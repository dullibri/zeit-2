HEADLINE: The Vanishing Economists

 BODY:
Re "A Doctorate Too Dry for Its Own Good" (Economic View, April 11), about students' declining interest in becoming Ph.D. economists:
One reason for the decline is a sharp drop in the value that many corporations attach to the degree. In the early 1980's, armed with a master's in economics, I entered a typical corporate economists' shop. Seeing my company's (and other companies') declining interest in economics as a profession and facing the need for a Ph.D. to further my economics career, I chose instead to take another opportunity in the company, in marketing. Since then, the five-person department in which I worked has been dissolved. 
 A combination of 60's-bred hubris about economists' abilities and an overemphasis on highly technical, impractical training has put the corporate economist to pasture in too many places. While I have been happy with my marketing path, I am saddened that a discipline with so much to offer is so poorly received in most boardrooms.

Investors Ask: Where to Go From Here?

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Markets around the world have been on pins and needles awaiting guidance from the United States. As overseas investors watched the week's divergent paths, they might have thought they had come upon a one-way sign with arrows pointing in opposite directions.
First, the Dow Jones industrial average crossed 11,000 on Monday, sending shares higher overseas. 
 Then, on Thursday, the Dow, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq fell on revived fears of tighter credit. Investors in the United States and in Europe and Asia reacted to a warning by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that inflationary pressures could re-emerge.
 A report on Friday that unemployment in the United States had edged higher assuaged those inflationary concerns for the moment, causing an uptick in American and European markets. This economy is still in the sweet spot, Robert Freedman, executive vice president for the John Hancock Funds in Boston, told The Associated Press on Friday.
 In the end, the Dow set a new record, closing up 2.2 percent for the week, at 11,031.59. The S.& P. rose frac-tionally, and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent, to 2,503.62. Stocks overseas were mixed. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: MONTENEGRO;
Air War Hurts Stability Of a Yugoslav Republic

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: CETINJE, Montenegro, May 7

 BODY:
It was a beguiling promise, "To Live Better," that helped Montenegro's governing coalition win power last year. But few people in this ancient city would say their lives are better now than before.
The sprawling OBOD electronics plant here, which employs 2,500 people, has been shut down completely since NATO's bombardment of Serbia cut off the market where 90 percent of the plant's air-conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators were sold. 
 The last time workers were paid was in February, and what they received then was December's salary. With no money circulating, small shopkeepers like Marko Stevov Kaludjerovic have had to extend credit to so many people that they too are in danger of going under. "Then they can count me as another casualty of the war," Mr. Kaludjerovic said.
The economy of Montenegro -- which is joined with Serbia in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- was already severely weakened before the bombardment began. And although Montenegro has never recognized Belgrade's declaration that a state of war now exists, it has suffered several NATO bombardments that have shocked and angered residents who thought they would be protected because of Montenegro's fledgling connections to the West.
Add to that volatile mix the economic disruptions and problems sure to be caused by the recently imposed embargo on oil for Serbia coming through Montenegro's Adriatic ports, and the stress fractures challenging the tiny republic's stability threaten to break wide open.
Government officials here acknowledge the danger. They believe civil authority is already being undermined by aggressive moves of the Yugoslav Army in Montenegro and the agitation of opposition forces loyal to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
While it struggles to check the army's moves, the Government of Montenegro's President, Milo Djukanovic, fears an economic collapse could undermine whatever support it retains. Unemployment has soared to as much as 50 percent, and more than 60 percent of all 635,000 residents of Montenegro may be eligible to receive some Government payment of social assistance -- if the Government has the money to pay.
Things will only get worse. The important tourism season has been wiped out with the NATO assaults, and the closing of the major Adriatic seaport of Bar by the Yugoslav Navy means shortages are likely.
The Government has appealed to the West for help. The United States provided $10 million in aid last month to help the Government meet some salary and pension obligations, and the European Union has promised $13.86 million to cover some of the cost of caring for the thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have sought refuge here.
But the Government fears the West does not understand the urgency of Montenegro's problems.
"Unless we have more help," Vojin Djukanovic, Minister of the Economy, said in an interview in the capital, Podgorica, "there will be a civil war here."
The minister, no relation to President Djukanovic, a former Deputy Prime Minister of the federal Government in Belgrade until he was dismissed by Mr. Milosevic last May, said that pro-Milosevic forces were using Montenegro's economic problems to foment dissent and lay the ground work for a coup. He estimates it would take $100 million in loans and credits to enable Montenegro to survive the current crisis without forfeiting the democratic advances it has made since President Djukanovic was elected in 1997, and his coalition won parliamentary elections last summer.
"The tragedy of our day is that the West has been opening the port of Bar, and now the Yugoslav Army is closing it," Vojin Djukanovic said, referring to Montenegro's main Adriatic port.
The Government's hope is that the people of Montenegro will be patient, and not catch war fever.
"People in Montenegro are not living better, that's quite correct," said Bozidar Jaredic, the Government's Minister of Information. "But the majority of people in Montenegro can understand the current circumstances and they can see the Government and Parliament are doing all they can."
While the people of Montenegro may not yet have reached their breaking point, they are showing strains. Radojica Radosevic, a jeweler in downtown Podgorica, said business has dropped by 70 percent since the NATO attacks began and the shop he has owned for 25 years is now empty most of the time.
"No one has been receiving their salaries on time so people just don't have enough money," Mr. Radosevic said as workmen installed a new folding metal security gate over the front window of his shop. He said it was a precautionary measure, against increasingly desperate times. "To be honest, I don't know much longer it can go on," he said.
Montenegrins joke that with the port blocked, the airports closed and border crossings often slammed shut, their country -- long known for the stunning beauty of its mountains and seaside -- has become "the world's most beautiful prison."
Few places though may be under as much pressure as Cetinje, where practically every family has suffered because of the closing of the giant OBOD factory.
"Since January, I've worked only 20 days," said Kice Pejovic, a mother of two sons who has been employed at the assembly plant for 12 years. She said the family survived on the food it grows in a small garden, and the milk it gets from a cow it keeps nearby. They cannot remember the last time any one of them bought clothes. "It's very hard, and every day it seems to get worse," she said.
No one is suggesting that the NATO assaults caused all of Montenegro's economic problems. The OBOD plant is 45 years old and has never been modernized. Productivity is still measured on Communist-era scales, and the product line has not been updated for years.
But Branislav Basovic, the general manager, said things would have been much better if the West had not failed to take full account of Montenegro's democratic opening.
For instance, he said, the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia earlier this decade dried up the small, but important, export market OBOD had developed with Western Europe and the United States. Now, he said, practically all exports -- which constitute 90 percent of the factory's output when it is operating -- go to Serbia.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Some Strategies That Help Poor Students Learn

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Low-income students are making significant academic gains in schools with educational strategies that include higher standards and more personal instruction, parent involvement and teacher accountability, according to reports made public this week.
Education Trust, a nonprofit organization in Washington that seeks to improve education for the poor, based its conclusions on a survey of 366 elementary and secondary schools, in 21 states, that had scored above average on standardized math and reading tests but had poverty levels of more than 50 percent -- that is, at least half of the students received free or reduced-price lunches. 
 After adopting new teaching approaches, Public School 72 in Buffalo displayed dramatic improvements in reading. Ninety-five percent scored at or above grade level in the 1996-1997 school year, compared with the New York State average of 86.1 percent. The previous school year, it had reported a score of 45 percent, against a state average of 83.1 percent.
In Gary, Ind., the Arthur Melton Elementary School stood out for its math and reading scores, with 78 percent of students reading at or above grade level, compared with the state average of 68 percent, and 91 percent in math, compared with 70 percent.
Shallow Water Elementary School in Shallow Water, Kan., saw its scores improve to 80 percent from 50 percent in math, compared with state averages of about 45 percent for 1996 and 1997.
The trust found that the schools that are doing well or have improved shared five characteristics: increased learning time for reading and math; money devoted to continuing education for teachers and staff members; systems to monitor student progress and provide extra help; efforts to involve parents in the day-to-day learning process, and state or district accountability requirements for teachers and the staff if students fail to show measurable improvement.
"Poor kids can achieve at high levels if we teach them at high levels," said Kati Haycock, the director of Education Trust. "What remains to be done is for more schools to do what these schools have proven can be done."
Another study, conducted by the Education Trust and the Kentucky Association of School Councils, found that several schools in Kentucky with a high level of poor students achieved the highest scores on the state's standardized tests in 1998. The study found that as a result of new teaching and administrative methods, 5 of the 20 elementary schools with the highest reading scores were low-income schools, as were 6 of the 20 with the highest math scores and 13 of the 20 with the highest writing scores.
"Every child can learn," said Bob Sexton, the director of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence in Lexington, Ky., an advocacy group seeking education improvements in Kentucky. "The socio-economic barrier can be overcome with the pursuit of high standards for every child. But we have a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Many States Slow to Use Children's Insurance Fund

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
States are using less than 20 percent of the Federal money that Congress made available, with much fanfare, for a big new program to subsidize health insurance for children in low-income families.
Some states say they cannot find enough eligible uninsured children to use all the money they are entitled to receive. Critics say many states have been slow to reach out to eligible children and sign them up. 
 The program's slow start and the accumulation of unspent money are tempting Republicans in Congress to take back some of the money and use it for other purposes -- an idea vehemently opposed by Democrats, by advocates for children and by governors of both parties.
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the West Virginia Democrat who helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, said, "The Appropriations Committee is looking at the unused money for other projects." He objects to such a shift.
Elaina J. Fox, a spokeswoman for West Virginia's new child health program, said, "A majority of states will probably not be able to utilize their full allotments" of Federal money.
Governors are enthusiastic about the program, and tens of thousands of children have clearly benefited. But Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, said some states, including her own, had "an abysmal record" of finding uninsured children and enrolling them in the new program.
Congress provided $39 billion for the program over 10 years, including $4.2 billion a year in 1998 and 1999. Federal officials said states had used $260 million through December 1998 and $115 million in the first three months of this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that states will use a total of $800 million this year.
States say they have enrolled one million youngsters in the new program. But Federal officials and health policy experts say the numbers are somewhat misleading.
Nearly 30 percent of the million children are in New York State, and 176,000 of the New York children were already in a state-financed program, Child Health Plus, often described by Federal officials as a model for the nation.
Moreover, Frank C. Ullman, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute here, said, "The decrease in Medicaid enrollment in many states is greater than the increase in coverage through the new Children's Health Insurance Program." So it is unclear, he added, whether there has been a net reduction in the number of uninsured children -- one of the main goals for President Clinton and Congress.
The number of children without health insurance has been creeping up in recent years and is now at least 10.7 million, the Census Bureau says.
Under Federal law, children eligible for Medicaid may not be enrolled in the new Children's Health Insurance Program. Medicaid is intended for families with somewhat lower incomes. States are supposed to screen children and enroll them in Medicaid if they qualify for it.
But states have a strong financial incentive to put children into the new program, rather than in Medicaid, because the Federal Government pays a larger share of the costs -- 65 percent, rather than 50 percent, in high-income states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
The children's health plan was forged in a bipartisan agreement between the President and Congress. When he signed the legislation in August 1997, Mr. Clinton said it would extend insurance coverage "to up to five million children." He called it "the largest expansion in health care for children" in three decades.
Bruce D. Lesley, director of Congressional relations at the National Association of Children's Hospitals, said: "The results to date have been mixed. Some states like South Carolina have done an unbelievably good job of enrolling children in the new health insurance program. Other states like Virginia are not doing so well. In these states, parents who need to know about the new program have no idea that it exists."
South Carolina simplified its enrollment process, disseminated applications at drug stores, day care centers, schools, churches and Indian reservations and signed up 40,400 children for the new program. By reaching out to low-income families, the state also found 46,000 other children who were eligible for its pre-existing Medicaid program.
By contrast, Amy M. Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services, said her state had enrolled 8,599 children in the new insurance program, including only 71 in Richmond, through May 3.
Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, said, "My state has not been as quick off the mark as others have."
Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, said the state had enrolled 30,232 children in its new health program, known as Kid Care, and expected to spend $19 million of its $88 million Federal allotment this year.
Connecticut has enrolled 8,000 children and expects to spend $5.4 million of its $35 million Federal allotment this year, said David Dearborn, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Social Services. As a side benefit, he said, in reaching out to low-income families, the state has found several thousand children eligible for its Medicaid program.
Auditors in some states said some children enrolled in the new program were probably ineligible and should have been enrolled instead in the regular Medicaid program.
In welfare, a separate program, states have also allowed substantial amounts of Federal money to go unspent. They say they are keeping it for a rainy day, in case the economy sputters.
But that concern does not explain delays in spending money on health insurance for children. Officials in many states said they had only recently begun to enroll children because they first had to design new health programs, get Federal approval, prepare application forms, set up toll-free telephone lines, print posters and run advertising to publicize the availability of the new benefits.
Judith A. Arnold, deputy commissioner of the New York Health Department, said, "Congress should be patient with states that seem to be moving slowly."
The Federal Government has approved children's health plans for every state except Tennessee, Washington and Wyoming.
State officials told Congress in 1997 that they needed the maximum latitude to design their own programs because they knew best how to meet the health needs of uninsured children.
But in a curious way, the law penalized states that had already expanded Medicaid eligibility by increasing the permissible income for families seeking coverage. Such states included Minnesota, Vermont and Washington.
In Washington State, for example, Medicaid covers children whose family incomes are up to twice the official poverty level (up to $27,760 a year for a family of three). Since those children are eligible for Medicaid, they may not enroll in the new Children's Health Insurance Program.
Under Federal law, Washington may use its share of the new Federal money -- $46 million a year -- for children of families with incomes up to 2.5 times the poverty level.
But Thomas W. Bedell, acting director of the Medicaid program in Washington State, said: "We won't be able to spend our full allotment of Federal money. We have only 10,000 uninsured children with family incomes from 200 to 250 percent of the poverty level. We estimate that we can spend only $7.5 million of our Federal money in the next year and a half."
Likewise, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said the law penalized "states like Vermont that have served as national leaders in expanding health care coverage."
Mr. Ullman of the Urban Institute said: "In theory, there's enough money to cover five million children a year in the initial years of the new Children's Health Insurance Program. But only 3.2 million uninsured children live in families with the proper income to qualify."
Other children might benefit, because they lack health insurance, but their family incomes are too low or too high to qualify for coverage under the new program, Mr. Ullman said.
Money earmarked for a particular year remains available in the two subsequent years. But Federal officials said some states were building up huge reserves because they would not come close to spending their allotments of Federal money in the early years of the program.

HEADLINE: City Seeks Private Development for Randalls Island

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
New York City is asking private companies to suggest commercial development proposals for Randalls Island to help pay for a $200 million renovation of the park there.
"We want to see who's out there to invest," Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine said. 
 The city's goal, according to a public notice to be published today, is the "creation of a dynamic urban park" on land that has been a scruffy, rather forgotten piece of the city -- despite its central location in the East River between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx.
Mr. Levine said the idea was to work from a master plan developed over the last two years by the Randalls Island Sports Foundation, a seven-year-old private support group, modeled after the Central Park Conservancy, that has raised more than $2 million for the park.
Most of the group's focus has been on recreation and creating new ball fields in the 480-acre park. It hopes to get private developers to pay for building and operating costs in the same manner that Chelsea Piers contributes to the new Hudson River Park in Manhattan.
In essence, the city is trying to fulfill the dreams of Robert Moses, who, as City Parks Commissioner, filled in the gap between Randalls and Wards Islands and prepared a comprehensive development plan in the mid-1930's. Despite Mr. Moses' construction of Downing Stadium -- where Jesse Owens qualified for the 1936 Olympics, Pele played his first American soccer game and Jimi Hendrix and Pearl Jam have performed -- the area never achieved its potential. There was no way to water the 27 baseball fields, for example.
But under Mr. Moses the park did emerge from its role as the site of the city's cemetery for the indigent and an asylum for the poor and troubled.
Today, youth and adult softball and soccer leagues throng to the island, and a golf driving range and miniature golf course have been added in recent years. On a nice summer day, 50,000 people visit.
Many of the visitors come to picnic beneath a spectacular view of the Manhattan skyline, or walk on nature trails where they sometimes spot pheasants. Events held on the island range from the Lollapalooza music festival to the Black Rodeo.
The project envisioned in the master plan carries an estimated price of $200 million, but the foundation's chairman, Richard J. Davis, said the project would likely proceed in segments. Ideally, he said, the initial segment would cost about $70 million and include the big indoor athletic buildings envisioned. But he said entrepreneurs' specific ideas will determine priorities and timing.
Among other things, the foundation's plan calls for replacing Downing Stadium with an amphitheater and festival grounds; building or upgrading 32 softball fields and 23 soccer fields, and building a field house for indoor athletic events and a 400-meter outdoor track.
Also in the plan are a tennis and skating center, a water park and an area for such alternative sports as in-line skating and kayaking. Wetlands and other natural areas would be enhanced and protected; trails for walking, horse-back riding and bicycling would be laid, and new marinas, ferry terminals and restaurants would be built.
Mr. Levine said the specific ideas provided by entrepreneurs could re-shape the plan. "Instead of doing it piecemeal, we would like to come up with a comprehensive plan," he said. "This is an opportunity to put flesh on the bone."
The process is the same as the city is using for Governors Island, though Mr. Levine says the city has more control over Randalls Island because it owns it. President Clinton has agreed to give Governors Island to the city only if it can come up with an acceptable plan to use it.
Giuliani administration officials say that interest in Governors Island has come from universities, museums, hotel developers and amusement park operators, including Tivoli Gardens of Denmark (whose representatives have also visited Randalls Island). Gambling, once the favored option for Governors Island, has been ruled out, they said.
Park advocates say they support bringing private developers into the Randalls Island park in a way that would be unacceptable in a historical treasure such as Central Park. They also point out that almost everything in the remodeled park would remain free to all.
"They're not turning the park over to anybody," said Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council, a research and advocacy group. "They are very clear they want it to be open to everybody."
The request for ideas is being handled by the city's Economic Development Corporation. The corporation can legally negotiate deals directly with companies, rather than going through the longer and more formal request for proposals required of other city agencies, Mr. Davis said.
Mr. Davis said one of the park's biggest problems, inadequate bus service, may be solved as the grounds are spiffed up. He predicted that more buses would be assigned, just as they were to Riverbank State Park in Harlem.
"Randalls Island will become a destination," he said.

Beware the Scarf in Parliament

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

 BODY:
At its first meeting, Turkey's newly elected Parliament turned not to pressing problems like inflation, human rights or educational reform, but to the question of the Muslim head scarf. The chamber erupted in pandemonium as Merve Kavakci, an American-educated deputy from Istanbul, sought unsuccessfully to take her oath of office while wearing a scarf.
She was harshly denounced by the President, the Prime Minister and many others, and the press began a campaign portraying her as a militant fundamentalist bent on subverting the secular Republic. 
 The debate reflected conflict between Turkey's desire for fuller democracy and its fear of religious influence in politics.

European Insurers Agree To Settle Holocaust Claims

 BODY:
More than a half-century after the Holocaust, a group of European insurance companies has reached an agreement to pay claims on prewar policies under a formula that reflects present-day values.
The agreement was reached after two days of negotiations in London and its terms were not released. But the broad outlines were made public by the World Jewish Congress, which took part in the talks, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the former American Secretary of State, who led a committee conducting the negotiations. 
 The agreement is the latest in a series of efforts to secure compensation from Swiss banks, multinational corporations and other institutions that advocates for Holocaust victims say were unjustly enriched during Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.
In this case, the agreement is different because it takes into account a half-century of interest, inflation and currency devaluations, and thus could lead to payments totaling billions of dollars.

HEADLINE: At Fort Dix, a New Ellis Island Embraces Kosovo's Refugees

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: FORT DIX, N.J., May 8

 BODY:
Selim Berisha sat in a barracks carefully made safe for old people and children, with pictures of murder running through his head.
On March 28, a holy day for Muslims, he recalled, the Serb police and paramilitaries spilled into his neighborhood in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. They beat Albanians in the streets and fired in the air and at houses. As the bullets shattered his windows, Mr. Berisha, a 63-year-old taxi driver, hid in his cellar with his family and neighbors -- 50 people in all. 
 In the morning, they found a neighbor who had not made it to shelter. He lay dead in his yard, his remains set upon by dogs. "We buried him, and we escaped into the woods," Mr. Berisha said.
Mr. Berisha was among the first Albanians from Kosovo who came to Fort Dix to begin new lives, separated by thousands of miles, but little time, from the loss of their homes and their worlds.
In less than a week, Fort Dix has been transformed from an Army base into a kind of sprawling Ellis Island, gearing up to be the gateway to America for almost 20,000 Albanian refugees.
The military has named the relief operation Open Arms, and Government agencies have tailored it with a certain sensitivity to both the refugees and to public relations.
Almost overnight, swing sets and play houses sprouted on the base, and by Friday morning, the smiles of toddlers blossomed like so many daisies at the play-house windows. Signs in English and Albanian lined the walls, one bare room had been turned into a chapel, and officials made a point of not serving pork to the Albanians, most of whom are Muslim.
Soldiers speaking to reporters were ordered to say "dining facility" instead of "mess hall," and to call the place where the Immigration and Naturalization Service fingerprints and photographs refugees upon their arrival a "welcome center." Terry Wade, a staff sergeant from Fort Bragg, N.C., who helped prepare the base, observed: "We're kind of running this like a hotel system. Welcome to the HoJo."
But four-foot-tall wooden fences have also gone up over the last week at Fort Dix, for the heart of Ellis Island was always immigration screening. The fences are guarded by military police, and the final authority over the refugees lies with the immigration service.
While the children play gleefully, as if Fort Dix were a miniature Disneyland, their parents and older siblings remain shaken by all they have seen and lost.
Ilir Hoxha, a 45-year-old music producer, said he missed the home he built for his family, a four-room house with two bathrooms in Pristina.
A few weeks ago, he was standing by the open door of that house with his son, Arben, 20, when the Serbian police approached. They forced Mr. Hoxha's wife and teen-age daughters outside and put a gun to his throat, demanding German marks. Mr. Hoxha said he had none; indeed, he had been out of work for 10 years, since Serbs began choking the Albanian economy and culture.
The Serbian police gave his family "half a minute to get out," he said. Armed police officers stood on both sides of the road. The family marched 40 minutes to the train station, staring straight ahead. At the station, they met up with 7,000 other ethnic Albanians and waited five days for a train to take them to the border with Macedonia, where they were stripped of their documents and told never to come home. Asked what might have happened had she looked at the police as she was climbing onto the train, Mr. Hoxha's 17-year-old daughter, Arbreshe, said only, "If . . .," and burst into tears.
The family sat at a picnic table in Doughboy Field at Fort Dix, historically a place of transformation, where generations of boys were turned into soldiers. As Mr. Hoxha told the family's tale, his children and his wife, Hysnije, stared at the grass, as if transfixed. Mr. Hoxha worried about a sister who remained behind. "The situation there is very dangerous," he said. "They don't have anything to eat or drink."
Mr. Hoxha has no relatives in the United States, and said his family had no preference for living in one part of the country over another. "New York," Arbreshe whispered, and smiled. Her father said he wanted most to return home, if he could only raise his family in peace.
The soldiers here appeared genuinely touched by the refugees, charmed by the children and moved by the adults. Early Thursday morning, some 12 hours after they had completed their 13-hour journey from Skopje, Macedonia, the refugees were finally getting to bed after an initial screening by the immigration service and a greeting from Hillary Rodham Clinton.
A mother approached Specialist Kenneth Sollano, 22, of Opp, Ala. She laid her head on folded hands and tried to explain that her little daughter could not sleep. The soldier handed her a doll, which the toddler hugged as she finally dozed off.
Despite the uniforms and the lack of freedom to move, the compound at Fort Dix is far different from the overcrowded tent camps of Macedonia, where the threat of disease looms and resources are stretched. Perhaps afraid the scarcity might return, children at the base cafeteria on Friday afternoon piled trays tall with soup, heaps of spaghetti and meat, and many slices of bread.
Sergeant Wade said that some of the refugees did not know how to say "thank you" in English but expressed their gratitude in other ways. "I gave a little 2-year-old a stuffed toy, and he looked at me and put his hand over his heart," the sergeant said. Adults, eager to help, tried to pick up brooms and sweep.
"It put chills on me," Sergeant Wade said, "that I could do some good for these people."
Mehde Shehu, 39, an Albanian who came here from the Albanian Assistance Center in the Bronx, said the refugees, many of whom were farmers, valued self-reliance. He said immigration officials should allow them to work in the fields at Fort Dix. "They would make them beautiful," he said.
Mr. Shehu had come to Fort Dix to see if he could talk to the refugees, but was being kept at arm's length by officials after he tried to pass a newspaper to a refugee on Thursday.
Though the plight of the Kosovar Albanians has touched a chord in many people, so much that a phone line set up in New Jersey to channel offers of help jammed with calls on Thursday night, immigration officials are controlling access to the refugees.
On Thursday, a day after the first refugees arrived, a 14-year-old, Hassan Maliqi, ventured to the gate to greet reporters and photographers. But almost immediately, he was shooed back and surrounded by 13 soldiers in uniform, for although the compound is being called a "village," it is really a "containment area," one reserve officer blurted out.
The Mayor of nearby Wrightstown, Jozsef Farago, a refugee from the Soviet crackdown in Hungary in 1956, wanted to invite the refugees to a picnic on May 15 to celebrate the centennial of the Wrightstown Fire Department. He also encouraged residents to help the refugees however they could, perhaps just by inviting a family over for an afternoon barbecue to show they cared. But the refugees are not being allowed to leave Fort Dix, and for the moment, Mayor Farago said, he has been told not to be so helpful.
The refugees are being screened for medical problems, while the immigration service tries to do background and criminal records checks. For the refugees to be granted asylum, immigration officials must ascertain that they would face danger if they returned to their home country. In this instance, noted Carl Rusnok, an immigration service spokesman from the Philadelphia office, there is little doubt they will qualify.
Last night, another 102 refugees arrived at Kennedy International Airport, and they are to stay with relatives. Two flights scheduled for next week are to bring more refugees to Fort Dix, where they will join the 860 there now.
Officials said the refugees were expected to stay at Fort Dix for about two weeks, until resettlement agencies find apartments for them. The agencies are also to help them assimilate to the United States, enrolling the children in schools and helping the parents find work.

HEADLINE: Pay Raise for American Soldiers Is Long Overdue

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Doubts Surface Over Raise Being Planned for Military" (news article, May 6): I write as a former naval officer who recently left active duty. As you note, the 1986 pension cut to 40 percent from 50 percent of base pay was intended not only as a money-saving device but also to increase retention among officers between the 20-year point and the 30-year point in their careers. Yet it had the effect of increasing the exodus of officers from the 8- to 12-year point. The new legislation is an attempt to redress this. It should be noted that base pay is only a portion of a military salary; in my case it was 50 percent to 60 percent. This is not an excessively generous pension. 
 Increasing pay and benefits will allow military personnel and their families to participate in the economic boom that the rest of society is experiencing. Thousands of servicemembers are eligible for food stamps. That those who defend us are unable to support their families on military pay should offend us all.

Property and Freedom
 By Richard Pipes.
 328 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $30. 
 Richard Pipes, a longtime professor of Russian history at Harvard, has had the satisfaction, rare among academics, of seeing his once unpopular views adopted as American policy. During the early days of Soviet-American arms limitation talks, Pipes was one of a handful of academics who continued to insist on the criminal nature of the Soviet regime. His 1977 Commentary magazine article, "Why the Soviet Union Thinks It Can Fight and Win a Nuclear War," was one of the half-dozen or so most influential articles in the entire period of the cold war, and his many books on Soviet and Russian history are standards in the field.
Pipes is now retired from Harvard, and his latest book is his first not specifically in his discipline. "Property and Freedom" is a meditation on the close connection between property rights and the development of law and individual liberty throughout the history of civilization. Pipes is massively erudite -- his source notes contain references in at least six languages -- and he has assembled a vast amount of material. But aside from a fascinating chapter on the sources of the perverse attitudes toward property and liberty in modern Russia, the book is a considerable disappointment, especially the querulous broadside against the modern welfare state with which it concludes.
In Pipes's view, despite the vanquishing of Communism, "liberty's future . . . is still at peril, although from a different and novel source. The main threat to freedom today comes not from tyranny but from equality."
Pipes links the "modern habit of thinking in terms of group rights rather than individual rights" with "Stalin's program of 'liquidating,' i.e., murdering 'kulaks,' for example, and Hitler's genocide of Jews and gypsies," both of which "were justified by the notion that people are to be judged and treated on the basis not of their personal behavior but of their membership in a designated group." Affirmative action, it seems, is but a step toward the gulag. The modern threat to liberty, Pipes goes on, comes "from below, from one's fellow citizens who . . . care more about their personal security than about general freedom."
Does Pipes read newspapers? Raising a clamor that the Morlocks are taking over, in a country that has just severely limited public assistance and one in which economic inequality is increasing rapidly, seems like piling on, if not actually paranoid. The book's characteristic rhetorical device is to make an extreme statement, then immediately back off it, as if Pipes were afraid to stand up for how he really feels. So, "abolishing welfare with its sundry 'entitlements' and spurious 'rights' . . . would go a long way" toward resolving the social predicament, is immediately qualified by "but such a solution is not feasible."
More seriously, there are real holes in Pipes's argument. The proposition that property rights usually reinforce the development of a rule of law is so unexceptionable as to be platitudinous. But Pipes seems to be making a stronger argument, that absolute respect for property rights is a precondition for maintenance of liberty. He admits a number of exceptions to that rule, but does so grudgingly, as he must, for they add up to a rather different argument from the one he would like to make.
The Slavic rulers of medieval Russia, most notably Ivan the Terrible, held their positions by grace of their Mongol conquerors, but only so long as they ruthlessly collected huge amounts of tribute. Over three centuries, the institutionalization of the czar's role as surrogate Robber in Chief fatally retarded the development of a nobility as a countervailing economic interest group. Russia never had a class of powerful barons like the ones who wrung Magna Carta out of King John in 1215. The consequence was the Russian "patrimonial" state, in which the czar could, and actually did, dispose of anyone's property virtually at whim.
Catherine the Great finally granted her nobles legal rights in their property by a 1785 charter that Pipes extols as "a revolutionary measure in the fullest and most constructive sense of the word." Although Catherine's reforms benefited only a tiny minority of the population, Pipes says that minority privileges are "the most reliable way of implanting freedom and rights, because it gives rise to social groups interested in protecting their advantages."
In the Russian case, however, there was a catch. The "introduction of landed property," Pipes concedes, "was a mixed blessing" because it enslaved privately held serfs, or about one-third of the population. Before Catherine's reform, the serfs had accumulated real, if limited, traditional privileges, which were summarily swept away when they were made the personal property of their landlords. That seems a rather large qualification to Pipes's argument. Limited freedom for serfs was restored in the next century by reforming czars, but only by trampling on the property rights of the gentry.
Pipes also conveniently ignores the case of modern Western slavery. Dred Scott surely didn't feel liberated by the Supreme Court decision that upheld his master's property rights. Nor does Pipes make any mention of the latifundista tradition in Spanish America that kept the great mass of peasantry in a state of virtual serfdom, or the destruction of Ireland in the service of the property rights of absentee British landlords.
At the conclusion of an extended chapter on the development of property and freedom in England, Pipes speculates on why similar traditions did not arise throughout Europe, even though formal legal protections were roughly similar. Dutch burghers and Polish nobles, for example, enjoyed almost identical protections for property, but the Netherlands became a thriving middle-class republic, while Poland stayed sunk in the Dark Ages.
Pipes never entertains the possibility that the distribution of property may be a far more important condition of freedom than the protection of property per se. Absolute deference to the property rights of the few can create private despotisms as surely as attempts to enforce absolute equality from the top can create despotisms of the state. The challenge is to tease out the balance between insuring a broad distribution of economic stakes and limiting intrusive state power. "Property and Freedom," however, is an exercise in dyspepsia that is not interested in such difficult questions.

HEADLINE: Beyond Blond and Gorgeous: L.A.'s TV Image Is Changing;
New Approaches Try to Capture the City's Complexities

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, May 9

 BODY:
Everyone in Los Angeles is blond, beautiful and, duh, has an I.Q. capable of absorbing only one Leonardo. DiCaprio, not da Vinci. The town stops dead in its tracks every week for a late afternoon freeway chase that is more entertaining than anything else on television. Everyone over 30 gets facial surgery, and that includes the women. And you can't find a good bagel either.
This small-screen perspective on Los Angeles, focusing on the banal, the superficial and the glitzy, has been beamed out in dozens of television shows over the decades, reflecting an image of Los Angeles that has acquired the undeniable patina of truth for many viewers. But the city's image, like television, is changing. Its odd trajectory can be traced in the departure of that archetypal L.A. show, "Melrose Place," on May 24 after seven years and 226 episodes on Fox, and the critical success of the new ABC comedy "It's Like, You Know . . . ," which makes fun of the kind of gorgeous, self-absorbed airheads who populate "Melrose Place." 
 "There's often been a kind of shallow view of L.A.," said Peter Mehlman, a former co-executive producer of "Seinfeld" who created "It's Like, You Know . . . ." The new show is about a group of wacky underachievers in a Los Angeles apartment house who do things like spend an entire episode watching a high-speed car chase.
"The perception of L.A. has always been that of surface glamour, and there's never been much of an attempt to get beneath the veneer," he said. "Actually, it's one of the saddest cities on earth because so many people come out here struggling for some kind of dream, and so few get there. And it's hard to see because it's so physically pretty."
In contrast to New York, which appeals to television executives precisely for its grittiness (though even shows like "N.Y.P.D. Blue" have their moments of unreality, too), Los Angeles is often presented as a sun-drenched pastel city with barely a trace of economic or social diversity. Even "Dragnet," which made its debut in 1952 and became one of the most successful police dramas ever by drawing on actual cases from the files of the Los Angeles Police Department, rarely focused on the violence, poverty and racial and immigration problems that were roiling the city in the postwar era.
Several new Los Angeles-based dramatic series (including one by the filmmaker David Lynch) that promise to deal with the complexities of life in the city may turn up on home screens in the fall. This more complex vision of Los Angeles is probably the next wave in television. (While movie studios have churned out film noir set in Los Angeles since the 1930's, television has shied away from these bleak mysteries in favor of the city's sun and light.)
Los Angeles's complexity goes only so far on television. Even David E. Kelley, the highly skilled and innovative creator of shows like "Ally McBeal," "The Practice" and "Picket Fences," has a new show, "Snoops," that by all accounts depicts the more glamorous side of the detective business. The show, tentatively set for ABC, features handsome private eyes who use high-tech means to catch the bad guys. One network executive described it as " 'Miami Vice' in L.A."
And some television shows perpetuate the banality of life in Los Angeles. Look at "Baywatch," with its cast of hunk lifeguards with perfectly chiseled features. Or the USA Network's successful "Pacific Blue," about seven young male and female police officers in tight clothes riding on motorbikes in Santa Monica. "It's cops on bikes," said Joan Swift, the publicity chief at the network. "They're in great shape."
In contrast, some of the successful shows involving New York, like "Seinfeld," "Mad About You," "Law and Order" and "N.Y.P.D. Blue," have been viewed by critics as more realistic and hard-edged. (The hit show "Friends," also set in New York, is another matter.)
Paradoxically, with the exception of "Law and Order," most of these New York-based series are actually shot in studios in Los Angeles. And it shows. Even on a series like "N.Y.P.D. Blue" there is a notable absence of people seen -- and accents heard -- on the streets of New York now: Koreans, Indians, Pakistanis, Africans, Latinos, Russians, Israelis and others.
And except for a handful of shows like "Cosby," with its star, Bill Cosby, who is black, the New York region is often represented in shows like "The King of Queens" and "Everyone Loves Raymond" as a place populated by Italian, Irish and Jewish types -- and stereotypes -- where everyone speaks with an extreme Noo Yawk accent like that of Fran Drescher in "The Nanny."
By contrast, the shows set in Los Angeles often depict the outlandish wealth of areas like Beverly Hills and Bel Air. This goes back to "fish out of water" comedies like the corny 1960's "Beverly Hillbillies," about a backwoods clan that strikes oil and moves to Beverly Hills. More recently, there was the somewhat more realistic "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," about a black rapper from a tough Philadelphia neighborhood (Will Smith) who moves in with wealthy Bel Air relatives.
Yet blondes at the beach still seem to predominate.
Aaron Spelling, whose company, Spelling Television, produced "Melrose Place," and whose Los Angeles-themed shows over the years like "Mod Squad," "Charlie's Angels," "Hart to Hart" and "Beverly Hills 90210" have, in some ways, shaped the kind of glitzy version of Los Angeles, said, essentially, that fantasy sells, not only around the nation but, more importantly, abroad.
"We do some of our L.A. shows for two crazy reasons," Mr. Spelling said. "When it's snowing in the East and Midwest, when it's freezing outside, people love to see the beaches and the sunshine. And in foreign countries they love L.A. Sunset Strip. Malibu. Rodeo Drive. The homes. It's the glamour. They love it."
Heather Locklear, who played the malevolent Amanda Woodward on "Melrose Place," said that the highly successful series, about a group of young people who live in a garden-apartment complex, initially floundered when it was tamely patterned as a sober "twentysomething" version of the hit show "Thirtysomething." Then the creators added some spice.
"It was a fantasy," she said. "The women became a little stronger than the men. It was sexy girls wearing tight clothes and no bras."
Ms. Locklear said with a laugh that she hoped she would now get more varied parts. "I'm a little typecast," she said. "People think of me as a nasty-type person who always wore short skirts. Hopefully, I'll be able to break that."
 
The City Becomes A Major Character
As a reaction to the fantasy version of Los Angeles, "It's Like, You Know . . ." is really the first show to take on the city with a vengeance. Ted Harbert, an executive producer of the show and former chairman of ABC Entertainment, said he could not recall a series that had turned a city like Los Angeles into a dominant character.
"Like Kramer in 'Seinfeld,' or Ted Baxter in 'Mary Tyler Moore,' and Norm and Cliff in 'Cheers,' L.A. is one of our crazy and loopy characters," said Mr. Harbert, who grew up in Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Stamford, Conn. "L.A. is a confusing place because it lures you with wonderful weather and great opportunity and then often frustrates with its inability to deal with complex emotions. It celebrates superficiality in many ways."
(ABC executives remain uneasy that the show, which has performed moderately well, may be too much of an inside joke for most of the country.)
The idea -- or at least the title -- for the show came when Mr. Mehlman, a onetime sportswriter for The Washington Post, visited Fred Segal, a trendy clothing store. "The woman who worked there used the term 'it's like, you know,' about five times in one minute, and I thought that was a great idea for a title. And if I was going to use that title it would have to be set in L.A."
The cast includes Chris Eigeman as a New York journalist visiting Los Angeles to write a book, "Living in Los Angeles: How Can You Stomach It?" Actually, Mr. Eigeman's personal view of Los Angeles is quite similar to the character he plays. "I do think L.A. is a little moral petri dish of degradation," said Mr. Eigeman, who lives in Brooklyn when he is not making the show in Los Angeles.
But the star is the actress Jennifer Grey ("Dirty Dancing"), who plays Jennifer Grey. Reality blurs. In the show, the self-deprecating Ms. Grey talks about some real-life boyfriends and her facial surgery.
"I'm not actually playing myself," Ms. Grey said. "I'm playing a character loosely based on certain facts of my life. It's also based on what the public might think I'm like, based on movies or rumors or tabloids."
Ms. Grey lived in Los Angeles for eight years, before moving back to New York two years ago.
 
The Illusion And the Reality
"The show is about the most demented city in the country, and how it dements the people who live here," Ms. Grey said of Los Angeles, admitting nonetheless that the yoga, the Pilates exercise, the weather and the health food were better there than in New York.
"Nothing's real in L.A.; it's all about illusion," Ms. Grey said. "It's about illusion of power, illusion of youth, illusion of wealth. Nothing is what it seems."
But this kind of L.A. bashing is anathema to other actors as well as filmmakers, who said it was too easy dismiss the city as superficial when it is, in fact, extraordinarily complex.
Mr. Lynch, whose films include "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway," as well as the cult serial drama "Twin Peaks," has just completed an ABC pilot for a dramatic series set in Los Angeles called "Mulholland Drive." He said he hoped to deal with numerous levels of life in the city.
"At first glance there's a big sprawling sameness to L.A.," Mr. Lynch said. "But every little section has its own mood. And I love the different moods in L.A. The Valley is so different from Santa Monica, which is so different from Pomona or Riverside. It sort of excites me to deal with the specific moods here."
And Mark Johnson, producer of the CBS drama "L.A. Doctors," said he and the show's creator, John Lee Hancock, were seeking to present a series as much about Los Angeles as it was about doctors.
"The reason we did this was that, like it or not, L.A. was at the cutting edge of what's going on in the country," Mr. Johnson said. "It's easy to make fun of superficiality and shallowness. But there are conflicts and temptations and dynamics that abound in L.A. that are much more harsh and extreme than anywhere else in the country. And that, we hope, makes good television."

HEADLINE: Disputes and Unknowns of Electronic Rights Roil the Book Industry

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
When Peter Mayer felt the slim weight of an electronic book in the palm of his hand, he suffered instant pangs of dread.
There was no reassuring crackle of paper or the faint scent of ink that had been a constant in his career in publishing, for two decades as chief executive of Viking Penguin and now his own independent company, Overlook Press. 
 "I respect it," Mr. Mayer said of the electronic book that could change the dynamics of his business, "but I have an emotional and professional investment in what I know. And when I was young, I knew that I could conquer any change, and now I don't know what's ahead."
Such wariness is prompting Mr. Mayer, and some authors and agents, to shy away from books made of bytes until a clear view develops of the rapidly emerging market for electronic readers. The culture of technology has collided with the slower-moving book industry, which is engaged in a tense, early clash over how to divide up the spoils of an infant business that is still difficult to picture in scope and potential.
"This is a scramble over who controls what," said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chief executive of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time Warner unit that includes Warner Books and Little Brown & Company. He noted that "we're not being motivated by what's to come, but a fear of being left out as the train is pulling away from the station, with some exotic station in mind."
For the first time in five years, the New York-based Authors Guild mailed out contract warnings last month to some 7,500 members. The letter criticized current E-book contracts as bad deals. The guild said it considered distribution fees for electronic-book manufacturers a payment scheme that would deny publishers and authors the rewards of the information age.
Some prominent literary agencies are also advising authors to refuse electronic-book agreements unless the contracts promise to revise the deals if electronic editions rapidly gain popularity. But in turn, some publishers are refusing to make that concession, which means that many popular books are staying firmly on the bookshelves instead of a digital page.
In the last three years, start-up technology companies have pushed forward with plans to make electronic books as ubiquitous as mass-market paperbacks. This month, Nuvomedia will expand its sales of $500 versions to stores, while Librius is preparing to begin selling its slender 12-ounce pocketbook-sized model for $200 in July. Softbook Press has been lining up deals with corporations and school districts that are eager to eliminate lockers and reduce backpack strain on students laden with textbooks. Softbook's version, with note-taking and scribble functions, sells for $299.
The first E-books became available late last fall. Barnesandnoble.com, for example, has about 500 titles available for sale and downloading and has sold about 15,000 copies in this format. In general, the privately held manufacturers will not say how many of the electronic readers have been sold, but a Barnesandnoble.com spokesman, Ben Boyd, said the company had been "pleasantly surprised with the pace that customers have purchased these devices and titles."
The numbers may seem small now, says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent with Darhansoff & Verrill, but "the issues are profound in their long-term impact."
"And we want to see the market grow, but we want to make sure the terms are fair," he said. The agency's authors, including Arthur S. Golden and E. Annie Proulx, are avoiding the electronic format until they get better deals with publishers.
The devices that are inspiring all this anxiety weigh from 12 ounces to more than two pounds and carry brand names like Rocket eBook, Millennium E-Reader and the Softbook. They seem rather expensive now for leisure reading, but eventually the manufacturers expect the cost to fall below $100 or plunge to nothing as E-readers are given away like cellular phones to entice customers to buy and download books, newspapers and magazines.
With almost missionary zeal, the entrepreneurs developing the E-books from the West Coast, and a culture of technology, are talking of sweeping changes in a publishing industry centered in New York and steeped in tradition.
"I think they're going to be everywhere," said Devin P. McKinney, director of content services for Softbook Press. "I think that 50 percent of the books are going to be published in electronic form and not in paper."
Publishers say they do not feel threatened by the development of the electronic book because they do not think the form will replace conventional books for adult readers who will always want to savor the familiar touch of paper.
But a new generation of young readers may have different notions about what constitutes a good book. Some school districts are already negotiating to buy the Softbook for students to essentially create "textbook-free" schools where students can download books and packets of course information over phone lines.
For instance, the Davis Joint Unified School District in Davis, Calif., is expecting to learn this month whether it has received a $6 million Federal grant to subsidize the purchase of some 3,000 electronic books that will be shared among 7,700 students.
But if educators see immediate benefits, publishers are showing more caution as the first deals are struck for electronic rights that could set a pattern to last the life of a copyright. When authors try to make the case that paperless books will result in cost savings, Random House, the top-ranking publisher, expresses private misgivings.
In an internal memo, the company said that "a generally held misconception is that publishers will make greater profits on E-books since the costs of paper, printing, warehousing and delivery are saved."
"This ignores the different kinds of costs that are incurred in handling E-books," the memo said. It then listed the added expenses of formatting manuscripts for electronic books, protecting digital material from piracy and granting higher discounts to E-book distributors.
But the Authors Guild does indeed expect savings from lowered paper and printing costs and so, as the guild's director, Paul Aiken, put it, "the result seems clear: authors should receive a significantly higher royalty for E-books than they do for physical books."
The Authors Guild says that now, a writer might get a share as great as 15 percent of the list price of a book as a royalty. The structure for an electronic book is about the same, but can run as low as 4 percent. In a conventional contract for a hard-cover book, the publisher gets about 35 percent of the list price while the distributor gets 15 percent and the bookseller keeps 35 percent. With the new electronic rights agreements that E-book manufacturers are getting from publishers, this structure shifts, with publishers getting 25 to 40 percent, booksellers 35 to 40 percent and distributors 20 percent.
In particular, the guild has criticized the new cut for Nuvomedia, which it describes as a combined "whopping 60 percent distribution fee" to Nuvomedia and Barnesandnoble.com, which sells the electronic titles.
Not surprisingly, such sentiments anger E-book manufacturers like Martin F. Eberhard, the chief executive of Nuvomedia, based in Mountain View, Calif., even though the parent company of Random House, Bertelsmann A.G., has invested in his company and in Barnes & Noble.
At the annual Book Expo America in Los Angeles, which draws thousands of booksellers and publishers, Mr. Eberhard sat in his exhibit booth, fuming about Random House's arguments and the Authors Guild letter, which also contended that "profit margins for publishers and royalty rates for authors should soar with these sales."
"If the publishing industry doesn't let up on these squabbles, it will hurt them," he said, adding that the combined 60 percent share for the distributor and bookseller had since dropped to 55 percent of the list price of a book.
Mr. Eberhard contends that the costs of publishing an electronic version are lower than conventional formats and so authors can improve their shares. He complained, though, that Random House was taking credit for bearing the costs of encrypting digital material "because they're trying to get the best royalty rate that they can."
But Random House's general counsel, Harriette K. Dorsen, said: "Publishers do the formatting and each device needs to be individually done. Upgrades are required for new upgrades of the devices." In addition, she said, the costs of encryption are passed back to the publishers through higher discounts granted to E-book manufacturers.
Some literary agents contend that Random House has taken tough negotiating positions by refusing to allow contract revisions as the market grows. But Ms. Dorsen said: "This is emphatically not correct that we have refused to revisit the issue of royalties. In fact, we understand that in a changing environment, with a business in its infancy, there will be changes in the way this business is done."
The current tension is such that Nuvomedia is prevented from selling an electronic version of Arthur S. Golden's "Memoirs of a Geisha," one of the titles published by Random House's Knopf unit that was used to test eRocket books with customers. "We had it all ready to go, and it was pulled at the last minute because the author wasn't happy with the deal," Mr. Eberhard said. Barnesandnoble.com, which was offering it on its site, deleted it when a dispute emerged.
Mr. Golden's literary agent, Mr. Verrill, said he and his client chose not to permit an electronic version more out of concern about the uncertainties of the future. In general, he said, he thinks that publishers should allow contracts to be revised after a limited number of years to gauge the impact of electronic books on publishing economics.
"We're not ready to commit a book that was likely to sell for the next 20 years over terms that seemed so unthought-out," Mr. Verrill said.
At the same time, he is aware of the impact if authors continue to shy away from electronic versions.
"You bet it has an impact," Mr. Verrill said. "It affects the content that Nuvomedia can offer, and if they have nothing but books nobody wants, then they're likely to fail."

HEADLINE: Defining the On-Line Chief;
Ebay's Meg Whitman Explores Management, Web Style

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
In a Valley of unexpected millionaires, Meg Whitman is the unlikeliest of billionaires.
Ms. Whitman recalls the day in November 1997 that a headhunter urged her to leave her comfortable job promoting Teletubbies at Hasbro Inc. The proposition: to head up a no-name Silicon Valley start-up that needed a chief executive. Her answer was "no." 
 Like legions of graduates coming out of elite business schools in the late 1970's, Ms. Whitman had taken her Harvard M.B.A. and slipped quietly into a successful career at a blue-chip consulting firm. She later moved to corporate America, happy to work for the likes of Disney and Stride Rite.
So it would take more than Internet stock options in a company she had never heard of for Ms. Whitman to give up the peaceful life she enjoyed with her husband and two sons in Boston.
That was until Ms. Whitman visited the cramped San Jose, Calif., offices of Ebay Inc., the person-to-person Web auction community that was already attracting a following so devout it bordered on the cultish. After a few days of being wooed by venture capitalists and hearing the testimonials of users so addicted they slipped out of business meetings to monitor their auctions, Ms. Whitman was hooked.
"I thought something was very right here," she said. "They had touched a consumer nerve."
Ms. Whitman's "no" became "yes." And 14 months ago, she packed up her family and moved to California to begin preparing Ebay for the initial public stock offering that the company's founder, Pierre M. Omidyar, was already mulling.
Since its $735 million offering last September, the company's market capitalization has blossomed to $22.1 billion -- the stock price skyrocketing 1,019 percent. And the 42-year-old Ms. Whitman, along with a cadre of early investors, has become very rich -- at least on paper.
But more to the point, she is also one of the new generation of Internet executives who is bringing conventional corporate bona fides and consumer- product-style marketing to the Web. In the process, executives like Ms. Whitman are changing the way Web companies are run -- even as they develop a new management style suited to this emergent medium.
With no technology background to speak of, Ms. Whitman leaves the heavy lifting to the tech experts. But what she does seem to have are many of the skills that may be necessary if Ebay is to prove itself more than a hot stock or consumer fad and become an established brand.
In some ways, executives like Ms. Whitman are becoming to technology what Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was to fast food and consumer culture in the early 1960's. In those days, an executive did not need to understand the chemistry of ground beef to deliver a hamburger people wanted. Likewise, today's Internet executives do not have to be computer geniuses, but seasoned brand managers who immerse themselves in the culture they are trying to foster on line.
Robert Kagle, a partner at the venture firm Benchmark Capital, an early Ebay investor that hired Ms. Whitman, may put it best: "I was looking for a brand builder to help make Ebay a household name. Understanding technology was not the central ingredient. You have to get the emotional component of the customer experience in your gut."
Certainly, the Ebay brand is becoming synonymous with Ms. Whitman, something she is not entirely comfortable with. A man moving furniture at Ebay's headquarters last week pointed at her, a spark of recognition lighting up his face. "There she is," he shouted. "My wife said she's seen you on TV. Maybe 10 times. You're real popular."
Ms. Whitman smiled and waved at the man. But the grin faded as she turned away. "That's what I hate," she said. "I even have the furniture man noticing me."
The attention is not all that surprising, though. Ms. Whitman campaigns for Ebay as fervently as any candidate on the trail. In recent weeks she attended a press conference with the Governor of Utah; spoke to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington, where she also met with Congressional leaders to discuss on-line privacy, and was interviewed for a handful of coming profiles.
"Personally, I don't care," she said, commenting on the media swirl. "But it is the right thing to do for Ebay."
Ms. Whitman never planned on a Web career. After a summer selling advertising for her college magazine at Princeton University, she switched from pre-med studies and graduated with an economics degree in 1977. She got her M.B.A. from Harvard Business School two years later, and briefly worked at Procter & Gamble before moving to San Francisco in 1981 with her husband, Griffith R. Harsh 4th, who landed a neurosurgery residency at the University of California at San Francisco.
There, she was hired by the consulting firm Bain & Company, where she worked for eight years. But the demands of her husband's career (they moved to Boston in 1992 when he became director of the brain tumor program at Massachusetts General Hospital) and the fact that headhunters called every time a new job emerged, led to a number of jobs at several companies.
It was her two years as chief executive of Florists' Transworld Delivery in Michigan, though, that proved her biggest disappointment. Ms. Whitman had been hired by the florist-owned member association in 1995 -- better known as F.T.D. -- to help smooth its transition to a privately held company. But several key members opposed the idea, quick decisions were politically impossible and competition was eroding market share. Conceding defeat, Ms. Whitman quit in 1997, moved briefly to Hasbro and the next year found herself at Ebay.
As if to test the new chief's technical mettle, Ebay's Web site crashed during her first day on the job, crippling trading for eight hours. "The No. 1 job at Ebay is keeping the site up," she said, so she assembled a team of senior managers to assess the site's reliability. As a result, Ebay added enough backup software and computer servers to increase trading capacity.
But intermittent problems have persisted, and Ms. Whitman has not hesitated to tap powerful Silicon Valley connections to help her. "Last January, we were having short outages -- 10 to 15 minutes," she recalled. "It made everyone here crazy." So she called Scott G. McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc., whom she has known for a decade. "I said, 'Scott, I need a nanny for this system until the baby gets better.' " Now Sun technicians are on call 24 hours. But the baby can still be fussy; just last Monday, trading was interrupted for four hours because of a computer glitch.
Much of Ms. Whitman's job is understanding who uses the auction service. About a year ago, Ms. Whitman set up a consumer insight and analysis group to find out. In contrast to the situation at traditional retailers, she said, "there is no one between us and the consumer." So twice monthly Ebay posts customer surveys on the site. Among the suggestions that were adopted is "Ebay Life," a newsletter full of feel-good stories -- like the woman who collects wedding cake decorations, 50 of which she found on Ebay, or the stay-at-home mother who is an avid Ebay trader at night.
Ebay, at times, can come off as a bit homespun, but that does not concern Ms. Whitman. "I didn't create this culture, but I want to maintain it," she said.
Mr. Kagle can attest to that. It was he who prodded her to set up a feature that customers had been requesting: notification by E-mail whenever favorite items are up for bid. And everyone is a source of feedback. Even the architects who redesigned their headquarters were asked to buy something and report back to Ms. Whitman.
Three times a week, Ms. Whitman meets with staff members to review what other auction sites have that Ebay does not. Ebay's recent $260 million acquisition of the auction house Butterfield & Butterfield was spurred, in part, by the threat of competition, she said. And Ebay is rushing to expand into untapped regional as well as foreign markets.
Whatever the sense of urgency that drives her, Ms. Whitman displays a calming, down-to-earth veneer -- perhaps a result of her upbringing as the youngest of three children in the comfortably affluent village of Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island's North Shore.
Her father was a businessman, her mother a full-time homemaker with a sense of adventure. Ms. Whitman recalls the summer she was 6 years old when her mother, the three Whitman children and a family friend with five children of her own, embarked on a three-month camping trip across Canada to Alaska. Driving for long stretches in a camper with canvas bunks in the back, the children would sometimes get antsy and start to squabble. So Ms. Whitman's mother came up with an unusual solution to tire them out.
She would stop the camper, order the children out on the deserted Alaskan highway and let them run ahead, creeping behind in the camper until they were weary. More than once, a passing trucker would stop to ask if something was wrong. "You could always hear the hiss of the air brakes," Ms. Whitman recalled. "We finally put up a sign on the back of the camper that said, 'We're O.K.' "
And one year, during the family's annual Christmas camping trip on the island of St. John in the Virgin Islands, her parents were too late to make a reservation at the usual campground. Undaunted, the family bivouacked in a toolshed.
That willingness to make do may help explain why Ms. Whitman was willing recently to move with her husband and children into a subdivision in Menlo Park that the locals refer to as "Woodside training houses," because executives there typically aspire eventually to the exclusive homes in that nearby town. "We didn't want to buy a statement house," she said (although not buying a statement house is a statement in itself). They do plan to move once they have finished remodeling a 3,800-square-foot home they bought in well-heeled Atherton.
Working for Ebay will be her last job, Ms. Whitman said. Her stock options -- worth about $1.3 billion as of Friday's closing price -- vest over four years, and she plans to stay at the company at least five years. But by then, if she has not delivered, her options could be worth significantly less or, depending on the capriciousness of the market, nothing at all.
For it is not yet certain whether the new brand-conscious executive is indeed the blueprint for the future, or simply an expensive experiment in Internet management. Yahoo and Amazon.com are already fast on the heels of Ebay hoping to grab the company's loyal customers for their own. And more are sure to come.
"There is this constant roar," Ms. Whitman said. "The challenge is to reorganize your business every three months." And being on the run makes missteps inevitable. "You will be wrong sometimes," she said. "That is just going to happen."
But uncertainty is a condition with which Ms. Whitman, and any investors in Internet stocks, for that matter, must learn to live with.
"She has done a great job so far with the stock," said Alberto Vilar, president of Amerindo Investment Advisors, and one of Ebay's largest shareholders. "Anyone who wants to pick her off as a second-rate manager is barking up the wrong tree."
But though a fan of Ms. Whitman, Mr. Vilar sounded the kind of warning that is an implicit part of being one of today's new Web chiefs: "Her board and shareholders are going to lynch her if she doesn't execute."

With corporate bona fides that include a Harvard M.B.A. and executive stints at established consumer-product companies like Disney and Hasbro, Meg Whitman is bringing conventional management experience to Ebay. But as Ms. Whitman has found, running a Web company requires adapting some of the established methods to the emergent corporate management style:
 
THE OLD WAY
* Decisions must be made in a matter of months.
* The focus is on selling consumer products.
* The chief executive monitors the company image.
* The chief uses a hands-off management style.
* Company strategy sessions might be held once or twice a year.
 
THE WEB WAY
* Decisions must be made in a matter of days -- or even hours.
* The focus is on selling consumers an experience.
* The chief executive micro-manages the company image.
* The chief uses a more approachable management style.
* Strategy sessions might be needed several times a week. (pg. C8)

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: ROMANIA;
Pope's Visit Adds to Hope Of a Future With the West

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, May 9

 BODY:
As Pope John Paul II prayed at an open-air Orthodox Sunday Mass at the side of Patriarch Teoctist, Cristian Andrei, 40, examined the historic moment from Mammon's perspective.
"I think maybe this could attract new investors," Mr. Andrei, a Romanian executive at an American venture capital fund, said as he sipped coffee at an outdoor McDonald's with his wife and twin 13-year-old boys. "Romania needs good publicity and profits, and the visit can do that. It shows that the West can trust Romania. It's a safe place in the Balkans for the Pope to visit." 
 John Paul II's three-day visit in Bucharest, which ended today, is the first Papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in more than 1,000 years, a bold mission to mend the breach between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity. But for many Romanians, the visit was more than an ecumenical milestone. It was also an opportunity to bask in rare international attention and make a case to the West that Romania belongs in Europe.
Since the war in Kosovo began, the Romanian Government has made the point repeatedly, opening its air space to NATO forces and complying with an oil embargo against Belgrade. But it is an uneasy position for a former Communist country that shares a border and the Orthodox faith with Serbia, and has simmering ethnic tensions of its own.
The beaming presence of John Paul II, who drew more than 100,000 people to the Orthodox service in Union Square and twice as many to a reciprocal Roman Catholic Mass attended by the Patriarch this afternoon, charmed even wary Orthodox nationalists. Romanians of all faiths seemed to view the visit as a reward for less pleasant services rendered to the Western alliance that Romania hopes one day to join, having been bitterly disappointed that it did not make the first cut for post-Communist countries, when the Czechs, Poles and Hungarians were admitted to NATO in March.
President Emil Constantinescu, a geologist who was elected in 1996 with a mandate to jump-start Romania's shaky transition to democratic capitalism, suggested as much in his greeting to the Pope on Friday. He described the visit as among other things "a sign of your gratitude for the wisdom and balance that Romania has demonstrated during the difficult and troubled years of this close of a century."
Romanians were deeply disappointed that recent bids to begin negotiations to join NATO and the European Union were rejected. Since the war began, though, Western leaders have suggested that Romania merits a second chance.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain visited Bucharest on May 4, and described Romania as an "exemplary partner and future ally" of NATO. He said he wanted Romania to be put on a fast track for NATO membership, and also pledged to support Romania's negotiations to join the European Union. The Romanian Government has asked the International Monetary Fund to increase its loans, a request that seems likely to get approved.
Bucharest is keeping a sharp eye on how much the war, which has devastated trade and halted transportation through the Danube River, is costing its troubled economy. Zoe Petre, a foreign-affairs adviser to Mr. Constantinescu, said Government economists had calculated that Romania is losing $500,000 a week because of the bombing. She had her eye on postwar opportunities.
"It is not so much whether the West will pay us back," she said. "There are other ways that are more interesting, such as insuring that Romania is really involved in rebuilding the economies of the Balkans."
Economic considerations are paramount to Romania right now, where high taxes, crippling bureaucracy and low wages (less than $100 a month on average) have made Romania's conversion to capitalism slower than neighbors like Bulgaria or Hungary.
The Government has recently sought to speed up the privatization process, but there is considerable skepticism about how deep such reforms really go in a country long stifled by the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, which was overthrown in 1989.
"It's a lot easier to invite the Pope than to restructure the economy," said Stelian Tanase, a political science professor at Bucharest University. But he too focused on the advantages to be found in wartime. "NATO needs our support and we need their money," he said. "Ordinary people are against the bombing, but that is actually not very smart. I may sound cynical, but if we want to be admitted to NATO and the E.U., what we really need is a very long war."
But public opinion polls show that a strong majority of Romania vehemently opposes the NATO bombing. "I think it is terrible," said Daniel Voinea, a 21-year-old art student who works in a bookstore. "Innocent people are being killed by those bombs. We watch it on television, and we know how close this war is to us."
He expressed a fear that is widely shared in Romania, where there are tensions with ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania. "Transylvania is not Kosovo," he said. "It's not exactly the same, but what is happening there could someday spark something similar here."
The Pope, while in Romania, criticized the NATO bombings, but Romanians nevertheless see him as a voice of the West. In Clejani, a small village about 25 miles outside Bucharest, a group of 300 Serbs and Romanian leftists protested the Pope's visit during a commemorative Orthodox Church service for Serbian victims of the NATO bombing.
But throughout the three-day visit, such demonstrations were rare.
"The Pope has now seen that we are all Christians together," said a 70-year-old retired civil servant, who declined to give his name. "And we Romanians see that our country has the approval of the Western world, including an important international organization like the Vatican."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE SERBS;
Torn by War, a Town Works to Recover

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: PODUJEVO, Serbia, May 9

 BODY:
Three months ago, Milos Savic was frantic. He had been stopped at a checkpoint by the Kosovo Liberation Army close to this northern Kosovo city and dragged out of his car at gunpoint. The fear ravaged him, he said, and he lost nearly 40 pounds.
When he met a foreign journalist then, Mr. Savic said he was afraid that the last Serbs would be pushed out of Podujevo, a 95 percent Albanian city about five miles from the border with Serbia proper. 
 Today, in his cafe across from the Podujevo municipal building, Mr. Savic says he's feeling much better, even as NATO airplanes circle and bomb in the hills to the west. The rebel checkpoints that began less then a mile from the city center are gone now, pushed back by the Serbian offensive.
The regional headquarters of the armed rebels in the hills around Lapastica, where a commander called Remi used to hold court for foreign journalists, is also gone, leaving only small groups of ethnic Albanian guerrillas fighting partisan actions against the Serbs in the hills farther north and west, around Bajgora.
Of course, many of Podujevo's ethnic Albanians are gone, too, and Mr. Savic, when asked, expresses some regrets and hopes that more of them will return. Wearing his wartime civil defense jacket and civil defense cap -- a little blue peaked number, with earflaps -- Mr. Savic, a simple and essentially decent man, says he is trying to help remaining Albanians, especially the elderly, to buy bread and provisions.
But Mr. Savic also remembers "the first night that NATO bombed, when the Albanians were in the streets cheering and shooting guns into the air to celebrate," he said, still upset. "The Serbs didn't call in NATO, but the Albanians did, and now NATO kills them as well as us," he said. "We didn't need NATO, and look at what they're doing to all of us."
He described how a friend and neighbor, Dragan Bubalo, was killed in a misdirected NATO cluster bomb attack on a village called Merdare near here, blown off the road in his Ford Sierra. This reporter had visited the scene a few hours after the attack and remembered the car, with its bloodied interior.
"I had to go to the hospital to identify him," Mr. Savic said. "I washed his body and shaved his face and I buried him." Mr. Bubalo was single, and Mr. Savic visits the dead man's mother, Mica, nearly every day. "Her husband is dead and she has no more sons," he said. "She's crying and yelling every day."
Of course the Serbs would defend Kosovo, which belongs to them, he said with new bravado. "It is our house, and the Albanians were welcome to live there, too. But it is not their house, and we are not going to give it away."
The resentment of Podujevo's Serbs toward the Albanians was mounting three months ago, and it burst forth in a fierce week of violence after the bombing began on March 24 and ethnic Albanian guerrillas attacked policemen in the town, killing 10 people, said the town's mayor, Milovan Tomcic. There were "heavy battles" between the Kosovo Liberation Army and security forces along the main roads and in the hills to the west along a 20-mile front toward Kosovska Mitrovica, he said.
The police and the army brought the situation under control, he said, but not before Podujevo was practically emptied.
"There was shooting in the town and a lot of panic," Mr. Tomcic said. "Serbs and Albanians fled. There were less than 100 people in the whole town -- just some officials and old people who couldn't run away."
There is much evidence of that anger in the town, with many Albanian shops and houses burned and looted. Spray painted on some of the shops are gloating slogans, like "Serbia -- we aren't leaving," and "You asked for it."
But between 55 and 60 percent of the 70,000 ethnic Albanians of the municipality have returned, Mr. Tomcic said, including villagers who had fled to the higher mountains while Serbian authorities "cleaned the villages of the terrorists," he said.
Part of his task now, he said -- despite the bombing, the paucity of gasoline and the destruction of roads, bridges and communications -- is to get flour, oil, bread and potable water to the villagers. "We help as much as we can," he said.
Mr. Tomcic, an economist who became mayor in September 1996, is an angry man, but keeps a flat, even tone with a NATO-country journalist. He is convinced that Serbia is being bombed unjustly by a Western world that is siding with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which he said had killed 1,000 Serbian policemen and civilians in 1998, and had laid plans that he said were found recently in its conquered headquarters to take control of Kosovo and kill Serbian men "from the ages of 3 to 70."
Asked if a journalist could see such documents, he said it was impossible, that these were military documents.
The West seemed to think the rebel group was not an army "but some kind of humanitarian organization," Mr. Tomcic said sardonically. "But it was a military force, and it is now destroyed and disbanded, except for some small groups of three to five people who appear somewhere to hit our forces. But their area for maneuver is smaller and smaller."
Mr. Tomcic is especially angry at the destruction NATO bombing has caused to bridges, highways and water, electrical and communications systems, as well as to warehouses for food and fuel needed for transportation and agriculture. "The damages are enormous, unbelievable," he said flatly. "There are no phone lines. There is no media. There is no way to address the people. We can't get food to them or water or diesel for farming. And just now the most important thing is to save the people, to give them enough food and medical protection, to avoid an epidemic."
The municipality is preparing vaccinations against dysentery, hepatitis and typhus fever, he said. "Summer is coming, and there is not enough clean water."
At the same time, he and other Serbian officials insisted, the Yugoslav Army is well dug in and is suffering comparatively little damage. "Fixed targets like barracks and warehouses have been hit," Mr. Tomcic said. "And they have hit decoy tanks and artillery pieces. But the main damage is to ordinary people."
Mr. Tomcic believes that what has been broken here can be mended, so long as the bombing stops and the rebels remain suppressed. "Even if all the powers of the world attack us, the Albanians have to realize that the problems of Kosovo must be solved with the Serbs," he said. "The Serbs and the Albanians here have to decide how to live together -- day by day, point by point. I think it was a terrible mistake that the Albanians listened to some in the West, and a year ago, with their help, tried to solve the problems here with weapons."
In his cafe, Mr. Savic, proud of his civil defense uniform, wears it to wait on tables while he chats with his newly confident customers, all Serbs. "This is a tragedy for all the people," he said, as the planes flew overhead.
"It's always like this in a war. There's killing and bombing and terrible things, and in the end, someone has to make a peace between us."
Outside the cafe, small groups of people gathered on the charred street corners of their broken city as NATO planes rumbled overhead and huge detonations echoed off the hills.
Small groups of Albanians were gathered too, near the main road, under the watchful eyes of the police. The Albanians, many of whom sat wearily on duffle bags made of striped nylon, seemed to be waiting for transportation. To where? A policeman politely but firmly shooed the foreign journalist away.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
China's Leaders Stoke Anger at U.S. at Their Peril

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 9

 BODY:
Through their extended campaign to portray the United States and NATO as evil aggressors in Yugoslavia, and now their endorsement of mass demonstrations that involved the unimpeded stoning of the American Embassy here, China's leaders may have unleashed forces that will come back to haunt them.
The extent to which the Government has shaped, or been forced to concede to, public passions on the Yugoslavia bombing and NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is debatable. 
 But one result of Beijing's policies was obvious in the chants and slogans of this weekend's protests: a revival of nationalistic and anti-American sentiment, which could lead in directions that are dangerous and unpredictable for the reformist Government led by Jiang Zemin. If these unpent emotions solidify, the effects on Chinese politics and foreign policy will be profound, possibly lending new power to conservative forces in the Communist Party.
Demonstrators have sung the national anthem and shouted for China's pride and against "American imperialism." Such attitudes seem to lurk permanently in the Chinese psyche, right alongside the affection for American culture that seemed so prominent last year when many students -- who form the core of the current anti-American protests -- hailed President Clinton as a hero.
Left to fester, that emotional nationalism could spin in unpredictable and dangerous directions, quite possibly turning against President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and their policies of closer ties with the West and more market economics.
"Chinese nationalism is a very emotional and explosive sentiment that, once aroused, can lead to all sorts of unexpected consequences," said Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai University.
The current outburst of nationalistic emotion, Mr. Xiao said, may be simply a shallow and largely passing response to an extraordinary event. But if it grows, he said, "it could encourage China to attempt to return to the past, and it will put Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji under great pressure."
The hand of hard-liners, who are less inclined to develop close ties to the United States or make concessions on, say, foreign access to Chinese markets, could be strengthened. The relative power of a figure like Li Peng, who now heads the national Parliament, might grow, and military chiefs who want a stronger response to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia might have a greater voice.
The patriotism expressed this weekend was seldom linked to direct support for the current leaders, who many protesters complained have been ineffectual in doing anything about the NATO crimes they so vociferously condemn.
Some of the cheers in front of the American Embassy this morning came when a man paraded a large photograph of Mao Zedong, the leader who brought on the mass turmoil and suffering of the Cultural Revolution and whose legacy has been largely dismantled since his death in 1976.
"Long Live Mao," scores of people chanted, students and older white-collar workers alike, seeming to revel in a slogan seldom heard in the last 20 years of economic reforms. In truth, few of them would really want to return to the rigid ideology and personal oppressions of Mao's heyday.
Tang Zhenlei, a 30-year-old teacher, explained why he had shouted with the others: "When Chairman Mao was the leader, he would have stood up to America and taken stronger measures," he said. "But now our leaders have been too soft, they're happy to accept an apology from NATO and leave it at that."
"Chairman Mao was willing to stand alone to defend China's dignity," Mr. Tang said.
For the current leaders, this was supposed to be the year of no demonstrations, a year of sensitive dates like the 10th anniversary next month of the crushing of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. And a stable China was supposed to broaden its ties with the West and deepen its progress toward a modern market economy.
Instead, last month more than 10,000 members of a spiritual movement held a surprise demonstration on the edge of Zhongnanhai, the inviolable leadership compound in Beijing, and the police saw little choice but to let it proceed.
Then this weekend, after the shock of the embassy attack in Belgrade, the leaders endorsed mass demonstrations around the American and British Embassies. Given the anger over NATO's motives that inflammatory propaganda has helped create here, officials may have felt that they had little choice but to let people vent their feelings.
By the same token, they cannot be pleased to have watched the student marches spiral almost out of control on Saturday night, as roaming mobs heaved bricks at American Embassy buildings and cars and mockingly defied the riot police. At several points here that night, groups of young men formed human wedges and tried to batter their way to the American Embassy through police lines. And in the city of Chengdu, crowds firebombed the American Consulate.
In a rare, direct speech to the people televised this evening, Vice President Hu Jintao gave official approval to the demonstrations, saying, in words that are sure to be quoted by democracy advocates: "The Chinese Government firmly supports and protects, in accordance with the law, all legal protest activities."
In a characteristically wooden manner, he also seemed to warn against excesses like the burning of the consulate in Chengdu. "We believe that the broad masses will, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the nation and taking the overall situation into account, carry out the activities in good order and in accordance with law."
Some Chinese people think that the Government intentionally stirred up public opinion over NATO's campaign in Yugoslavia to shift attention from domestic ills and the approaching June 4 anniversary of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations for democracy.
In an interview today, a person who spoke on condition of anonymity who had been involved in the democracy movement then said that by permitting the current large and raucous demonstrations, officials were courting trouble. He quoted a Chinese saying: "He who climbs on a tiger may have trouble getting off."
Today, even as the riot police began to assert more control over the streaming throngs of protesters, the Government continued to stoke the flames of public passion, its media and "experts" insisting absolutely that the Belgrade attack had been intentional.
A bitter editorial in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's prime mouthpiece, referred to the "criminal intent of the aggressors" in the embassy bombing and said NATO now owed the Chinese people a "blood debt."
It is not a far jump from those words to the more lurid slogans voiced by protesters today, like "Bomb the White House" and "Blood for blood." But the newspaper's harsh words came from the same political leadership that has staked great status on building a "strategic partnership" with the United States.

HEADLINE: Rights Groups Shift Battle to New Front: Economic Issues

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In a sign of the ways that both Congress and the leading civil rights groups have changed over the years, some of the biggest civil rights battles now are not about affirmative action plans or school choice, but about access to bankruptcy protection and bank loans.
The shift in the advocacy groups' agendas, from social inequities to economic opportunities, has become apparent as two landmark bills, overhauling both the nation's banking system and its bankruptcy courts, move swiftly through Congress. 
 Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill by a veto-proof margin that would make it much harder for American families, particularly women and the elderly, to have their debts erased through bankruptcy proceedings. A day later, the Senate adopted a sweeping overhaul of the nation's financial system sponsored by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that would also eliminate many of the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law that requires banks to make loans to residents of inner cities, farmers and others who have traditionally been denied credit.
The shift in the agendas of civil rights groups reflects the political realities of a highly partisan Congress that wants to roll back many of the legislative gains achieved by liberals, and of civil rights groups who now see they have nothing to gain by pushing old and unpopular issues like affirmative action.
"The country today has largely moved beyond the most blatant aspects of racial discrimination, which was the driving force for so many years of the movement," said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella group of the nation's most prominent civil rights organizations. "Every economic disadvantage suffered by the under-served in our society is reflected in the bankruptcy debate and the Community Reinvestment Act debate."
Civil rights groups, who have suffered from dwindling public support and court setbacks in the affirmative-action fight, stormed Capitol Hill last week in the hopes of removing provisions from both bills that would repeal the advances the groups had made more than 20 years ago.
The groups that actively lobbied against the measures represent the interests of minorities, women, Indians, the elderly, urban residents and farmers.
And liberal Democrats said that the votes on the two measures could be the only major civil rights votes in the 106th Congressional term. But so far both the House and Senate have rebuffed the recommendations of the civil rights groups and the Clinton Administration.
At the urging of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and other aides, President Clinton has threatened to veto both measures if they are not changed later in the session when members from both Houses meet in conference committees.
Mr. Rubin said in an interview last Friday that he had not heard a single complaint from bankers about the costs of the Community Reinvestment Act, and that the civil rights groups were right to make the legislation a central focus of their agenda.
But Democrats say they fear that the Republicans have found an ideal "wedge issue" for the modern age -- embarking on what could be a successful political strategy of forcing the President to choose between the powerful and politically generous banking industry, which has spent years pushing for the adoption of both bills, and the civil rights leaders who oppose them.
"Gramm could well provoke the Administration to have to choose between the civil rights community and the financial institutions," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who fought unsuccessfully to eliminate the provisions of the banking legislation that would repeal major portions of the Community Reinvestment Act. "It has the potential to be a wedge issue."
Before last fall, the Community Reinvestment Act had never been an important issue in the perennial debate over whether to deregulate the banking system by eliminating the restrictions imposed in the Depression. Those restrictions limited the ability of banks, insurance companies and securities firms to compete with each other. The law has actually proved highly profitable for many banks and savings associations, encouraging them to lend in areas that had often been redlined and neglected. Some experts have estimated that the law has helped to direct more than $6 billion annually to distressed communities.
Senator Gramm's proposal would exempt some 4,000 smaller banks and savings associations from the act. He would also make it more difficult for community groups to challenge the lending records of financial institutions. Mr. Gramm has said that the legislation has proved to be too onerous for financial institutions and has been used by some community groups to "extort" settlements from banks that need strong records in lending to the disadvantaged in order to get regulatory permission to expand.
The harshness of the new bankruptcy legislation became apparent when it was denounced by Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who sought unsuccessfully to soften it by giving more discretion to bankruptcy judges to set the legitimate expenses of debtors.
But Mr. Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has lost his once considerable influence among House Republicans as a result of his handling of the impeachment proceedings. In a scene that was unimaginable before the impeachment hearings, Mr. Hyde was challenged by the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, who urged the chamber to reject the Hyde provision and leave bankruptcy judges with no discretion to consider the individual circumstances of each case that comes before them.
Mr. Hyde, who received the support of only 25 of his fellow Republicans, was ultimately defeated by a vote of 238 to 184.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Jobs Lost to Cheap (and Chilly) Climes

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 7

 BODY:
Seamstresses, steel workers and electronics assemblers have all lost jobs as manufacturing moved from the United States to countries where costs were lower. Now complaints about similar job losses are coming from workers in a quintessentially American industry: Hollywood's film and television studios.
Pressed by declining profits and ballooning expenses at home, Hollywood has shifted production abroad, particularly the production of low-budget movies made for television. About 55 percent of the 1997-98 season's made-for-television movies and mini-series were filmed in other countries, according to the Entertainment Industry Development Corporation, which promotes film making in Los Angeles. 
 Most were made in Canada, where a weak currency, generous financial incentives and proximity to the United States make production relatively inexpensive and convenient. Ten of the 14 original movies shown by the Showtime cable network were made there. And despite its name, 14 of 23 films made for the USA Network were not made in the United States.
Current television shows like "The Outer Limits" and "The New Addams Family" are made in Vancouver, which has become known in the industry as "Hollywood North."
Recent feature films made at least partly in Canada include "Jumanji," "Legends of the Fall" and "Good Will Hunting." "Down in the Delta" was really up in Toronto. So was "Murder at 1600."
Runaway production, as it is called by critics, is a hot issue for scores of Hollywood art directors, grips, boom operators, sound mixers, costume designers, makeup artists, prop builders and stunt men.
"I lost three movies in four months with producers I have worked with for years," said David Lewis, a director of photography. Mr. Lewis, 53, said he has made only $1,800 so far this year.
Many experts caution that the amount of offshore production is tiny, compared with Hollywood's overall output. If workers are losing jobs, they say, it is probably because movie studios, which have been hurt by big-budget flops, are cutting back.
Still, about 1,500 people showed up for a "Bring Hollywood Home" demonstration on April 18 in Burbank, organized by the Film and Television Action Committee, a group of Hollywood workers fighting what their chairman, Jack De Govia, calls a Canadian raid on American industry.
The Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild are jointly financing a study of the phenomenon. Two bills introduced in the California legislature would provide tax incentives to keep film making in the state.
In Washington, representatives of many of the 196 state and local film commissions met last week to form a new trade group, Film US. The group will press for Federal tax incentives and easier access to national parks and military bases for film crews.
"The industry was created here," said Dawn M. Keezer, director of the Pittsburgh Film Office and chairwoman of the new group. "It's now walking out the back door."
Many of the cities and states the group represents once drew business away from Los Angeles, where costs are high and obtaining a permit to film on city streets is not always easy. Now they find themselves in the same boat as Los Angeles. Pittsburgh, where five to eight television movies were once made annually, had none in 1997 and only four in 1998, Ms. Keezer said.
New York City, the nation's second-largest production center, continued to report record levels of filming in 1998. Pat Swinney Kaufman, director of the Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development, suggested that the city did not see the decline experienced by some other cities because very few television movies are made there.
In the past, as production moved to other states, Los Angeles-based workers could travel from one project to another, like highly paid migrant workers. But under Canadian immigration and union rules, only the top people on a production -- including the director, the producer and the stars -- are allowed in. The rest of the film crew must be Canadian, with rare exceptions.
Weekly television series and feature films have not moved offshore to the extent that television movies have. Only 8 American feature films out of 77 now in production are being made in Canada, according to The Hollywood Reporter, a trade newspaper.
Still, there has been considerable migration, and not only to Canada.
Australia, which also has a weak currency, is attracting production. The News Corporation, the Australian parent of 20th Century Fox, has just opened a studio in Sydney.
Warner Brothers executives have said they saved more than $20 million by making "The Matrix" in Australia. "Mission: Impossible 2" is also being made there, and the next two "Star Wars" movies will be. Even "Baywatch," the iconic California beach series, planned to move to Australia, but ended up going to Hawaii instead after the state government and local labor unions made cost-cutting concessions.
The movie business has driven the Los Angeles area's recovery since the collapse of the aerospace industry, and any threat to the business is of great concern. Employment in movies and television in Los Angeles County soared from less than 76,000 in 1990 to a high of 142,500 in February 1998, according to the county.
But employment has dropped by about 10,000 since then. Filming of movies, television shows, commercials and music videos on Los Angeles streets fell 8 percent in 1998 and 2.9 percent further in the first quarter of 1999.
The downturn has hit people like Betty Pecha Madden, a costume designer for 24 years, who said that in the past she had made between $80,000 and $120,000 in a good year.
Ms. Madden said she had lost two jobs to Canada in the last year. "I did a commercial for three days in January. That's the only work I've had since March 14 of last year," she said, adding that her husband, who supervises children on film sets, has also had trouble finding work. "We're scared of losing our home," she said.
Peter Mitchell, the director of the British Columbia Film Commission, said the anger of workers like Ms. Madden was misplaced. Production of American movies and television shows in Canada generated about $1.5 billion last year, he said, compared with $27 billion in Los Angeles alone.
"If we were to evaporate as a production center overnight, or double, it would not have any effect on California at all," Mr. Mitchell said. As with other industries, he said, manufacturing jobs have come to Canada while more lucrative financial and creative jobs stayed in the United States.
Some Hollywood executives say that even now, film employment in Los Angeles is far ahead of where it was a few years ago and the overall economy is healthy.
These executives attribute the dip not to runaway production but to runaway budgets, which have crimped profits and caused studios to make fewer films. The Walt Disney Company says it plans to make 20 movies a year, down from more than 30, cutting its budget by $500 million. Television networks are also tightening their belts.
"I don't really know that so-called runaway production is really any more an issue than it's always been," Tom Rothman, president of production for 20th Century Fox, said. "I think there is an increasing cost consciousness with the business over all."
Still, film production in British Columbia, most of it in Vancouver, grew by roughly 20 percent in 1998 to about $550 million, measured in United States dollars. Right now, 30 productions are under way or about to start there, including 12 television movies and several feature films. These include "Detox," starring Sylvester Stallone; "Reindeer Games," starring Ben Affleck, and "Mission to Mars," a big-budget Disney picture starring Gary Sinise.
British Columbia is recruiting film work heavily. The province's Premier, Glen Clark, visited Los Angeles last year to meet with studio executives. Last year, British Columbia introduced financial incentives similar to those instituted by the Canadian Government in 1997. Together, the programs provide a rebate equal to 22 percent of a film's spending on Canadian labor. Similar incentives are available in Toronto, Canada's other major film center.
On top of that, the Canadian dollar has depreciated to 69 American cents from nearly 90 cents early in the decade. Locating in Canada results in a roughly 30 percent saving on labor, which typically accounts for about 40 percent of a movie's costs. Some of the savings are offset by travel and hotel expenses for American crew members.
"Between the Canadian dollar and the tax advantage they give you, it's very had to beat it," said Leonard Goldberg, the producer of "Double Jeopardy," a thriller made in Vancouver that is scheduled to be released this fall.
Ed Lammi, executive vice president for production at Columbia Tristar Television, said moving to Canada could save up to $200,000, or 10 percent of the budget of a one-hour television show.
"Unfortunately, on a lot of shows you just can't overlook that," he said. Columbia Tristar, a unit of the Sony Corporation, made 5 of its 20 pilots for next season in Canada.
"Everybody in town is there," Mr. Lammi said. "It obviously works."
In some respects, this trend represents an odd turn of events. Canada has long been concerned that its culture is being overrun by movies and television shows made in the United States. Now some people in Hollywood worry that Canadians are usurping the creation of American culture.
"Would you like to have to tell John Wayne, 'You're going to have to take "The Alamo" and do it in Canada?' " asked Luster Bayless, the owner of American Costume of North Hollywood, who was once Wayne's personal costumer.
While some angry film workers have called for a movie boycott on Memorial Day weekend, many say the studios are merely reacting to economic forces.
"I can't blame the studios; they're a business," said Richard A. Ludt, who gave up union construction work five years ago for a job as a grip, moving and positioning cameras. Unable to find work, Mr. Ludt, 35, temporarily went back to construction early this year.
Some groups are exploring whether Canada's incentive system could be attacked under world trade rules or the North American Free Trade Agreement, but they say such moves do not look promising. Many local unions have agreed over the last few years to accept lower wages for low-budget productions to keep them in the United States, but Canada is still cheaper.
Migration to Canada could level off. In January, a Canadian Government commission recommended eliminating incentives, saying they were attracting too many foreign companies and interfering with the greater goal of fostering Canada's own film and television production. Canadian actors are threatening to strike for higher pay, and film crews there are stretched thin.
"The X-Files" moved to Los Angeles this season after five years in Vancouver, because one of its stars, David Duchovny, wanted to spend more time with his wife, the actress Tea Leoni. But few people have enough clout to get a movie or television series to relocate.
"We'd all rather be working at home," John V. Stuckmeyer, a producer of television movies, said in a telephone interview from Vancouver. But, he added, "For every 'X-Files' that leaves here, three more show up."

HEADLINE: Pataki Shift on Pay Turns Union Friends Into Foes

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 7

 BODY:
The Pataki administration's relations with organized labor have suddenly turned bitter over contract talks and proposed budget cuts, and three unions that were on good terms with the Governor just months ago are now running advertisements attacking him.
Last week, after members of the largest state employees' union voted down a tentative contract with an 11.5 percent wage increase, the administration withdrew the offer and replaced it with a proposed four-year wage freeze, a move union leaders took as a slap in the face. Talks with the second-largest union have stalled as the administration has offered it, too, a four-year deal with no increases. 
 "The state used to have legitimate financial problems and it solved them partly because of our sacrifices, and now that times are good, they put this insulting offer on the table," said Roger Benson, president of the Public Employees Federation, which represents 53,000 state workers.
Tensions between governors and unions at contract time are taken for granted, and the administration's latest offer is understood by both sides to be merely a bargaining position. But union officials and state legislators in both political parties say the offer was needlessly provocative.
Two unusual factors have state workers especially incensed: First, Gov. George E. Pataki and other elected officials received a 38 percent raise in January, and Mr. Pataki has given comparable increases to his top aides over the last four years. And second, the state has a $2 billion surplus.
Administration officials declined to discuss the contract situation in detail. "We negotiate at the table, not in the press," said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary.
As for the ire being vented at the Governor, he said, "It shouldn't be seen as all that surprising or unusual."
He also criticized union leaders for complaining publicly about the course of the talks, saying they had agreed to a news blackout.
In 1995, Mr. Pataki, a Republican in his first year in office, proposed deep budget cuts, layoffs and a wage freeze to close a large deficit and pay for tax cuts. The unions began a fierce advertising campaign against him, and the Governor retreated from some of his positions.
Union leaders are threatening a return to that level of warfare. But where four years ago, Mr. Pataki was a little-known newcomer, now he is a popular figure fresh from a resounding re-election victory in November.
There seems to be little risk to Mr. Pataki in getting tough with the unions, which are barred from striking by state law. State law provides that if the two sides reach an impasse and mediation fails, the dispute could be settled by the State Legislature, where the unions would surely get a friendlier hearing. But that route is a long and arduous one that no union has navigated in 24 years.
By last year, Mr. Pataki had improved relations with the unions through measures like improved pension and unemployment benefits and an expanded health program for children. The unions, seeing that the Governor's opposition was weak and that he had moved away from the austerity of his first years, stayed neutral in his re-election race.
But things began to change in January, when Mr. Pataki proposed cuts in Medicaid spending, which officials in the health care industry said could threaten the jobs of thousands of hospital and nursing home workers. In March, the union that represents 150,000 of those workers, along with a consortium of hospitals, began broadcasting radio ads against the Governor.
"I think what we're looking at is a wholesale defunding of government and its historic missions," said Dennis Rivera, the president of the hospital workers' union, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union.
Mr. Rivera noted that the Governor, who is weighing a run for national office, has said repeatedly that budget restraint is needed to preserve promised tax cuts over the next few years. He said Mr. Pataki might have decided that cutting taxes and getting tough with the unions would go over well with Republican primary voters around the country.
"I think his political calculus, in New York and in New Hampshire and in Iowa," Mr. Rivera said, "is that tax cuts trump the concerns of the health care community and the public employees and the people who rely on public services."
Contracts for nearly all of the state's 200,000 employees expired on April 1.
In March, the administration reached a tentative contract with the Civil Service Employees Association -- the largest state employees' union, representing 77,000 mostly blue-collar state workers -- that would have raised salaries 11.5 percent over four years. The pact was expected to set the pattern for the other unions.
But after a campaign that focused heavily on the raises for top state officials, union members voted nearly 2 to 1 to reject the deal.
Last week, the administration resumed talks with the union, with the offer of no wage increase at all. Despite the view that this was just a bargaining position, the offer infuriated many state workers, and the union responded with a radio campaign against the Governor.
"They insulted every working man and woman," said Danny Donohue, the union president.
Mr. Donohue and Mr. Rivera said both unions were prepared to step up their ads attacking Mr. Pataki, and to expand them to television, as the contract and budget battles wear on.
Administration officials said it was essential to send a strong message that the tentative contract the workers turned down was the best offer they would see.
Asked about the administration's wage freeze proposal, Mr. McKeon, the Governor's press secretary, said, "When the C.S.E.A. rejected its contract, what they said, essentially, is, 'We want to start over,' so we're starting over."
The administration began talks with the Public Employees Federation, the second-largest workers' group, by offering the four-year wage freeze, a position it so far has not changed. The federation represents 53,000 of the state's highest-paid workers, including doctors, nurses and technicians in state hospitals.
Those employees' anger was on display on Tuesday, when the federation's rally on pension issues turned instead into a raucous protest against the Governor and his contract offer. Nearly 1,000 people crowded into the lobby of the Legislative Office Building across the street from the Capitol, wearing buttons that proclaimed, "Hey Gov: I'm not a zero."
This week, the union began buying newspaper ads attacking Mr. Pataki.
In addition, the state's more than 20,000 prison guards voted last week to leave their union and form a new one, a move that turned in part on displeasure with the Governor. Critics of the old union, Council 82 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, accused the council's leaders of being too close to Mr. Pataki. The guards want to get out of the contract pattern so that they can receive larger raises than other state workers, a move the administration opposes.
"You know, the Governor had it pretty good with unions until recently," Mr. Benson of the Public Employees Federation said. "I think he's blown it."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
For Women, Manhattan Is Prehistoric

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
HOW will men and women get along in the 21st century? Helen Fisher, a research associate in the department of anthropology at Rutgers University, has come up with a couple of examples for what will happen in societies around the world. One is the African savanna of a million years ago. The other is today's Manhattan.
Dr. Fisher might be accused of parochialism, given that she is a native New Yorker who works out of her apartment on the Upper East Side. And there's no denying that the women whom she envisions transforming the world -- self-sufficient, highly educated, well connected, verbally adept -- do sound a lot like herself. At age 53, Dr. Fisher is a single woman who supports herself and her research (the Rutgers position has no salary) by writing and lecturing. 
 But Dr. Fisher has gathered so much outside evidence, from the mediation techniques of female chimpanzees to the brain structures of male executives, that it's easy to believe her, especially since her observations come without a predictable political agenda. Her new book, "The First Sex: The Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World" (Random House), will not entirely please any of the combatants in the gender wars.
Unlike some conservatives, who bemoan the breakdown of the traditional family, she celebrates women's newfound independence as a return to a much older tradition: the women who roamed the savannas of Africa gathering food, before the invention of agriculture left women tending the the hearth while men plowed the fields.
"The divorce rate is high in Manhattan," Dr. Fisher said, "for the same reason it was high among hunter-gatherers. When you have women with careers outside the home who can support themselves and aren't tied to the land, they don't have to remain the subordinate partner in a bad marriage. They can look for a better marriage that's a partnership of equals."
Women enter the workplace with many advantages over men, as Dr. Fisher documents: they tend to speak and write more fluently than men do; their senses are keener; their brains can keep track of more projects simultaneously; they're more patient and empathetic and nurturing; they're more adept at negotiation and cooperation.
THE marketplace needs women's skills," Dr. Fisher said, "because the world is moving to an information and service economy like New York's." But while New York's skyscrapers are filled with women, relatively few of them make it to the executive suites now -- and maybe they won't in the future, either.
"We're going to see a few more women C.E.O.'s," Dr. Fisher predicted, "and it's good that we're living in a time when women can get those jobs. But it's never going to be 50-50, for biological reasons. Men will fight harder and work longer for those jobs. The vast majority of women will choose not to make the sacrifices. Women are much more interested in balancing work and family because they're designed for the most important job on earth, which is nurturing babies." (Not all women feel this way, as Dr. Fisher well knows. "I'm one of the less than 1 percent of women who can say that they never wanted a child.")
Isn't it unfair to see so many men in the top spots? "Well, you also step over more men on the sidewalk," Dr. Fisher said. "A few win big, and a lot fail. You don't see many groups of women on the Bowery too drunk too zip up their pants. To get to the top, men are much more likely to jeopardize their family lives, their friendships, their health, their safety, their lives. Over 90 percent of deaths on the job occur to men. They're the expendable sex, so they take the risks."
The good news for women, Dr. Fisher said, is that male hierarchies aren't what they used to be. "Men regard rank as power, and women regard connections as power," she said. "We're moving to a society where rank is less important. Corporations are cutting middle managers and emphasizing team play. Small businesses are thriving, most of them started by women."
Those concerned about women's power might also take comfort from a demographic trend in America. "We're about to have a tidal wave of baby boomers reaching menopause," Dr. Fisher said. "In every culture anthropologists have studied, postmenopausal women become more assertive and socially powerful. There are cultural reasons -- they're no longer raising babies; they've established networks -- but I think it's mainly because the ratio of testosterone has risen. Young girls want to please. Old women tell you you how it is -- and how it's going to be."

HEADLINE: DRAWING UP PLANS TO PAY FOR PILLS FOR THE ELDERLY

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Prescription drugs were not a major issue when Medicare was created in 1965, and thus never included as a benefit. But 34 years later, medicine has been transformed by new drugs to treat the ills of old age, from osteoporosis to heart disease, and many of the elderly are struggling to pay the bill.
The issue has great and growing power at the grass-roots level, politicians and health care advocates say, and with the goad of an election just over the horizon, lawmakers in both parties on Capitol Hill are suddenly working on a variety of proposals to do something about it. The debate will be fully joined in a matter of weeks when the Clinton Administration produces its plan to overhaul Medicare, which is expected to propose a major new drug benefit. 
 Yet there is also widespread agreement that it will be very hard to actually pass legislation on the issue, and not simply because of partisan politics. Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled, already has problems paying for benefits over the long term; because of that, many politicians say, any expansion of benefits must be tied to a broader restructuring of the program, an extremely divisive prospect.
As Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who headed a Federal advisory commission that deadlocked over how to restructure Medicare, put it: "People want the goodies. They want dessert. But you've also got to reform the system to make it work."
More than a third of the 39 million people on Medicare have no coverage for prescription drugs they use outside hospitals, and many others with some form of private coverage have substantial out-of-pocket costs.
It was not hard to start a conversation about the issue at the Berkeley Senior Center in Martinsburg, W.Va., last week.
"My medicine bill was almost $200 last month," said Edith Dennison, 82, a retired millworker who says she pays that bill out of her Social Security check. Dorothy Baker, a friend who is also 82, said her bill was more than $100. Judy Knick pulled out a list of her medications, pointed to one and declared, "This is the one that kills me -- $145 for 30 at the Wal-Mart."
Social workers at Berkeley Senior Services, a private, nonprofit agency that operates the center, say they have become expert at getting the low-income elderly onto drug-company programs that provide free medication, and patching together other forms of assistance.
Heather Triplett, a Berkeley outreach worker, said: "A lot are embarrassed or ashamed to admit that they can't afford their prescriptions. So they go from month to month and never let anyone know what a dire situation they're in. Sometimes their kids call us."
The cost can be to a patient's health as well as pocketbook. Addressing that concern, Roni Mather, a registered nurse, recently gave a talk at the senior center about the importance of patients' taking medication as directed, and not trying to economize by stopping short when they feel better.
"Cost really comes into play with our patients," Ms. Mather said.
Medicare beneficiaries who do have some drug coverage get it in several ways. About a fourth of all beneficiaries had coverage through employer-sponsored plans in 1995, according to the National Academy of Social Insurance, a research group, while less than a tenth bought supplemental Medigap insurance with a drug benefit, which is substantially more expensive than a standard Medigap policy.
The rest of those with coverage are either members of health maintenance organizations that provide drug benefits, or qualify for Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor. Thirteen states have programs to help the lower-income elderly who are not poor enough for Medicaid.
Medicare does cover prescriptions for its beneficiaries in hospitals.
Besides the third of all Medicare beneficiaries with no drug coverage at all, what worries some analysts are the signs of erosion in private coverage. The number of large companies offering their retired employees such benefits is declining, according to the Administration. Meanwhile, some health maintenance organizations are putting new limits on how much they will cover for prescription drugs. And some of the elderly have lost their drug benefits because their health maintenance organizations have pulled out of the Medicare market.
"I went through a period toward the end of last year when four of the eight H.M.O.'s that treat seniors pulled out of my area," said Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. "So I had a town hall meeting and a huge crowd showed up." They were "panicked," he said, over the loss of prescription drug benefits.
With coverage limited, advocates say, the out-of-pocket costs for the elderly are substantial, because of both the rising prices of drugs and the greater use of them. Spending on outpatient pharmaceuticals this year is expected to average $942 per Medicare beneficiary, roughly half paid by insurers and half paid by the beneficiaries, according to the National Academy of Social Insurance. About 29 percent have out-of-pocket expenses of more than $500 a year.
Dr. Jerry Avorn, a geriatrician and expert on drugs at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said a Medicare patient today might be a woman in her 70's, on medication for osteoporosis, cholesterol, high blood pressure and depression.
"She could easily end up with bills of three or four thousand dollars a year, primarily to prevent the occurrence of disability in future years," Dr. Avorn said. "In that light, we're really in a new era of pharmacological therapy for the elderly."
In contrast, Dr. Avorn said, "When Medicare was first created back in the mid-60's, our understanding of drugs was quite different. They were primarily used to treat acute illness and made up a small part of the health care budget. In the three-plus decades since, medicine has become not just about the treatment of acute disease but about ongoing management of chronic illness, and even more about the lowering of risk status for things like hypertension."
As a result, many advocates argue, the lack of prescription drug coverage raises important questions of equity.
The issue has quickly caught fire on Capitol Hill, with both parties promising action. But the enthusiasm masks the serious difficulties in its path. Among the biggest questions: Should a new prescription drug benefit cover everyone on Medicare, or just the lower-income? And how should it be paid for?
An analysis of five possible drug benefits by the National Academy of Social Insurance showed them adding $17 billion to $24 billion in the first year to Medicare, which has total spending of about $200 billion a year.
Lawmakers are keenly aware that one of the last major efforts to expand Medicare benefits was disastrous: a 1988 law intended to provide additional coverage for catastrophic illnesses and for prescription drugs that was financed, in part, by a surtax on the elderly. The backlash was so intense that it was repealed the following year, before the drug benefit even began.
Moreover, all the current maneuvering is taking place in the shadow of the 2000 elections, in which the House, where Republicans have only a thin majority, is considered up for grabs. Some Republicans suggest that the Democrats are less interested in passing legislation than in creating a campaign issue.
Republican leaders say they will offer a more responsible approach to the problem. "Republicans are working on a prescription drug plan for seniors that will not bankrupt Medicare," Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said last week. "The Democrats' bill is a poison pill," he added.
Add to that some powerful lobbies, notably the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which is fiercely opposed to any Medicare prescription drug plan that would involve Government price controls, asserting it would hinder research.
For all of that, many analysts say that sooner or later, the Medicare benefit package must be retrofitted for the changing medical needs of the elderly.
Dr. Christine K. Cassell, chairman of the geriatrics department at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said, "If you were to look at the current Medicare population, living as long as they do, and say, 'Let's design a cost-efficient but effective health care plan,' you'd do it very differently."

HEADLINE: New Group Seeks to Build on Newark's Gains

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 8

 BODY:
More than a decade and a half after he startled many people with his support for building the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in a lusterless Newark rather than in some lustrous suburb, Thomas H. Kean is back with more ideas for the state's largest city and a vehicle to promote them.
Mr. Kean, the former Republican Governor, is chairman of the Newark Commission, a group of public and private figures seeking to bring corporate funds, expertise and influence to bear on city problems and economic development efforts. Mr. Kean, who is now president of Drew University in Madison, founded the group three months ago with the philanthropist Raymond Chambers, business executives and local elected officials. 
 So far, the group includes Lucent Technologies, Bell Atlantic of New Jersey, Prudential Insurance, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Amelior Foundation, and it is poised to announce within days that CIT Group and Public Service Electric and Gas are among its new recruits.
Mr. Kean's commission has been most visible in its support for Mr. Chambers's proposal to build a new arena in downtown Newark. One of Newark's main boosters, Mr. Chambers is an owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. Under his proposal the Nets and the New Jersey Devils hockey team, which now play at the Meadowlands, would move to the new arena.
One of the commission's less glitzy efforts -- but to Mr. Kean's way of thinking, a vastly more significant one -- is under way at a school the former Governor and other members of the commission toured on Friday, Peshine Avenue School in Newark.
Lucent has committed $15 million over 10 years to a group of eight schools in the South Ward -- seven elementary schools, including Peshine, and the high school they feed, Shabazz Malcolm X High School. The money will be used to support special learning techniques, community liaison and programs for mentors, and to offer college scholarships of up to $6,000 to any high school graduate who logs a 2.5 grade point average in core academic subjects.
With Mr. Kean on the school visit were Richard McGinn, the chief executive of Lucent, and William M. Freeman, the chief executive of Bell Atlantic of New Jersey. For Mr. McGinn, whose company has supported group learning techniques in Los Angeles and Houston, the activity in the second-grade classroom was familiar.
The program was called Project Grad. Students in groups of four were laboring on short essays describing their favorite animal characters in a story they had read. Each member of a group was assigned a specific task -- one led the discussion, a second kept time, a third took notes and wrote the essay and the fourth kept track of materials.
The teachers at the school said that assigning such responsibilities focused activity and cut down on disruptions.
Studies have shown that the approach increases student achievement, Mr. McGinn said.
Mr. Freeman, of Bell Atlantic, said "a confluence of events" augured well for downtown Newark: the success of the new Performing Arts Center, which opened in October 1997 and drew more than half a million people downtown in its first season; the possibility that a new sports arena could draw up to 20,000 visitors on game nights, plans for commercial redevelopment and the expectation of greater demand for office space.
Downtown business owners and residents say they welcome the efforts of the Newark Commission.
Feldman Middleton, co-owner of the Commerce Food Court and the Express Coffee Shop in Pennsylvania Station, said he has watched Newark's downtown grow more lively at night. He said he would like to see something continue that momentum.
"It's good to see some of the same players making a commitment to downtown" and to the community at large, he said.
The commission hopes to help the city develop a master plan for downtown and selected communities, and to advise city officials on budget and business matters. Mr. Freeman is heading a search committee looking for a full-time staff director for the commission.

HEADLINE: Nation of Savers, or Just Spenders?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A corollary to Klaus Friedrich's argument that the American savings rate is misunderstood because capital gains are not counted as an official measure of income is that stock prices are not counted by the Government as a gauge of inflation (Op-Ed, May 4). One answer to the baffling lack of wage inflation may be that the financial security afforded by the bull market has dulled workers' impulse to press for higher salaries. 
 Also, the inflation that is not showing up in wages seems to have been channeled into the market itself. With the democratization of investing, the instruments of wealth have taken on the character of consumer products. And as the desire to own them becomes widespread, they are becoming outrageously expensive. In what may prove to be the apotheosis of capitalism, Americans seem to have found a way to save and consume with the same dollars.

HEADLINE: Stripers Rebound, To Anglers' Delight;
Schools in Hudson Are Largest, And Cleanest, in Many Years

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: VERPLANCK, N.Y., May 7

 BODY:
The Hudson River, which for years was a forgotten waterway between more popular fishing grounds on the Atlantic Coast and the Great Lakes, has become one of the hottest spots for striped-bass fishing in the country.
The schools of silver-streaked striped bass migrating up the Hudson River on their annual spawning run are cleaner, more plentiful and bigger than they have been in a generation, anglers and New York State biologists say. And sports fishermen from Texas, North Carolina, Michigan and Indiana are contributing to a boom in the charter boat business up and down the river. 
 In the broad bay near this sleepy village 40 miles north of Manhattan, anglers who just a few years ago dreamed of landing a 30-pound trophy were catching 4-foot-long 40-pounders this week and are now dreaming of 50-pound giants.
"There's been an incredible surge in the last five years," said Andrew Kahnle, a biologist for the State Department of Environmental Conservation who has studied striped bass for 20 years. "People have clearly figured out that the fish are back."
All along the East Coast, the bass are strongly rebounding from past overfishing, repopulating rivers from Virginia to Maine, including some -- like the Roanoke, Delaware and Kennebec -- where they had largely disappeared.
But in the Hudson the turnabout is even more striking, because the bass here are overcoming another longstanding problem -- contamination with PCB's, polychlorinated biphenyls, industrial chemicals that were dumped by factories in the upper reaches of the river.
Recent tests by New York State biologists have found that after a long decline, the levels of PCB's in fish caught south of Poughkeepsie have dropped enough to meet safety standards set by Federal officials. As a result, Gov. George E. Pataki has announced that state fisheries officials are going to consider reopening the commercial fishery for stripers on the river, which has been closed since 1976.
And the State Health Department has begun a review of the warnings it posts about eating bass -- which now suggest that pregnant women and children eat no river fish and others eat no more than one meal a month of bass caught south of Catskill. Bass caught north of Catskill should not be eaten at all, the advisory says.
Mr. Pataki is one of many people living along the river who happily eat the fish in moderation. "It's great," Mr. Pataki said as he trolled for bass in Newburgh Bay today.
Up and down the river, fishing activity has grown steadily over the last decade. Unused boat slips are a rarity at marinas along the shores. Many boat dealers say they are nearly sold out of the small craft used for striper fishing. The combination of plentiful fish, a good economy and cleaner water means lots of business, said Rich Pasiut, the general manager of Prime Power Marine, in Newburgh.
"We're making up for a lot of tough years when people were just hanging on by a thread," he said.
For many years, Grant Scott, a professional fishing guide and boat captain from Marshall Creek, Pa., took clients fishing in Lake Ontario and along the Jersey Shore. But five years ago, after reading an article about the Hudson's bass, he said, he tried launching his boat here.
"The fish were just amazing," he said, describing how the screen of his sonar fish finder would "be a blackout" -- so thick with dark spots indicating fish that it looked dark.
He spent several seasons learning the river, then last spring began running $275-a-day spring charters in the Hudson for anglers from as far away as Maryland. He has been fully booked ever since.
Boating on the Hudson, an eight-year-old magazine, has seen its spring and summer circulation grow from a few thousand to more than 22,000, said John H. Vargo, a retired designer of telecommunications equipment and the magazine's advertising sales manager.
Mr. Vargo, a native of Verplanck, is an avid angler himself, dropping everything in early May to net herring for bait and then camp out on his boat on the river.
Nowhere is the return of large bass more evident than in the waters off Verplanck, which for most of the century was a center for commercial netting of shad and sturgeon on the Hudson, with stripers usually a secondary, almost incidental, catch.
Now, angling for bass is the dominant activity in May. On Thursday, a cluster of boats, their fishing lines glinting like spider silk, grew steadily through the misty morning as anglers converged over a sandy flat frequented by bass.
The older fishermen here time the arrival of the bass by the flowering of dogwood trees along the banks. That has always been the case for Tucker Crawford, 73, a shad and sturgeon fisherman. Now, though, his grandson Michael, 30, marks his calendar months ahead of time, securing the first week of May for a vacation from his janitorial job with the Metro-North Commuter Railroad so he can take his boat, the Club, out on the river from dawn until dark at the height of the bass run.
On Wednesday morning, Michael Crawford hooked the fish of his dreams, a great hulk that did not shake its head at the bite of the barb the way small 14-pounders do. This one fought with sheer power, he said, simply swimming away from the boat with the steady momentum of a heavily loaded freight train.
He sent a code word to fishing friends over the radio: "submarine." This was going to be a trophy, he explained later, not an "eater." A small crowd of boats converged.
"There were boats real close on both sides offering to help, but after the first hour, it was personal -- between me and the fish," Mr. Crawford said. After 70 minutes, he landed the giant, which now took up an oversize purple cooler in his driveway, where it awaited a taxidermist.
Mr. Crawford grew up on the river, helping his grandfather haul nets from the age of 8. It was only in the last five years or so that he fell in love with using a rod and reel. "They usually clash -- the commercial and the pole fisherman," he said. "But I love both. The commercial fishing has given me a little upper hand: knowledge."
He said he was disturbed to hear that many recreational anglers opposed the possible return of commercial netting of stripers.
The commercial fishermen have been part of the food chain in the river for centuries, Mr. Crawford said, focusing mainly on shad, which had a high value because of their delicate roe, but also selling whatever stripers stumbled into their nets. Now it seemed reasonable to let the few remaining shad fishermen on the river resume catching stripers, he said.
"There's just a handful of the old-timers doing this," Mr. Crawford said. "It's in their blood and their heart, and they live for the river."
He added that there were more than enough fish in the river to satisfy the sportsmen and the netters. "It's like picking a few grapes from a bushel basket out there," he said.
The day after he caught the 40-pound-8-ounce giant, well below the state inland record of 48 pounds, 3 ounces, which was set last year, Mr. Crawford was back on the water, this time so his brother, Sean, 17, could catch a few 30-pounders. They quickly caught their limit. (Fishermen may keep one striped bass per day per person; others that are caught must be released.)
Unlike some of the sleek, expensive boats around him, equipped with electronic fish finders, Mr. Crawford's boat was a well-worn old craft with decks deeply infused with bass essence and herring scales flecking the deck like sequins on a dance-hall floor. But the fancier boats tended to follow his every move. When Mr. Crawford lifted his anchor to shift spots, his motions were soon echoed by others.
Farther upriver, 330 big-bass hunters were preparing for a weekend fishing tournament with a $20,000 boat as first prize. Hard-core anglers are willing to pay lots of money to travel to places with a "trophy fishery" -- waters containing big, aggressive game fish that give an angler something to talk about back home, said William R. Conners, a tournament organizer and director of the Hudson Valley chapter of the New York State Conservation Council, a private lobbying group representing anglers and hunters.
Now, he said, they can simply drop a hook in the Hudson. "People are starting to realize that they don't have to travel halfway around the world for that anymore," he said. "It's right here in their backyard."

Why Some Get Busted -- and Some Go Free

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
Drug arrests on the 10 o'clock news tend to show inner-city blacks and Latinos being led away in handcuffs. But Federal health statistics show only slight differences in the rates of drug use for whites and people of color -- and define the typical drug addict as a white male in his 20's who lives in a suburb where drug busts almost never happen.
The Partnership for a Drug-Free America expects to spend nearly $200 million this year to convince policy makers and affluent Americans that the drug problem crosses racial, economic and geographic lines. This point would seem self-evident. But the myth that drug use is confined to the black inner city will be difficult to dislodge. 
 The Hartford Courant learned how deep the myth runs when it published a series in 1992 that examined the lives of drug addicts who supported their habits through prostitution. Conditioned to think of drug abuse as a minority problem, some readers were stunned that 70 percent of the drug-addicted prostitutes shown in the series turned out to be white. Some doubted that the story was true. The refusal to believe that white heroin addicts exist was particularly self-deceptive in a state that is almost 90 percent white.
The same stereotypes have been at play for decades along the mid-Atlantic stretch of Interstate 95, where the presumed link between race and drugs has led state troopers to stop and search black motorists based on race alone. The profiling scandal in New Jersey is spreading. Last week Boston opened a profiling investigation of its own.
The move in Boston was helped along by a Federal judge who sharply cut the expected sentence for a black man who had been charged with weapons possession after a random traffic stop. Judge Nancy Gertner chastised the police, saying that nothing in the man's record or driving conduct justified them in stopping him.
Turning to the police record, the judge found a host of random stops. She noted that "African-American motorists are stopped and prosecuted for traffic stops more than any other citizens" and suggested they were "imprisoned at a higher rate for these offenses as well." Citing "deep concerns" about the disparity, the judge gave the man 30 months, when she could have given him six years.
Statistics from Maryland and New Jersey show that black motorists are about five times as likely to be stopped on the highway as whites. Even Americans who disapprove of racial profiling tend to view it as a passing humiliation, with no broad social import. But criminologists have long argued that profiling goes well beyond the personal and exerts a substantial impact on the criminal justice process and the broader social order as well.
Speaking at a national conference last week, Dr. Dawn Day, an addiction specialist from the Dogwood Center in Princeton, N.J., drew a connection between racial profiling of intravenous drug users and the rapid spread of AIDS in the black community.
The most conservative estimates suggest that white intravenous drug users outnumber black users by at least 5 to 1. Even so, drug sweeps tend to be concentrated in inner cities, which are widely viewed as the sole source of the problem. Dr. Day's calculations, based on Federal data, show 5 arrests for every 100 white addicts, but 20 arrests for every 100 black addicts.
Unworried about random searches and arrests, many white addicts carry clean needles so that they can avoid sharing needles and the risk of getting AIDS. But black addicts know that they are vulnerable to random search and arrest and often choose not to carry needles. Instead, they share the needles of strangers, getting AIDS and other blood-borne diseases in the process. As a consequence, the rate of H.I.V. infection for black drug users is many times that of whites.
Criminologists have argued for decades that racial profiling plays a central role in the fact that black Americans make up a disproportionate part of the prison population. Drug cartels have long since grasped this point, minimizing the use of non-whites as couriers and using people who look like mild-mannered suburban housewives whenever possible.
Police departments have historically justified profiling by arguing that it leads to valid arrests. But the practice also exempts from scrutiny the vast majority of drug users and couriers who are by definition non-black. The race-based practice catches some of the guilty, but it violates the lives of many more innocent people, undermining law-enforcement credibility in minority neighborhoods. Finally, the myth that drug crime is a "black" problem, confined to ghettos, allows the culture to deceive itself about the vast scope of the epidemic.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 11, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
The May 10 Editorial Observer, on racial profiling, erred in saying that a Federal judge in Boston had chastised the police for an unjustified traffic stop of a car carrying a black man. The judge held that the stop was justified, but in sentencing the man, who was charged with weapons possession, she took into account that previous convictions may have resulted from racial profiling.

Vying for Korean Hearts: Kim Il Sung vs. Hip-Hop

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 10

 BODY:
On the walls of the classrooms are stern portraits of North Korea's late "Great Leader" and his son the "Dear Leader," and a huge banner on the gymnasium declares, "Great Leader Marshal Kim Il Sung Is With Us Forever."
But it is obvious that this high school is in Tokyo, not North Korea, when a cluster of giggly teeny-boppers bounce up and test their English by asking about something really important to 16-year-old hearts. 
 "Do you like the Backstreet Boys?" asked Yun Mi Hyang, a junior at the Korean High School in Tokyo, and she and her friends paused breathlessly. "You know, the Backstreet Boys. Kevin! Nick! Brian! Oh, they are so great! The best American band. I love their music."
Miss Yun and the other students at the Korean High School come across, in short, as the world's funkiest Stalinists. But the 137 North Korea-backed schools in Japan -- partly financed by North Korea and run by North Koreans who are long-term residents of Japan -- are caught in a crisis, for it is becoming ever more difficult to balance loyalties to Great Leaders and Backstreet Boys.
More broadly, the 650,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan -- by far Japan's largest minority -- seem to be at a crossroads and increasingly to be choosing the Japanese path rather than the Korean path. After half a century in which the Korean population in Japan bridled and fought constantly with its hosts, it is becoming more subdued, and every year more than 10,000 Koreans are taking Japanese citizenship.
"Intermarriage is increasing, and taking of Japanese nationality is increasing," Ku Dae Sok, the principal of the Korean High School, said glumly as he sat in a spacious office with memorabilia of Kim Il Sung on the shelves. "So I think the trend for Koreans here is headed downhill."
Today's Koreans in Japan are mostly grandchildren of those who were brought here to work as manual laborers when Korea was a Japanese colony early in this century.
Most were from what is now South Korea, but in the postwar era many were contemptuous of the American-backed Government in the South. Many Koreans felt that the true nationalistic credentials belonged to Kim Il Sung, who fought Japanese troops during World War II and who established a fervently nationalistic Government in the North.
The upshot was that most of Japan's Koreans initially inclined toward the North, not so much because of its Communist political system as because of patriotism.
Japan discriminated harshly against the Koreans, even after the war, and that cemented the nationalistic tendencies of the Korean minority. The discrimination continues today, for Japan's Education Ministry, which has traditionally been as prone to hard-line ideologies as North Korea itself, bars graduates of Korean schools from even applying to enter Japan's prestigious national universities.
Yet the broader reason for the crisis in the Korean schools has to do with changes among the Koreans themselves.
"The original purpose of the schools was to prepare Koreans so that they could go back to their homeland," said So Chung On, an official of the pro-North Korean Chosun Soren organization in Japan. "But now young people have no intention of going back to their homeland.
"Taking account of that reality, our organization has been trying to modify the contents of the education," Mr. So added. One result is that the North Korean schools in Japan now study much less politics and ideology, and the curriculum is fairly similar to that of Japanese schools, except that classes are all conducted in the Korean language.
This flexibility in the curriculum has helped preserve the support of some Korean parents, but even so, attendance of Korean schools has fallen to 17,000 today, compared with 35,000 in 1967. That reflects a significant waning of support for North Korea in recent years among Japan's Korean population.
Korean families in Japan used to send $100 million or more each year in hard currency to North Korea, but now the aid has fallen to a small fraction of that. One reason is the current recession in Japan, but more important is that some Koreans in Japan look to North Korea and now see not inspiration, but rather something closer to embarrassment.
In contrast, as South Korea has prospered and democratized and emerged from beneath the American thumb, it has steadily gained support. Now more Koreans in Japan are aligned with South Korea than with the North.
The South does not run full-fledged schools in Japan, so parents usually send their children to Japanese schools and then sometimes to Korean-language classes on the side.
What keeps the North Koreans here going, it seems, is not ideology or politics, but nationalism and loyalty. "Are people proud of their mothers only in good times and then ashamed of their mothers when they run into troubles?" asked Shin Te Jyun, the president of the student body at the Korean High School.
Perhaps the greater challenge to the Korean schools is not that pro-North Koreans will defect to the South, but rather that they will join the flood of Koreans signing up for Japanese nationality. Most Korean families in Japan now speak Japanese at home, and the surge of naturalizations alarms many Korean stalwarts who see it as a kind of cultural suicide.
"I could never think of becoming a Japanese citizen, because we were colonized by Japan," said Sok Kyong Suk, a Japanese teacher at the school. "To become Japanese would be a humiliation."

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: P.L.O. OFFICES ORDERED CLOSED -- The police served orders to close three offices in Orient House, the P.L.O. headquarters in East Jerusalem, but the action was delayed pending a petition to the Supreme Court by Israeli peace advocates. Palestinians called the order an election ploy by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau, who has made Jerusalem a centerpiece of his campaign. Faisal Husseini, left, the top Palestinian official in East Jerusalem, warned that a forcible closing could set off riots.

IRAN: PARDON URGED FOR EX-MAYOR -- A majority of Iranian legislators have signed a petition calling for a pardon for the former Mayor of Teheran, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a moderate who began serving a two-year prison term last week on corruption charges. (Agence France-Presse) 

IRAQ: U.S. ATTACKS NORTH AGAIN -- American jets attacked air-defense sites after being tracked by radar during patrols in the northern no-flight zone, the U.S. military said. Air Force F-15's and F-16's dropped laser-guided bombs on antiaircraft sites northwest of Mosul, according to a statement from Incirlik, in southern Turkey, where the jets are based. Iraq said one person was wounded. (AP)
 
ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: JOURNALIST CASE PRESSED -- Punjab state officials said in Lahore High Court that they do not know the whereabouts of Najam Sethi, editor of The Friday Times, although his wife says two Punjab police officers were among 10 men who took him from their home on Saturday. A Government spokesman has said Mr. Sethi was suspected of links to India's intelligence agency; his wife says he is being punished for speaking out against the Government. The court gave the Government two days to say where Mr. Sethi is being detained. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: EAST TIMOR CLASHES -- Supporters and opponents of independence for East Timor fought for a second day in Dili, the district capital, and officials said four people had been killed. Riot policemen circulated in trucks and shots could be heard from the main market, the university and a cemetery. A referendum on independence is scheduled Aug. 8. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
VIETNAM: CORRUPTION TRIAL -- A trial with 77 defendants, including 18 bank officials, opened in Ho Chi Minh City, drawing hundreds of spectators. The case involves a charge of collusion by private companies to acquire huge bank loans with exaggerated collateral. Some defendants risk a death penalty. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
CAMBODIA: LOOTED ARTWORKS RETURNED -- Under military escort, 61 sandstone statues and friezes looted by the Khmer Rouge have been returned for safekeeping to authorities at Siem Reap, the site of the huge temple complex of Angkor. The looted pieces, some dating from the 10th century, were recovered from Anlong Veng, the last stronghold of guerrilla holdouts from the Communist insurgency. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: BOMB SUSPECT REMANDED -- A 22-year-old man accused of killing 3 people and wounding more than 100 in three London nail bombings last month was ordered held in custody by a London court. The man, David Copeland, an unemployed subway engineer, was arrested a week ago and charged with the attacks, the first in a black neighborhood, the second in an Asian one and the last in a gay pub, where the three people died. Mr. Copeland is not known to be a member of any of the racist groups that claimed responsibility for the bombings. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: A SUIT OVER VIAGRA -- A decision by the National Health Service to curb the prescribing by its doctors of the impotence drug Viagra was challenged in England's High Court by Pfizer Ltd. as "legally indefensible." The drug company, which makes Viagra, said it was considering suing the Government for damages in lost business. Health Secretary Frank Dobson took the action in September, saying unrestricted prescribing would be a "serious drain" on the service's finances. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
 NORTHERN IRELAND: SINN FEIN'S CHOICES -- Sinn Fein has picked its chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, left, and another party official, Bairbre de Brun, as its nominees for the party's two positions in the executive of the new Northern Ireland Assembly. The province's largest party, the Ulster Unionists, is refusing to let Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., take its seats unless guerrillas start to disarm. The Unionist leader, David Trimble, and Sinn Fein's leader, Gerry Adams, are deadlocked on the issue. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: YELTSIN CHARGES -- Leaders of Russia's moderate Yabloko Party told members to support one of the five impeachment charges against President Boris N. Yeltsin: that he exceeded his authority by waging a disastrous war against secessionists in Chechnya. The impeachment debate begins in the lower house on Wednesday. Yabloko's 46 members often hold the balance of power, but it is unclear whether the votes exist to impeach Mr. Yeltsin. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
GERMANY: 'RED ARMY' MEMBER SURRENDERS -- Barbara Meyer, one of the last members of the Red Army Faction terrorists of the 1970's and 80's, turned herself in, the federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe said. She is being held pending trial for murder and other charges. The prosecutor said she had been living in Lebanon. (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
COLOMBIA: JUSTICE MINISTER QUITS -- Minister of Justice Parmenio Cuellar, left, has resigned, saying reforms of the judicial system backed by the Government will contribute to human rights violations. The Interior Minister, Nestor Martinez, favors leaving untouched many features of special "faceless" courts that protect judges, lawyers and witnesses by allowing them to testify anonymously. That system is supposed to be dismantled by June 30, but Mr. Martinez favors laws that would allow many contentious practices to continue. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
 MEXICO: SENATOR HURT BY GUNFIRE -- Senator Hector Sanchez Lopez, a former candidate for governor who continues to protest what he calls fraud in elections last August in Oaxaca state, was wounded during a confrontation with a crowd of governing-party activists in a Oaxaca village. Senator Sanchez blamed the governing party leaders in Oaxaca for the attack, a contention the state attorney general, who is from the governing party, called infantile. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: PARAGUAY PLEA REJECTED -- A Federal judge rejected a Paraguayan request for the arrest of Gen. Lino Oviedo, a retired former army chief who is suspected of masterminding the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana of Paraguay almost two months ago. The judge said the Paraguayan warrant was incomplete, lacking charges and the amount of jail time the general could face. General Oviedo has held political asylum in Argentina since he and his family fled to Buenos Aires on March 28.

AFRICA
 
ANGOLA, ZAMBIA: MEETINGS PLANNED -- Hoping to ease growing tensions between Angola and Zambia, defense and security ministers from both countries have agreed to meet in Swaziland this week for talks. For months Angola has accused Zambia of allowing the Angolan rebel group Unita to resupply via Zambia. But Zambia denies such cooperation, saying the accusations emanate from its refusal to allow Angolan troops to use Zambian territory to attack the rebels.
 Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
RWANDA: BELGIAN EXTRADITION DENIED -- Tanzania turned down Belgian requests for the extradition of a former Rwandan Army major accused of killing 10 Belgian peacekeepers during Rwanda's 1994 genocide, saying he should be tried in Rwanda. The officer, Bernard Ntuyahaga, is accused of ordering the slaying of Rwanda's Prime Minister and the soldiers deployed to protect her.

Making Brazilian Soccer a Bigger Deal

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 10

 BODY:
Luiz Carlos Faloppa loves rooting for his soccer team. Yet he has not attended a match in person for eight years, disgusted with the concrete slab seating and the irate fans who lob urine-filled plastic cups and brawl with supporters of rival clubs.
"I tired of getting urine tossed on my back," said Mr. Faloppa, a 39-year-old executive at a magazine publisher. Now he watches soccer only on television. 
 Years of mismanagement and neglect have left Brazilian soccer in disarray, with only diehard fans, mostly young males, mustering courage to attend matches live. The situation is not much better for players, who are subject to a punishing schedule of games, bound by an archaic system limiting their ability to negotiate lucrative contracts and often threatened with violence on and off the field.
Even so, foreign and Brazilian investment firms increasingly see opportunities to transform Brazilian soccer into a moneymaker. For example, Nationsbank -- now Bank of America -- purchased the licensing rights of the Vasco da Gama club of Rio de Janeiro. And in the most widely publicized transaction, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., the Dallas-based buyout firm with investments throughout Latin America, announced a deal in April giving it the marketing and licensing rights for Corinthians, Sao Paulo's largest team.
"Soccer in Brazil is like baseball, basketball and football put together," said Charles Tate, the firm's president. The transaction gives Hicks, Muse all licensing rights of the club's name, enabling it to sell items like caps or T-shirts emblazoned with the Corinthians insignia as well as the opportunity to negotiate deals for the TV broadcast of games. Hicks, Muse has already entered into pay-TV ventures in Brazil and in neighboring Argentina that could facilitate such deals.
Mr. Tate said Hicks, Muse would use its knowledge from experiences in the United States, where it has interests in sports ranging from professional baseball and hockey to rodeo.
The entrance of American companies like Hicks, Muse into Brazilian soccer is the latest chapter of a wide-reaching transformation that began largely with efforts by the most famous soccer player in Brazil, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele. After retiring from the game, Pele was named Minister of Sports in 1994 by the newly elected President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He strongly encouraged clubs to treat players, many of whom came from poor backgrounds, with greater respect. He also sought to limit corruption in clubs by spurring them to make the leap from nonprofit organizations into for-profit companies.
Pele, now 58, convinced Congress last year to approve legislation that requires greater transparency of club finances and better accounting procedures. This change has paved the way for potential investors to consider deals with some of Brazil's larger teams. Another part of the legislation, known as the Pele Law, phases out an antiquated system in which players had little freedom to negotiate contracts.
"The Pele Law laid the groundwork that investors needed to start taking Brazilian football seriously," said John Michael Streithorst, the director of new business ventures at Banco Icatu, an investment bank based in Rio de Janeiro, which had negotiated with Corinthians before the club's deal with Hicks, Muse.
Mr. Streithorst likens the situation in Brazil to that in England in the 1980's, an era when English soccer was widely known for the violent clashes among rival fans. With the entry of private investors into the sport, however, and with lucrative pay-TV licensing contracts, soccer's image improved, and a broader array of fans began to attend games.
Another domestic authority on the Brazilian soccer business, the talk show host and newspaper columnist Juca Kfouri, has estimated that it may be possible for sports to generate 4 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product in a few years, up from 1.5 percent today. "Thank God capitalism is winning out against the feudal attitudes that have prevailed in this sport for too long," Mr. Kfouri said. "With the talent produced here, Brazil could have the N.B.A. of world soccer."
That potential, combined with the transformation of soccer in recent years in Europe, where some clubs have gone so far as to sell stock to the public, has not limited investors only to contracts with individual clubs. For instance, the Globo media group and several Rio de Janeiro investment banks have invested $30 million in Lance!, a daily sports newspaper founded in 1997 along the lines of France's L'Equipe and Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport. Although Lance! publishes some articles about other sports, including auto racing and volleyball, soccer dominates. And the newspaper unabashedly supports efforts to improve team management.
"Having more private capital in clubs should act like a benevolent virus, in which the good cells expel the bad cells," said Walter de Mattos, the newspaper's publisher.
One large problem facing those hoping to transform Brazilian soccer is the way games are scheduled. In Brazil, a club can play up to 90 games a year, compared with 60 or 70 in Europe. Players often complain of the effects of the grueling schedule. And there is an array of championships and other tournaments, making schedules confusing.
Regardless, soccer as a business is expanding even outside the two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In the northeastern state of Bahia, Opportunity, an investment group, formed a venture with the state's largest club. Even Pele is considering similar deals. He has left his post as Minister of Sports and now dedicates part of his time to Pele Sports and Marketing, which is searching for possible ventures.

. . . and Finds That It's Not 1999 Anymore

SERIES: COUNTING TO 2000: China's Computer Puzzle

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
When Zhang Qi, the state official who coordinates China's Year 2000 computer policy, began asking Government ministries last August for monthly reports on their readiness, most simply ignored her.
"I was not satisfied," said Ms. Zhang, a 53-year-old career bureaucrat whose flinty demeanor seems perfectly suited to her task. "We are here to offer them service and technical support. But quite a few did not send over information, and we had to call them to find out their situation." 
 She got action only after she reminded her colleagues that confronting the Year 2000, or Y2K, problem was a top priority of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and other leaders. "It takes some time to make them realize and believe the problem," she said with ill-disguised impatience.
In contrast to the United States and Europe, where the public debate over the Year 2000 issue has gone through a full cycle -- from near-hysteria to having many people dismiss the whole thing as a minor annoyance -- China is just waking up to the idea that on Jan. 1, 2000, some of its computers may not work.
(In general, the problem results from the reliance of many programs on only the last two digits of a year. Unless updated, some computers and electronic machinery might misinterpret "00" as 1900 rather than 2000, substitute another year or simply freeze.)
Experts here warn that China could suffer everything from severe disruptions in power and water to lesser but still expensive glitches in telecommunications, banking, public health and transportation. And China's woes could spill over to Hong Kong, where banks, brokerage firms, and shipping companies with close ties to the mainland are worried about lost cargo and missing payments.
"China is very, very behind in Y2K contingency planning," said Joseph Sweeney, director of research at the Hong Kong office of Gartner Group, a research firm that specializes in the Year 2000 problem. "There's no way many of their organizations will come up to speed in time."
Yet so little is known about the nature of the problem here that the experts are often reduced to a digital-age version of reading tea leaves as they scrounge for clues about how and where China will be affected. The dearth of data is compounded by China's computer network -- a mix of 1960's-era mainframe machines and pirated copies of the latest Windows software running on a variety of personal computers.
Tim Shepheard-Walwyn, the chairman of the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, a consortium of 300 banks that monitors Year 2000 compliance, said he did not have enough information even to make a judgment about China. He visited Beijing in March to prod officials at the People's Bank of China for more details.
Part of the resistance is that China is not nearly as dependent on computers as the United States or other Asian countries. Seventy percent of people live in rural areas, where computers -- let alone computer bugs -- are barely known. Even in big cities, the prospect of computer failures is not frightening to a country that measures calamity on the scale of last year's Yangtze River floods.
"Food still comes in on people's backs, water comes from a dam upriver, and people don't use that much electricity anyway," said R. Mark Mecham, deputy director of the United States Information Technology Office in Beijing, a trade association that represents more than 50 computer makers.
At a minimum, though, the Year 2000 problem could cramp China's economy, which is growing despite the Asian slump. Gartner Group estimates that 66 percent of Chinese companies will experience some failure in their computers. That compares with 40 percent of companies worldwide.
Experts said China's Year 2000 problems were likely to be concentrated in just the kind of places where the Government wants to showcase its future as a technologically advanced economy: the Pudong district of Shanghai and Shenzhen, the special economic zone that borders Hong Kong.
In a recent survey, a Chinese research firm, Century Perspective Market Research, found that only 15 percent of commercial and governmental organizations had fixed Year 2000 flaws and tested their systems.
Numbers like these alarm foreign companies here, as well as companies outside China that deal with the mainland. Hong Kong's container port, for example, processes half of China's exports and 40 percent of its imports. Many of the invoices for those goods are settled by payments that flow electronically between banks in Hong Kong and their counterparts in mainland China.
If the Chinese banks suffer computer malfunctions, it would paralyze hundreds of millions of dollars of settlements within days. Alan Fung, an area manager at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, said the banks were already devising plans to channel transactions through larger Chinese banks. Failing that, they might resort to writing out transactions on paper.
"If the Chinese banks fail to process transactions for one or two days, that might not be a problem," Mr. Fung said. "But if the interruption is for four or five days, that's another issue."
Similarly, Hong Kong's major utility, CLP Power, buys some of its electricity from power plants in mainland China. Among those is the Daya Bay nuclear power station in neighboring Guangdong Province. A spokesman said 97 percent of CLP's Hong Kong systems were ready. But he acknowledged that the company had little control over Chinese suppliers like Daya Bay.
American computer companies have fears of a different sort. They sold China most of its 10 million computers. And although many have dispatched teams here to repair bugs, they are afraid of being dragged into Chinese courts if Year 2000-related glitches lead to costly interruptions in services.
"It's a very sensitive issue because relations with the Government are obviously very important," said Greg Shea, the director of communications and government affairs for Hewlett-Packard in Beijing.
Outsiders say they are impressed by the noise Ms. Zhang has generated since she became China's Year 2000 czar last August. With a propaganda campaign that includes advertising, newspaper articles and trips around the country, Ms. Zhang has introduced the term Y2K to the Chinese vocabulary.
China has also made splashy symbolic gestures -- such as requiring top officials of the Civil Aviation Administration to be aloft on New Year's Eve as a show of confidence in the air traffic control system.
But Ms. Zhang has been more successful as an evangelist than a trouble-shooter. That is because, in fixing Year 2000 problems, she must overcome a gantlet of technological, financial and institutional hurdles.
One big problem is that an estimated 96 percent of the software in China is pirated. Software manufacturers generally refuse to repair products not sold under a license. Faced with buying a license to become Year 2000 compliant, many Chinese companies simply opt to leave their equipment alone.
China's straitened finances are an even bigger hurdle. The central Government has given provincial and local governments a deadline to be compliant that is supposed to lead to repairing all identified problems by the end of September. But Beijing also says they must foot the bill.
China's banks alone have spent $600 million on Year 2000 fixes, according to Ms. Zhang, so selling the party bosses in China's unruly provinces on such a costly chore for public facilities and the many businesses still under government control is no small challenge.
"Officials who want to be promoted don't see this as an opportunity," said Chen Xinxiang, a gregarious engineer who is overseeing the Beijing municipal government's Year 2000 preparations.
Mr. Chen, who has a Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University, took on the project as a sideline to his efforts to promote Internet use in Beijing. He said he was confident that China's capital would not suffer widespread breakdowns in transportation, telecommunications or electricity.
But Mr. Chen said there were potential trouble spots. The plant that supplies two-thirds of Beijing's water cannot be shut down for testing, and Mr. Chen said he did not know whether its computers were vulnerable. Water would still flow if the computers malfunctioned, but it might not be purified.
On April 9, Beijing had a kind of dry run for Jan. 1. Because it was the 99th day of 1999 -- many computers were programmed to read a string of 9's as the end of a file -- some experts said April 9 was the first of a series of dates that could cause electronic glitches. Mr. Chen said there were three computer crashes in the city: the reservations system of a luxury hotel, the network of a company, and the board that displays exchange rates at a bank.
"I've been telling people, 'This is a tiny version of the Y2K issue,' " Mr. Chen said. "It was like an alarm."
For all his jitters, Mr. Chen said he would happily fly on New Year's Eve. That reflects a growing view -- even among foreigners -- that China's skies will not be filled with dangerously wayward airplanes. Officials here contend they are only six months behind the Federal Aviation Administration in the testing and repair of the country's air traffic control system. (If so, that confidence could be overdone, since even the F.A.A. says it does not expect to finish until June.)
Yi Qun, the deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration, said it was not hard to debug China's guidance and communications equipment because most of it was made by foreign suppliers.
With its top aviation officials at risk, China plans to adopt precautionary measures, such as spacing planes farther apart in the hours just before and after midnight on New Year's Eve, which falls on a Friday this year.
As the Year 2000 draws closer, the focus among computer companies here has shifted from how to get ready for Jan. 1 to how to deal with the fallout from inevitable failures afterward. I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and other companies are bracing for a blizzard of lawsuits demanding compensation for Year 2000 losses.
"It's still far from clear that American companies will get a fair hearing in Chinese courts," Mr. Mecham said.
I.B.M. has played a central role in advising the Chinese Government on Year 2000 issues. But executives at rival companies said it was taking a low profile as the threat of lawsuits loomed. I.B.M. declined to discuss its efforts in China.
The companies may have reason to worry. Beijing initially ordered its ministries to demand free repairs. Suppliers that refused would no longer be allowed to sell products to the Government, according to a mid-1997 directive.
Ms. Zhang has since softened that line, saying China no longer expects companies to bear the entire cost of repairs. "The question is, how much should they pay?" she said. "Chinese users have already paid a lot. And as we know, big companies like I.B.M. never do anything free of charge."
In general, though, Ms. Zhang has cultivated close relations with the computer industry. It is easy to understand why: With 18 Government departments reporting to her on Year 2000 readiness, she needs a constant stream of advice from experts on where to channel her energies.
Of the Government departments, in fact, only the People's Liberation Army does not have to report to Ms. Zhang on the Year 2000 issue. "Maybe they are able to solve it themselves," she said with a faint smile.

Chart: "Backup Plan?"
China is far less dependent on computers than other major countries. But it may not want to throw away its abacuses just yet because it relies on enough computer technology to be vulnerable to the Year 2000 problem. (No data on readiness are available.)

HEADLINE: Edwin Dale Jr., 75, Reporter And an Expert in Economics

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former economics reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times who later explained the intricacies of supply-side economics as a budget spokesman in the Reagan Administration, died today at the Washington Hospice.
He was 75 and was visiting in Washington when he died. He had homes in Delray Beach, Fla., and Osterville, Mass., on Cape Cod. 
 The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Meredith.
Mr. Dale worked for The Times from 1955 to 1976. In his journalistic work, economists often found him as knowledgeable as they were. For example, Mr. Dale was credited by economists with being one of the first to establish that the roots of inflation lay as much in the service sector as in the pricing of goods. He came to this insight in the 1950's and helped bring it to public awareness.
Joseph Laitin, a spokesman for Government agencies including the Treasury Department, said, "One budget director commented to me after an interview that this man Dale was qualified to be budget director."
The economist Paul A. Volcker said, "It was pretty wild and woolly when I was Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and he was a voice of calm, common sense during that period."
Mr. Volcker said that when Mr. Dale became the spokesman for David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, "I thought that was a waste of a good journalist, going to the budget bureau."
Mr. Dale was born in Philadelphia and went to Yale University, where he was managing editor of The Yale Daily News and graduated in 1944, in time to serve as a naval officer in the Pacific in World War II.
His first newspaper job was with The Worcester Evening Gazette in Massachusetts in 1947 and he was an economics reporter for The New York Herald Tribune before joining The Times.
In 1968 Mr. Dale assisted on an important scoop on the escalation of the war in Vietnam.
Stanley Karnow, in his 1983 book "Vietnam: A History," wrote that Representative William Moorhead of Pennsylvania held a party at his home in Washington that was attended by Mr. Dale and Townsend Hoopes, the Under Secretary of the Air Force. Mr. Hoopes, Mr. Karnow said, had turned against the war and "hinted to Dale that a faction of the Pentagon was forming to resist a troop buildup in Vietnam."
Acting on Mr. Dale's hint, The Times was able to report on March 10 that President Lyndon B. Johnson was considering a Pentagon request to call up 206,000 more men at a time when the Administration was proclaiming that Communist forces had been crippled by losses suffered in their recent Tet offensive.
Mr. Dale was the author of "Conservatives in Power" (1960, Doubleday) and the principal author of "The People's Budget" (1995, Regency). He was co-editor, with his Times colleague Richard E. Mooney, of "Inflation and Recession?" (1958, Doubleday).
Mr. Dale was married to Mary Todd Hastings from 1950 until her death in 1983. In addition to Mrs. Dale, he is survived by a stepdaughter, Rosalind C. Dujardin of Bermuda; a stepson, Daniel C. Cross of Washington, and six step-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Is Back in Favor, But Dow and S.& P. Slip

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stock prices closed mixed yesterday after a choppy session that saw some profit taking in blue chips and renewed interest in technology shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average was off 24.34 points, to 11,007.25. The blue-chip index fluctuated between positive and negative territory throughout the session. 
 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.70, to 1,340.30, but the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.77, to 2,526.39, largely on the strength of Internet stocks.
Blue-chip stocks fell in a reversal of last week's trading pattern, in which investors sold technology stocks and bought those of economically sensitive, or cyclical, companies. Yesterday, traders were unloading cyclicals like General Motors and Boeing.
"The market is a fickle mate, and on any given day, it's going to like the cyclicals and hate something else and on another day going to flip-flop and do just the opposite," said Charles Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management.
One exception was aluminum stocks, which rose after Credit Suisse First Boston upgraded Kaiser Aluminum.
But while bond prices were stronger yesterday, consumer and financial services stocks declined amid concern about interest rates. Investors are concerned about the general upward movement in interest rates, particularly in light of two big auctions of Treasury securities this week, said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at the First Albany Corporation.
Rising interest rates typically prompt some selling in financial services stocks and also stocks trading at high prices relative to their earnings projections, Mr. Johnson said.
"Investors generally don't buy companies with high price-to-earnings ratios when interest rates are rising," he said, "and that generally hurts large companies, which tend to have the highest P/E ratios."
Big consumer stocks like Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble, which depend on lower rates to keep consumers buying, were hit hard.
Meanwhile, merger news moved other stocks. HSBC Holdings is buying Republic National Bank of New York and an affiliated banking company for $10.3 billion in cash. Under the agreement, HSBC will pay $72 a share for the Republic New York Corporation and Safra Republic Holdings S.A. Republic's stock fell on the news, however.
Internet stocks were higher on reports USA Networks would abandon its bid to acquire Lycos after concluding it cannot win approval from Lycos shareholders. Lycos stock rose and USA Networks fell. Shares of CMGI Inc., a holding company that has about a 20 percent stake in Lycos, advanced.
In economic news, two manufacturing groups jointly reported that spending on machine tools in March rose 44 percent from February but declined 48 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall economy. Don Carlson, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said the group expected stronger results in the second half of this year.
 
Treasuries End Slide
 By Bloomberg News
 Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, snapping a two-day drop, as the highest 30-year Treasury yields in almost a year lured investors.
"It's a buying opportunity," said Alan Day, who helps oversee about $4 billion at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt. "There's an overreaction to the threat of inflation."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 92 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.79 percent, from 5.81 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of a new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.868	97.707	High Rate	4.48%	4.51%	Coupon Yield	4.60%	4.69%	Low Rate	4.39%	4.42%	Median Rate	4.47%	4.49%	Total applied for	$31,772,472	$29,871,104	Accepted	$11,348,255	$11,317,304	Noncompetitive	$1,363,598	$1,113,819	
 
Both issues are dated May 13, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 12, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 11, 1999.

HEADLINE: Pataki Report Says Tax Cuts Helped Upstate

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
As government officials in Albany remained deadlocked over the state budget, Gov. George E. Pataki released a report yesterday asserting that tax cuts enacted by his administration have prompted an economic revival in upstate New York.
The report, by Stephen Kagann, the Governor's chief economist, says that the number of nongovernmental jobs in the 52 counties north of the New York City metropolitan region has hit a record, and contends that manufacturers have started to add jobs in the Hudson Valley, the Mohawk Valley, and Syracuse. Manufacturing is particularly important upstate, employing almost 14 percent of private-sector workers, versus 10.5 percent of workers nationwide, according to the study. 
 The report puzzled some independent economists, who said that upstate shows few signs of an economic rebound. "If it's happening, you can't see it in the employment statistics," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates.
The economic problems in Asia have hit manufacturers across the country Mr. Kagann said. Nevertheless, some areas of the state were gaining manufacturing jobs while such jobs were declining nationwide, he said, "and that hasn't happened in New York State in 25 years."
The study was released as the Governor and State Legislature remain deadlocked over the state budget, which is more than a month overdue. The Governor has proposed further tax cuts and a very small increase in spending, and wants to use the state surplus to pay for future needs. The Democrat-controlled Assembly wants to skip the tax cuts and increase spending; the State Senate, which is controlled by Mr. Pataki's Republican Party, is somewhere in the middle.
Mr. Kagann's report asserts that for every $1 billion in tax revenues raised by state or local governments, upstate companies cut 45,000 jobs. The same amount of tax revenue does create government jobs -- but only 17,000, he said. "It's not a fair tradeoff," Mr. Kagann said.
Independent analysts agree that cutting taxes can have a positive effect on private-sector employment, especially in manufacturing.
But in addition to the tax burden, there are other factors that have dragged down the upstate economy, economists said, including the national decline in manufacturing, the mergers and sales of companies that have moved headquarters out of upstate, and Canada's weak economy.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Pay $10.3 Billion For Republic

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 10

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings P.L.C. announced today that it would purchase the parent company of the Republic National Bank of New York for $10.3 billion cash, the biggest foreign takeover deal for an American banking company.
The purchase of the Republic New York Corporation and an affiliate by HSBC -- an international banking group based in London with antecedents in Hong Kong and Shanghai -- would double the size of HSBC's private-banking business. It would also give HSBC the third-biggest retail branch network in the New York region, serving lower- and middle-income customers with low-cost checking and free automated teller machine services. 
 Banking industry analysts said the deal largely reflected HSBC's efforts to expand its highly profitable private-banking operations, which serve very wealthy clients.
"Strategically it fits," said James Johnson, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities. "It complements them in an area they have been pushing: wealth management."
The deal would likely result in layoffs at Republic's New York operations to eliminate duplication with HSBC Bank USA, the network of American branches formerly known as Marine Midland. Analysts also said that the effects of the deal on Republic's less affluent customers remained unclear, with the possibility of new services and higher fees. Page C6.
Republic's sale would mark the end of independence for a banking business founded more than three decades ago by Edmond Safra, a Lebanese-born Jewish businessman who is regarded as an enduring figure in the banking world.
Mr. Safra, 66, suffers these days from Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder, and there had been growing speculation in recent days that he might sell. Republic's stock rose 14 percent on Friday, and HSBC's purchase plan was reported on Sunday evening by Bloomberg News.
Under the $72-a-share agreement, HSBC is buying the Republic New York Corporation and an affiliated company, Safra Republic Holdings S.A., the parent of banks that serve clients in havens like Switzerland, Luxembourg and Monaco.
HSBC has grown aggressively out of its roots in the colonial Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. It is now a major competitor in the business of managing money for the wealthy, a profitable business that helps offset the risks in such other operations as loans to emerging-market countries of Asia.
The deal would surpass the previous record for a foreign takeover of an American bank, the $10.1 billion purchase of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank announced late last year. It would also be HSBC's biggest purchase since it acquired Marine Midland Bank of Britain for $6.1 billion in 1992, which led to the relocation of its headquarters from Hong Kong to London.
The combined HSBC and Republic would have assets of $554.4 billion and currently employs 136,700 people. HSBC said that it would finance the purchase partly through through borrowing and a $3 billion stock sale, and that the deal would eventually result in $300 million annual savings.
Its spokesman, Adrian Russell, said the move would maintain the bank's stated intention to balance its holdings in the industrial world with investment in emerging markets. And, he said, "It gives us an extra million customers in the world's biggest economy."
The acquisition requires regulatory approval in Britain, the United States, Hong Kong and elsewhere, but Mr. Russell said HSBC hoped to complete it by the end of the year.
HSBC announced last year that it would list its shares for trading in the United States, and there has since been speculation that it planned a big American acquisition.
After rising Friday on takeover speculation, Republic shares fell $1.9375, to $68.0625, in New York today. Safra Republic shares, traded in Luxembourg, soared 17.5 euros to close at 66 euros. Both HSBC Holdings and HSBC's separate class A shares fell more than 2 percent here.
By purchasing Safra Republic Holdings, HSBC will acquire 30,000 international clients in high-margin private banking, a business that generally caters to people with $1 million and more to invest. The affiliate has 44 offices holding client funds that total $56.5 billion.
"What they want to capture is an ever-growing number of millionaires in Asia and, to some extent, in Latin America," said Simon Samuels, a banking analyst with Salomon Smith Barney here. Wealth management, he said, was also seen as "the flavor of the next century" on the assumption that with governments less able to provide pensions, there would be a corresponding boom in private investment by individuals.
John Bond, HSBC's chairman, said: "The acquisitions we have announced today will bring together two complementary private banking franchises. At the stroke of a pen, it doubles the size of our consumer-banking operations in the United States, and it doubles the size of our private-banking business around the world."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: TRADE;
Aides Fear Clinton's China Deal Has Become Collateral Damage

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
In the days just before NATO mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Administration officials were already voicing fears that they might have missed their moment to strike a political deal to get China into the World Trade Organization.
Such a deal has been the centerpiece of President Clinton's much-debated effort to build a "web of engagement" with Beijing. Now the hopes of patching it together in a few months are fading, and White House officials doubt that they will have the political opportunity to get it through Congress after that. 
 The bombing has clearly fueled the nationalist sentiments that were forcing Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, China's leading economic reformer, to pull back some of the concessions he offered a month ago.
That, in turn, creates a backlash here. Lawmakers who were wavering about whether to support the deal that Mr. Clinton nearly had in hand seem virtually certain to reject any accord with lesser concessions.
But that is only the beginning of the problem. The images of Chinese tossing bricks at the American Embassy may harden the views of powerful figures including Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, who argue that the United States should not aid China's efforts to seek prestige through membership in the group that sets the rules of world trade.
Senator Lott has said he opposes China's entry because of Beijing's alleged espionage efforts and human rights abuses. For its part, the AFL-CIO has vowed to oppose the deal for fear that American jobs will be lost.
"Before the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, it was very optimistic for the Administration to think they could get this together before the summer," said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who has been leading the effort in the Senate to get China into the trade group and whose constituents export farm products to Asia. Now, he said, "it's much harder."
"But to a great extent," he said, "this is now in the hands of the Chinese."
Senator Baucus is among many inside and outside the Administration who are critical of President Clinton's decision to walk away from the market-opening concessions that Mr. Zhu offered last month in everything from agriculture to foreign ownership of cellular phone concerns. Had a deal been initialed then, Mr. Baucus argues, it would probably be far less vulnerable today.
It is too early to tell, some Clinton aides say, whether the President himself harbors second thoughts about not having closed an agreement while Mr. Zhu was here.
By some accounts, Mr. Clinton castigated a few of his advisers after Mr. Zhu's visit, saying that while the President was focused on Kosovo, his aides should have been finding ways to quickly close the negotiating gap.
That outburst led to a last-minute effort to rescue a deal. Mr. Clinton's called Mr. Zhu in New York on April 13, offering to send negotiators to Beijing immediately to finish up the talks. They arrived days after Mr. Zhu's return but ran into obstacles.
Chinese negotiators, under attack at home for giving so much away, floated suggestions that the 14-page list of Chinese concessions that the Administration published during Mr. Zhu's visit was no longer on the table. The American team returned home empty-handed. In the aftermath of the Belgrade bombing, it is unclear whether they will return to Beijing next week as scheduled.
"What we're hoping," one official said, "is that the anti-American protests run their course and Zhu can proceed with his reforms." In that case, the reforms would include the kind of opening of markets that entry into the trade group would require.
But it is a chancy bet. And if it turns out that the embassy bombing was a turning point -- that the deal within Mr. Clinton's grasp a month ago has become part of the collateral damage of the Kosovo conflict -- then the effects could be serious and lasting. For the deal was less about trade than about gloabl strategy, accommodating China's rising economic power to a world system in which Beijing still feels treated as an outsider.
"This is a case where they probably could have gotten it through Congress," said Nicholas Lardy, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. "Whether they could get the same deal right now is highly uncertain."
But Mr. Lardy noted that while China suspended various talks with the United States today, it did not withdraw from the trade talks.

HEADLINE: Candidates Falling Into the Open Arms Of High Technology

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 10

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore makes a point in his Seattle visits of stopping at Internet companies like Amazon.com, the on-line commerce pioneer. Other Presidential hopefuls, including Senator John McCain, Representative John R. Kasich and former Senator Bill Bradley, have recently toured Microsoft's campus here.
So far Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has not come near either Seattle or Silicon Valley in Northern California. But that did not stop a group of high-technology executives from taking out a newspaper advertisement in The San Jose Mercury News last month, calling Mr. Bush one of the "visionary leaders who understand the New Economy" and urging him to run for President. 
 The dance is on between Presidential candidates and high-technology executives, who were once regarded as bit players in campaign finance and whose industry in turn prided itself on its libertarian streak and almost dismissive attitude toward whatever was happening in Washington, D.C. Facing a host of tax and regulatory issues, and with the landmark Microsoft antitrust case serving as a powerful reminder that Federal officials can still sway the competitive landscape, many industry executives are clearly deciding that it pays to have friends in the White House and Capitol.
Mr. Gore, who has long sought to position himself as the Administration's champion of computer technology and the Internet, has extensive contacts in the industry and pulled in roughly $400,000 last month at a Silicon Valley fund-raiser given by John Doerr, a founder of Technology Network, widely known as Technet, the prime lobbying and fund-raising organization of the industry.
But Mr. Gore's competitor for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Bradley, who spent a year as a visiting professor at Stanford University in which he nursed his own Silicon Valley contacts, has also done well, taking in about $1 million at a large San Francisco fund-raiser last month that was well-populated with industry executives.
And Governor Bush, though pledged to stay in Texas until the end of the legislative session this spring, is planning big fund-raisers for San Francisco and Palo Alto in early summer. Among those who signed the recent pro-Bush newspaper advertisement, which praised the Republican Mr. Bush for "creating an environment that stresses personal responsibility over government intervention, and innovation over regulation," were James Barksdale, founder of Netscape; Bob Herbold, chief operating officer of the Microsoft Corporation; Jeff Henley, chief financial officer of the Oracle Corporation, and Steve Behm, a vice president of Cisco Systems.
It is still early in the campaign cycle, but it is already certain that computer-industry donations will be a bigger factor in the 2000 elections than they have previously been.
"Unless high-tech people unplug their telephones, sign off E-mail and leave the country in the next 18 months, they're going to give more than they've ever given before," said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign finances. "They're certainly being hit up like never before."
Contributions to 1998 Congressional campaigns from the high-tech industry totaled about $8.1 million, more than twice as much as the total in the 1994 campaigns. Even as industry contributions will continue to grow in 2000, they will probably still be well below the dollars spent by other industries, like energy and banking, that have had large lobbying and campaign-donation operations in place for a long time.
Microsoft, whose total campaign contributions in 1998, $1 million, were more than triple its 1996 contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, is planning to have a major presence in the 2000 campaign. (The contributions include individual giving by company employees, political action committee donations and so-called soft money, which is given to the political parties rather than the candidates.)
A Microsoft spokesman, Greg Shaw, said the company acknowledged it was "a little slow in recognizing the importance of being a more visible and more active participant in Washington," but was now intent on "sharing its views and experience" with policy leaders there.
For the Presidential aspirants, the booming industry is not just an obvious source of money. It is also the creator of technology that they are intent on understanding, since it could be vital to their campaigns.
The number of American households with Internet access has doubled to nearly 44 million since the last Presidential election, according to Forrester Research Inc., a company that monitors technology trends. Candidates are already trying to use the World Wide Web to attract voters, with sites that offer video clips, questionnaires and invitations for visitors to "get involved" by volunteering to work for the campaign, donating money or at least signing up for regular E-mail updates.
For the high-technology executives, there is a growing array of reasons to want good friends in Congress or the White House. They have already won legislation creating a moratorium on taxes for Internet commerce, special visas for skilled foreign workers and an extension of tax credits for research and development, though they have had only minor success so far in measures to limit lawsuits for problems related to the year 2000 computer glitch.
Still, while the more established interests in the relatively young computer industry, like Microsoft and America Online, are getting increasingly involved in the political process, many newer Internet companies and their top executives do not show significant signs of doing so, even as their stock prices have climbed so high that their market value has eclipsed that of huge companies in other industries.
"When you're Amazon.com," said Wade Randlett, Democratic political director of Technet, the industry group, "you're a new company and you're trying to grow at 50 percent a quarter and your competitors are trying to kill you -- that just doesn't allow you to devote a lot of time to anything else."
A spokesman for Amazon.com, Bill Curry, said the company had recently designated a person on the legal staff to monitor public-policy issues related to the Internet, and was evaluating whether the company needed to do a better job of establishing contact with public officials.
"We want to avoid the mistake of being so focused on building a business that some day we find out we need relationships in Washington and we don't have any," Mr. Curry said.
Calculating the precise impact the high-technology industry is having on the 2000 campaign is difficult. The most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission, for instance, show contributions by individuals through March 31 and do not reflect big fund-raisers held by both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley in the San Francisco Bay Area last month.
The commission reports show Mr. Gore with about $83,000 in direct contributions from executives at high-technology companies, but they do not show the roughly $400,000 he pulled in at the fund-raiser given by Mr. Doerr, a leading industry venture capitalist.
Many computer companies, which had little presence in Washington in the past, have set up political action committees for corporate giving that are expected to make major contributions to candidates or the national parties as the campaign heats up.
Moreover, while many computer companies applaud the Federal lawsuit against Microsoft, in which a ruling is expected this summer, and thus may have a reason to reward Mr. Gore, the case is also a reminder that the Government has the potential to wield enormous power in shaping the industry, all the more reason for computer executives to take an interest in campaigns.
The Microsoft antitrust battle is an obvious reason for anyone in the industry to pay more attention to Washington, even as the company says the case does not belong in a Federal courtroom.
"A few of our competitors decided that Washington, D.C., was a place where they could out-compete us on issues that in our view would have been better resolved in the marketplace," said Mr. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesman.
As Microsoft has become far more active in both making campaign contributions and deploying lobbyists, and tried to fend off a lawsuit pushed by a Democratic Administration, there is no question that the Republican Party has benefited.
About two-thirds of the company's total contributions last year went to Republicans. In 1992, just 20 percent of them did.
And Republican Presidential candidates, including Senator McCain of Arizona and Representative Kasich of Ohio, have traveled to Microsoft recently to meet with top officials.
Microsoft executives said that the company was "steadfastly bipartisan" and that increases on the Republican side were attributable to the party's having taken control of Congress in 1994. Across the industry in general, many executives are not particularly partisan, meaning that either party could make inroads.
"More than anything else, Silicon Valley is on the 50-yard-line of the political spectrum," Mr. Randlett of Technet said. "It's strongly free-market, free trade, pro-economic growth. And it's pro-choice, pro-public education and pro-environment, with the same if not greater fervor than the belief in free-market philosophy. Whichever candidate is most centrist is going to do best here."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: DIPLOMACY;
EMBASSY BOMBING MAY BADLY IMPEDE KOSOVO DIPLOMACY

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to inflict long-term damage on an already-troubled relationship between the United States and China, officials said today.
Although Clinton Administration officials were confident at first that the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the Chinese Government may delay a United Nations Security Council resolution requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior Administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a proposed diplomatic settlement of the conflict. 
 The Chinese signaled today that they would try to obstruct the Administration's diplomatic strategy by demanding that NATO first halt its bombing against Yugoslavia before the Security Council could consider any other action on Kosovo.
Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, announced a partial withdrawal of his forces from Kosovo, a move that may be intended to take advantage of the turmoil caused by the Chinese incident and to splinter support within NATO for the American-led bombing campaign.
He did not specify the number of troops involved, and NATO and Pentagon officials said they saw no signs of a pullout. Page A10. President Clinton insisted that Mr. Milosevic had to meet all of NATO's conditions.
At the United Nations today, the Chinese representative, Qin Huasun, said suspending the air strikes was an essential precondition for any discussion by the Security Council on Kosovo. "Anything short of that is impossible for the Security Council to discuss any plan to solve the problem,' he said.
China also announced today that it was suspending high-level military ties and a number of ongoing talks about issues the Administration sees at the heart of the American-Chinese relationship, including human rights.
The bombing may also imperil an important overture, the possible entry of China into the World Trade Organization. Page A11.
Anti-Western officials in Beijing are using the embassy bombing to make their case against economic concessions that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji offered during his trip to Washington last month.
The Administration has based much of its strategy for improved relations with China on extending economic ties. Administration officials had hoped to finish negotiations in the next few months, when they believed that the Senate would be more amenable. Congress's indirect approval would be necessary for China to enter the trade organization.
But just as anti-Americanism is riding high in Beijing, anti-Chinese anger is simmering in Congress, with Senators angry over reports of Chinese efforts to steal American satellite and nuclear technology.
To try to calm China, which contends that the bombing was not a mistake, President Clinton apologized for the third time today. He sent a letter to the President, Jiang Zemin, on Sunday and publicly expressed regrets on Saturday.
"I want to say to the Chinese people and to the leaders of China, I apologize, I regret this," Mr. Clinton said in remarks before a ceremony on youth and violence at the White House.
Mr. Milosevic's announcement of a troop pullback did not say how many of his estimated 40,000 troops in Kosovo would be removed, and NATO was dismissive of the offer. Indeed, Jamie P. Shea, the NATO spokesman, suggested that the announcement could be a cover for a rotation of troops.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright dismissed the announcement as a "half measure."
Mr. Clinton said, "I'm encouraged by any good word." But he, like other NATO officials who were cautious in their reaction, insisted that other terms must be met to reach a settlement. "I think that the conditions that we set out are the minimal ones," the President added.
As the Administration worked at holding its Kosovo policy together, the Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, arrived in Beijing to talk to Chinese officials about Kosovo.
Mr. Chernomyrdin changed his travel plans and headed for Beijing.
Administration officials said they assumed that because the Russians were eager to play a predominant role in finding a solution in Kosovo, Mr. Chernomyrdin would encourage the Chinese to be amenable.
Even so, the image of senior officials of two anti-NATO countries, China and Russia, meeting over Kosovo, the place where NATO's future hangs in the balance, was unsettling for Administration officials.
But in the end, the officials said, they were confident that Mr. Chernomyrdin would ask the Chinese not to block a Security Council resolution on the international security force.
"For the Russians, the United Nations is an important venue, and it's important for them to argue back home that they've brought this issue back to the United Nations and out of the hands of NATO," a Russia expert in the Administration said. "I think their position to the Chinese is going to be: 'Don't screw up the possibility of a Security Council resolution. Let's try and get it closer to our terms.' "
After his visit to Beijing, Mr. Chernomyrdin was expected to meet in Moscow with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Wednesday to discuss details on the planned international security force.
Among the questions that need to be addressed are which countries would be represented in the force and the rules of engagement for the soldiers, State Department officials said. Just as crucial was the issue of how far Mr. Milosevic had to pull back his forces and over what period of time, so that NATO could consider a pause in the bombing.
On all these matters, there are considerable differences between the Russians and NATO. The Russians, for instance, would like a bombing pause first, before a troop withdrawal by Mr. Milosevic.
And as the allies and the Russians negotiated among themselves, Mr. Milosevic has still to be formally approached with a cohesive plan.
The aftermath of the bombing of the embassy was sure to affect the talks in Moscow, the State Department officials said. The internal struggles in the Yeltsin Government -- with anti-NATO hard-liners emboldened by the NATO mistake -- could make Mr. Talbott's mission more difficult, according to these officials.
The Security Council became a pivotal part of the solution in Kosovo last week when the seven richest industrial countries and Russia agreed to a set of principles that would end the war, including a proposed international security force.
The President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said during the weekend that he believed that the Chinese would not veto the international force, for doing so "would put them in the position of wanting to prolong the bombing and being against peace," he said.
But others were not so hopeful. "Whether the Chinese will calm down in a week or two is not at all clear," a State Department official said.

New Group Will Promote Newark Airport

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Continental Airlines and several chambers of commerce announced a coalition yesterday to promote the economic importance of Newark International Airport. The effort is being introduced as a proposed $1 billion upgrade of Continental's Newark terminal is threatened by political turmoil at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Continental and the Port Authority plan to build a third concourse at the terminal for the wide-body jets needed to handle more passengers without increasing flights, said Michele Treacy, a Continental spokeswoman. She said Continental would pay $700 million of the cost, and the Port Authority would pay the rest. 
 But like a proposed expansion at Kennedy International Airport, the Newark plan has been stalled by a dispute between Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey involving the structure of the two-state agency and lease negotiations with two shipping companies.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
Meet The Wallflowers Of Bordeaux

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

 BODY:
CAN'T afford Chateau Margaux any more? Or Chateau Latour, or Chateau Any-Other-Famous-Bordeaux? Have you thought of trying your favorite chateau's second wine?
The principal wine of any Bordeaux chateau is the one that bears its name. But every vineyard produces some grapes that are better than others. Some chateaus mix all their grapes together and ferment them into a single wine. It is a practice that is dying out, and the result is a growing class of second wines, which may not be made from the best of grapes, but do come from the finest houses. 
 They are worth knowing about because for a relatively low price -- $50 compared with $240 in one example -- you are buying the expertise of the great winemakers of the world.
Second labels are mostly a Bordeaux phenomenon, closely associated with the chateau system, although winemakers around the world have resorted to separate names for lesser wines from their principal vineyards. The difference is that outside Bordeaux, the second label doesn't have a consistent meaning.
In fact, in most places -- Italy, Spain, Latin America and California -- the second wine can be the better wine. For example, the very best cabernet sauvignon from Robert Mondavi Winery is designated a "reserve" wine to set it apart from the regular bottlings. But to confuse matters, many more California wineries use terms like "reserve," "proprietor's reserve" or "winemaker's reserve" as meaningless designations on inexpensive, commercial wines they buy in bulk. Mostly, they are just dressing up the label.
But in Bordeaux, the meaning of a second label is very specific. Few Bordeaux vineyards are a single entity surrounding the chateau whose name they bear. Many family-owned vineyards have been cut up over the years to satisfy the demands of France's draconian inheritance laws. Some chateaus have as many as 40 separate parcels of vines spread around the commune in which they are located. A map of most chateaus' vineyard holdings will look like a patchwork quilt.
Because these parcels often have different soil, different irrigation, even different microclimates, they are harvested and vinified separately. What's more, within each parcel of vines, the different grape varieties will also be picked and vinified separately.
The result is many different vats of wine. The best go into the principal wine, called the grand vin; the rest go into the second wine, also known as the second label.
Thirty years ago, when Edmund Penning-Rowsell wrote "The Wines of Bordeaux," the first important book on the subject in English, he barely mentioned second wines. The sixth edition of his book (Penguin, 1989), lists dozens of them.
Some second wines are well known. Les Forts de Latour, the second wine of Chateau Latour, is better known than the first wines of many other chateaus. So is Bahans-Haut-Brion of Chateau Haut-Brion, Pavillon Rouge of Chateau Margaux, Amiral de Beychevelle of Chateau Beychevelle and Carruades de Lafite of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild.
In Bordeaux, second wines are usually, but not always, the product of young vines. A good grapevine maintains its vigor for 35 to 40 years before it is replaced. Almost every Bordeaux chateau has sections of new or young vines whose fruit is no match for that produced by mature vines.
Similarly, different portions of a vineyard produce different quality fruit.
Some parts could have been damaged by hail, for example, while others remained untouched.
Then, too, the grapes mature at different times: merlot is usually first, followed by cabernet sauvignon and, even later, cabernet franc and petit verdot. Each variety is picked separately and fermented individually.
Even a moderate size modern chateau may have as many as 30 fermentation vats to accommodate the different batches of grapes. The blending process, called the assemblage, determines how much wine will go into the first wine and how much into the second.
At this point, economics steps in.
At a great property, owned by a Parisian banker or an insurance company, prestige will always outweigh profit. If half the year's production is deemed even slightly inferior, it will go into the second wine or will be sold off in bulk. There have been years when some chateaus deemed none of their wine good enough for the grand vin.
A lesser property, whose owner makes his living from his wine, may not be able to afford the luxury of such severe selection. Consequently, his wine is not as good as it might be were he able to reject some of his lesser vats.
Alexis Lichine, the late wine writer and owner of Chateau Prieure-Lichine in Margaux, once observed: "Rigorous selection is what really permits the large properties in Bordeaux to be very discriminating, thus enabling them to make the top wines. Selling part of your production at half-price is a discipline demanding a sacrifice that not many chateaus are willing, or can afford, to make."
For the Bordeaux-loving consumer, buying a second label is a question of perceived value. The 1995 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild currently sells in New York for about $240 a bottle. The chateau's second wine, Carruades de Lafite, sells for about $50 -- not a bad price for a wine from Lafite-Rothschild in today's overheated market.
But is the Carruades better than, say, Chateau Pichon-Baron, a grand vin also from the commune of Paui llac, and also about $50?
Sometimes, the price spread between a chateau's first and second wine is not so great. While a 1994 Chateau Haut-Brion will cost around $135 and the Bahans-Haut-Brion of the same vintage about $33, the Chateau Lagrange 1995 from St.-Julien sells for about $40 and its second wine, Les Fiefs de Lagrange, from the same year, is priced at about $25.
Obviously, the second wine of a famous chateau will have been made with all the care and skill of the first wine. Some second wines develop a passionate following of their own. But most live in the reflected glory of their famous siblings; good wines, yes, but not necessarily better than lesser-known chateaus whose first wines sell for the same prices.
Some of my own favorites among the seconds would include the Fiefs de Lagrange, mentioned above; two St.-Estephes -- Frank Phelan, the second of Chateau Phelan Segur, and Les Pagodes de Cos, the second of Chateau Cos d'Estournel -- and Clos de Marquis, the second of Chateau Leoville-Las-Cases.
The second wine of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild can be delicious, too, but it is made in tiny quantities and is rarely seen. It's called Le Petit Mouton, but there is nothing petit about it.
 
TASTINGS
RICH CHILEAN
 
Errazuriz Chardonnay Reserva 1996, Casablanca Valley, Chile. About $15.
THE Casablanca Valley is only a few miles from the Pacific Ocean, which has the same moderating effect on the vines that it does on California vineyards. But the climate and the soil, sandy loam, produce a different style chardonnay from that of California vines. The wine is intense and rich but displays less of the buttery, over-oaked quality of California chardonnays.
The weather in these Chilean vineyards was cooler than normal in 1996 and produced wines with higher acidity, a decided asset. It is, as it should be, a wine for food and not an aperitif.
The style is restrained, and while it retains its own character, it should appeal to devotees of white Burgundy.

Technology andInternet Issues Brighten Wall St.'s Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks were buffeted by a further selloff in the bond market yesterday but recovered and moved higher, led by technology and Internet shares.
Bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose to their highest level in nearly a year after an auction of new five-year notes was poorly received. Major stock market averages dipped after the auction results were announced in the afternoon but then regained some of their footing. 
 "There is still a lot of concern in the bond market about an overheated economy and what that means for inflation," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at the BankBoston Corporation. "But that concern seems to be less of an issue in the stock market."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.90 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 11,026.15. But broader market measures did appreciably better.
Buttressed by sharp gains in America Online, Wal-Mart and Cisco Systems, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.31 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,355.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index rose 40.29 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,566.68. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks increased 4.96 points, or 1.12 percent, to 446.81.
Stocks sensitive to the business cycle, which have moved sharply higher over the last month on signs of vigorous economic growth, surrendered their leadership role yesterday to the well-known, big-capitalization growth stocks that have been the market's standard bearers for a number of years.
International Paper, a Dow component, fell 2 1/4, to 53 7/8. Allied Signal, another Dow stock, fell 1 3/8, to 63 9/16 . And Georgia-Pacific fell 4 3/16 , to 56 15/16 .
By contrast, Internet stocks, which have been under selling pressure over the last few weeks, did much better yesterday.
The group was led higher by America Online, which surged after Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's influential Internet analyst, upgraded the company to "strong buy" from "outperform." Later in the session, the company announced that it would develop an Internet television service with several partners.
America Online, which was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, rose 13 1/8, to 141 7/16 .
Cisco Systems, another big company with important ties to the Internet, gained 2 5/8, to 111 7/8. After the market closed, the company posted earnings that were slightly above expectations and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Mr. Riley and other analysts said the Cisco earnings report could get technology stocks additional momentum today.
Strong earnings helped lift the price of Wal-Mart Stores, a component of both the Dow and the S.& P. 500. Wal-Mart gained 2 1/8, to 47 5/16 .
Despite the rise in interest rates, a number of financial service stocks did well.

Rising Stocks (and Wishful Thinking) in Japan

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Japan's economy may be dead in the water, but the nation is once again the land of the rising stock market. The question is, when will Japan's economy, the world's second largest, begin to justify investors' increasingly high hopes?
So far this year, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 20.96 percent in yen terms, surpassing even the Dow Jones industrial average. Anyone who invested in the Nikkei in dollars has a 13.58 percent gain for the year. Shares of small Japanese companies are doing even better than the big blue chips. 
 Pushing stock prices higher is a consensus among economists that the worst is over for Japan. Last year, the nation's gross domestic product declined 2.8 percent. In general, economists expect output to shrink only 1.5 percent this year.
Japan, which an economist says is responsible for 20 percent of the world's production of goods, has been mired in its deepest recession since the end of World War II. While some numbers and anecdotal information coming from Japan very recently have seemed positive -- consumer spending has stopped dropping, automobile sales have risen a bit -- real evidence of a rebound is scanty.
"The passage of the bank reform legislation last fall and the extra fiscal stimulus gave people confidence," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "But investors' expectations for the timetable are too optimistic."
This optimism is evident in the buckets of money pouring into Japanese stocks. According to Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, money flowing into mutual funds that invest in Japanese equities has exceeded that going into any foreign market in recent weeks. On Feb. 24, assets in Japanese equity funds totaled $1.73 billion, but have since risen to $3.02 billion, a 75 percent increase. Only a relatively small part of that increase in value comes from market gains.
Over the last month, some $77 billion a week has gone into Japanese equity funds. "Japanese inflows are the heaviest they've been since June 1997," Mr. Adler said. "Then, a nine- consecutive-week period with relatively heavy flows was brought to a screeching halt by the Thai baht collapse. Outflows started and investor sentiment hasn't recovered until now."
Many of those putting money into Japan are doing so in the belief that the economy is about to turn up. Others are probably trend-followers, jumping into whatever investment is the top performer of late. Since Japanese stock funds headed the performance lists for international mutual funds offered by United States fund companies in the first quarter of 1999, they have attracted even more attention. And now that interest rates on Japan Government bonds have dropped to 1.32 percent, Japanese investors seem to be heading into stocks, as well.
"Stock markets can be wrong," said Robert H. Parks, professor of finance at the Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace University. Mr. Parks believes that investors are mistaking low interest rates in Japan -- money market rates are close to zero -- as evidence of relatively easy monetary policy, an approach that would turn the economy around. "But low interest rates are not evidence of fiscal monetary stimulation; they are evidence of a collapsing economy," he said.
Indeed, through March 31, tax revenue was down 7.1 percent, consumer prices had fallen 3.9 percent, and residential land values in Tokyo declined 1 percent. Mr. Weinberg expects corporate earnings to be disappointing and the nation's output for 1999 to be down much more sharply than the 1.5 percent that most economists are projecting.
One of the most closely watched figures compiled in Japan is the so-called bank lending number, a report of lending activities from 19 city banks, which is due late Thursday. A rise in lending, which has been falling for almost two years, would be a harbinger of an improved economy, Mr. Weinberg said. But he suspects that lending is still on the downswing. In March, bank lending fell 3.6 percent from a year earlier; his forecast for April is a 4.1 percent drop from the 1998 period.
Mr. Weinberg said that growth in the gross domestic product does not usually show up until three to four quarters after money and credit have begun to expand. "That means that at the soonest, it will be the first quarter of 2000 before meaningful economic expansion takes place," he said. "And for that to happen, everything has to be perfect."
To try to jump-start the economy, Japanese policy makers have cut taxes and increased spending on public works. But the spending has been financed by the issuance of Government bonds, the wrong approach according to Mr. Parks, because it sops up private funds that might otherwise go to investment or consumption.
Instead, Tokyo must increase the money supply by rolling the printing presses, Mr. Parks said. Policy makers are afraid to do this for fear of pushing the yen down and inflation up. The recent 3.5 percent increase in the broad supply of money in Japan has simply been the result of consumers shifting money around, not the creation of new money, an economist said.
"I'm concerned that Japan's sovereign debt will be downgraded again if they don't shift their policies," Mr. Parks said. "And if yields on sovereign debt shoot up, what would that mean for credit demands that have collapsed as it is? Once the economic decline gains a self-reinforcing momentum, you go right into a depression."

The approach of summer's first holiday gives signs of a crowded tourist season ahead.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
STILL haven't made reservations for summer vacation? Well don't wait any longer, because the AAA auto club predicted yesterday that from Memorial Day through Labor Day (the unofficial summer season) Americans would make a record 271 million trips of at least 100 miles from home. Over Memorial Day weekend alone, a record 33.3 million people are expected to get away.
The projections for both the summer and Memorial Day represent a 4 percent increase over the respective travel numbers for 1998, a year in which overall summer travel figures jumped 7 percent from the summer of 1997. If the projections hold, this Memorial Day will be the fourth this decade to show an increase of more than one million in the number of people traveling at least 100 miles from home. 
 The projections are based on an AAA-commissioned national travel survey of 1,500 adults by the Travel Industry Association of America.
The AAA also projects that summer travelers can expect increases of slightly more than 1 percent this year in the costs of meals and lodging, for an average total of $213 a day for a family of four. By contrast, an analysis released on Monday by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Bear, Stearns & Company forecast that Americans would pay "much more" for summer travel this year over last, because of higher prices for hotels, fuel, car rentals and, possibly, domestic leisure air fares.
Whatever the cost, all parties agree that within three weeks, the roads and skies of the United States will begin filling with travelers.
 
2 Cities Add Flights
Business travelers and city officials in New Orleans and Cleveland expect to benefit mightily next month when Trans World Airlines begins a new daily nonstop on June 1 between New Orleans and Mexico City that originates in New York, and when Continental Airlines begins daily nonstop service on June 30 between Cleveland and Gatwick Airport in London.
New Orleans officials expect the T.W.A. flight to increase corporate and leisure travel to their city by millions of dollars a year, and to position New Orleans as a hub for commerce with Latin America.
Projections for the Cleveland-London flight, the first nonstop flight between Cleveland and Europe, are that it will add about $200 million a year to the economy of northeastern Ohio.
To attract the T.W.A. flight, which will be the only daily nonstop between New Orleans and Mexico City, several corporations -- including Harrah's Entertainment, which expects to open a New Orleans casino this fall -- agreed to buy an undisclosed number of tickets for an undisclosed price for a certain period. In addition, New Orleans International Airport agreed to reduce T.W.A.'s landing fees for that flight.
The Cleveland-London flight is symbolic of Continental's steady expansion at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport -- to 268 daily departures currently from 205 in 1995. But it did not hurt matters that $120 million is being spent to expand the airport, including $92 million for a concourse for Continental's regional carrier, Express Jet, scheduled to begin service on Sunday.
With aircraft flying so full over the last couple of years, it is tempting to conclude that passengers will automatically flock to each new flight. Not so. Which is why airlines often start or cancel routes, add or reduce frequencies, fly seasonal schedules and change the size of the planes used on particular routes.
 
Airline Perks
Fly first class or business class to Japan before May 31 and Japan Airlines will give you your choice of up to $300 in American Express gift checks, two free nights at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., or private car service from Narita Airport to your hotel in Tokyo.
Fly United Airlines and stay at a Hilton Hotel and you will earn points in Hilton's HHonors program and also in United's frequent-flier program, Mileage Plus. The offer is good through May 31, 2000.
 
Hotels
United States hotels won 5 of the 10 spots in Gourmet magazine's ranking of the best hotels in the world, and one of them -- the Halekulani Honolulu -- came in first The others were the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, Fla. (No. 6); the Boulders, Carefree, Ariz. (7); the Greenbrier, White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. (8) and the Phoenician, Scottsdale, Ariz. (9). The survey of the magazine's readers was conducted by the Willard & Shullman market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
The renovated 210-room Sheraton Phoenix Airport Hotel has reopened in Tempe, Ariz., with an executive club, conference center and other amenities for business travelers. In Aurora, Colo., the 157-room Hilton Garden Inn Denver Airport is open for business, with a 24-hour business center and three meeting rooms.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: REPERCUSSIONS;
Bulgarians Bet Future On a Link To NATO

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, May 8

 BODY:
For Yugoslavia's Balkan and Central European neighbors, the war in Kosovo is becoming part of a familiar pattern of casting their lot with the perceived victor.
As Europe's first hot war in half a century damages their economies and public anxiety over the conflict mounts, Governments in this region have made a kind of wager that the future after the guns fall silent will be promising only if they find themselves on NATO's side. 
 Like the other nations ringing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria has taken this course -- even as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and Danube bridges cuts this Balkan country of more than 8 million people from its markets in Western Europe and its meager export income plummets. Prospects for foreign investment, crucial for future recovery, have dimmed, and nipped a brief economic springtime in the bud.
Then, last week, the military risks of a shared border with Yugoslavia were brought home to Bulgarians, when a NATO missile tore into the attic of a home of a family of four on the outskirts of Sofia. It was the fourth NATO missile to hit Bulgarian soil. No one has been hurt.
And yet, despite all these events, a broad majority of Bulgaria's Parliament voted last Tuesday, after only five hours of debate, to make the country the latest in the region to open its airspace for NATO bombing missions, in exchange for security guarantees.
The vote was very much in line with the policies of the anti-Communist, pro-business Government that took office in 1997 to rescue Bulgaria from economic collapse. Unlike its neo-Communist predecessor, this Government and its reformist President Petar Stoyanov, elected in 1996, have pushed Bulgaria toward NATO.
Support for the alliance now is "a question of Euro-Atlantic solidarity, and choosing European values," Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said in an interview.
A failure by NATO in Kosovo, he added, would "give the right to any government to commit genocide against its people."
Mr. Kostov's arguments echoed those of Government leaders lined up against Yugoslavia and President Slobodan Milosevic, across the region where Communism once held sway. But the moral stance, opposing evil with good, masks a far more complex reality -- a gamble that may not pay off.
For the people of central and eastern Europe, torn by warfare again and again in this century, the prospect of war breeds fear.
For the last 100 years or more, they have been caught up in a pattern of inimical pact-making. From the Balkan League of pre-World War I, which bred the Balkan War pitting Bulgarians against Serbia and Greece, to the opposing alliances of the two murderous world wars and finally the nuclear standoff of NATO versus the Warsaw Pact in the cold war, they have taken sides to survive, trying to minimize the cost.
For a majority of people in the region, said Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in Sofia, "the choice, in a very practical sense, is not between good and evil, but between a lesser and greater evil."
In the case of Kosovo, he said, the lesser evil was NATO air strikes following the brutal purge of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their Kosovo homes. The greater evil, in this view, is "being isolated in a security vacuum," given NATO's post-cold-war role as the sole provider of international security in Europe, Mr. Minchev said.
To act otherwise, he said, would be "to remain on the other side of the dividing line, away from those supporting the war, who are also those supporting recovery investments after the war. That is the reason why not a single Government could resist saying 'Yes' to that kind of offer from NATO."
Choosing the lesser evil does not remove the anxiety that stems from fear of future relations in the Balkans, which could be poisoned by having taken sides against a neighbor -- in Bulgaria's case a neighbor, Serbia, with whom the ties of religion and language are close.
"Psychologically, the region is torn apart," Mr. Minchev said.
But the greater worry is that of a protracted war that causes even greater economic and human damage than has so far occurred. Such a prolonged war might seriously destabilize the fledgling democracies of the region, born out of the collapse of Communism a decade ago. New Governments emerging from that prolonged war, Mr. Minchev said, could involve political parties and movements not oriented toward democracy and a market economy -- unlike most Governments in the region now.
The immediate reality is a beleaguered Bulgarian economy facing a halving of growth this year because of the war.
Martin Zaimov, deputy head of the National Bank, counted off the economic casualties. Foreign investment was at a standstill, he said in an interview, because "people are not even willing to travel to Bulgaria -- it's not a question of investing."
With land routes to Western Europe cut in Yugoslavia and a principal waterway -- the Danube -- blocked by bombed out bridges, Bulgarian exports are collapsing. In the first quarter, export revenues dropped 26 percent against last year. Bulgarian growth this year, as a result, is expected to drop by almost half to 2 percent, he said.
Yet the most devastating effect, Mr. Zaimov said, was psychological and involved Bulgarians' "perception of the future."
"For the first time, we had managed to instill in people a reality in which they could sit back and have a longer horizon," he said. "Now, people think, 'This is war. We should sit and do nothing, but wait and see.' "
Bulgaria's political opposition, the former Communist party, seems poised to exploit the malaise. Emboldened by public discomfort with the war, the former Communists' resistance to NATO is stiffening and they publicly question the wisdom of Bulgaria casting its lot with the Western military alliance.
Historically, said Sergei Stanishev, head of the Socialist Party's International Relations Department, the nation had little luck with foreign alliances. "We were always on the losing side," he said.
Moreover, he said, his party's opposition to the war merely echoed common fears that Bulgaria would ultimately be browbeaten into allowing air or ground attacks from its territory.
"If you say a, you have to say b, till the end of the alphabet," he said.
Mr. Kostov accuses the Socialists of opposing strong measures against Mr. Milosevic out of sympathy for a fellow former Communist. Mr. Milosevic "has a totalitarian Communist regime which has sought refuge in the last haven of nationalism and chauvinism," much as Bulgaria's own Communists did in the late 1980's by oppressing and expelling the country's Turkish minority, Mr. Kostov said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE EUROPEANS;
Dependent On U.S. Now, Europe Vows Defense Push

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 11

 BODY:
Alarmed by their dependence on the United States in NATO's military campaign against Serbia, European officials vowed today to develop a strong common military policy.
Meeting in Bremen in northern Germany, defense and foreign ministers of the Western European Union, Europe's long-dormant military arm, issued a statement saying they were now committed to "the development of an effective European defense and security policy." 
 George Robertson, the British Defense Secretary, summed up the mood: "In Kosovo, we have all come face to face with the European future, and it is frightening."
The European Union has long been an economic giant and military midget, content to leave most of its security concerns to NATO. But a combination of the crisis in Kosovo, a new British readiness to contribute to a European military arm within NATO and a growing German determination to play an active security role in Europe appear to have led to a decisive shift of mood.
"With this meeting, we have taken a considerable step toward a common European security and defense policy," Rudolf Scharping, the German Defense Minister, said. "Today, we have too many institutions and too little substance."
The reference to institutional excess was clearly an allusion to the Western European Union itself, an organization of 10 European nations that belong to NATO. Several European governments, including Germany's, have concluded that the Western European Union must now be merged with the European Union as soon as possible.
This measure, combined with the appointment of a European High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, would begin to give the 15-nation European Union the means to coordinate military policies that now duplicate one another in many areas, increasing cost and diminishing effectiveness.
Several ministers said today that they hoped to push through those reforms by the end of next year.
Europe, with no equivalent to the C-5 and C-17 aircraft, is almost completely dependent on the United States for air transport of troops, an increasingly important asset when mobility rather than static ground defenses are at a premium in the aftermath of the cold war.
The continent also depends heavily on Washington for strategic reconnaissance and has lagged in the development of new military technologies like laser-guided bombs. Eager to cash in the "peace dividend" in the last decade, European governments have cut military spending to an average of about 2.1 percent of gross national product, compared with 3.2 percent in the United States.
In the Kosovo campaign, the United States, with 639 aircraft, already has more than double the number of planes of all its NATO allies combined, and is planning to send 176 more. In effect, the Europeans have been obliged to confront the extent of their dependency.
"We Europeans should not expect the United States to play a role in every disorder in our back yard," the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said recently, arguing that Europe's governments had failed to modernize armies for the post-cold-war era.
Mr. Blair played a central role in framing a joint British-French military initiative late last year. It was significant because it seemed to represent the end of a long division between a France committed to a stronger European defense arm, even at NATO's expense, and a Britain overwhelmingly committed to the Atlantic Alliance.
The accord reflected France's grudging acquiescence to the idea that Europe's defense should be developed within NATO, and Britain's realization that it had to work more closely with its European defense partners. Duplication in spending has long made Europe's military outlays much less cost-effective than those in the United States.
The defense ministers said today that a European military arm must emerge "in complementarity with the Atlantic Alliance." Mr. Scharping said recently, "The last aim is to sever the European decision-making process from NATO," adding that the intention was "to strengthen the European pillar within the alliance."
On this basis, the Clinton Administration has supported Europe's efforts to put together a more coherent military organization and force that would be able to undertake some NATO missions using American military assets but not American troops. But exactly how "a common defense policy" for Europe would work in practice remains uncertain.
What seems clear is that efforts to increase military spending will meet resistance from many Europeans, even in the aftermath of Kosovo.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Inflation Fears Continue to Lift Treasury Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates, which have risen steadily since early April, jumped to their highest level in almost a year yesterday as investors continued to worry about inflation and the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers on Tuesday.
Investors have been spooked -- at least for the time being -- by the failure of the United States economy to slow significantly and by a reminder last week from Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that inflation could become a problem again. 
 "There is a lot of fear and nervousness in the market at this juncture," said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities.
That is not because investors expect a surge in inflation this year or even that the Fed will raise interest rates next week. Instead, they are nervous because they must wait for new inflation data and the Fed meeting before determining whether the recent rise in long-term interest rates has been overdone -- in part because of Mr. Greenspan's warning -- or will push on toward 6 percent.
The surge in the yield on the 30-year bond, which rose to 5.83 percent yesterday, also cooled the stock market a bit, leaving the Dow Jones industrial average up only 18.90 points, at 11,026.15.
In another sign of nervousness yesterday, investors shrugged off the news that worker productivity rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the first quarter, an increase that was better than expected. Investors would normally find this news positive because stronger-than-expected productivity has helped keep inflation at bay.
Adding to the gloomy atmosphere was a lackluster auction of five-year Treasury notes and negative comments about the bond market from Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of George Soros's Quantum Fund. According to Bridge News, Mr. Druckenmiller told investors at a conference in London that bonds were now in a bear market and that the Fed would raise interest rates by the end of the year.
Because of the uncertainty, traders and analysts said that until the results of the Fed meeting were known, long-term rates could edge higher. And the bond market could get a worse shock if two inflation reports -- the Producer Price Index tomorrow and the Consumer Price Index on Friday -- are disappointing.
Both reports are expected to reflect the recent spike in crude oil prices, which saw the price of a barrel reach $18.98 last week, though as of yesterday it had retreated to $18.02. The unknown is whether these two inflation barometers have positive surprises -- as they did in March -- or negative ones. For this month, Wall Street is forecasting a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the producer index and a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in the consumer index.
The Government report on retail sales for April, which is due tomorrow, will also signal how fast the American consumer is still spending. Consumers are the main reason the economy has grown at a brisk 5.25 percent pace in the last six months -- a pace too fast for Fed policy makers to remain comfortable.
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said he was forecasting an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales for April. But he said investors would also keep their eyes on the revision for the March data. An upward revision of that number would add to fears that consumer spending will keep the economy chugging along too quickly and eventually force the Fed to raise interest rates, possibly by the end of the year.
The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates to slow economic growth when the Federal Open Market Committee, its policy-making panel, meets on Tuesday. But some analysts wonder if the Fed will fire a warning shot to the bond market.
To do this, the central bank could indicate with a formal directive that it thinks its next interest-rate move will most likely be an increase.
If the inflation news is not alarming and the Fed stands pat, then there is a chance for interest rates to slip a bit until the next round of data provides a clearer picture of how strong the economy is and how persistent price pressures might become.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 19/31 , to 91 26/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 percent, from 5.79 percent Monday. That was the highest yield since 5.84 percent on May 27, 1998.
The new five-year Treasury notes yielded 5.37 percent and the demand was weak, traders said.
There is a 10-year note auction scheduled for today. In when-issued trading yesterday, the yield on the 10-year note was 5.49 percent, up from 5.46 percent on Monday. The yield on the current 10-year note rose to 5.57 percent yesterday, from 5.52 percent Monday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:
 (000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Price . . . 99.493
High Yield . . . 5.367%
Low Yield . . . 5.279%

HEADLINE: Clinton Tries to Sell Executives on Inner-City Economics

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 11

 BODY:
Eager to keep his domestic agenda going, President Clinton flew here today to call for corporate investment in inner-city America and said he would tour some of the nation's pockets of poverty, which he characterized as great economic opportunities.
The tour, in July, is to be modeled on the overseas missions that Cabinet secretaries and corporate officers frequently make to help American businesses take advantage of emerging markets. Mr. Clinton said today that some of America's neglected rural and urban areas constituted such emerging markets. 
 "Our greatest untapped markets are here at home," the President said at the White House this morning after a closed-door session with 15 chief executives of major corporations. Mr. Clinton brought the executives here later for a tour of local businesses that have profited from Federal investment.
Aides said Mr. Clinton's tour was to take him to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, Indian reservations and aging industrial cities like Gary, Ind. The aides said he would try to get the executives to see the tour sites as sources of customers and make substantial investments in them. There was no immediate reaction from the executives.
The President's schedule was intended to highlight a part of the domestic agenda he laid out when he first campaigned for President, when he said repeatedly that "no one should be left behind." With the war in Kosovo, the shootings in Littleton, Colo., and other issues now dominating his time in Washington, Mr. Clinton is eager to revive this aspect of his Presidency, particularly as former Senator Bill Bradley challenges Mr. Clinton's designated heir, Vice President Al Gore, on broad questions of race and economic equality. Mr. Gore spoke extensively with the executives this morning.
Much of the United States is enjoying the biggest economic expansion in more than three decades. And Mr. Clinton noted that in particular, African-American and Hispanic residents were enjoying the lowest rates of unemployment since statistics have been kept. But he said that parts of the country had had no new investment, no new business and no new jobs and that 37 cities had unemployment rates that were double the national average.
"In the midst of all our prosperity," the President said here, he wanted to point out "both the obligation and the opportunity we have to do better."
The President's support for investment at home was inspired by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's pleadings in the last year to Wall Street to encourage private investors, said Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's economic adviser. Mr. Jackson was not with Mr. Clinton today but is supposed to be part of the July tour.
Mr. Clinton spent his day emphasizing that people in poor areas could succeed if someone invested in those areas and if they are aided by federally sponsored tax credits, loan guarantees and technical support. He is also proposing $1 billion in tax credits for businesses in poor areas.
He brought the executives with him here on Air Force One for a round-table discussion staged between stalls at a historic farmers' market. He talked about tax incentives for empowerment zones, areas in the inner city earmarked for economic initiatives, but not before cruising for munchies and coming up with some coffee and sweet potato cheesecake.
"I have lifted things from almost every entrepreneur here," the President said with a laugh. He said the woman who gave him the cheesecake "destroyed my diet today -- and I loved every bite of it."
The market, the Sweet Auburn Curb Street Market, is in Southeast Atlanta's first black commercial district, not far from the home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In operation since 1923, the market has fallen on hard times over the years and has been aided with more than $8 million in Federal financing.
The market now employs about 800 people in 24 shops. The President was intrigued by a bin of cows feet and pig ears, recalling that when President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia visited him in Washington, he presented Mr. Clinton with a roasted pig and cut off the ear, telling Mr. Clinton that he would eat it if he were a true Russian.
Many shop owners said business was slow as the executives made their way through the market. The corporate delegation included representatives from Bell South, Aetna, American Airlines, Goldman Sachs, the Rite Aid Corporation, AT&T Wireless, Delta Air Lines, Bankers Trust and New York Life.
The corporation chieftains said they supported Clinton's plans.
Richard Huber, head of Aetna, said his company already employed residents from low-income areas and trained them to sell insurance tailored to low-income consumers. The goal, Mr. Huber said, is to "get in there and really penetrate these communities."

HEADLINE: Have Funds, Could Run;
Unknown but Rich, Corzine Becomes a Top Contender for Senate

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
When Goldman Sachs Group went public last week, its former chairman, Jon S. Corzine, became a very rich man. He also effectively became unemployed. Having lost a power struggle earlier this year, Mr. Corzine ended his formal relationship with the Wall Street firm once the public offering was completed.
But it didn't take him long to rebound. By week's end, Mr. Corzine was in Atlantic City for a conference of New Jersey's Democratic Party, using his gentle Midwestern charms to audition for a job even his closest associates never realized he wanted: United States Senator. 
 "I've always been interested in public service," Mr. Corzine (the last syllable of his name rhymes with "pine") said in his hoarse, whispery voice between handshakes at the conference, where few people knew what he looked like but almost everyone had heard estimates of his net worth. (More than $300 million). "I actually care."
To the surprise of many New Jersey Democrats, Mr. Corzine, has emerged as a leading contender in a crowded Democratic field to replace Senator Frank G. Lautenberg, the three-term Democrat who plans to retire next year. Virtually unknown in state political circles, Mr. Corzine, a 52-year-old native of Illinois who now lives in Summit, N.J., has leaped ahead of more seasoned politicians largely on the strength of his fortune, which he has vowed to use lavishly on a campaign.
But he has also been quietly promoted by a coterie of influential Democrats, many of them close to Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who do not want the nomination to go to the best organized of the Democratic candidates, former Gov. Jim Florio. Those Democrats say Mr. Florio, while capable of winning a primary, will certainly lose in a general election, particularly if his opponent is Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican who ousted him as governor in 93.
Though Mr. Torricelli says it is premature for him to back anyone, he came close to endorsing Mr. Corzine in an interview today. "For the Democratic Party in New Jersey and the Democratic caucus in the Senate to have a candidate from the most prestigious banking house in the world has some merit," he said. "This is a guy who can speak on economic and tax issues with some authority. And that is going to be appealing to many Democrats in New Jersey."
Mr. Corzine's supporters are now trying to winnow the field of other candidates and unify leaders from the state's populous northern counties behind the investment banker. They are hoping to set up a one-on-one primary against the tenacious Mr. Florio, who has the support of seven southern county chairmen. A crowded Democratic field, Mr. Corzine's advisers say, will benefit Mr. Florio.
Though the other candidates, including Representative Frank Pallone of Long Branch; Michael Murphy, a former Morris County Prosecutor, and Thomas Byrne, a former state party chairman, say they have no plans to drop out, many party leaders think the pressure on them to step aside will be intense if Mr. Corzine formally jumps in.
"This issue of his money is going to be pretty daunting to the other candidates," said Thomas P. Giblin, the state Democratic chairman, who has met with Mr. Corzine several times but remains neutral in the race.
But while Mr. Corzine's immense wealth may win him fans among some political leaders, some Democrats worry that it could also offend Democratic primary voters who might view it as evidence that he is out of touch with them.
Though he does not plan to make an official announcement for several days, Mr. Corzine has told friends he plans to run, and in an interview last Friday, he said he was leaning strongly in that direction. Two things could hold him back, friends say: opposition from his family and a desire to start a business. Asked about his wife's feelings, Mr. Corzine replied, "She's not opposed."
But in the meantime, he has taken firm steps toward starting a campaign. He has hired Doug Schoen, who does polling for President Clinton, to measure public support for Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman. He has talked to Robert Shrum, the veteran Democratic media consultant, about working on the campaign. And he has recruited a former state director for Mr. Lautenberg, Christy Davis, to help him meet New Jersey Democratic officials.
Yet for all his immense wealth and growing support, Mr. Corzine is not a shoo-in, even among the anti-Florio forces. Though he has given nearly $1 million to the Democratic Party over the past decade, almost none of that money went to New Jersey candidates, leaving him with no base of support in the state.
And unlike Mr. Lautenberg, another rich businessman-turned-politician, Mr. Corzine has not been active in local politics, has not run for office and even failed to vote on numerous occasions. Many of his critics think Mr. Corzine is running solely because Mr. Torricelli nudged him into it.
More important to many Democrats, Mr. Corzine must answer some fundamental questions about what he stands for and whether an untested candidate like him can endure the strain of a long campaign. Last weekend, many Democrats were openly wondering whether the party of urban poor and organized labor should endorse a wealthy banker who lives in the suburbs and who ran a Wall Street firm known for helping big companies gobble up smaller ones.
"There's a concern about sending the wrong message," said Paul M. Bangiola, chairman of the Morris County Democratic Committee, who is leaning toward supporting Mr. Murphy. "He's charming. But the rich guy rap is a tough one to overcome."
In perhaps the surest sign that Mr. Corzine is viewed in some quarters as the man to beat, labor supporters of other Democratic candidates have begun circulating a memo asserting that under Mr. Corzine, Goldman Sachs helped finance mergers and acquisitions that led to the layoffs of 74,000 workers.
"Do we really need another multimillionaire businessman in politics?" asked Jimmy Tarlau, president of the Mercer County Labor Union Council, who favors Mr. Pallone. "If it's between him and Florio, I think I'd have to support Florio. At least I know what Florio stands for."
Mr. Corzine's supporters have worked hard to paint a different picture of the candidate. They describe him as a modest farm boy who has been New Deal Democrat all his life. Though he owns a summer home on Long Island's East End, he has also contributed $2 million to help poor minority students attend parochial schools in New York City, and millions more to support public libraries and the performing arts. As co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, they say, he helped create more jobs than were lost through mergers and takeovers.
And though he has never run for office, he has taken a keen interest in public policy, including advising Vice President Al Gore on global economic issues. Mr. Corzine has also been a major fund-raiser for Mr. Gore.
Mr. Corzine bristles at suggestions that he is trying to buy the race, saying he will win on the strength of his ideas for improving education, expanding economic opportunity and restricting gun sales -- though he is not ready to discuss specific proposals.
"This whole gun-control issue, which is easier to make a case about today than it might have been two weeks ago, I think is one somebody ought to really put their neck on the line about," he said in Atlantic City.
Mr. Corzine grew up on a 120-acre farm in Willys Station, Ill. (pop. 17), where his father grew corn and soybeans. His mother taught first and second grade in public schools.
As a freshman at the University of Illinois he was one of just 2 walk-ons, out of 225 candidates, to make the varsity basketball team -- a story his supporters offer as evidence of his determination. But he did not play a minute, and quit during his sophomore year. "A 6-2 forward just doesn't cut it in the Big Ten," he said.
In his senior year, he married a woman he had known since first grade, Joanne Dougherty. The couple, who settled in Summit in the 1970's, have three children.
After college, Mr. Corzine joined the Marine Corps reserves, mainly, he acknowledged, to avoid the draft, and earned a business degree from the University of Chicago. In 1975, he joined Goldman Sachs and became chief executive in 1994.
At Goldman, Mr. Corzine was known for having a cool head and sharp analytical mind in the risky business of bond trading. As he rose through the corporate ranks, he also gained a reputation as an accessible manager and effective consensus builder, traits his supporters say would make him a fine Senator.
"He is not a lone ranger," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice president for Goldman Sachs International. "He works well with people."
Mr. Corzine has clearly succeeded on one front: convincing Democratic leaders that, for all his money, he is a regular guy. Tall, lean and balding, with a thick graying beard and mitt-like hands, Mr. Corzine speaks in a soft, slow, serene voice that seems reassuringly down home.
"To be honest, I was surprised," said Joseph A. Ferriero, chairman of the Bergen County Democratic committee. "I expected a high-powered, obnoxious guy, and was confronted with the opposite. He was warm and personable, with absolutely no air of arrogance."
But Mr. Corzine acknowledged that he has much to do to sell himself to New Jersey's skeptical politicians and wary electorate.
"I'm an underdog," he said. "I don't enter this under any preconception that this is anything other than a very difficult thing to accomplish."

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks $6 Billion in Work on Schools

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 11

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman put forward a bill today that promises $6 billion in state money to build and repair schools throughout New Jersey, but some worry there may not be enough money in future budgets to pay for the huge construction program.
All districts, regardless of their wealth, would be able to participate in Governor Whitman's program, but it was not clear how the state would end up paying for it. 
 Mrs. Whitman has identified two annual revenue streams: $62 million from the new "Big Game" lottery and $50 million in cigarette tax revenue. But those cash sources may not be enough. It is estimated that over the 5- to- 10-year life of the program, the cost to the state would be about $400 million annually.
Since it will take a few years for the program to become established, it is not likely that the Governor will be faced with paying the biggest part of the construction bill before her term expires in 2002.
State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr. said that in the future, revenues from the state's general fund -- or some other source -- might be needed to help finance the plan.
Governor Whitman's new school construction bill gives schools more flexibility than previously proposed to use state funds to build new schools. Only those districts that receive more than 50 percent of their financing from the state will be required to use the New Jersey Building Authority for their projects. Other districts have the option of using the authority or a low-interest loan from the state.
State officials have built incentives in the plan to encourage districts to use the Building Authority. They say that by coordinating labor resources and economies of scale, the authority could reduce project costs as much as 25 percent.
Governor Whitman's bill would also increase the square footage allowed for new buildings. Elementary schools would be allowed up to 125 square feet per pupil, middle schools up to 131 square feet per pupil and high schools up to 151 square feet per pupil. School officials had complained that the state's initial size allowances were too small.
In an action affecting some of the neediest schools, Education Commissioner David C. Hespe announced today that he intended to provide $37 million more in state money to pay for special programs in eight of the poorest school districts. But that $37 million represents a small share of the $295 million that 16 districts originally asked for.
Under court order, the state is required to provide additional money to its poorest districts to help needy students overcome their educational disadvantages. Local districts can ask the state to pay for items like social services, teacher aides and extended-day preschool programs.
Sixteen of the 28 "special needs" districts submitted supplemental requests totaling $295 million. Two were disqualified for "failing to document need," Mr. Hespe said. Two others were later withdrawn.
David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center, which represents poor children in the school-financing battle, said he had not heard a good explanation for how state officials could "chop off 90 percent of what was asked for" from the districts.
Mr. Hespe said the department used a twofold standard in determining who should get supplemental aid: The requests had to be for a program that is deemed essential to meet the state's constitutional obligation to provide a "thorough and efficient" education, and districts had to show a need for the money.
Mr. Hespe said that New Jersey was already spending more per pupil in its poorest districts "than any major East Coast city."
Michael Azzara, the Education Department's assistant commissioner for finance, said that after initial meetings with the districts, $76.3 million worth of requests were voluntarily withdrawn.
But Mr. Sciarra said he believed the districts were pressured into dropping their requests for more money or risk losing other program aid.

HEADLINE: State Senate Republicans Seek to Drop Commuter Tax

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Saying that New York City should share its record surplus with suburban residents, Republican leaders in the State Senate announced yesterday that they would vote next week to abolish the commuter tax paid by suburbanites who work in the city.
On its surface, the plan is an unusual act of rebellion against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a fellow Republican who is close to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader. The tax is an important source of revenue for the city, delivering about $360 million a year, and Mr. Giuliani wants to continue it. 
 But Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, pointed out yesterday that the city is benefiting from a $2.1 billion surplus, and that Mr. Giuliani has proposed $405 million in tax cuts for city residents. The Senator said it was only fair to provide similar benefits to the 450,000 residents of suburban counties in New York State who pay the commuter tax.
"We think that it's very productive," Mr. Bruno said of the proposal, speaking to reporters in Albany. "It just gives people more spendable income."
Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he favored cutting taxes, so he would look carefully at the plan. But it is unlikely that the Assembly, which is dominated by New York City Democrats, would agree to abolish the tax, which was introduced in 1966. Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, would not comment on the proposal yesterday.
But the Senate has some leverage, because much of the commuter tax revenue comes from a temporary surcharge that the Legislature added in 1971, which is set to expire at the end of this year. Both houses must agree to reauthorize it, so if the Senate refused, the surcharge would be eliminated.
The Senate proposal would repeal the commuter tax only for residents of New York State, who pay about $208 million of the roughly $360 million in revenues. The remaining 42 percent of the money comes mostly from New Jersey and Connecticut commuters. A total of 769,000 suburbanites pay the tax, a Senate spokesman said.
Aides to Mr. Giuliani, who is seriously considering a run for the United States Senate and trying to win support in upstate New York, were subdued in their response to Mr. Bruno's plan. The Mayor said in a statement that he was against repealing the tax, but he avoided any criticism of the State Senate.
Other city officials wondered why Mr. Bruno would antagonize Mr. Giuliani, and they theorized that he was supporting the measure only because he knew it would die in the Assembly.
The officials speculated that Senate leaders were pushing the repeal only to help the Republican candidate, Thomas Morahan, for a highly prized Senate seat in Rockland and Orange Counties. Both Mr. Morahan, and his Democratic opponent, Kenneth Zebrowski, have called for abolishing the commuter tax.
Senate approval of the measure could help Mr. Morahan, but more important, it could hurt Democratic Assembly members from the suburbs in the next round of elections. Their Republican opponents could point out that the Assembly foiled efforts to repeal the tax, raising the ire of suburban voters.
Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Long Island who is sponsoring the measure, suggested that Democratic legislators from the suburbs could suffer if the Assembly did not approve the repeal.
"The Senate will pass the bill next week," Mr. Skelos said. "The question is, will the Assembly Democrats be able to meet the challenge?
But Mr. Skelos dismissed another theory raised by some Assembly members: that the Senate would ultimately agree to continue the tax if the Assembly agreed to raise taxes in Nassau County, which is experiencing a fiscal crisis. Mr. Skelos, who is from Nassau County, said county leaders had not requested a tax increase, so the Senate was not considering it.
Asked why the Senate Republicans would risk angering Mr. Giuliani, with whom they have formed a close alliance, Mr. Skelos was blunt.
"He's done a great job of turning his economy around, but now it's time to give suburban commuters a break," he said. "He has the right to his opinions, but we in Albany are the ones that have the vote."

HEADLINE: String of Rocket Mishaps Worries Industry

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
America's space rockets seem to be failing, blowing up or losing payloads at an alarming rate that has experts questioning the prowess of an increasingly competitive satellite launching industry.
In the last nine months, there have been six significant failures of United States rockets trying to put civilian and military payloads into orbit. The mishaps, involving both older, usually reliable rockets and newly designed vehicles, have resulted in losses totaling $3.5 billion and shaken confidence in the ability of the United States to launch space missions, including crucial communications and spy satellites. 
 Engineers studying the problem say they cannot tell if the recent difficulties are just bad luck or signs of systemic problems in the launching business. A number of explanations have been floated to explain the string of disasters, ranging from an over-reliance on computer models in place of flight testing to the pressures to do more for less money.
"The performance we've demonstrated since last August is unacceptable, to us and to our customers," said Peter B. Teets, the president and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin, whose rockets are responsible for the loss of four satellites since August. "The worst impact on morale is losing a mission. We have good people who are not feeling very well right now.".
John F. Willacker of the Aerospace Corporation, a private consulting and engineering research company based in El Segundo, Calif., said the nation's space launching industry was suffering from being under the competing pressures of flying more rockets at less cost while also trying to introduce new boosters that are even more economical.
The satellite launching business is booming, with an unprecedented number of customers in science, communications and other industries clamoring to get their payloads into space. At the same time, there is great pressure to reduce the cost of launchings, with American companies forced to compete with low-cost launching services being offered by Europe's Ariane rockets and boosters available in Russia and China.
"The industry is a little stretched, and this pressure is contributing to some systematic problems," Mr. Willacker, head of the consulting company's space launching operations, said in an interview. "I have a hard time believing there can be this much bad luck in a row without there being some common threads. We must find them and straighten them out."
Meanwhile, the troubles are causing apprehension for rocket users as well as flight delays while engineers sort out the problems to determine whether future missions are in danger. With some three dozen military and civilian launchings scheduled from the United States in 1999, this is a particularly busy year for the American launching industry, which in a typical year might have 20 to 25 launchings of unmanned booster rockets.
The Air Force has indefinitely postponed the flight of a giant Titan 4 rocket, which has failed three times in its last three launchings and which was to carry a secret spy satellite into space early this month from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. This delay, in turn, prevents the scheduled launching of an older rocket, the Titan 2, from an adjacent pad. The Titan 2 is supposed to place a NASA science spacecraft called Quikscat in orbit.
And NASA, which oversaw none of the six failures, has pushed back the scheduled July 22 flight of the space shuttle Columbia, which is to carry the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. An attached booster rocket that is to drive the observatory into its final orbit is the same type as one that malfunctioned last month.
The space agency is going ahead with plans for a July launching of Terra, a billion-dollar satellite that is the flagship of NASA's Earth Observing System to monitor global changes, even though the upper stage of its carrier rocket, a Centaur, is identical to one that misfired last month and doomed a military communications satellite. But a spokesman said NASA was monitoring military investigations to see if it uncovered problems that might affect the launching of the Terra.
The string of mishaps began last Aug. 12 when a Titan 4, the most powerful rocket used by the military, exploded 41 seconds after liftoff, destroying an $800 million communications intelligence satellite along with the $340 million rocket. An Air Force review board blamed damaged electrical wires that had not been detected before the flight.
The two other Titan 4 setbacks, at a cost of about $1 billion each, occurred in April, apparently for dissimilar reasons. On April 9, an upper stage deployed from the Titan as expected, but apparently parts of it failed to separate properly between multiple firings, putting a missile warning satellite in a useless orbit. This booster, made by the Boeing Company and called the Inertial Upper Stage, is the same type that is to propel the Chandra observatory.
And on April 30, a different upper stage, the Centaur, malfunctioned and put a military communications satellite in an orbit thousands of miles too low, where it is doubtful it can ever be used.
The trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its May 10 issue that the Centaur went awry nine minutes into the mission because of inaccuracies in computer flight software from the rocket's maker, the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The software was loaded before the flight, and problems went undetected by the company's normal verification process, the report said.
Botched launchings also affected these civilian space missions:
*On Aug. 26, Boeing's new Delta 3 rocket exploded 71 seconds after liftoff on its maiden voyage, destroying the Galaxy 10 communications satellite in a $225 million disaster caused by a design error in its first-stage guidance system.
*On April 27, the Athena 2, a relatively new small rocket made by Lockheed Martin, failed to place a private earth-imaging satellite into orbit after launching from the Vandenberg base A 1,300-pound protective payload shroud failed to separate from the $25 million rocket, dragging the satellite back down into the atmosphere, where it burned up.
*On May 4, the second stage of another Delta 3 rocket did not fire long enough after restarting in space, putting a $145 million Orion communications satellite into a lopsided orbit thousands of miles too low to be useful. Controllers are looking into ways to salvage some of the $230 million mission by using the satellite's internal fuel to nudge it higher.
The Air Force announced on May 6 that it and the National Reconnaissance Office, which deploys spy satellites, would conduct a broad review of military launching capability and the Titan failures. Lockheed Martin, which makes the Titans, as well as the Centaur upper stage and the Athena rocket, also announced it was appointing an independent panel of experts to examine the procedures of its rocket business.
Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, who is commander of the United States Space Command, said the loss of three new military satellites since August because of launching failures did not jeopardize current military operations but could affect future readiness if problems are not corrected.
"Because these failures have cost us a great deal in financial terms and in future mission capability, we are working hard to identify their causes," General Myers said in a statement.
Mr. Teets of Lockheed Martin said: "My gut feeling is that we're having a very unlucky period right now and that our basic operations are sound. But we want this outside committee to see if there is something going on here, something fundamental, that we can't see on a case-to-case basis."
Gale Schluter, executive vice president of Boeing's rocket systems division, said troubles with the new Delta 3 appeared to be birthing problems of a largely new design and not a breakdown in normal operations at the company. Mr. Schluter noted that Boeing's smaller, older Delta 2 had accumulated a 97.5 percent success rate over 10 years, showing that the company knew how to produce quality rockets.
"We are looking at the Delta 3 comprehensively," he said, "We want to understand the two failures better and deal with them."
Mr. Willacker of the Aerospace Corporation said the rocket business suffered from too few experienced engineers and technicians, particularly those at midcareer, who were being stretched across too many projects.
A dearth in hiring in the industry in the early 1980's has resulted in a cadre of well-educated new engineers in their 20's and early 30's and a seasoned group over age 55 who are approaching retirement, Mr. Willacker said, but few in the gap between these clusters.
Another problem, he said, is an over-reliance on computer simulation and modeling in creating new products and a reduction in testing actual hardware.
"Historically, you would build test aircraft or rockets and fly them before you commit to production," Mr. Willacker said. "We seem to have convinced ourselves that we don't need that luxury today, and it shows."
Boeing, Mr. Schluter said, does a lot of testing of components and subsystems and is highly confident of its results, but he acknowledged that this analytical approach "gets risky" when used for a complete vehicle. This has led to discussion over firing test rounds of new rockets without paying cargo, an expensive prospect for the manufacturer, Mr. Schluter said.
"Customers will have to make risk assessments and trade that against the price of early missions," he said.
Mr. Willacker of the Aerospace Company said that his group kept a database on all space flights and found that there had been about 60 significant launching failures since 1990.
"When looking for common factors, we were somewhat surprised," he said. "We worry a lot about electronics and computers, but the most prominent factors were hardware -- propulsion and ordinance systems."
This means rocket engines and fuel systems with their varied manufactured parts, he said, and explosive bolts, springs and other mechanisms for separating rocket stages.
"These are the kinds of things we should know how to make and operate well," Mr. Willacker said, "It's manufacturing and quality control. Not a lot of this is real rocket science."
Several space historians said the recent run of ill fortune reminded them of a period in the mid-1980's when everything seemed to go wrong. The calamities included the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, in which the seven-member crew died; the back-to-back failures of two Titan rockets and the destruction of a pair of military reconnaissance satellites; and an Atlas rocket being struck by lightning in flight, destroying a Navy satellite.
"Space launch vehicles are inherently unreliable, and people should understand that this is still risky business," said John E. Pike, an expert on civilian and military space programs with the Federation of American Scientists. "I'm prepared to believe we have had an extraordinary run of bad luck, but when you have something like the Titan 4 failures, where there have been three in a row, you wonder if it's more than bad luck."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Seeks Deal to Sell 63 Gardens to Land Group and End Suits

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Faced with three lawsuits and the kind of bad publicity that comes when protesters are willing to risk arrest for the sake of lilacs and tomato plants, the Giuliani administration is trying to strike a settlement with various environmental groups opposed to its plan to auction off public lots that are used as community gardens.
A senior administration official said yesterday that after several weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations, the city was working on a deal to sell 63 parcels -- scheduled to be auctioned off tomorrow -- to a private conservation group called the Trust for Public Land. The sales price is $3 million, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and whose account was verified by others close to the discussions. 
 It was unclear last night precisely which parcels were included in the proposal, although the city official said that they were not ones that the city considered feasible for "economic development or housing." There are 112 community gardens scheduled to be sold at auction; even if a settlement is reached, dozens of gardens would still be put up for sale.
All parties acknowledged that any agreement faces significant hurdles, particularly the city's demand that, as the city official put it, "all the lawsuits go away." Rose Harvey, the senior vice president for the trust, said last night that her organization is interested solely in a real estate transaction and is not involved in any way in the lawsuits.
"I do believe that there's a strong possibility that we will do a deal," Ms. Harvey said. But having the lawsuits dropped "is a condition put forward by the city," she added, "and we have no ability to do that."
Making matters even more complicated is that the plaintiffs in the lawsuits include more than two dozen organizations, from the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance to the More Gardens! Coalition. And not all of the groups share the same agenda.
Lawyers at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is representing several of the garden groups, said that they were angry that they had not been apprised of the discussions between the city and the Trust for Public Land. They also said that they were unlikely to drop their lawsuit unless the city agreed to call off the entire auction.
"We feel a great deal of frustration at the fact that a party, which is not a party to this lawsuit, is coming in and negotiating what the city is now considering 'the deal' -- in effect cutting the baby in half," said Sara E. Rios, a lawyer for the fund. "We think it is not in the interests of our clients and we will continue to aggressively defend our clients, which is all of the gardens."
The potential for an agreement represents a shift by the administration in its dealings with the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit national organization that has long advocated the preservation of the city's community gardens. Less than three weeks ago, the city rejected the group's offer to buy 165 gardens for $2 million, which city officials said was markedly lower than the properties' fair market value.
The intense negotiations are taking place as advocates for the gardens continue to demonstrate an almost militant resolve, staging demonstrations with people dressed as plants and ladybugs, sending out plaintive E-mail appeals en masse, filing lawsuits and orchestrating acts of civil disobedience. One week brought a protest at City Hall that led to the arrests of 30 people, some bearing kazoos; another week found a man, dressed like a sunflower, screaming, "The gardens must be saved!" from his perch in a ginkgo tree in City Hall Park.
The latest action came on Monday, when three demonstrators shackled their ankles together with a Kryptonite bicycle lock inside a city office. The police had to use an electric saw to cut through the lock before arresting them.
Also on Monday, State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer sued the city on the grounds that auctioning off the lots violated state environmental laws. And yesterday, some members of the City Council wore flowers from the gardens on their lapels, reflecting the Council's interest -- perhaps through state legislation -- in blocking or delaying the Giuliani administration's plans to sell the properties.
Two decades ago, the city permitted community groups to transform vacant lots into gardens as part of an open-ended but temporary agreement. That agreement effectively ended with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants to sell the lots and return them, if possible, to the public tax rolls. His administration's general response to those who want to keep the lots gardens has been: So then buy them.
The administration has also said that it hoped the sales would lead to more housing; garden advocates dismiss that position as a ruse. Adding further confusion to the debate is the differing conditions of the gardens. Some are verdant gathering places for neighborhoods; others are little more than glass-strewn lots.
The debate reached Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday, as Judge Allen G. Schwartz considered a request by garden supporters for a temporary restraining order that would stop tomorrow's auction. After being told by city lawyers that the administration was trying to negotiate a deal, the judge indicated that he might issue a decision sometime this afternoon.
In addition, there is a hearing scheduled today in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on two other lawsuits, including the Attorney General's, that are also seeking to stop the auction.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BEIJING;
China Students Are Caught Up By Nationalism

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 11

 BODY:
Exactly 10 years ago, with protesters in Tiananmen Square, a small grassy triangle in the center of Beijing University became a shrine to democracy, plastered with tracts about liberty and freedom. In recent years it had become a temple for the professions, filled with notices about computers and law examinations.
But in the last four days, the plaza has been transformed anew, into a museum of frenzied nationalism and anti-American sentiment. Hundreds of handwritten letters and posters decorate the fence, the trees and nearby billboards in a vitriolic reaction to the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. 
 "Support Yugoslavia and Resist America," one poster read. "Adolph Clinton," another read. A letter suggested that students should cover the American Embassy with garbage.
A poem read, in part: "Resist America Beginning with Cola, Attack McDonald's, Storm K.F.C."
University students here led the angry and sometimes violent protests at the American Embassy over the bombing. With the authorities' permission, the students have vented and displayed for the world the fury that many Chinese say they feel.
But even after four days of nearly continuous demonstrations, it is clear that there remains an extremely deep wellspring of angry emotion on college campuses that students say could percolate for months or years.
For many people, Chinese friendship toward the United States has always been tinged with a drop of suspicion, and the bombings have allowed dormant nationalism and anti-Western sentiments to surge to the surface.
The demonstrations have quickly become a formative experience for college students, who are in some cases making dramatic life decisions like forgoing overseas study based on their new views.
A generation raised on rock music and Coca-Cola is experiencing a complicated shift. "Many of my classmates have been going through their things and planning to burn all American products, at least those they can do without," said a 22-year-old marketing major at Beijing University, whose surname is Zhao.
Many students who cheered Michael Jordan last year and welcomed President Clinton on his recent visit are turning their backs or even lashing out at all things American.
At People's University on Sunday, several American students were surrounded by a group of Chinese students who were screaming, "Blood must be repaid with blood!"
Such incidents are rare, but Westerners who were walking on the Beijing University campus were subject to hard stares, as well as the occasional impromptu lecture on imperialism and anti-American taunts tossed out of dormitory windows.
The scene is a jarring about-face at universities where two months ago the highest achievement was to obtain a place at an American graduate school. In some departments at Beijing University, more than half the students have gone to the United States after graduation in the last few years.
Some students said they worried that rash actions now could haunt China for years. "There is a tone of irrational extremism, and people aren't thinking clearly about what they think and write," said Yu Jie, a popular liberal essayist who is a graduate student at the university. "I think this will have a very bad effect on the economic, social and cultural development of China."
Since Saturday, the universitieshere have sent busloads of students to the American Embassy area. On campuses, students talk of little else, and they have organized accompanying on-campus study sessions and protest rallies.
"I protested because I'm extremely outraged at this trampling on the dignity of the Chinese people," said Chen Wanyi, 20, who marched last weekend.
Although many students opposed the rock throwing that has battered the embassy, they said they understood why it had occurred.
"I know the protest looked extreme," said Lin Yijin, a trendily dressed 28-year-old journalism student at People's University, who protested on Saturday and Sunday. "But I think compared to what we were responding to, it was pretty restrained, just bottles and rocks and things like that."
Students said they believed that the United States had intentionally bombed the embassy in Belgrade, although few explained why Washington might have wanted to do that.
Unlike average Chinese, who can see only state-controlled media, the elite university students generally have Internet access. They read Mr. Clinton's expressions of regret and the NATO explanation, both of which the students dismissed as unbelievable or inadequate.
At the Beijing University triangle, students have posted a full English transcript of the NATO news conference in which officials first explained the bombing. It is covered with comments like "pure lies."
"Chinese are furious, and although we've now heard the apologies, we still feel that the response from NATO and the United States has been superficial," a 22-year-old international business major from northeastern China with the surname Wei. "If you'd seen the pictures of the three corpses, you'd understand why."
Although a number of students said they continued to feel friendly toward the American people, they were keeping their distance for now. Students said they were boycotting American products. Near the university, the usually bustling McDonald's and Pizza Hut restaurants stood mostly empty today.
"Give up the poison of American-style fast food and cultural opium -- Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, K.F.C.," read a poster on the triangle.
A Dairy Queen store near the protests was closed this evening, and a Baskin-Robbins store was also closed, hiding its sign under red cloth and placing banners that said, "Down With Imperialism," on its doors.
The anti-American atmosphere is so intense that some students said they were contemplating whether to continue English classes, take jobs with American companies or pursue hard-won acceptances to Harvard University.
Many are clearly torn between the moment's anger and pragmatism. Some said the protest groups were probably smaller than usual today because students were busily cramming for a national English test tomorrow and standardized tests this weekend that are required for American graduate schools.
A group of students at the National Minorities University in Beijing said it wanted to go to Yugoslavia to join the army, and it has posted fliers on other campuses urging others to join.
But a number of students who strongly support the protests said the excesses frightened them. "Are we still in the revolutionary era?" an essay posted on a wall at People's University asked. "Must we answer barbarity with barbarity?"
Jiao Li, 20, a student at the Beijing Transport Technology College, said: "I think this is a passing thing when students are inflamed with patriotism and very emotional. So it's natural for now to respond by not drinking Coke, for example. But I don't think that refusing to work for an American firm will solve any problems."
Students said the anger would fade slowly and only if NATO and the United States offered acceptable apologies.
"What the Chinese want is an explanation and an apology that will restore our dignity," Lin Yijin said. "I wouldn't take the stuff about 'Blood for blood' and 'Attack NATO' too seriously. For us this is about saving face."

Company to Return Tax Break Windfall

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A manufacturing company that promised to create 25 jobs in return for $1.1 million in tax breaks but instead cut 30 jobs from its payroll is giving the money back.
ABB Instrumentation was awarded the Manufacturing Tax Incentive by Monroe County's Industrial Development Agency. Since 1991, the tax break has saved the company $1.1 million on its $21 million plant in Henrietta, a suburb of Rochester. 
 Company officials announced yesterday that they would return the money in response to negative publicity that the tax breaks generated. The money will go to the town of Henrietta and its school district.
Greg LeRoy, a director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, said the move by the company appeared to be unprecedented. "I'm not aware of any other voluntary repayment anywhere," he said.
ABB Instrumentation makes instruments that monitor and control manufacturing processes.
The fate of the company's plant remains uncertain. Its parent company in Switzerland, ABB Asea Brown BoveriLtd., has delayed making a decision on whether to move the plant, which employs 400 people, to Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Israeli Race for Prime Minister Is Down to the Wire, With Little Cheering

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 11

 BODY:
Six days before the Israeli elections, Chaim Yisrael, an elderly Hasidic Jew, hurried to complete his shopping near the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He was on his way to tutor Torah, he said, but he could spare a few minutes.
"You know, there's only one real leader for us," he said, raising his bearded chin, peering heavenward over the brim of his black hat, and pointing at the sky. 
 Nonetheless, Mr. Yisrael said, he is planning to cast a half-hearted vote for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"On the personal side, he looks a little like Clinton morally," Mr. Yisrael said. "But ideologically, he's fine. What choice do we have really? Politics is the land of relativity, and he will be better to protect the land of Israel."
Eight miles away and a world apart, Moussa Ibrahim was equally equivocal. Standing over a mountain of salty pumpkin seeds in his gourmet shop in Abu Ghosh, an Israeli-Arab village, said he will vote for Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader.
"Not because I am a big fan," he said. "But because I want to be able to go out in the street and say I have a Prime Minister who is not a paranoid, a cheater and a liar."
This election campaign is reputedly a personality competition, devoid of substantive debate on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, the economy and tensions between secular and religious Jews. But few Israelis seem inspired by the personalities themselves.
From the craggy hills of the West Bank to the sleepy desert town of Beersheba, from affluent Tel Aviv to depressed Netivot, few Israelis offer rhapsodic endorsements of their candidates. Many say they will cast their ballots while holding their noses. "People vote by way of elimination here," said Vered Alexandrovitz, a bookstore owner in North Tel Aviv.
Israelis tend to be skeptical of predictions. They distrust the polls, which show Mr. Barak ahead of Mr. Netanyahu by about eight percentage points in a five-way race for Prime Minister. A tour of south-central Israel, including conversations with scores of voters, instead leaves the impression that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak are in a dead heat.
Yet the country does not seem gripped by the intensity of a tight election battle. Few balconies are strung with political banners, and road junctions are not routinely staffed by campaign workers. There have been no big political rallies, partly for security reasons, and no political debates between Mr. Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi, and Mr. Barak.
Throughout the country, many Israelis said they consider Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak to be cut from the same cloth: both self-confident Ashkenazi Jews with master's degrees from the United States, both former members of the military elite, and both leaning toward the center -- Mr. Netanyahu from the right, Mr. Barak from the left.
"I think they have the same profile," said Shmuel Lederer, mayor of a small West Bank settlement. "No matter who is elected, we won't feel much change."
Many Israelis feel that this is a critical election in which they will select the leader who oversees sensitive negotiations over a Palestinian state, an Israeli military withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the fate of the Golan Heights.
But they are weary of the high-decibel level of Israeli politics, disgusted by dirty deals and profoundly skeptical of the the maturation of the process in the near future.
Navon and Shoshana Armand, lifelong members of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party, do not even know if they will bother to vote on May 17, which is a holiday, a day off work.
"Maybe," said Mr. Armand, a bus driver in Beersheba. "If we're not on a picnic."
 
Efrat
 In the large Jewish settlement at Efrat, in the arid, rocky West Bank, the grass is green, the flowers plentiful and the stores modern and well stocked. It looks like an Arizona suburb and, with 6,450 people, it is effectively a bedroom community for Jerusalem. But while some residents chose it for its amenities, many elected to live in Efrat for purely ideological reasons.
In the small shopping plaza, the town bakery, which sells croissants and prayer shawls, is decorated, inside and out, with Mr. Netanyahu's face. In 1996, Efrat voted overwhelmingly for the Prime Minister, and most residents still back him.
Uri Netter, 22, a cheery clerk at the unusually efficient post office, said it did not require much thought.
"He is the only one who supports us," said Mr. Netter, an immigrant from France. "Look how we have grown here and how many new settlements have popped up during his time in office."
Eti Avrahami, however, is sharply critical of the Prime Minister, speaking more like a small business owner than a settler. Her family owns a grocery store in the center of town.
"We used to believe in Bibi," she said. "But everything seemed to come to a halt under him. The economy is down. The society is stuck. There's no forward motion, no swoosh."
Mrs. Avrahami unconsciously echoed the themes of Mr. Barak's campaign against Mr. Netanyahu. People like her, defectors from the committed core of Netanyahu supporters, are very worrisome to his campaign.
 
Bet Haggai
This town near Hebron is a hard-core settlement, a Zionist outpost among the Palestinian towns. Bet Haggai has a frontier feeling, and the many shuttered houses on its edges suggest that the living is hard.
Even here, however, where 98.8 percent of voters selected Mr. Netanyahu last time, the Prime Minister does not have the electorate sewn up. "I think people want to punish Netanyahu because he did not stop Oslo," the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed in 1993, said Mr. Lederer, the mayor.
Yisrael Buskila, 24, is only a renter, a newlywed who moved in because the price was right and the view was splendid. But he believes from his core that Israel should hold onto as much of the West Bank as possible. If Benny Begin, the right-wing candidate for Prime Minister, had a chance, he would get Mr. Buskila's vote, he said. But he doesn't, so Mr. Buskila said he will vote for Mr. Netanyahu.
He said he does not believe in the Prime Minister, but that the traits he finds unappealing -- his perceived arrogance and wiliness -- make him tough at the negotiating table.
"With Netanyahu, you see him holding the Palestinians by the throat," he said. For Parliament, however, Mr. Buskila will vote for the far-right National Unity coalition. "Why?" he asked. "Because they will be holding Bibi by the throat while he holds the Palestinians."
 
Beersheba
In this desert town, far from the political centers of the country, a Barak banner and a Netanyahu banner hang together as if they are one sign -- sharing the same string, between two palm trees.
That would seem to sum up the sleepiness of the campaign in Beersheba, where many voters said they were undecided. Even so, Ruthie Sheetrit, a hairdresser, said the barrage of election news was driving her and everyone else insane. "By May 17, we'll all be meshuga," she said, in her shop at the central bus station.
Sixty percent of Beersheba, a mixed town with many Sephardic Jews, Russian immigrants and Israeli Arabs, voted for Mr. Netanyahu in 1996. Since then, though, the Likud town elected a Labor mayor, and politically it is in flux.
Mrs. Sheetrit said she would vote for Mr. Netanyahu, as she did in 1996. But her endorsement is not ringing. "Barak in power is an unknown," she said. "With Bibi, we already know the bad. So what I'm saying is, I'll go with the known evil."
In Israel, political scientists say that voting is tribal. People are born into political parties -- the Ashkenazi or European power elite and Israeli Arabs are Labor while the Sephardic or Middle Eastern and African working class and the ultra-Orthodox are Likud. But everywhere it seemed that the tribes were shifting ground.
Chaim Crispin, 46, for instance, was among those who selected Mr. Netanyahu last time. But Mr. Crispin, a lifelong Likudnik who owns a small metal business in Beersheba, said Mr. Netanyahu had immediately detached him from his party loyalty. He will vote for Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate. And in a runoff election, if it comes to that, he will vote for Mr. Barak -- "if there's no other choice, because no way I'll vote for Bibi."
 
Netivot
This somewhat desolate southern town that is home to poor and working class Sephardic Jews is an unlikely tourist destination. But Netivot has the tomb of Baba Sali, the late Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, a Moroccan-born sage who was revered as a healer and miracle worker. And Jews of North African descent flock to it in tour buses. If there is anything that is unadulterated Netanyahu territory, this is it.
At a raucous bar mitzvah, celebrated with couscous and grilled meat, one man banged a drum, while another strummed an oud. Shouting above the revelry, Felix Smadar, a port worker, said, "We're Bibi. Why? Because he's a strong man, and all the Arabs are afraid of him."
But within every group, there is a freethinker. Cheli Azulay, who was celebrating her one-week wedding anniversary at the tomb, said she will vote for Mr. Mordechai, defying her new husband, because she dislikes Mr. Netanyahu.
Sometimes, voters' motivations are personal. "He takes his wife everywhere, this Bibi," Mrs. Azulay said. Yitzhak "Rabin -- God bless his soul -- did he drag his wife around with him? What is this? I don't like it."
 
Ashkelon
On the pedestrian mall in this port town that is home to new immigrants from the former Soviet Union and older immigrants from North Africa, Ilana Tveritzim cuddled her small, blond daughter.
A clerk at an employment agency who left Russia nine years ago, she is one of the immigrant voters that the candidates are furiously courting because they seem less wedded to parties than native-born Israelis.
Mrs. Tveritzim is abandoning Mr. Netanyahu. "He tends to bump his head against other heads," she said. "That is not good in a leader. Maybe Barak is more mature.'
At her non-kosher delicatessen in Ashlelon, stocked with sausages, Tanya Levin, of Minsk, said she is defecting from Mr. Netanyahu, too, because the economy is depressed. And Renata Koeppel, who immigrated to Israel four years ago from the Ukraine, said that her friends are feeling the sting of rising unemployment. She works at a new toy store, where she beat out 100 other immigrants for the job, her boss said. "We will vote Barak," she said.
Hearing about their fellow countrymen, Uri and Natalie Datchek were disappointed. "Maybe they are not thinking about Israel, but themselves," Mr. Datchek said, endorsing Mr. Netanyahu because "he is strong."
 
Ramat Aviv Gimmel
This community is so notorious as the affluent yuppie center of Tel Aviv that it is the name of the Israeli television's version of Beverly Hills 90210. In 1996, Ramat Aviv Gimmel came out strongly for Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who lost to Mr. Netanyahu.
This is one of the places where Israelis say they will sink into depression -- or go abroad for a while -- if Mr. Netanyahu is re-elected.
Sari Yisraeli, a real estate broker with stylishly touseled red hair, was meeting some clients at a cafe in an upscale food court in the local mall. She said she and her friends are panicked at the possibility of a Netanyahu victory.
"If it will be Bibi, it will be tragedy -- disaster," she said. "If he wins, I think I'm going to lock myself in the house for a week. Barak -- I trust his judgment -- I trust it in my gut."
Inside a coffee shop, two well-dressed couples debated their choices of candidates, offering lukewarm endorsements. "I'm a right-winger, so I will have to vote for Netanyahu," Avner Cohen said.
"I don't like him," said his friend, Ms. Alexandrovitz. "He's not a good choice. But don't misunderstand me. I'm not a big fan of Barak."
"I didn't say I like Bibi, either," Mr. Cohen shot back. 
 
Abu Ghosh
In his immaculate shop in this relatively prosperous Arab village in the Judean hills, Mr. Ibrahim stood between towering bottles of olive oil and hookahs, which were on sale.
"A man like me, not a Jew -- on the one hand, they are telling me this is not your state," Mr. Ibrahim said. "On the other, they are telling me you have the right to vote. So what is the value of that right in a place they say I don't belong?"
Election campaigns underscore the quandary of Israeli Arabs, citizens who feel they are treated as second class. With more than 300,000 voters, they represent an important bloc. In the past, their turnout, which is relatively low by Israeli standards, has been somewhat assured by their desire to cast a ballot for the Arab parties in the Parliament.
But in this election, where there is likely to be a runoff, will they be motivated to vote a second time, to choose between Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu? In a close race, the answer is very important to Mr. Barak, and his party is working hard to overcome the cynicism many Israeli Arabs feel.
"The leftist parties scream, "Give us your vote so that we can get back in power and make things right for you,' " Mr. Ibrahim said. "Then regimes change, but nothing changes for us. They are right to worry about the Israeli-Arab turnout."
 
Mea Shearim
In the shopping district near here, the walls are plastered with posters warning against casting a blank ballot for Prime Minister.
"White slip, black future," the new posters say ominously.
The posters are trying to combat a community-wide campaign that is urging strictly religious Jews in Mea Shearim to be neutral. It is a pragmatic response to the possibility that Mr. Barak could win as well as an expression of the feeling that the religious community has become too politicized.
Standing near one wall of posters, Rickie Sofer, who immigrated to Israel 30 years ago from Brooklyn, said she was considering abstaining altogether, even from the vote for Parliament.
"The truth is, between you and me, I think they're all dishonest," she said. "Last time, I voted for Netanyahu. He looks like a gentleman. But I'm very disappointed by his conduct."
Mrs. Sofer is unusually independent-minded. Most members of the religious community vote according to their rabbis' recommendation, although most rabbis have not yet made their endorsements.
Asya Konofnitsky, a young mother who held her tiny daughter's hand at a bus stop, looked stunned when she was asked for whom she would vote.
"How could I know?" she said. "The Torah sages have been silent. What they tell me. That's what I will vote."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Testing an Emerging Market;
Can Wall St.'s Old Guards Cope With the New Trading?

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Late last month, lawyers for Island ECN, a computerized stock-trading service that opened for business less than three years ago, applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to become America's newest stock exchange.
Island's owners acknowledge they are taking a leap of faith as they set out to compete on an equal basis with the 207-year-old New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, born a quarter-century ago. Like those exchanges, Island deals with brokerage firms, not individual investors, but its software offers a difference: automatically matching up orders from buyers and sellers without going through a dealer or trading floor. 
 Island is a novice, though, in the regulatory labyrinth. "We don't even know how much it will cost us to go through the S.E.C. process," said Edward J. Nicoll, chief operating officer of the Datek Online Holdings Corporation, which owns Island. "We've guessed $10 million" -- a figure that Island's 28-year-old president, Matthew Andresen, acknowledged making up out of the blue.
As Americans gallop into the stock market seeking instant riches or retirement security, the basic trading machinery is also being made up on the fly. Driven by technology, upstarts like Island are luring trades away from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange by offering nanosecond service and microscopic fees. Those older markets are fighting back, proposing longer trading hours, new rules and changes in their ownership structure aimed at making them more competitive.
"This is not a revolution; it is an earthquake," said Robert A. Schwartz, a finance professor at Baruch College in New York.
And the fault lines lead directly to the S.E.C., which is responsible for maintaining investor confidence in a marketplace that behind the scenes is changing almost beyond recognition. The agency must make sure that rapid change does not create new opportunities for fraud or conflicts of interest and that investors are not shortchanged amid the confusion.
"This is a time of evolution and change," said Annette L. Nazareth, the agency's new director of market regulation. "When you have those dynamics, you can't always predict what the next step will be."
The scenarios range from a fragmented world of competing exchanges like Island, each catering to a different trading community, to a monolithic world where today's competitors have merged into a single network that trades foreign and domestic stocks around the clock.
So far, regulators seem sure that whatever market model emerges will be cheaper, faster and fairer for all investors. But the agency's ad hoc approach to a changing marketplace has made it a lightning rod for Wall Street's frustration.
"Regulators are having as tough a time as everybody else trying to figure out what their new priorities should be," said John Byrne, editor of The Trader, a Wall Street magazine. "We all need to tread a little more carefully -- there's too much at stake, from the livelihood of market makers to the health of the nation's economy."
Moreover, the same technology that has produced the market's structural earthquake has produced an explosion of Internet stock gossip and on-line investing, which themselves produce myriad opportunities for fraud.
With Congress urging more attention to on-line abuses, Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, announced on May 4 that he was asking for enough new money to double his "cyberforce," the 125-lawyer team devoted to policing the Internet.
And the next day, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill requiring disclosure of on-line brokers' service records, raising the penalties for on-line fraud and increasing the five-year budget authorization for the S.E.C.'s Internet efforts.
By contrast, little public attention has been paid to the agency's market regulation division -- though that "is where the real changes are happening," said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor.
Island's application is just one of the novel issues pummeling the S.E.C. Others include proposals to extend trading hours on Nasdaq and the New York exchange and to convert the fractional stock quotes to dollars and cents. Nasdaq dealers want to collect fees for matching buyers and sellers, as Big Board floor specialists and computerized traders like Island do, and the Big Board is planning to acquire or build its own computerized system to compete with Nasdaq.
Meantime, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, is wrestling over demands for trading halts in volatile Internet stocks. And the Big Board is looking for ways to enable traders to buy foreign stocks in Frankfurt in the morning and sell the same shares in New York in the afternoon.
Some market participants trace the current tumult to two earlier S.E.C. initiatives.
In mid-1996, the commission imposed new rules for handling customers' trading orders, after Nasdaq dealers were accused of fixing prices for over-the-counter stocks. Dealers were directed to display on Nasdaq's trading screens any superior prices they had posted on private trading networks like Island.
Soon, the electronic communication networks' share of Nasdaq trading boomed. Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola & Thornton, a San Francisco investment bank, calculated that these networks handled nearly 29 percent of all Nasdaq trades the last three months of 1998.
Then, in December, the S.E.C. adopted a new set of rules to govern electronic networks and other "alternative trading systems." The rules allow the networks to apply to become exchanges, the marketplace equals of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.
Island's application is the first test, and the commission is moving cautiously. After all, Ms. Nazareth said, approving a new exchange has not been done in 26 years.
And Island is a controversial applicant, in part because a sister subsidiary, Datek Online, is an on-line broker catering to day traders -- individuals who speculate on short-term stock positions -- who have prompted so much regulatory concern. Mr. Nicoll said Island would be well insulated from Datek's brokerage business.
 
A Police Force On the Lean Side
A pending investment by Waterhouse Investor Services, a unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank, will put $25 million in Island's coffers, adding to the fraction of a penny it gets for each trade. And as an exchange, Island would get a share of the millions of dollars investors pay for up-to-the-minute stock prices. But it would also take on the costly job of policing its members to prevent insider trading and other misbehavior.
The N.A.S.D. has a 200-member staff and a $60 million budget devoted to market regulation, and the Big Board's internal police force accounts for roughly a third of its 1,500-member staff.
Mr. Andresen said Island would do its duty by being innovative -- for example, it may hire outside accountants to audit its member brokerage firms, at the firms' expense.
Without commenting on Island's status, Ms. Nazareth warned that some electronic networks might not fully grasp "what it is going to entail when you get to the nitty-gritty of being an exchange." Her deputy, Robert L. D. Colby, added, "Doing self-regulatory oversight on the cheap is not going to be sufficient."
Many market experts say that in hindsight the S.E.C. should have envisioned the need for a single self-regulatory police force in a market composed of private, for-profit operations like Island.
As it turned out, that issue is just now climbing up the agency's agenda: the N.A.S.D. is considering spinning off its regulatory arm into just such a free-standing entity -- but it proposes doing so in conjunction with a plan to become a for-profit corporation. That initiative, which could essentially make the Nasdaq market into a Nasdaq stock, got an informal nod from Mr. Levitt last week, but its implementation is at best months away, given the deliberative pace of the agency's rule-making process.
If the regulatory gait is measured, the pace of reinvention is accelerating so fast that market executives are starting to compare it to the convulsive changes that began on May 1, 1975, when fixed brokerage commissions were abolished -- an event Wall Street calls "May Day."
Venerable but bloated firms found they could not survive on the thin commissions that mutual funds and other big investors demanded. Funds flourished as trading costs shrank, but they had to develop direct-to-consumer sales methods because stockbrokers became less interested in marketing their wares. Individuals, meanwhile, became a rich market for Charles Schwab and the other discount brokers born in this era.
 
Wall Street Labels It 'May Day II'
Today, with computers like Island's replacing many human relationships, Wall Street magazines like Institutional Investor and The Trader are talking about "May Day II."
Calling today's changes as significant as any that have occurred since the early 1930's, William R. Johnston, president of the New York Stock Exchange, drew knowing nods at a recent Wall Street conference when he said, "Your competitors today may be your partners tomorrow, and your competitors tomorrow may not even exist today."
How individual investors fare as all this unfolds will depend, in part, on how well the S.E.C. enforces rules that require brokers to give customers "the best execution" of trades -- traditionally, the best price.
But even the definition of "best execution" has been muddied by new technology and the emergence of new marketplaces, with newcomers like Mr. Andresen arguing that the term should encompass the speed and certainty of a trade, not just the price.
Poor execution can cost small investors far more than they save on low commissions, and on-line brokers sending orders to electronic networks are already generating complaints.
In a speech last week, Mr. Levitt warned Wall Street that his staff was finding numerous instances of poor execution. The best-possible execution was "not just good business practice; it's a legal obligation," he said.
But disciplinary cases have been rare, perhaps because regulators "are overwhelmed by some of the best-execution issues that have arisen in this new trading environment," Professor Coffee said.
 
A Big Test For the S.E.C.
Academic studies support the S.E.C.'s pride in how its order-handling rules have narrowed the spread between the prices at which Nasdaq stocks can be bought and sold. But Douglas M. Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group P.L.C. and the dominant private trading service, argues that the resulting market turbulence has made life difficult for large institutional investors, including pension accounts and mutual funds, which are most Americans' foothold in the market.
"The S.E.C. has done a lot of good things for the retail investor trading 400 or 500 shares," Mr. Atkin said. "What they need to take more into account, as market structure evolves, is that retail investors need a market that will work for them when they give their money to their mutual fund managers, too."
Mr. Colby disputes that institutional investors are discontented. "We have not heard any complaints," he said. But industry executives point out that interest from institutions is one engine driving the proliferation of alternative trading systems.
Some critics say the S.E.C. should focus on protecting investors and let the market evolve. Others argue that investors cannot be protected in a market that is not fairly structured.
But with so much at stake, it is clear that Wall Street is watching the S.E.C. carefully, particularly as it evaluates Island's application. "It is a bit premature to grade them yet," Professor Coffee said. "But this is the big exam."

HEADLINE: Productivity Rose at a Rate Of 4% in the First Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The productivity of the nation's workers surged in the first three months of this year, highlighting the economy's continued competitiveness in its ninth year of expansion and easing fears of inflation.
The Labor Department said today that productivity, measuring workers' hourly output of goods and services, rose at an annualized rate of 4 percent in the first quarter of 1999. 
 That was a slight slowing from the 4.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter, but the overall performance was remarkably strong, especially for the advanced stage of the business cycle, when productivity growth is typically much more subdued.
"It seems to confirm the more positive view that people have about the economy," said Fred Breimyer, chief economist at the State Street Bank and Trust Company, referring to some analysts' description of a "new economy" in the 1990's, one that is marked by technological gains, low inflation and high productivity.
The first-quarter advance in productivity for workers outside the farm sector was well above the 3 percent increase expected by economists.
"We are going from strength to strength," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant with the Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago. "It's another factor in favor of the argument that productivity has moved to a new higher ground."
Productivity is crucial to rising standards of living. A more efficient work force gives companies a competitive edge, enabling them to keep prices lower. It also allows companies to grant payoffs to workers in the form of higher wages without cutting into profits.
Indeed, consistent with the robust productivity in the quarter, unit-labor costs, a key gauge of wage inflation, rose just three-tenths of 1 percent, following a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in late 1998. Economists had expected a gain of half a percent in the first quarter.
But workers pocketed a solid rise in inflation-adjusted pay. Real per-hour compensation rose 2.8 percent in the first quarter, up from 2.2 percent in the prior quarter.

HEADLINE: HOUSE PROUD;
2B + 2H + 2F = A 1990's New York Design for Living

BYLINE: By MARC KRISTAL 

 BODY:
QUESTION: How long does it take to put together a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the heart of Greenwich Village, with three working fireplaces and a terrace, overlooking an Italianate inner garden, and all for a total of $234,000? Answer: 21 years.
The woman who created the space, Diane Shea, 45, is notable not merely for her perseverance. She also represents a classic New York tale, in a certain time and place: a personal journey from 1970's art student to a collaboration with a 1980's art star to a genteel, familial bohemianism that is typically 1990's. It is equally a chronicle of homesteading, Manhattan-style, and how, as one woman grew with the city, she adapted to changing times -- within her neighborhood, the real estate market, her apartment and her life. 
 It started in 1974, when Ms. Shea was an art major at the Parsons School of Design, crashing with three aspiring musicians in an artist-in-residence loft on West Broadway and Prince Streets, then a quiet, semi-industrial zone. Each paid $85 a month for the privilege of living in a space in which you took the elevator by leaping into the shaft and grabbing a rope, Tarzan-style, then scrambling out again before the car came down and crushed you.
Tiring of the communal life, Ms. Shea decided to get a place of her own. She found a 250-square-foot studio in a crazy-quilt structure created from four tenements erected in the 1850's and combined in the 1920's. The buildings had been joined but not unified, and the results of this poly gamous shotgun marriage were evident everywhere: hallways and window lines abruptly changed levels; closet doors opened onto unresolved bits of stairway. Indeed, there were still two entrances and two addresses, one on Bleecker Street, the other on West 11th.
Her studio was a box, with a half kitchen, and front and bathroom doors that opened directly into the living space. The wiring ran through the original gas lines, and the entire space functioned at the whim of a single 15-ampere fuse. Its sole distinguishing feature was an orange-veined, gray marble fireplace -- more a necessity than a luxury, as the boiler was often out.
But the studio's three windows looked onto a lush garden and former stable, which had been converted to a loggia adorned with found furniture. It formed a remarkable urban oasis. The neighborhood still felt very much like the storied bastion of bohemianism, in which free thinkers drank gin at Chumley's while debating the evils of capital and the glories of art. And at $175 a month, the price was right, though, Ms. Shea noted dryly, no bargain. It was an ideal life for a 20-year-old student enjoying her first New York adventure.
By 1985, when the building went co-op in that decade's real estate boom, Ms. Shea's life had changed. A relatively unknown artist, Robert Longo, had engaged her to collaborate on his work, and along the way he had become one of the brightest of the New York art scene's supernovas. Ms. Shea had, in her own way, arrived. Her priorities became those of a woman whose knockabout youth had given way, at 31, to a desire for more mature satisfactions.
With little in savings, Ms. Shea secured 100 percent bank financing and bought her piece of the Manhattan rock for $48,000. She also bought her next door neighbor's apartment, a 325-square-foot studio, for $68,000, also 100 percent financed, without knowing whether she could legally or structurally combine the two. Neither was anyone's ideal of hearth and home, but it was an opportunity, and she wasn't going to miss it.
Shortly afterward, Ms. Shea married Doug Sloan, a multimedia producer-director and old school chum of Mr. Longo's. She sublet her two studios and moved into Mr. Sloan's apartment in a cookie-cutter, white-brick building on East 46th Street. Still, she pined for Greenwich Village, though as a career woman and soon-to-be mother, for different reasons. The bohemian fantasyland of her youth was giving way to higher rents, fancier restaurants and tonier shops, but it was still home to Public School 3, one of the city's best. And with the Bleecker Street playground just outside the door, the Village remained one of the most civil places in Manhattan to raise a family. So Ms. Shea cast her eye on a third studio, this one a whopping 500 square feet.
There were two problems. The apartment was still occupied, by an elderly woman who paid a two-figure, stabilized rent. The second problem was more troublesome: the third space didn't adjoin the others. The only direct access was through a wooden fire door and across a tar-paper roof to another fire door.
Nevertheless, Ms. Shea urged her husband to buy the apartment from the owner of the building, knowing that he would take much less than if the place were vacant. They were near to closing a deal when the tenant suddenly died -- and the price more than doubled. Swallowing hard, Mr. Sloan ponied up $48,000. The couple now owned three studios, for a total of $160,000, and were still living in midtown.
There ensued two long years, in which Ms. Shea had a second child; worked with Robert Evans, a New York architect, to reconfigure the 1,000-plus square feet into a space that would afford comfort and privacy to a family of four; dealt with New York's protracted permit procedures and the Landmarks Commission, and through her architect hired an expediter to, as she put it, find loopholes in the law and hang around City Hall, making sure the paperwork got moved to the tops of the right piles.
The expediter, John Peachy, earned his keep. He found an obscure, Lindsay-era law stating that the total number of apartments in tenement buildings could be decreased without need of a new certificate of occupancy, which saved Ms. Shea an expense. And Mr. Evans determined that a lot-line window belonging to another building, which sat squarely in the middle of the planned hallway that would connect apartments two and three, could be legally covered.
Ms. Shea also joined the co-op board, which helped insure that her renovation plan would be approved. Once the permits and permissions were in place, she hired all the craftsmen and shopped for bargain appliances and fixtures. When money ran short, she shrewdly used her resources, bartering most of her cache of signed, original Longos at the height of their value to reduce her cash outlay to roughly $70,000 from an estimate of $120,000.
Finally, in 1995, just in time for her elder child to begin first grade at Public School 3, Ms. Shea and her family took up residence. The resulting space remains a model of painstaking planning, highlighting the architecture's best qualities, while catering to individual and collective needs.
This is most evident in Ms. Shea's original studio, which has been transformed into a two-bedroom children's suite and has a ship's snug economy. Her old entrance is now a niche, containing an antique storage cabinet used for linens. Beside it, the tiny Pullman kitchen has been replaced by louvered closets. These are opposite the doors to the new bedrooms; together, they form a corridor, at the end of which is the entrance to the enlarged bathroom.
Off the corridor, the children's two bedrooms form the most amusing and effective of the residence's spatial economies. The original studio had three windows. Each bedroom would, of course, receive one, but which child would get the third?
The solution was sublimely Solomonic: the new rooms interlock like Lego blocks before the center window, resulting in "bunk beds" in which each bunk is actually in a separate room. Mica, 8, has the lower berth in hers, while, 31 inches above, Max, 11, sleeps in the upper in the room next door. An identical-size portion of the original window (sealed with Plexiglas) remains at the foot of each bed. Both spaces, which display a riot of childhood clutter, provide roughly 50 square feet of floor space -- about the size of a dorm room, Ms. Shea noted.
Apartment two, which is a step up from the children's suite and in another building, serves as the couple's living room-kitchen-dining room. The narrow kitchen, which incorporates the old bathroom, is finished with an antique sink, which Ms. Shea found on the Bowery, and cherry-wood and glass cabinets. It is open at both ends, affording both separation and easy access from the front door and the dining area.
The living-dining area, though small, has three generous windows, which overlook the garden and flood the space with afternoon light. The area also reflects the family's priorities: no sofa, but a substantial dining table, designed by Ms. Shea, at which she and her children work on projects.
For the 14-by-20-foot tar-paper roof between apartments two and three, Mr. Evans designed a hallway that connects the spaces via their old fire exits. It is enclosed in what Ms. Shea describes as a little hut, raffishly clad in fire-resistant copper shingles. From the hallway, sliding glass doors open onto a new west-facing terrace, delightfully private and serene.
The third apartment serves as the master suite and departs from the others in atmosphere and architecture. With leaded-glass windows, wide plank floors and beamed ceiling, all original, the space sustains a literal and psychological separateness for parents who need their privacy. Here, the kitchen was removed, and a curved, partial wall installed to form an open walk-in closet/dressing room. This space contains another of Ms. Shea's droll designs for living: a pedestal sink, which taps the former kitchen's water line. While Ms. Shea is occupied in the slightly undersize bathroom, Mr. Sloan can shave in the closet.
Today, Ms. Shea, who still works with Mr. Longo, estimates that her apartment is worth roughly three times its $234,000 total cost. But the family has no plans to move on. For one thing, the feat could not be duplicated, at least in the Village. For another, the couple has built a post-and-beam house on 10 acres near Rhinebeck, N.Y., where the children can roam unrestricted.
Most of all, Ms. Shea expects that as she and her family evolve, the apartment, in one configuration or another, will always play a part in their lives. In a tradition more usually associated with the heartland, but no less applicable to New York, she will remain in her first home forever.

Roving Minstrels
Led by its artistic director, James Levine, the Met Orchestra today begins a 12-concert, 3-week tour of 10 European cities. Besides making its debut in Lisbon; Bremen and Baden-Baden, Germany; Prague and Geneva, the orchestra will be revisiting Madrid and Valencia, Spain; Hamburg and Cologne, Germany, and Vienna. Soloists appearing on the tour include Deborah Voigt, who will sing Richard Strauss's "Four Last Songs"; the clarinetist Ricardo Morales and the bassoonist Patricia Rogers. One concert in Baden-Baden will feature Act II of Saint-Saens's "Samson et Dalila," with Placido Domingo, Olga Borodina and Sergei Leiferkus in the principal roles. 

Journey Into Light
Eugene O'Neill will be the subject of a two-day conference of writers, critics and scholars organized at Baruch College to coincide with the Broadway run of "The Iceman Cometh." After consideration of O'Neill and his vision of racial, cultural and class conflict, the conference, which begins tomorrow, will end on Saturday with a performance by the Playwrights Theater of New York of O'Neill's one-act "Bound East for Cardiff," which brought realism to the American stage in 1916. The keynote address, "More Than 40 Years of Research and Analysis of O'Neill," will be given by Barbara Gelb, an O'Neill biographer with her husband, Arthur Gelb, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation.
 
Hemispheric
Some 60 works by 50 artists from Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States and Canada are on display through Aug. 9 in "Mastering the Millennium: Art of the Americas" at the Organization of American States' Art Museum of the Americas and the World Bank in Washington. Among the pieces is "WAIS Station Tower," by the Korean-born American Nam June Paik. The work evokes the rapid flow of information by means of a 17-foot-high pyramid with 56 television monitors displaying multiple images on a framework of electronic wiring and computer boards.
 
On the Riviera
The 52d Cannes International Film Festival began yesterday on the French Riviera with 22 films vying for the Golden Palm, to be awarded on May 23 by a jury led by the director David Cronenberg. Other jurors are the opera star Barbara Hendricks, the actors Holly Hunter and Jeff Goldblum, the playwright Yasmina Reza, the actress Dominique Blanc and the directors George Miller, Dorris Dorrie, Andre Techine and Maurizio Nichetti. The opening attraction was "The Barber of Siberia," Nikita Mikhalkov's historical epic of a tragic love. LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

On the eve of Bill Clinton's impeachment, the President of the U.S. changed the subject by firing missiles. On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's impeachment, the President of Russia dominated the news by firing another of his Prime Ministers. Both stunts were briefly effective; the Russian way is cheaper.
Yevgeny Primakov was sent to the showers not only because he is an economic ignoramus but because he did not stand up for his boss to the Communist impeachers. 
 Until recently he had been warning Communists in the Duma that if they impeached Yeltsin, he would resign as Prime Minister. But this week the ambitious ex-spymaster changed his mind and told them he would stick around, impeachment or not, which impelled Boris to yank him.
In a way, I'll miss Yevgeny; he was the devil we knew. When a team of New York Times correspondents went to interview him last year, he spent the first 10 minutes denouncing my columns as glupo, "stupid" -- a display of thin-skinniness that warmed my heart. But it's good for Russia and the world that he's gone; Saddam Hussein's longtime friend was too adept at evildoing.
Trudging to the mound in relief is Sergei Stepashin, the K.G.B. chief who blundered into Chechnya and the police chief who failed to uncover Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich's nerve-gas dealings with Syria. He is the fourth Russian Prime Minister in about a year, and mail addressed to him should read "or current occupant."
More important than who Yeltsin's choice is to be seasonal front man is what faction will win elections to the Duma in mid-December. Here's what to root for:
Communists, who now dominate, are using impeachment as their vehicle. Democratic reformers of the Yabloko Party are focused on reviving the failed economy. If the reformers push their Duma percentage up into the teens, they will be kingmakers in the presidential elections next year. Root for that.
But here's the stickler: Although Yabloko opposes four impeachment counts, it supports a fifth, castigating Yeltsin for the bloody war in Chechnya. If it passes, Yeltsin could not disband Parliament, and the Communists could refuse to approve his Prime Minister and Cabinet. Result: deadlock and crisis. Only six years ago, that led to the shelling of Parliament. We should root for the Duma's impeachment to fail.
What does Yeltsin want? He wants (1) to stay in control, politically and physically, until his last day in office; (2) to help defeat the Communists, his foes for the past decade, and (3) to keep the country stable enough to hold elections as scheduled. These are worthy goals and we should root for him to attain them.
Unfortunately, he may also want (4) to guarantee the welfare of his relatives and enriched oligarchs who sustain him, and (5) to bestride the world stage like the superpower Russia is no longer, protecting Serbia from the consequences of its state-sponsored savagery. We should offer catcalls and brickbats and Bronx cheers to call attention to our disapproval of this dangerous pretension.
Above all, Americans now forced to switch channels from economy-watching to military affairs should root for an awakening in the White House to its greatest current folly: using unstable, NATO-resentful, Chechnya-transfixed Russia as the broker in a deal with Serbia.
We do not need any go-between. NATO mediation should disintermediate immediately. If Slobodan Milosevic wants the bombing stopped, he knows what number to call. If we want to send him a message, we can do it over public airwaves.
A middleman only guarantees that we split "core" differences and thereby fail to protect returnees with the guns of the nations proved willing to fight for their rights.
Look beyond Primakov, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Stepashin, even Yeltsin. There looms a presidential front-runner, Yuri Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow, who revealed his mindset last month to Harvard's Graham Allison in The Boston Globe: If NATO dares send troops into Serbia, Russia would supply the Serbs missiles to shoot down U.S. aircraft. This could "lead to direct military conflict between the U.S. and Russia."
Do not deal through Serbia's blustering ally. Deal direct.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise at Federated and Kmart

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Macy's and other department stores, and the Kmart Corporation, the nation's second-largest discount retailer, said yesterday that their first-quarter profits rose as they sold more clothes and home furnishings and held down costs.
Net income for Federated, whose chains also include Bloomingdale's and Burdines, rose 45 percent, to $87 million, or 40 cents a diluted share, compared with $60 million, or 27 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts expected the company to earn 31 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. Sales rose 7.3 percent, to $3.71 billion from $3.46 billion. 
 Kmart's profit rose 43 percent, to $67 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $47 million, or 10 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results matched Wall Street forecasts. Sales rose 8.4 percent, to $8.14 billion from $7.52 billion.
Shoppers, benefiting from rising wages and low inflation, splurged on home products such as lawn furniture as well as capri pants and other spring fashions. Both retailers squeezed more profit from sales by keeping costs in check.
Shares of Federated, based in Cincinnati, rose $3.3125, to $54.3125, while shares of Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., fell 43.75 cents, to $17.125. Both stocks are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rubin Leaves the Treasury

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin's decision to step aside as Treasury Secretary was responsibly timed in that the major crises in the world now are not primarily economic. Nonetheless he will be missed, in part because he anchored a changing cast of Cabinet and White House officials. The American economy -- and those of many other countries -- might be in far worse shape had not his expertise and calm determination helped steer the Clinton Administration's economic policies for six years.
Mr. Rubin deserves a significant part of the credit for putting the Government on a course to balance the Federal budget, and he will be remembered as perhaps the most influential member of the Cabinet at a time that economic issues came to rival security concerns in determining American relations with other countries. He can also take pride that it has been more than eight years since the last American recession ended. 
 The understanding of markets that Mr. Rubin gained in a career as a bond trader proved to be invaluable in a world coming to grips with the growing reach of markets and the billions of dollars in capital that can be moved from one market to another by traders interested more in quick profits than long-term development.
Mr. Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, the investment bank, was chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council until he was chosen as Treasury Secretary in late 1994, shortly before the Mexican crisis erupted as that country's currency fell sharply. It was Mr. Rubin who put together a rescue package that enabled Mexico to come through the crisis and also kept that crisis from infecting the rest of Latin America.
The bad part of the rescue -- that investors who had unwisely lent money to Mexico emerged unscathed -- came back to haunt the world by encouraging investors to make ill-considered investments in other countries. That contributed to the Asian crisis that erupted in 1997, but investors who thought such lending was risk-free learned otherwise when no bailout materialized after Russia defaulted on its debts last summer.
While there was criticism of the way the International Monetary Fund, with Mr. Rubin's approval, handled the Asian crisis by forcing countries to raise interest rates and bring on recessions, the fact is that most of Asia is on the mend and those policies now appear to have worked.
Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Secretary named to succeed Mr. Rubin, is an outstanding if sometimes undiplomatic economist who is well qualified and deserves prompt confirmation.

HEADLINE: Higher Prices Reported for Home Resales

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Prices of existing homes rose in most metropolitan areas in the first three months of this year.
Nationally, the median resale price -- meaning half of homes sold for more and half for less -- was $131,600 during the January-March quarter, up 4.6 percent from the corresponding quarter a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said today. 
 By comparison, inflation rose at a 1.7 percent annual rate during 1998 and has kept to an even lower 1.5 percent rate so far this year.
"The rise in home prices in all regions has been fueled by a combination of buyers ready to move up to more expensive homes and a growing number of first-time buyers in this favorable economic environment," said James F. Smith, chief economist for the real estate group.
Ten of the 120 metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group reported median resale price rises of 10 percent or greater; 24 had drops. Median resale prices ranged from $65,700 in Ocala, Fla., to $331,100 in San Francisco.
The top five rises were: Kalamazoo, Mich., 13.6 percent; San Francisco, 13.2 percent; Miami-Hialeah, Fla., 12.9 percent; Boise, Idaho, 12.4 percent, and San Diego, 11.6 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;
Like Beijing, Taiwan Courts Trade Forum

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 12

 BODY:
While international attention has been focused on Beijing's effort to join the World Trade Organization, Taiwan has quietly been moving ahead with its own application.
Representatives of the island, which Beijing considers a renegade province, met formally with trade organization delegates today to report their progress in complying with the market-opening requirements for admission to the 134-member group that makes the rules for international trade. The Taiwan representatives said their administration had essentially fulfilled the requirements. 
 Unstated, however, was the crucial question of whether Taiwan will be able to join before the Chinese Government in Beijing, which is at a much less advanced stage in the application process but has insisted that it must be admitted first.
Taiwan's bid could be completed in July, trade organization officials said. But an approval of its application could develop into a diplomatic confrontation, inflaming the already delicate situation in which China has been avidly seeking admission to the trade organization for a dozen years. Its recent efforts have been complicated by the accidental American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade only weeks after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji lobbied heavily during a trip to the United States for China's acceptance into the W.T.O.
While Beijing officials have suspended human rights and other discussions with the Clinton Administration to protest the bombing, analysts have noted that they did not cut off trade talks, which are a high priority for the rapidly growing economy. Beijing is almost certain to protest if Taiwan gains entry first.
The issue could result in an effort by China's allies among developing countries, which make up the majority of trade organization members, to block Taiwan's admission. All actions at the trade regulatory body are supposed to be taken by general agreement among member countries. That includes the admission of new members.
However, Taiwan's bid could force a vote in the already splintered trade organization, which has been at very public odds in recent weeks over who will be named its next director general.
China's supporters argue that a 1992 "China first" statement agreed to by the trade organization's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, requires that Beijing gain admission before Taiwan.
Taiwan has always maintained that both applications should be evaluated on their merits, and the United States supports that view. Taiwan's negotiator, Yi Fu Lin, said today that "our opinion has been that the two accessions are dealt with separately."
Under the Nationalist Government -- since overthrown and moved to Taiwan, where successors are still in power -- China was among the 23 original signers of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Chinese membership lapsed after the Communist revolution of 1949. Since 1986 Beijing has been seeking to rejoin the trade forum.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS;
Pollin Selling Capitals and Share of the Wizards

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Abe Pollin, who poured millions of dollars into sports franchises that usually let him down by season's end, announced today that he was selling outright his hockey team, the Washington Capitals, and a minority interest in his other holdings, which include the Washington Wizards basketball team.
The price was not disclosed -- "We never talk about money," Pollin said at a news conference -- but it appeared that a partnership that will make the purchase was investing $200 million now with more to come in the future. 
 Pollin, who is 75, said that both his health and personal finances were in good shape but that his two sons had told him they did not want to follow him into the sports business. The recent basketball lockout did not affect his decision, he said.
The principal member of the partnership that is making the purchase, Ted Leonsis, is a billionaire Internet executive and sports buff who has a full-size basketball court at his house.
Asked why he was making the investment, Leonsis said: "Because I can. I love competition. I went to Georgetown University. I was a Hoya." He is a sports fan from Brooklyn who used to root for the Knicks.
Leonsis is an executive at America Online, but he said that there would not be any connection between his sports and computer interests.
Pollin and his wife, Irene, have been known in Washington for their community activity and he said that the sale would allow them more time -- and more money -- for that.
"I have decided to spend a little less time with sports and more with folks less fortunate than I am," Pollin said at the news conference, which was held on the Wizards' practice court in the MCI Center, an arena he built two years ago with $200 million of his own money in downtown Washington. His immediate concerns, he said, were a major campaign by Unicef for relief in Kosovo and helping Washington's homeless.
When asked why he was selling now, he answered, "First, we did not want a repeat of the mess the Redskins went through with their transition."
His reference was to the disposition of the Washington football team after the death of its owner, Jack Kent Cooke. The trustees of the Cooke estate sold the team to one group, only to have the deal fall apart when it became clear that the owners of the National Football League would not approve the buyers.
Although neither Pollin nor Leonsis would say how much the partnership was paying, Leonsis was asked if it was $200 million and he answered: "That's a good number."
One of Leonsis' partners, Jonathan J. Ledecky, confirmed the $200 million estimate and, after Leonsis had declined to provide the breakdown of the new partnership, Ledecky suggested that Leonsis' share was 60 percent, his own 30 percent and that of Dick Patrick, president of the Capitals, 10 percent.
Pollin remains the majority partner in Washington Sports, which owns the Wizards and the MCI Center, and said he hoped to bring another basketball championship to Washington. He said that he expected the new partnership to eventually invest enough to obtain full ownership of his properties -- the two teams, the MCI Center and Ticketmaster.
Pollin's son Robert, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, confirmed later that neither he nor his brother, Jim, who runs a travel business, wanted to follow Pollin as the teams' owners.
Asked whether his father's holdings made economic sense, he said: "Yes. He's got a lot of debt, but he's doing O.K."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BEIJING;
China Pauses As Remains Of Victims Return Home

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 12

 BODY:
The ashes of the three Chinese killed by NATO bombs in Belgrade returned to China today, carried off the airplane by relatives wearing white flowers of mourning in a sad procession shown repeatedly on national television.
Popular anger over the bombing of the Chinese Embassy on Friday was laced with grief. 
 The authorities, seeking to re-channel the outrage of the last four days, halted the raucous demonstrations that had immobilized the American Embassy and urged students and others to concentrate on their own work to help make China stronger.
This morning, the streets around the embassy were quiet, sealed off by hundreds of police officers. Ambassador James Sasser emerged from the embassy for the first time since Saturday.
He and several staff members walked out the front door, picking their way through shards of glass and heaps of plastic bottles, and chunks of concrete that protesters had heaved against the building.
"I think we need to give our Chinese friends a day of grief, and then we can move on and discuss with them how to mend this situation," Mr. Sasser said before visiting the families of American diplomats who have remained all week in nearby foreigners' compounds. Mr. Sasser later returned to work and then left to sleep elsewhere.
For the rest of the week, a skeletal staff will be working in the embassy and consulate buildings, mainly to clean up. The embassy remains officially closed.
The embassy flags were hung at half-staff in respect for the dead. The gesture was shown on Chinese television, another sign that the authorities were hoping to cool passions as they sought deeper remorse and explanations from the United States.
China flew all flags at half-staff as the entire political leadership paid homage to the dead, who are described as heroes and martyrs.
Killed in the bombing, which the United States says was caused by a misidentification of the building, were Shao Yunhuan, 47, a reporter for the official New China News Agency; Xu Xinghu, 31, a reporter for The Guangming Daily newspaper, and his wife, Zhu Ying, 27, an art director for the paper's advertising department.
Also brought home on the plane today were 6 seriously wounded people and 20 who were sleeping in the embassy when it was hit by at least three bombs.
Ms. Shao's 19-year-old son carried her ashes. Her husband, a diplomat, was one of the severely wounded taken off in a stretcher. Ms. Zhu's father carried two boxes of ashes, those of his daughter and of his son-in-law, in the walk past weeping relatives, politicians and hundreds of representatives of social groups.
The procession was officially met by Vice President Hu Jintao, who was shown on television greeting a bandaged man by saying, "On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, I welcome you home and offer you sincere condolences."
This afternoon, private memorial services were held at The Guangming Daily and at the news agency.
The television news tonight showed President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Li Peng, who ranks second in the Communist Party and heads the Parliament, as well as three other top party leaders, visiting the services before they began, shaking hands with grieving relatives.
Alone among the leaders, the usually unflappable Mr. Zhu was visibly sobbing.
As of late today there was no announcement of any larger public service, an event that some feared might set off demands for additional demonstrations.
The Chinese and American Governments have barely begun to assess how far the bombing and the convulsion of anti-Americanism here have damaged relations.
In view of the political climate in Washington, China may be badly mistaken if it tries to use guilt over the bombing to extract deep concessions on vital issues.
Chinese leaders have made it clear that they still seek American trade, investment and technology and that they still want to join the World Trade Organization.
But even before the bombing, powerful industries here had attacked Mr. Zhu for making too many market-opening concessions in negotiations with Washington over the trade organization, putting those talks under a cloud.
China's leaders surely know that after the outburst this week Congress will be in no mood to grant special economic favors.
Nor has it ever been likely that the Clinton Administration could give China the absolute pledge that it seeks that Taiwan will not be included in a hypothetical missile-defense system.
The Chinese, for their part, have suspended talks on arms proliferation and other issues that are of deep concern to the United States, and it is unclear what it will take to get them back to the table.
Still, the two countries have many shared economic interests, and neither wants to see a costly new cold war.
Outside the embassy this morning, Mr. Sasser said he hoped that "we'll move back in the direction of trying to establish a productive and stable relationship between our two countries."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Sellingon the News, Wall St. Recovers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Wall Street flinched, but then quickly brushed off yesterday's announcement that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin was resigning and being replaced by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
Stocks did fall on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average plunging more than 200 points in the morning. Bond prices dipped and the dollar, which was rallying in Europe because of the sudden dismissal of the Russian Prime Minister, gave up some gains. 
 But it did not take long for traders and investors to realize that the resignation news was not that bad and the three markets began to rebound almost immediately. Indeed, President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov had more impact, but it was still muted. While the dollar moved as some investors sought a haven, bond and stock prices fell only moderately in key emerging market countries.
But by the end of the day in the United States, stocks were mostly higher, the dollar rose against the euro and bond prices were little changed.
One reason for the rebound is that Mr. Summers is respected, though his bluntness might mean some volatile trading days when he speaks his mind. Additionally, Clinton Administration policy initiatives -- including support for a strong dollar and open markets, and a focus on the repair of global financial markets -- are not expected to change. The American economy is in good shape and the world financial crisis has subsided.
But more importantly, Wall Street was prepared. Rumors of a Rubin-Summers switch have been circulating for so long that the only uncertainty was the timing of the change. The Treasury went to great lengths to prepare financial markets and investors for the change, even insisting that the cover photograph for a Time magazine article earlier this year on the taming of the global financial crisis include Mr. Summers with Mr. Rubin and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
"This is a move that had long been contemplated," John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said. "And there is no sense that Mr. Summers is untried in directing policy."
Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the change in leadership at the Treasury would not have an effect on his outlook for the stock market. But he did say there would be a "vacuum in the Cabinet" because Mr. Rubin's contributions included more than his Treasury duties.
"His influence and his wisdom covered geopolitical areas and areas of public policy well beyond financial and that is what will be sorely missed," Mr. Wien said.
He also argued that with "the credibility of the Clinton Administration damaged, Mr. Rubin was the one person who had the respect of Congress and the respect of our partners abroad. And it will take a while for Mr. Summers to grow into that."
Jeremy P. Fand, the senior foreign exchange strategist at the BankBoston Corporation, suggested that the appointment of Mr. Summers might even give an extra upward push to the dollar.
"The dollar will benefit from his frankness on the problems with the Japanese and European economies," Mr. Fand said, because his comments will presumably make it clearer to investors why they should be investing in the United States rather than Europe or Japan.
Mr. Fand also said that "the dollar is likely to be more volatile because Mr. Summers will be less controlled with his remarks."
In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.78 points, to 11,000.37. Two oil companies -- Exxon, off 2 9/16 a share, to 79 1/16, and Chevron, down 3, to 95 1/16 -- accounted for most of the Dow's loss as the price of oil fell to $17.57 a barrel, dropping for the fourth time in the last five trading days.
The other major stock indexes ended higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 39.86 points, or 1.55 percent, to 2,606.54, led by Cisco Systems, which reported better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Earnings jumped 33 percent and the stock rose 6 7/8 a share, to 118 3/4.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks set a new closing high, finishing at 1,364.00, up 8.39 points. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks climbed 2.45 points, at 449.26.
The selloff that greeted the Rubin announcement was a reflection that traders cannot take time to assess important news. If it appears to be bad, they have to sell immediately to defend themselves from steep losses. If the news proves to be less worrisome, they can always buy again, even profiting from the decline.
Bond investors remained nervous yesterday ahead of reports on producer and consumer inflation, set for release today and tomorrow respectively, and on retail sales today.
Yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes went much better than Tuesday's five-year note auction, giving the bond market a little lift. The new 10-year note was auctioned at a yield of 5.51 percent; by the end of the day that slipped to 5.50 percent as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 4/32, to 91 30/32, while the yield slipped one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.82 percent yesterday.
The dollar strengthened against the euro, with the euro ending the day at $1.0653, down from $1.0715 on Tuesday. The dollar was off slightly against the Japanese yen, at 120.95 yen compared with 120.97 Tuesday. The dollar did rebound from the intraday low against the yen after the Rubin announcement.
In emerging markets, the Bovespa stock index in Brazil dropped nearly 1 percent, while the Bolsa index in Mexico fell 1.74 percent. The difference -- or spread -- between the yield on Russian bonds and comparable United States Treasuries jumped to 42.73 percent, which reflected a 10 percent drop in prices, according to J. P Morgan Securities. But the moves in Latin American bond markets were much smaller. In Brazil, the spread widened less than a quarter of a percentage point to 8.88 percent.

Since President Clinton took office in 1993, Robert E. Rubin has been the chief architect of the Administration's economic policy. Named Treasury Secretary in 1995, Mr. Rubin has served during an astounding run in the stock market, but the collapse of many emerging markets has flooded the United States with imports, sharply widening the trade gap.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE MILITARY;
Allies Detail Busiest Bombing Yet, but See Clash Continuing

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Senior NATO and Pentagon officials said today that after the most intense 24 hours of bombing so far, NATO had weakened Yugoslavia's forces but still not broken their ability to fight.
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the attacks had exacted "a significant toll on Serb forces in Kosovo and throughout the rest of Yugoslavia," including half of the Yugoslav Air Force and a quarter of tanks and other armored forces in Kosovo. 
 President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia acknowledged today that the NATO attack has caused the deaths of "many members" of its army and police forces.
But General Shelton conceded that the Yugoslav forces could go on for weeks. "It is possible that a force like the one Milosevic is using for ethnic cleansing and terror in Kosovo could hold out for quite some time," he said at a Pentagon briefing.
General Shelton and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen offered a fairly detailed -- and upbeat -- assessment of NATO's campaign in the Balkans, which reached its 50th day today with no sign of nearing an end.
With clear skies, American and allied warplanes have been attacking in wave after wave. Officials said NATO aircraft carried out 327 strikes over the 24 hours leading up to early today, hitting eight bridges, an air-defense command center in the Belgrade suburb of Rakovica, an oil production center in Sombor, in the province of Vojvodina, and five airfields, where they destroyed a MIG-29 and five MIG-21's.
It began early Tuesday with 36 American A-10's and F-16's, British Harriers, French Etendards and Jaguars and others attacking military vehicles around Suva Reka, in south-central Kosovo. And it ended just before dawn today with 24 fighters and bombers, including B-52's, striking sites in Kosovo, including the airfield in the provincial capital of Pristina, and forces around Junik and Stimlje.
Although the campaign has done nothing to reverse the expulsion of much of Kosovo's Albanian population, NATO and Pentagon officials have portrayed the attacks as successful. "I would simply say that the game's not over yet, quite frankly," NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said today when asked to assess the progress so far. "And I don't think we should start writing the history books until the final results are in."
Officials in Brussels and here in Washington continue to report an erosion in morale among Yugoslavia's military leaders, though they have provide little evidence. Other officials have played down the psychological impact of the attacks.
Mr. Cohen said Yugoslavia's senior military leaders had sent their families out of the country.
"Milosevic may not admit that he is taking his country down the road to ruin -- politically, economically and militarily -- but his top leadership is apparently more realistic," he said. "And at the very least, they are hedging their bets by hiding their assets and their families."
Mr. Cohen's aides said they did not have the names of commanders who had sent their families out of the country. Nor could they say how many families they believe have left.
Mr. Cohen and General Shelton vowed to press the attacks -- soon with additional aircraft based in Hungary and Turkey and, perhaps, with Apache helicopter gunships in Albania, which General Shelton indicated were at last ready for combat. Two that crashed have been replaced, bringing the total back to 24.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Milosevic Admits Casualties
 BELGRADE, Serbia, May 12 (Reuters) -- For the first time since the NATO bombing began, President Slobodan Milosevic publicly acknowledged today that his forces had suffered casualties.
The acknowledgment came in a statement read on Serbian television that paid tribute to the "many members" of the country's forces that have been killed.
"I wish to congratulate all the members of the police forces and the security services and to pay tribute to their efforts to defend the security of the fatherland," Mr. Milosevic's statement said.
"In that struggle, many of your members bravely gave their lives, and their sacrifice is a bright example of their heroism and loyalty to their people and fatherland," it said. "You have had great success in breaking the separatists' movement and their terrorist gangs in Kosovo, who are supported by foreign forces who have committed the crime of aggression against our country."

S.E.C. Sweep Uncovers Stock Frauds on Internet
Companies are using the new medium of the Internet for the old-fashioned task of separating investors from their money, promising profits that seem too good to be true, and are according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Their practices were revealed in an S.E.C. enforcement action against 18 people and eight companies in 14 cases of fraud -- the agency's third sweep in seven months of Internet investment scams. Market Place. Page C9.

HEADLINE: A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM: THE NOMINEE;
The Administration's Fiscal Closer

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
When Lawrence H. Summers gives a speech these days, he softens up the audience by facetiously suggesting that he sought advice about what to say from the two men who have served as his mentors the last six years.
"Rubin said to be cautious," Mr. Summers says, referring to the legendary self-control of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, whom he was nominated to succeed today. "And Alan Greenspan," he adds, invoking the name of the Fed chairman who is Mr. Summers's frequent opponent on the tennis courts, "said to be opaque." 
 When he came to Washington six years ago, Lawrence Henry Summers was neither cautious nor opaque.
He arrived with a reputation for brilliance -- the youngest scholar ever to be granted tenure at Harvard, at 28 -- and an equal reputation for intolerance of those he considered slow to grasp the dynamics of an unforgiving global economy.
It was a category into which Mr. Summers placed many Washington politicians, most Japanese and European finance ministers and more than a few of his colleagues in the Clinton Administration. And it regularly got him in trouble, whether the issue was saving Mexico, stabilizing Russia or rewriting the laws governing inheritance taxes.
But the last year or two, a new Larry Summers has emerged -- one who has tamed his sharp-edged wit, who regularly solicits key members of Congress for their advice, who now occasionally acknowledges errors of political judgment.
As he entered the home stretch of his training for the most visible and vital job in managing the world economy, he has become, one close associate at the Treasury said recently, "more Rubin-esqe." A few weeks ago, during a particularly contentious argument at the White House over how to handle the politically explosive issue of China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization, Mr. Summers surprised several Administration officials by prefacing his arguments with a version of Mr. Rubin's oft-used, self-effacing phrase, "It's just one man's opinion, but . . ."
Mr. Summers still has plenty of critics in Washington -- environmentalists who remain suspicious of him after a bitter clash when he was chief economist of the World Bank, bruised State Department hands who clashed with him on how to deal with Japan and Russia, Asian leaders who have termed him a bully and economists who argue that he helped promote the free flow of capital in markets around the world -- and then blamed the countries that couldn't handle the consequences.
But even his harshest critics say the scope and depth of his economic understanding are astounding, to the point that he once pleaded with a reporter that he would like to be described in the newspapers as anything except the "the brilliant but acerbic Larry Summers." And now, at 44, the man who grew up in a family of renowned economists will have roughly 18 months to demonstrate his talents at the helm of the most successful American economy in a generation.
If he succeeds, he will go down in history as the relief pitcher who helped save the one legacy a scandal-ridden President is likely to boast about in his memoirs. If markets crash and economies collapse, both Mr. Summers's grasp of the new forces of the global economy and his newly developed diplomatic skills will face their greatest test.
"A few years ago, people would have questioned whether Larry had the gravitas to match his incredible talents, whether he could be less of an academic and more of a Washington player," one of Mr. Summers's close friends, Daniel Tarullo, who left the White House last year, said today. "You don't hear that kind of thing anymore. He has learned Bob's greatest capacity: to be sure about some things, and to be aware of what he is not sure of, too."
As he sipped a cup of coffee in his private dining room at the Treasury late this afternoon, Mr. Rubin was asked whether Mr. Summers could calm the markets on a calamitous day, as Mr. Rubin himself did from the steps of the Treasury after a 500-point drop in the Dow in October 1997, the early days of the Asian crisis. He thought about the question for a moment and then said that "in the last year or so -- maybe the last couple of years -- Larry has developed a great deal of credibility." The markets, he said, "are now comfortable with him."
But Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers are clearly not comfortable about the markets. Mr. Summers cringes these days when he hears the confident-sounding tone of Wall Street executives as they talk about a Dow that could reach 15,000 or more and refer to the problems of Japan and the emerging markets in the past tense. "We have nothing to fear," Mr. Summers warns these days, with no apologies to Franklin D. Roosevelt, "except the lack of fear itself."
Managing excess fear and excess optimism was not part of Mr. Summers's academic preparation, but it has become very much a part of his life for the last six years -- years of applying what he called "battlefield medicine" for a world financial system that is undergoing wrenching change.
He has come to advocate something he often calls the "financial Powell doctrine," a derivative of former Gen. Colin Powell's argument that if the United States commits forces, it must do so to win. Similarly, Mr. Summers argues after the experiences of Mexico and the Asian crisis, if the choice is made to pour money into a country to save it from default and restore the confidence of investors, it must be done decisively. The middle ground, he often argues, is treacherous and results in propping up an economy only long enough for the rich to get their capital out of the country.
But he also recognizes that saving a country with cash often takes the pressure off policy makers to reform. And so Mr. Summers has often been the Treasury's heavy hand, arriving in foreign capitals to deliver the news that they must take unpleasant steps -- closing banks, ending crony capitalism, curbing corruption -- in return for aid from the International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is the leading voice.
He has angered many along the way -- Asians who wanted more money and fewer conditions, Europeans who wanted to apply more conditions and less money. "What's easy to miss is that a lot of innovations in the financial system that we've adopted in recent years come from Larry and the Treasury," said Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the I.M.F., who counted Mr. Summers among his students at M.I.T.
It was while he was finishing his doctorate that Mr. Summers, perpetually the disheveled-looking graduate student as he roamed around Cambridge, Mass., was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He went through a year of intense chemotherapy and has been in remission ever since, though the experience seemed to drive him to live life a bit harder, to stack up his accomplishments even faster.
He was snapped up by the Harvard economics department and garnered awards for his work at a startling pace. He moved on to the World Bank in 1991, where he succeeded Mr. Fischer as chief economist and oversaw a long study -- one that would be written very differently now -- about the causes of the East Asian economic miracle.
It was also there that he ran into trouble, publishing a paper that included the observation that "the economic logic of dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable." It raised a firestorm with enviromentalists, including Al Gore, and Mr. Summers has worked hard -- and apparently successfully -- to work his way back into the Vice President's confidence.
The toxic-waste incident also, it later became clear, showed a different side of Mr. Summers. The paper was written by an aide, who volunteered to take responsibility for it. Mr. Summers refused, the aide later recalled, insisting that since he had signed off on it, he had to take responsibility for it.
Mr. Summers returned briefly to academia before he and his wife, Victoria, now a tax lawyer at the I.M.F., returned to Washington so that he could become Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. He was often juggling cellular phone calls to finance ministers around the world with the tasks of entertaining three young children: twin girls, Pam and Ruth, now 8, and a son, Harry, who is 5. All three were playing late this afternoon in Mr. Summers's Treasury office as reporters and well-wishers stopped by.
Mr. Summers's first real conflicts with Congress came over the Mexico crisis, when he often jousted with former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and frequently angered members of Congress with what they viewed as a significant lack of deference. He once referred to Republican efforts to sharply cut inheritance taxes for the rich as "greed," starting a small firestorm.
He was put in charge of solving the problems at the Internal Revenue Service, but his critics say he began serious reforms only after bruising Congressional hearings into I.R.S. mismanagement and abuses. He is co-chairman of the Administration's working group on Social Security, and the inventor of the Treasury's inflation-indexed bonds, bought by cautious investors who want a return adjusted for inflation.
Mr. Rubin often enjoyed tweaking Mr. Summers for his absent-minded ways, missing airplanes, or his focus on his cell phone instead of what was happening in front of him. Once, on the way to a mission to Indonesia last year to persuade President Suharto to accept financial reforms, Mr. Summers was pleasantly surprised when a passenger came up to him and said, "Excuse me, are you Lawrence Summers?"
The Deputy Treasury Secretary straightened himself, happy to be recognized. "Yes I am," he said. "I thought so," said the passenger, handing him something. "I just found your passport."

HEADLINE: A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM: THE RESIGNATION;
Rubin Resigning as Treasury Secretary

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the chief architect of the Clinton Administration's economic policy during one of the strongest periods of American prosperity in decades as well as financial turmoil abroad, announced today that he was resigning.
President Clinton said he would nominate as Mr. Rubin's successor Lawrence H. Summers, currently the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. His selection was intended, White House officials said, as a clear signal to the markets that there would be continuity in both economic policy and the management of a fragile global economic system. 
 Mr. Summers, a former Harvard professor, has served as the day-to-day manager of a succession of international financial crises that have rocked the global economy over the last three years. Page C1.
While the stock market dropped 200 points when word circulated this morning that Mr. Rubin's departure was imminent, the Dow Jones average closed the day down only 25.78 points.
A fiscal conservative who managed to move the Democratic Party toward a new embrace of free markets, Mr. Rubin was almost universally praised on Wall Street, Capitol Hill and in many foreign financial centers as a stabilizing influence on the financial markets and on the erratic Clinton White House.
But in the world's emerging markets, particularly in Asia, the view is quite different. When the Asian crisis hit in 1997, many people there protested the Rubin-Summers brew of high interest rates and major cuts in Government spending that were the prerequisite for American-backed aid from the International Monetary Fund. Those policies, many in Asia argued, led to high unemployment and a more severe recession from which a number of countries are still struggling to recover.
Moreover, some economists contend that the Treasury Department's prescription of rapid globalization of markets may have carried the seeds of many of the difficulties that emerged in Asia and elsewhere because they proceeded too fast without adequate safeguards.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers -- and many outside economists -- argue that the free movement of capital encourages growth and that the formula for recovery is working. Two of the nations have bounced back rapidly, Thailand and South Korea. But Indonesia and Russia remain mired in economic chaos, for which they blame Washington's unbridled market philosophy and for which Washington blames their own political instability.
At home, though, Mr. Rubin, 60, has been viewed as an anchor for the White House. Time and again the President's populist political advisers clashed with Mr. Rubin on matters of tax policy and budgetary discipline. Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that whatever credibility he had with Wall Street and fiscal conservatives he owed largely to Mr. Rubin and his economic philosophy of budgetary restraint, which helped fuel the market's astounding rise.
Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, who frequently clashed with Mr. Rubin on tax cuts and other issues, said: "Of all the officials in the Clinton Administration, he has had more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any other official. He will certainly be missed."
While Mr. Rubin's advice usually won the day in Administration policy debates, he remained insulated from the President's political travails and personal scandals. Often, from his office in the Treasury, he would gesture out the window to the East Wing of the White House and talk about the chaos "over there," making it clear that he intended to keep his distance.
"This has been a remarkable experience, but I was ready to go, ready to return to New York," Mr. Rubin said late this afternoon, in the dining room behind his office. He said he had "only some very vague plans" about what to do next, though he ruled out seeking elective office, a step many Democrats in New York had urged him to consider.
His resignation comes as the stock market is at an all-time high and global financial turmoil appears to have waned, though perhaps only temporarily. Mr. Rubin, one senior White House official joked at the Rose Garden ceremony where Mr. Clinton lauded him, "made his fortune selling at the top of the market."
He was never one of the President's confidants, and freely said so. But he enjoyed enormous freedom within the Administration -- including the responsibility to navigate the United States through some of the scariest episodes in recent world financial history, particularly when the world financial architecture seemed on the brink of seizing up last September.
"He built a spirit and a belief that we could actually make this economy what it ought to be for our people," Mr. Clinton said today in the Rose Garden ceremony, which turned into a reunion of former Clinton Administration officials who had returned to bid Mr. Rubin farewell. "That will be his enduring achievement -- along with the fact that everybody believed as long as he was Secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen."
Mr. Rubin said he had the privilege to serve during a period of remarkable economic growth and praised the President for helping to balance the Federal budget and understanding the degree to which global forces were reshaping the American economy.
Mr. Clinton was effusive in his praise of Mr. Summers, who many in the Administration had initially regarded as too brash and outspoken to become Mr. Rubin's successor. But those doubts have washed away as Mr. Summers has been groomed for the job, and today the President called him "more than ready to steer our nation through the strong and sometimes turbulent currents of the new economy."
The President also said he would nominate Stuart E. Eizenstat to succeed Mr. Summers in the No. 2 post at the Treasury. Mr. Eizenstat, who served in the Carter White House, is now Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and coordinator of the effort to force Swiss banks and other European institutions that once cooperated with Nazi Germany to compensate Holocaust victims whose assets were seized during World War II. Mr. Clinton said Mr. Eizenstat would continue to play that role in his new post.
Mr. Rubin came to know Mr. Clinton in 1991, and soon signed on as both an adviser and fund-raiser for the 1992 Presidential campaign. His first post was as head of a newly created institution, the National Economic Council, which he used to arbitrate among the conflicting voices in the Administration -- and to battle with political advisers who wanted to spend billions of dollars in new Federal money on a variety of social programs to fulfill campaign promises. Mr. Rubin insisted that deficit reduction must come first, provoking a fierce struggle for the President's mind that he ultimately won.
Paul Begala, a campaign adviser, warned in early 1993 that Mr. Rubin's conservative fiscal approach might reduce the deficit and win the respect of Wall Street, but it would be politically devastating for Mr. Clinton among traditional Democratic voters.
"Rubin was right, but I was right, too," Mr. Begala said today. The economy soared -- and the Democrats lost control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
"It became a standing joke between us," Mr. Begala said. "He was just a lot happier about it."
In early 1995, Mr. Rubin became Treasury Secretary -- and was immediately propelled into a crisis. The Mexican peso collapsed, and many feared an economic disaster there would spill over America's southern border and perhaps inflame the rest of Latin America. Congress refused to back a bailout, so Mr. Rubin persuaded the President that he had to act on his own authority, ultimately lending $12 billion to Mexico from an obscure exchange-rate fund under the Treasury's control. It was a high-risk gamble that ultimately paid off; Mexico has largely recovered, and its reforms, part of the deal, helped inoculate it from the financial earthquake to come.
Mr. Rubin's dominance of the Mexico debate accelerated the shift of foreign policy-making to the Treasury from the State Department. In some ways that transition seemed natural in a post-cold war world driven as much by the rapid movement of capital as by the traditional balance of military power. But it led to many internal conflicts, in places as far-ranging as Indonesia and Russia, where America's diplomatic interests and its economic interests often diverged.
Mr. Rubin was cautious about committing American funds, perhaps too cautious in the case of Thailand, the first Asian country hit by what became known as the "Asian contagion." To this day, Thais chafe at the fact that the Treasury refused to come to their aid. There were constant arguments over how to help Russia, and how fiercely to publicly criticize a longtime ally, Japan.
In all these arguments the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, often seemed to steer clear of entanglements with Mr. Rubin -- perhaps calculating that she would not win. But some State department officials argue that the Treasury's growing powers led to a bias toward a market-driven foreign policy. And many critics argue that Mr. Rubin was too cautious in containing the power of markets after the Asian crisis.
The nation's domestic economic performance will also be part of his legacy, resulting both from his early demand for fiscal caution and from extraordinary good luck. When Mr. Clinton took office, domestic unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the nation's budget deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones industrial average was below 4,000 points.
Unemployment now stands at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a budget surplus estimated at $79 billion this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for the first time, creating a huge pool of new wealth for tens of millions of Americans.
In part, Mr. Rubin's power emanated from an uncanny ability to disarm, matched with an unexpected talent for political manipulation. After the shutdown of the Government in 1995, he spent months fencing with a Republican majority that threatened not to increase the debt limit -- the Treasury's authority to borrow. For a while it seemed as if the United States might actually default on some debt payments, a prospect Mr. Rubin deftly put on the shoulders of the Republicans. They backed down.
There were constant struggles over the budget: Republicans in Congress and members of the White House wanted to cut taxes while Mr. Rubin wanted to concentrate on eliminating the budget deficit and paying down the national debt. J. Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House, noted today that "Secretary Rubin and I disagreed on many things, mainly the importance tax cuts play in keeping our economy growing."
"But," he added, "we also agreed on many things, and he generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of the Clinton-Gore Administration in check."
But Mr. Rubin's biggest challenge was to grapple with the forces of the global economy and the risks that they posed to the United States and the markets that were his world. His strategizing on this subject often came at a weekly breakfast and occasional dinner with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Mr. Summers.
This afternoon Mr. Rubin recalled one of those dinners, in December 1997, when South Korea appeared on the verge of default and many wondered whether its collapse would damage much of Japan and the rest of Asia. "It was one of the scariest moments," Mr. Rubin said, describing how a plan was put together to get the world's major banks to keep South Korea whole.
Mr. Greenspan, never particularly effusive about anything, said of Mr. Rubin today, "He has been one of the most effective Secretaries of the Treasury in this nation's history." And he praised Mr. Summers as "a person of extraordinary talent and judgment, who will continue the important work Bob Rubin initiated."

HEADLINE: Oh, to Be Down and Out Living on the Bowery;
Artists' Cheap Lofts, Found Decades Ago, Are Threatened by Development Project

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Forty years ago, decades before stretch limousines choked the Bowery, discharging luminaries lured to the Bowery Bar, long before it was remotely hip to live on the Lower East Side, much less Skid Row, Kate Millett moved to what she dubs the "street of sorrows."
"When my mother first visited me, she stepped out of the cab, over the bluejeaned hippies and the drunks passed out on the sidewalk and wept," Ms. Millett, the feminist author and artist, recalled recently, her gray, shoulder-length hair brushing her face as she laughed. 
 Ms. Millett sat in a wooden chair in the kitchen of her second Bowery residence, a 2,400-square-foot loft the city moved her to 26 years ago after her previous rental was condemned. The massive fifth floor apartment is where she lives; her art studio, also 2,400 square feet and awash in white, is two floors down.
Ms. Millett was chain-smoking Marlboros.
"I adore where I live," she said, lighting up. "I love nesting."
Who wouldn't? She rents both lofts from the city for the impossible sum of $500 a month.
But Ms. Millett, 64, may find herself in a new dwelling soon. The building at 295 Bowery, also home to two other artists, a curator and two children, is scheduled to be razed and its tenants relocated because the city wants to tear it down to make room for an urban renewal project that has been in the works since 1971.
Having slowly acquired chunks of property during the last 25 years over a large swath of the Lower East Side, the city is finally poised to select a developer at the end of the summer for the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Project, which would cover three and a half acres. The project would include 450 market rate apartments, 150 low income dwellings, and a 30,000-square-foot community center with a gymnasium and a pool.
Not surprisingly, Ms. Millett and the other residents are not moving without a fight. Having failed to win landmark status for the 136-year-old building -- which has quite a storied history, in a sordid sort of way -- the tenants are looking into gaining historic district designation for the entire length of the Bowery, from Confucius Plaza at its south, to Cooper Square, at its northernmost end. And they have submitted to the city an alternative development plan that would spare 295 Bowery. In addition, the city also has yet to find replacement housing for them, a process that could drag on.
That the city's ambitious plans may hinge on, or at the least be inconvenienced by, 295 Bowery could be viewed as either curious or fitting, given the transformation of the thoroughfare and the small building itself.
The building had been a hotel during the Civil War, catering to returning soldiers. By the 1890's it was a brothel and a dive where it is said a half-dozen destitute courtesans drank carbolic acid and died. John H. McGurk, the owner of the saloon on the ground floor, then capitalized on the notoriety of the place by renaming it McGurk's Suicide Hall.
Later, beginning in World War I and continuing into the 50's and early 60's, it was a flophouse for Skid Row veterans. In the mid-60's it was converted into artists' studios.
Despite this colorful past, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission denied landmark status to the building, finding that it did not have sufficient historical, cultural or architectural merit.
But the neighborhood is a far cry from what it was when Ms. Millett and her neighbors first moved in. Real estate there is ablaze. The area is dripping with funky shops, restaurants, cafes and night spots and the price of apartment rentals rivals that of other Manhattan neighborhoods.
So the loft-dwellers of 295 Bowery are not evoking much sympathy. Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents the area, said that the building's tenants knew when they moved in that one day they would have to vacate because the property was part of a project born 28 years ago.
"I would hate to see this proposal fall flat because of a few people," Ms. Freed said. "They put a lot of money in their lofts, but they knew it was not their property."
From the outside, the building looks like any other dowdy tenement, with its faded brick facade and a touch of graffiti. But inside, the rambling lofts have been transformed by their artists in residence.
"When I came here, it was dark and dirty, with no windows in the front, just openings covered with tins; no bathroom except for a toilet, no heat and no kitchen," said Ms. Millett, whose living quarters now are filled with three Franklin stoves, a wealth of antiques, and shelves upon shelves of books.
The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development says it will relocate the tenants, but exactly where is not yet known. The city is obligated to move the residents into comparable space, and a statement released by the housing agency says the new dwelling must be "decent, safe and sanitary." But it is not required that the rent remain the same, nor that the apartment be in the same condition. Tenants, the statement said, can get rental assistance if they meet eligibility requirements.
Ms. Millett's downstairs neighbor and longtime friend, Sophie Keir, denied that she and her neighbors knew that the building would one day be leveled. Ms. Millett moved in after her former residence on the Bowery was razed. "Why would they put her in a building that was going to be demolished, too?" asked Ms. Keir, a sculptor and furniture maker who has lived for 20 years in the second-floor loft. She added that the artist Michael Bakaty -- who lives on the fourth floor with his wife, Yvonne Muranushi, and two young sons, Zoli, 5, and Kaz, 2 -- was living in the building 30 years ago when it was privately owned.
The Bakatys, who pay $300 a month for rent, have erected a warren of rooms in their apartment. "I love this place," said Ms. Muranushi, a curator. "Both my children were born here with a midwife right there on the sofa."
But the housing preservation department says the Cooper Square project is moving forward. The city agency will issue a request for proposals sometime this spring and expects to have a developer chosen by the end of summer.
Over the years, 400 households were relocated temporarily or permanently because of the urban renewal plan, said Valerio Orselli, a member of the Cooper Square Committee, an arm of the plan.
Mr. Orselli said that five years ago the tenants of 295 Bowery were shown alternative spaces at 267 Bowery, which they rejected. Residents say they were shown the space with a flashlight because there was no electricity. "We asked to see it in daylight," Ms. Millett said. "That never happened."
Mr. Orselli said the city planned to renovate 267 Bowery. "We were going to put in solid wood floors, windows, everything," he said. Other artists have since purchased it.
Under the plan, the city will also demolish commercially occupied buildings at 291, 293 and 311 Bowery. That worries Sam Kahn, a co-owner of Stanton Trading Corporation, a restaurant supply company. "There's no good end to this for us," said Mr. Kahn, whose business occupies 291 and 293 Bowery and the ground floor of the loft building. "We're in something of a pickle."
The housing committee of Community Board 3 passed a motion that any proposals for new construction should contain space for Stanton Trading, which has been on the Bowery for 40 years, Mr. Kahn said.
Late last month, Ms. Keir presented her own proposal to the community board. Under her plan, the 600 apartments planned by the urban renewal project would be built, but 295 Bowery would be spared. The board unanimously passed a resolution urging the housing department to examine the plan as a possible alternative when proposals flow in. Ms. Keir has also presented the plan directly to the housing department.
And the residents are still researching the street's unsavory past, hoping to be designated a historic district.
"I would hate not to have a Bowery address," said Ms. Millett. "It's the street of truth, so to speak."

HEADLINE: A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM: THE TRUSTED DEPUTY;
Veteran Who Strides Into Thickets of Trade Policy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton became the first Democrat in a dozen years to move into the White House, the party's cognoscenti saw the treatment of Stuart E. Eizenstat as a sign of the young Administration's disdain for the political skills of the old crowd of former top aides to Jimmy Carter.
Mr. Eizenstat, who had been President Carter's chief policy maker for his domestic agenda and then spent the Reagan and Bush years on the sidelines at a large law firm, was sent by President Clinton to Brussels, where he had the relatively obscure post of ambassador to the European Union. 
 Slowly, Mr. Eizenstat demonstrated to the President that he could be trusted to handle sensitive assignments, and after tackling many of the most difficult trade issues as a high-ranking official at both the State Department and Commerce Department, it was hardly surprising that Mr. Clinton would turn to him today to become the next Deputy Treasury Secretary, one of the most important economic policy jobs in Washington.
Mr. Eizenstat was praised by aides and friends for having a mind for the mind-numbing minutiae of trade policy but who can also see the bigger picture. His assignments from Mr. Clinton have included negotiating with the Swiss Government and banks over reparations for Holocaust victims, dealing with the Europeans over threatened trade sanctions for foreign companies doing business with Cuba, leading the American delegation to the global warming conference in Kyoto, Japan, and resolving a difficult shipping dispute with Japan.
"Stu has handled many of our nation's most difficult missions over the last six years, from our successful efforts to lift food and medicine sanctions on trading partners -- or nontrading partners -- to the struggle for justice in compensation on behalf of the victims of the Holocaust, an endeavor he will continue," President Clinton said today in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. "With his legendary grasp of policy and the art of practical government, his long experience, his stamina and his steady judgment, he will be a vital, full member of our economic team."
Stuart Elliott Eizenstat was born in Chicago on Jan. 15, 1943. After graduating from the University of North Carolina and Harvard Law School, he landed a job as a junior aide to President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 and worked the next year as research director for the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Hubert H. Humphrey.
Before joining the Carter Administration, he became a partner in the Washington office of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, a large Atlanta law firm, and his clients included several large American and foreign companies with trade issues pending in Washington.
Away from work, Mr. Eizenstat is known for dedication to religion and religious causes. A practicing Jew who leaves his office early enough on Fridays to observe the Sabbath, he once had President Carter to his home for a Passover seder. He also took his own china to Belgium and raised tens of thousands of dollars in private donations to refurbish the kitchen of the American Embassy in Brussels to make it kosher.
One question that emerges from today's appointment will be how Mr. Eizenstat, who had his share of turf fights during both the Carter and Clinton Administrations, will get along with Lawrence H. Summers, who was nominated as the next Treasury Secretary. Explaining Mr. Eizenstat's success both in government and in private practice, Simon Lazarus 3d, a close friend and former law partner, said, "He is relentless in trying to prevail."
"He is so determined that he finds it physically painful to lose," Mr. Lazarus said. Mr. Summers is known to be similarly strong-willed, leading some officials to wonder today how the two men would work together.

HEADLINE: A NEW ECONOMIC TEAM: THE POLICY IMPACT;
A Key Architect Of Prosperity

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
There is a case to be made that his approach worsened the global financial crisis of the last few years. He could be politically tone-deaf, as when he initially resisted efforts in Congress a year and half ago to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service. At times he was stubborn and turf-conscious, traits on display in his continuing battle with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to preserve the Treasury Department's powers as a bank regulator.
But the enduring reality about Robert E. Rubin is that he was consistently the most influential voice in shaping economic policy through more than six years in which the economy performed remarkably well, bringing great benefits to the United States and incalculable political advantage to his boss, President Clinton. 
 By the time he announced his resignation today as Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin stood second only to Mr. Greenspan as the embodiment of American economic solidity in a world that has been roiled by financial instability and accompanying political upheaval. "It's hard to argue with success, and his success has been extraordinary," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
Mr. Rubin both reflected and encouraged the economic ethos of the 1990's, bringing to Washington from his background on Wall Street a deep understanding of the power of the financial markets and a distrust of ideology.
Mr. Rubin is certain to rank among the most important Treasury Secretaries of the last century, if only because of the magnitude of two crises that confronted him: Mexico's near-meltdown in 1994-95 and the financial turmoil that swept out of Asia and into other regions of the world in the last two years.
In both cases, his responses -- though successful in the sense that the problems were ultimately contained -- remain the subject of vigorous debate among economists. Critics say he achieved his goal of calming global currency and stock markets at the cost of plunging millions of people in developing nations into poverty through the policies he prescribed of high interest rates and reduced government spending. Others say his advocacy of the free flow of capital across national borders helped set off the financial crises two years ago.
But his most enduring legacy may prove to be his success in convincing Wall Street and much of the country -- as well as his own party -- that fiscal and monetary austerity could be compatible with the progressive aims of a Democratic Administration. As chairman of the National Economic Council when President Clinton first took office, Mr. Rubin played a critical role in persuading him that a credible deficit-reduction policy would lower interest rates and create jobs.
"He put fiscal austerity on the screen as one of the lodestars of economic policy," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Rubin also argued in favor of free trade against protectionist interest groups within the party. Despite a large and growing trade deficit, he maintained a policy of keeping the dollar strong, helping to hold down inflation and making the United States even more of a magnet for foreign investment. And he counseled a hands-off approach toward the Federal Reserve, giving Mr. Greenspan free rein on inflation.
Given his Wall Street ties, as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, and his personal wealth, Mr. Rubin's leanings on social policy may seem surprisingly liberal. He cautioned against turning Social Security into a gamble on the stock market. He supported the 1993 tax increase on the wealthy that was at the heart of the Administration's early deficit-reduction efforts, and he fought Republican tax cuts with the argument that they did too little for working people and the poor.
But for the most part Mr. Rubin was seen even by Republicans as a steady hand on the tiller, a market-oriented pragmatist who inspired confidence if not agreement with all his policies.
Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, praised Mr. Rubin for having been "a good stabilizing force in the world economy."
Still, he had his share of critics. Stephen Moore, of the libertarian Cato Institute, said conservatives had always been wary of Mr. Rubin because of his willingness to raise taxes in 1993 and his unwillingness since then to cut them. "He's got an anti-supply-side mentality, and it's always puzzled me why that is," Mr. Moore said. "It may be guilt from making all that money."
His performance on the world stage has come under even sharper review, and not just by conservatives. Although the bailout of Mexico that he orchestrated restored economic calm there, many economists think it may have planted the seeds of the Asian crisis that sprouted two and a half years later.
The bailout's primary feature was to rescue investors who had bet on Mexican bonds and stood to lose fortunes. And that sent a signal to investors that they had nothing to fear from debt problems in emerging markets, some economists said, encouraging a further, large-scale flow of money into developing countries that their financial systems were unequipped to handle.
Throughout his tenure, Mr. Rubin also encouraged the free flow of capital around the world by pressing countries to drop trade barriers and open their banking systems to global competition. In hindsight, even some former Clinton Administration officials said, they and Mr. Rubin may have missed the potential dangers of allowing investors to unleash huge pools of cash into less developed countries at the touch of a computer button.
When Thai devaluation in July 1997 spread gradually throughout Asia and on to Russia and Latin America, Mr. Rubin took the lead in developing not just the Administration's response but also the International Monetary Fund's. Together, the United States and the fund imposed high interest rates and tight budget policies on countries mired in the crisis to restore currency stability and calm markets. But austerity sent the affected economies into deep economic slumps, from which many are only now emerging.
But at least they are emerging, however tentatively. And perhaps most important for Mr. Rubin's reputation, the United States was never hit hard by either the crisis in Mexico or the global financial turmoil.
Mr. Rubin came to the Administration a stranger to the ways of Washington and to Mr. Clinton. But it was a measure of the influence and respect he has gained that even before his departure was announced today, there were rumors that he would be selected to fill the only shoes in economic policy circles larger than his own -- those of Alan Greenspan, whose current term as Fed chairman expires in 13 months.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: CHINA'S MOOD;
Rage at U.S. Is Sign of Deeper Issues

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 12

 BODY:
Most ordinary people in China have a double-barreled view of the United States, filtered by sharply competing emotions: admiration and suspicion, hope and fear, love and hate.
A powerful surge of anti-American sentiment was unleashed after last week's bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade, sending rocks, bottles and slogans at the American Embassy here. The protests grew to become the largest anti-foreign demonstrations since the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's. 
 Led by students, fanned by a Government eager to take advantage of nationalist emotion, the demonstrations reflected a resentment toward the United States that feeds on China's mixture of wounded pride, desire for influence commensurate with its size and shame at its nagging poverty and intractable politics.
In the 20 years since China began its reform program, many Chinese people have openly pointed to American democracy, wealth and technology as models they want to follow. Yet during those same years, and long beforehand, the same people have harbored grave suspicions about the United States, often seeing anti-China conspiracies and often taking deep offense at what they regard as signs of disrespect.
Today, students, business executives and government employees agree that the surge of anti-Americanism is more than just an emotional reaction to the killing of three Chinese citizens in the bombing. Instead, it represents an attempt to rally national pride, set off by a widespread belief that the embassy bombing was an intentional effort by the United States to cow China into submission for not supporting NATO's campaign in Yugoslavia.
"We are a very old and traditional nation," said Wang Yizheng, a government employee. "If you do not show us respect, we will hate you."
Personally, Mr. Wang seems to have a drastically divided position toward the United States. He is proud that his 18-year-old daughter led her classmates in an anti-American demonstration, and yet he seemed equally proud that she plans to apply to study in the United States next year.
Is that not hypocritical?
Mr. Wang was not fazed by the question.
"People will tell you they are demonstrating to send a message to America," he said. "In reality, they are demonstrating to feel good, to respect themselves. Going to America to study, I don't see any contradiction."
China's state-run news media, rarely so in tune with popular opinion on a strident political issue, have encouraged general outrage at the United States. The most sensitive and effective heartstring the press seems able to pull is the issue of national pride.
"Chinese people cannot be bullied," People's Daily wrote in an editorial that was published today. "China is a sovereign country and its dignity is not easily infringed upon."
Perhaps the most pungent symbol of China's wildly fluctuating views of the United States is President Clinton, who was lionized before and after his visit here last year.
Mr. Clinton was admired in part for his support of an engagement policy toward China against stiff opposition from Congress, but also, many Chinese say, for his good looks. In several popular books Mr. Clinton was roundly praised by Chinese historians as one of the greatest American Presidents ever.
This week, President Clinton is being likened to Hitler, denounced by protesters as a fascist and an imperialist. This appears to have less to do with Mr. Clinton personally than it does with his role as the Commander in Chief in a military action that ordinary Chinese generally see as unjustified and misguided.
Indeed, the seeds for this week's explosion of public outrage were sown in recent weeks by NATO's bombing campaign. Unable to see what direct benefit the United States can gain from opposing Serbian aggression in Kosovo, many Chinese seem convinced that the United States has broader military aims.
"America is acting like an arrogant bully," said Mou Jianmin, a former reporter for the New China News Agency who now runs a computer company. "I've been talking with many friends about it, and we are asking: What is America's real aim? Is it really to protect Kosovars? Or is it to strengthen NATO? Or is it really a way to get at Russia?"
Though China's press has offered carefully filtered accounts of the war, reporting that the sufferings of the Kosovo Albanians had largely been caused by NATO bombing, Mr. Mou insisted that China's limited press was not a major factor in shaping the resentment and anger many people feel.
"I know some Westerners think we are only acting this way because we have limited information, but that's ridiculous," Mr. Mou said. "We feel very strongly."
One of the surprising aspects of the demonstrations was the way some demonstrators chanted "Long Live Chairman Mao!" The authorities have a deeply ambivalent attitude toward Mao, fully repudiating his fanatical politics while praising his dominant role in modern Chinese history.
Yet to students trying to rally national pride, Mao represents the Communist Party leader with the most courage and flair.
"Mao was the only Chinese leader who really dared to stand up to anyone," said Han Weiping, an economics student from People's University. "He was afraid of no one."
Reluctant to directly criticize today's leadership, Mr. Han chose instead to praise Mao.
"I'm just saying that Mao was great," he said. "He was very anti-American."
Although few Americans in Beijing have been the victims of violence, many who have witnessed demonstrations were challenged or threatened by boisterous crowds. Many gave false nationalities when asked where they were from.
"It takes so little to scratch the surface and bring out xenophobia in this country," said a Chinese businesswoman who has lived in the United States. "I feel it, too. It's my first impulse, before I stop and think about it."
It is unpredictable where the current surge in anti-Americanism will lead. Yet this businesswoman said she fears that the sentiment is so deeply felt and so widespread that it will have an immeasurable effect on the role of foreign businesses in China.
Lu Xun, perhaps China's best-known essayist of the 20th century, once wrote that in a country that was isolated for centuries, that suffered at the hands of foreign aggressors, and that carried a deep sense of its own lost greatness and of envy for modern powers, it may be unavoidable that many ordinary Chinese people have trouble seeing foreigners evenly.
"We look up to foreigners as gods, or down at them as animals, but never equally, as people."

HEADLINE: Attack Ads Roil Mayoral Contest in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 12

 BODY:
It was the kind of day politicians locked in a close race only dream of. John F. Street, the former City Council president who is one of five Democrats running for mayor of Philadelphia, awoke on Tuesday morning to a long and "heartfelt endorsement" in the city's largest newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer.
The editorial endorsement not only urged Philadelphians to vote for Mr. Street in the primary next Tuesday but also begged them -- "please, please" -- to not vote for one of his closest competitors, Marty Weinberg, a wealthy lawyer who was once an adviser to Frank L. Rizzo when he was Mayor from 1972 to 1980. In a stinging rebuke, the endorsement called Mr. Weinberg the worst candidate in the field, based on his association with the controversial Mr. Rizzo. 
 Later in the day, Mr. Street was at a news conference with construction union leaders, who presented him with a check for $100,000. Opening the envelope, he looked genuinely surprised. "I knew it was going to be a check," Mr. Street said. "This is unbelievable." He said it was the largest donation he had received.
In a rough-and-tumble campaign to succeed Mayor Edward G. Rendell, a popular Democrat who is barred by the city charter from serving a third consecutive term, Mr. Street, 55, appears to be sailing along as the front-runner, little concerned by the efforts of four other Democrats and one Republican to overtake him. Altogether, the six candidates have raised nearly $15 million, a record for Philadelphia.
Under Mr. Rendell's leadership for the past eight years, Philadelphia has reinvented itself as a vibrant city that has grown in sophistication without losing its characteristic grit and feistiness. Chronic budget deficits of previous administrations have turned into annual surpluses, and economic development abounds.
In a reflection of Philadelphia's progress, the Republican Party plans to hold its national convention in this overwhelmingly Democratic city next year.
In general, all the Democratic candidates have campaigned on the urgent need to continue the progress of the Rendell administration by improving the public schools, maintaining fiscal restraint, expanding economic development into the neighborhoods and lowering crime rates.
Even Sam Katz, who is trying to become the city's first Republican mayor since 1952 and faces no opposition in the primary, is making the same points.
But in recent weeks, the race for the Democratic nomination seems to be tightening a bit, based on a number of polls.
Despite the Mayor's strong support of Mr. Street, Mr. Weinberg, 62, and John White Jr., 50, who once led the city's public housing agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare, appear to be narrowing Mr. Street's lead.
State Representative Dwight Evans, 44, and Happy Fernandez, 60, a former council member, are widely viewed as long-shot challengers.
Perhaps not coincidentally, the campaign dynamics began changing last month, when the candidates began broadcasting a flurry of attack ads, the most caustic from Mr. Weinberg. They underscore how close to the surface the issue of race is in a city where Mr. Rizzo is remembered as a divisive force and voters often cast ballots along racial lines.
As the only white candidate among the three leading contenders, Mr. Weinberg is counting heavily on a strong turnout among what he describes as "row-house voters," essentially, white working- and middle-class residents who constitute about half the electorate.
Aides to other candidates say Mr. Weinberg's calculation is that if the three black candidates -- Mr. Street, Mr. White and Mr. Evans -- split the black vote, he can prevail. Ms. Fernandez, who is white, is not expected to win enough white voters to affect Mr. Weinberg.
Playing on that equation, Mr. Weinberg began running television advertisements that use 18-year-old images of Mr. Street, then a young councilman and community activist, shoving a television reporter to the floor. In another, Mr. Street is shown throwing water in the face of a City Council administrator.
Each advertisement asks: "John Street for mayor? You decide."
Mr. Weinberg has also run commercials that cite Mr. Street's past financial problems, including bankruptcy, and ask voters, "Does this sound like someone who should be in charge of $2.7 billion?"
In an interview, Mr. Weinberg said of his advertisements: "I'd like to view them as informational. These are things voters should know about."
Mr. Weinberg's target audience is also reflected in his promotional brochure, which shows a series of five photographs of the candidate with groups of people. Only one of those people is black, a little boy.
As the front-runner, Mr. Street has resisted being drawn into any personal attacks. He has not denied the financial problems cited in the Weinberg commercials, but he has refrained from responding except to call on Mr. Weinberg to avoid negative campaigning.
"Desperate people do desperate things," Mr. Street said in an interview, referring to Mr. Weinberg. "He is a candidate who is drowning, failing in almost every way. I consistently said I am not interested in doing anything negative."
Mr. White was drawn into the advertising wars only after Mr. Katz, the Republican, began broadcasting commercials last week that attacked the credibility of Mr. Weinberg and the managerial skills of Mr. White as a way to prop up Mr. Street. Campaign aides in several camps say Mr. Katz, 49, would have an easier time defeating Mr. Street, especially if the vote breaks along racial lines.
Mr. Weinberg has virtually ignored Mr. Katz's foray into the Democratic campaign, but Mr. White responded to Mr. Katz's criticism by calling his contentions "Republican lies" in his own commercials.
Buoyed by polls showing him gaining on Mr. Street and pulling about even with Mr. Weinberg, Mr. White said the race was now "wide open, anyone's to win."
"I'm discovering that if the candidates can be viewed at all objectively, there's a certain comfort level voters have discovered with me," he said in an interview. "For us, that's a big plus."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Minimum wage bandwagon needs some skillful reining.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
CONGRESS will almost certainly raise the minimum wage this year, probably to $6.15 an hour from $5.15, phased in over two to three years. Democrats, as always, are in full support. So, too, are at least 20 moderate House Republicans anxious about next year's election. But whatever the political attraction, does a higher minimum wage make economic sense?
A growing number of economists say yes, though there is reason for Congress to move cautiously, perhaps even creatively. 
 The main purpose for raising the minimum wage is to make it possible for all full-time workers to earn enough to lift their families out of poverty. The current minimum wage falls short. By 2000, according to calculations by Isaac Shapiro of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the combination of earnings at $5.15 an hour, $3,600 in food stamps and the earned-income tax credit -- a provision of the tax code that has the Treasury send a check of up to $3,880 to low-wage workers -- would bring the annual income of a family of four to about $16,100: $1,400 short of the poverty line.
But at a wage of $6.15, the family would fall short by about only $450.
Critics, like Prof. David Neumark of Michigan State, say further increases in the minimum wage would make some low-wage workers too expensive to hire. Teen-agers are especially vulnerable. Professor Neumark concludes, "the net effect of minimum wages is an increase in the proportion of poor families." Other critics say that the minimum wage showers help on the wrong people, for example, teen-agers from wealthy families.
But most studies show that none of these problems loom large. Based on widely accepted estimates, a $6.15 minimum wage would likely take jobs away from fewer than 64,000 of the 3.3 million teen-agers now working. And very few adults would lose work. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, challenges the argument that the benefits of the minimum wage go to nonneedy families. More than 70 percent of the beneficiaries of minimum wage increases in 1996 and 1997 were adults, about half of whom worked full time and typically accounted for more than half of their families' earnings. The 20 percent lowest-paid workers reaped about 35 percent of the benefits of the wage increase even though they accounted for only 5 percent of total earnings.
Many economists who concede that a higher minimum wage would not destroy many jobs oppose raising it because, they argue, there is a better way to help low-wage workers: increase the tax credit. Because the credit does not hit employers, it does not strip workers of jobs. But the problem with this argument, many other economists point out, is that the tax credit has its own problem. To control the cost of the credit, it is phased out as family income rises above $12,500. The credit is scaled back by 21 cents for every extra dollar the family earns. The claw-back operates like an extra 21 percent tax on additional earnings. The most effective antipoverty program, Mr. Bernstein says, "would artfully combine the tax credit and minimum wages."
Yet, there is reason to proceed with caution. In the next few years, women who have exhausted benefits under the 1996 welfare law will be forced to enter the labor force. These women, many of whom will have poor or nonexistent work records, will be pressed to find jobs. Making employers pay an extra dollar an hour will not help. There is, then, reason for Congress to consider permitting employers to pay $5.15 for recent welfare recipients for, say, the first six months or so.
Congress might even venture a bit further. Small companies are dropping health insurance for their workers. To reverse the trend, Congress might consider permitting companies to apply some of the money they spend on health benefits toward their obligation under the minimum wage bill. There are problems with this approach -- young workers are likely to prefer higher wages to health insurance -- but it could also help ease a pressing and growing social problem.

HEADLINE: Sudden Deal Saves Gardens Set for Auction

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
A day before the Giuliani administration was to auction off city-owned lots that had been transformed into community gardens, the performer Bette Midler had her private conservation organization agree to buy dozens of the less desirable parcels, providing the final financing to preserve all 112 gardens that were set for sale.
The 11th-hour announcement ended a long-running dispute between city officials who said the parcels were ripe for sale and residents who viewed themselves as gardeners tending to verdant oases in neighborhoods of concrete and steel. But the fate of more than 600 other lots that were not part of the auction remains unclear. 
 Nevertheless, the $1.2 million purchase of 51 lots by the New York Restoration Project -- arranged by a singer and actress better known for her engaging flamboyance than for her diplomatic skills -- provided a vital piece in the city's negotiations with environmental groups.
The offer cleared the way for another conservation group, the Trust for Public Land, to buy the rest of the 112 parcels for $3 million, a figure that included an additional $1 million from Ms. Midler's organization.
According to the deal, the two organizations are to work out plans to turn over the properties to the community groups that tend to the gardens. If the properties are ever used for anything other than gardens, ownership will revert to the city, said Deputy Mayor Randy Levine, who helped in the negotiations.
"We're thrilled," Ms. Midler said in a prepared statement. "This is a joyous occasion and means that these gardens will stay in perpetuity."
"It's a win-win for everybody," Mr. Levine said. "The city gets market value for these properties, which will go into the general treasury to be used to enhance other city services. The gardens will remain gardens."
The agreements end, at least for now, what had become a daunting public relations challenge for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his aides, who were faced with demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience by protesters often wearing colorful garb. No matter how principled their stand, city officials learned, it can be difficult to remain dignified when faced with an adversary dressed as a sunflower -- or a ladybug or a tomato plant.
But the central issue was not frivolous to any of the involved parties. The administration contended that the city lots were provided to neighborhoods two decades ago as part of a temporary agreement, but should now be used for housing or economic development or put up for sale. If the gardeners were interested, the officials said, they could make a bid. But the environmentalists saw the gardens as havens of green, often in the city's poorest neighborhoods.
It turned out that the auction -- characterized by gardeners as an act of aggression -- would not have taken place today anyway. A Supreme Court judge in Brooklyn temporarily barred the auction yesterday, after lawyers for several environmental groups and the State Attorney General's office had argued that the city had flouted various local and state regulations in putting the properties up for sale.
City officials had hoped that the purchase agreements would make moot several lawsuits that have been filed by more than two dozen environmental organizations and neighborhood groups seeking to block the city's sale of the lots. In fact, the city initially sought to make the sale to the Trust for Public Land contingent on the end to the lawsuits, even though the trust was not a part of them.
But some of the environmental groups vowed to continue their legal battles, saying that they were concerned with the fate of several hundred other community gardens throughout the city.
"For us, it was never a question of only saving a few gardens," said Leslie Lowe, the executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. "The issue is the city's lack of policy on open space equity."
"Almost all the gardens that were to be auctioned were in neighborhoods of color," Ms. Lowe contended.
Richard Kassel, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council who presented some of the environmentalists' arguments yesterday, agreed that there were outstanding issues, and said, "We are going to wait and see the details" of the proposed sales "before we pop any Champagne."
Ms. Midler, meanwhile, had always been a player in the efforts to salvage the community gardens. Although a native of Hawaii, she first gained notice as an actress by singing in the gay bath houses of New York City. She and her family later moved to Los Angeles, but returned to New York in 1994 after a devastating earthquake in California.
Since then, she has been an integral member of the city's environmental coalition. She founded the New York Restoration Project with $250,000 of her own money, and has since raised money for conservation causes with elaborate fund-raising events. At last October's "Hulaween" party, which raised about $1.2 million, costumed dancers appeared as caterpillars, children dressed as butterflies and Ms. Midler made her entrance as a spider.
Roberta Greene, a spokeswoman for Ms. Midler's organization, said the performer was up well into the night trying to figure out a resolution. She finally decided to offer to buy 51 properties, Ms. Greene said. "So early this morning, phone calls went back and forth."
That resolve -- and that cash flow -- clearly impressed Deputy Mayor Levine. "I think she's a great believer and she's done a lot for New York," he said.
"I think she wanted to do what she can to try to save these things," he added.
Mr. Levine also said that the city would be negotiating with the Trust for Public Land about another 21 gardens. But there are hundreds of other gardens whose fates were not affected by Ms. Midler's beneficence and which Mr. Levine did not discuss.
Rose Harvey, the senior vice president of the Trust for Public Land, expressed caution about any suggestion by city officials that they had won a victory in the fight over community gardens.
"It's a victory if it's the end of private purchases of public space," she said. "And a beginning of a process in which the city protects open space on its own."

HEADLINE: On China, Time To Face Reality

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert Kagan (Op-Ed, May 11) suggests and then dismisses a major cause of the Government-sponsored demonstrations in Beijing -- namely, the impending 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
 In fact, the Government has been concerned that the anniversary could spark nationwide demonstrations. The Chinese leadership is worried about major disaffections at every level of society stemming from corruption, urban unemployment, rural migration to cities, lack of a coherent legal system, unfair tax burdens, no social safety net and environmental pollution. Then, out of the blue, came unexpected good fortune: the Belgrade embassy bombing.

HEADLINE: A Life After Prison

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your May 9 Week in Review analysis of low unemployment in the United States compared with other industrialized countries overlooks a key factor: United States rates of incarceration are 5 to 10 times those of other industrialized countries. 
 Incorporating these figures into unemployment calculations raises male unemployment rates by two percentage points and black male rates by seven points.
High rates of imprisonment affect labor-market issues in other ways as well. A prison record reduces one's prospects of finding gainful employment, but, conversely, the vast expansion of the prison system in the past quarter century has created a surging area of employment for prison guards, construction workers and associated services.

HEADLINE: Travel Agent or Travel Site? It Depends on the Trip

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA 

 BODY:
BEFORE she flew to Paris this spring, Mary Shane looked for travel help on the Internet. There, she was told (1) not to pack such French fashion no-nos as sneakers or blue jeans, (2) that the budget hotel she was considering was clean and conveniently located and (3) that the best price available for a round-trip airplane ticket was $600.
Two out of three turned out to be true. "In Paris, all the women were wearing black and my hotel was, well, it was clean enough," she said. But Ms. Shane, who is 53 and lives near Olympia, Wash., found a cheaper fare off line, paying $525 for a round-trip ticket offered by a Montgomery Ward travel service. 
 Ms. Shane's experience typifies both the best and the worst aspects of on-line travel sites. If you are willing to wade through dozens of travel sites -- general sites for airline, hotel and car rental reservations; travel chat rooms, and sites with tourist information -- you may stumble upon useful information that could save you time, money and the embarrassment of showing up at the Eiffel Tower in Nikes. You can even be your own travel agent and book airline tickets, hotel rooms or rental cars.
There is no guarantee that you will find a better deal on line than you would find if you walked through the door of your local travel agency, but the simpler your travel needs, the better the chances of finding the best prices on the Web. If your tastes run to cooking or museum tours or high-end travel, you are more likely to need a travel agent.
The vast majority of people who visit on-line airline sites do so for research. Only about 30 percent of those people end up buying at those sites, according to a new study from NPD Online Research, a market research company in Port Washington, N.Y.
"So far I've always found a cheaper price off line," said Ms. Shane, a retired analyst for the county health department. "But since I live in a little town of 3,000 people -- it really is the sticks -- I couldn't live without the information I get from the Internet."
In recent months, more and more travelers have been booking trips on line. Several of the sites with the most traffic reported record sales in 1999. Over all, on-line sales last year accounted for about $2.23 billion, about 1.7 percent of the amount spent by Americans on leisure travel and on business travel that is not handled by corporate services. But that figure is expected to climb by the end of 2002 to nearly $12.6 billion, about 7.9 percent of what is expected to be spent then on leisure and unmanaged business travel, said Fiona Swerdlow, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications.
In addition to potential savings, the Internet also offers a powerful psychological benefit. At a time when travelers are so often forced to endure the indignities of canceled flights or lost luggage or have suspicions that the passenger in the next seat paid $400 less for the same ticket, the Internet puts part of the process firmly back under their control. That's perfect for the information hound who likes to compare a number of permutations of an air route just to save $50.
"It's like driving your own car instead of being in the passenger's seat," said Richard Gritta, a professor of business at the University of Portland in Oregon who studies the airline industry. "The Internet makes you an active participant."
Most of the larger travel sites, like Microsoft Expedia Travel (expedia.msn.com) and Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), work like this: customers submit itinerary information, like dates and times of travel and departure and arrival cities. (Many sites, however, will not give you price information if you have multiple destinations and want to fly into and out of different cities.) Then the site spits out a list of airplane itineraries and prices, or hotel or car information and prices. To buy, customers type in credit card information, and the purchase is confirmed by E-mail.
Consumers are most likely to see the largest price swings -- and largest potential savings -- for airline tickets. Most major carriers encourage on-line sales because the airlines generally pay lower commissions to on-line agents than to off-line travel agencies. And many on-line sites have struck deals with specific carriers.
You can also find big price differences among the various travel sites because they do not all check flights for the same set of airlines, even though many sites seem to share databases. For example, a recent search for a fare for three people to fly from New York to Rome in midsummer turned up a fare of $3,084 from Travelocity, $2,802 from Expedia and $2,814 from Skytours (service.skytours.de).
Many airlines also offer on-line reservations for their own flights at their own Web sites, which can be good places to look for specials. And travelers concerned about frequent-flier miles may want to go straight to the Web sites of particular airlines. But if you go to the general sites, you can get information from many airlines at once. Air fares can fluctuate from day to day.
Some of the bigger travel sites have added improvements in recent months that make them easier to navigate. Last month, Travelocity added a Best Fare Finder feature that allows travelers to see the cheapest ticket for any given air route. Expedia recently introduced Mileage Miner, which will keep track of customers' frequent-travel account balances and point them toward new mileage offers. And Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com) beefed up its Destination Guides last month, enabling travelers to read restaurant and hotel reviews for 202 destinations.
Charles Sheppard, of Nahunta, Ga., was recently able to find a New York hotel room through Expedia, which strikes deals with specific hoteliers and also has access to the Pegasus reservations system, a database that contains the most up-to-date rates for thousands of hotel rooms.
"I found the hotel I wanted," Mr. Sheppard said, "saw the price was $160 a night, which was much less expensive than the price that a local travel agency gave me for the same hotel, and booked it."
While some sites have streamlined the purchasing process, do not expect from travel sites the kind of one-click shopping that makes it so easy to buy, say, books on Amazon.com. "With travel, one click is too quick," said Suzi Levine, a product manager for Expedia. "This is often an expensive purchase, and we want to make it very clear to customers that here is what they are buying. You don't want customers to have remorse."
But booking on line works best for relatively simple arrangements.
"Right now the technology is ideally suited to someone who needs a round-trip ticket on a well-traveled air route, who can say, 'I know what I want and what I'm willing to pay,' " said Gadi Maier, chief executive of the Internet Travel Network (www.itn .com).
For travelers like Lisa Myers, a mother of two who has booked several family trips on Travelocity in the past two years, the Internet can seem an ideal solution. "We travel a lot to see our family, and I'm looking for a good air fare," said Ms. Myers, who lives in Houston. "I usually have some flexibility on dates, so I look to see when we can fly the cheapest and then I book it. I usually do it at night, after the children are asleep."
But planning something more complicated, like a cruise, can require an expert's advice. You're not very likely to find out how old the ship is or how nice the staff is just by surfing travel sites.
"If you think about travel today, there are two general categories," said Ms. Swerdlow, the analyst. "There's complex travel, which involves lots of questions to be answered, and then there's fairly simple travel, which might require nothing more than a point-to-point airline ticket. In the future, you'll see on-line sites becoming easier to navigate, but today, the straightforward type of arrangement is what most people would feel comfortable with doing on line."
 
Priceline.com
One Chance At a Low Price
TRAVELERS who care only about price and don't mind compromising on departure times can check Priceline.com, a hybrid travel site that lets you place a bid. But for each itinerary, a traveler gets only one chance to bid -- if the first bid is too low, there is no chance to enter a higher bid and try again.
For a discount air fare, a customer types in bare-bones itinerary information -- departure and arrival dates and cities -- then enters the price the customer is willing to pay for an airline ticket or hotel room. A company spokesman said that customers had a 35 percent chance of getting a ticket if they made what he called a reasonable offer -- an offer that is within 30 percent of a 21-day advance-purchase price for a particular air route.
Priceline.com (www.priceline .com) can offer those discounts because it negotiates deals with major carriers in advance. "If Delta has lots of excess inventory on a given flight, of course, they want to fill those seats," said Fiona Swerdlow, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications. "If you know the going price for a fare, and you would be willing to pay a little less, maybe your fare will be accepted."
The tricky part is that the customer must agree to buy the ticket -- and type in credit card information -- before finding out whether the flight is available at that price. Also, the customer must agree ahead of time to fly on any major airline that is willing to sell a seat and to fly on any flight departing between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M. It's a service aimed at bargain hunters willing to make a few compromises for price.
"The airlines have told us they are willing to entertain these low offers as long as they are serious, no-fooling-around offers, which is why customers have to agree up front to buy the ticket," said Brian Ek, a Pricelinespokesman.
Although Priceline's popularity has grown consistently in the year since its debut -- in April, the site sold an average of 20,000 airline tickets a week -- the rules can be confusing to inexperienced travelers. Charles Sheppard, a Pepsi warehouse manager who lives in Nahunta, Ga., learned that lesson a few months ago when he was planning a trip to New York with his wife, Julia, to celebrate their 12th anniversary.
"Priceline got me a $125 round-trip ticket from Jacksonville, Fla., to New York City, but then when I looked at the details, the times were terrible," Mr. Sheppard said. "We would have to be flying through the middle of the night."
Luckily for Mr. Sheppard, when he phoned Priceline.com's customer service department to explain the situation, "they were very cooperative and said, 'Yes, sir, we'll cancel the order.' "
"But they told me not to do it again," he added.

HEADLINE: Cox to Acquire TCA Cable for $3.26 Billion

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
In the latest consolidation deal by a cable company preparing to offer telephone, Internet and interactive services as well as ordinary television to its subscribers, Cox Communications Inc., announced yesterday that it was acquiring TCA Cable TV Inc. for $3.264 billion in stock and cash.
The deal moves Cox up the ladder of the nation's largest cable companies from No. 5 to No. 4, behind Time Warner Inc., the AT&T Corporation (new owner of Telecommunications Inc.) and the Comcast Corporation. 
 Cox, based in Atlanta, will have almost 5 million cable subscribers upon the completion of two deals -- yesterday's with the Texas-based TCA, which has 883,000 customers mostly in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, and its recent $1.4 billion acquisition of Media General Inc., of northern Virginia, with 264,000 subscribers.
"This company was the last attractive takeover candidate among the publicly traded cable companies," Fred Moran, an analyst with ING Baring Furman Sels, said of TCA. Mr Moran's company was among several investment firms that gave TCA a "buy" rating recently.
The consolidation trend that began with enormously expensive acquisitions by the three biggest cable companies is now spreading to middle-sized companies, analysts said. Cable companies need to acquire more systems and subscribers to achieve economies of scale in building costly new networks capable of delivering telephone and Internet and interactive digital television to homes.
The Cox-TCA transaction is valued at $63.89 a share, with Cox offering TCA shareholders $31.25 in cash and 0.3709 share of Cox common class A stock for each TCA share. Cox will also asume $736 million in debt. The transaction has been approved by both companies' boards.
Mr. Moran said that the deal translated to a multiple of roughly 20 times TCA's estimated cash flow in the current fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, or a value of about $4,100 a subscriber. He described that price as "right in line with other recent transactions in the industry and very rewarding for TCA shareholders because they get both cash and stock in Cox, which is one of industry leaders."
AT&T paid about $4,600 a subscriber when it agreed to acquire Mediaone Group Inc., last week.
Another large multisystem operator, the Adelphia Communications Corporation of Coudersport, Pa., has made three acquisitions, each for more than $1 billion, of small cable companies in the last two months. The latest was its purchase of privately held Harron Communications in April.
James Robbins, Cox's president and chief executive, said his company planned to make further acquisitions, calling TCA "the cornerstone of our plans to offer advanced services in middle-market communities."
TCA reaches 74 percent of the homes in its markets, well above the industry average of 67 percent. And Mr. Robbins said it had several other attributes important to Cox, including what he called "a powerful commitment to customer service, a solid management team, a strong balance sheet and a technologically advanced network."
Indeed, Cox and TCA are both well ahead of most other cable companies in making many of the technological improvements needed to enable cable lines to provide advanced services and digital television. Both have also been aggressive about deploying new services to customers relatively quickly.
Half of TCA's systems and more than 65 percent of Cox's have two-way capability for data and telephone services. TCA offers high-speed Internet access to about 2,300 customers now in partnership with the At Home Corporation and digital-cable television service to about 5,000.
Cox currently has almost 100,000 digital television subscribers, in eight markets, and provides high-speed Internet access via cable modem to 88,900 customers; it also provides digital telelphone, but to only about 42,000 customers.
"Cox stands today as the most technologically sophisticated cable operator, already," Mr. Moran said. "And TCA, as a well-positioned Southwestern property, complements Cox perfectly because they, too, have been aggressive in deployment of new technology."
Once the transaction is completed, Cox Enterprises Inc., will be the majority shareholder of the new company, with 67.2 percent of the equity and 76.8 percent of the voting power in Cox Communications Inc.
Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's placed debt of Cox Enterprises Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. on Creditwatch with negative implications, apparently because the Media General and TCA deals will require substantial financing. While it has an extensive investment portfolio that includes equity in AT&T and At Home, Cox has not announced a definitive financing plan.
Shares of Cox Communications fell $1.9375, to $8.625. TCA Cable gained $7.96875, or 15.31 percent, to $60.03125.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 13 about Cox Communications' acquisition of TCA Cable TV misstated the scope of a previous agreement by Cox, involving Media General. Cox purchased Media General's cable operations in northern Virginia, not the entire company.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AFTER LIFE," starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika Oda. Written, directed and edited by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118 minutes). Much of this transcendently compassionate, gently humorous Japanese film is set in a drab office building where courteous caseworkers welcome the week's new clients. The place turns out not to be a social service agency but a metaphysical way station where the newcomers are people of all ages and types who have just died and have three days to select one memory to take with them into eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be filmed. As they tell their stories and make their choices (those who can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers), the movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value and the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen Holden). 

* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Mr. Crystal as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal, "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comedy (Janet Maslin).
 
* "COOKIE'S FORTUNE," starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Mr. Altman's vintage ensemble films make a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy. Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide. As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting nemesis, Mr. Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works on a single wavelength as Mr. Altman makes the most of a well-woven screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
 
* "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS," starring Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she views as imminent disaster. In the process, Mr. Zonca shows astonishing acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
 
* "ELECTION," starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the acerbically funny director of "Citizen Ruth" comes this caustic satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting. Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms. Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Mr. Broderick plays the hapless good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off of what they actually mean (Maslin).
 
"ENTRAPMENT," starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper film summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Mr. Connery's glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin).
 
"EXISTENZ," starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 90 minutes). Not for Mr. Cronenberg the sleek futuristic look of other films that play virtual reality games. This one has the insinuatingly ghoulish hallmarks of other Cronenberg fever dreams (like "The Fly," "Crash" and "Naked Lunch"). And it uses them to weirdly enveloping effect as a renowned game designer (Ms. Leigh) and her wary companion (Mr. Law) try to play the most dangerous game she has yet created. This sci-fi scheme is disturbingly effective as it plays its own mind games with the viewer, complete with a sharp final twist. The title is pronounced "eggs-is-tense" (Maslin).
 
"GO," starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy borrows truckloads of inspiration from "Pulp Fiction" but still has some flash and personality of its own. Mr. Liman, who shot the film as well as directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends a sullen cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. He embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down the rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
 
* "HIDEOUS KINKY," starring Kate Winslet. Directed by Gillies MacKinnon (R, 99 minutes). Ms. Winslet knew best when she took on this offbeat, richly atmospheric adventure in the wake of "Titanic." The leading role in Mr. MacKinnon's vividly colorful film offers her a field day. She plays a young hippie mother who brings her reluctant British daughters to Marrakesh, circa 1972. The film, about the mother's willfulness, the girls' reaction and the sheer headiness of their surroundings, belongs to the striking subgenre in which it is baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need to come of age (Maslin).
 
"THE MATRIX," starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but incomprehensible to nontechnofreaks. And the film borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt to "The X-Files" in the paranoia department. But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Mr. Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
 
"THE MUMMY," starring Brendan Fraser Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134 minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an unwieldy hybrid of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy" via "Night of the Living Dead." The intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that carries a fearful curse are Mr. Fraser (playing a swashbuckling American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky wide-eyed English librarian) and John Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming scarabs who burrow under the skin and do awful "Alien"-like things (Holden).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" (the Oscar winner for best film, best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench (best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
"THIS IS MY FATHER," starring Aidan Quinn, Moya Farrelly and James Caan. Directed by Paul Quinn (R, 120 minutes). Made with obvious sincerity, this story of a glum Chicago schoolteacher (Mr. Caan) in search of his more interesting Irish forebears (Mr. Quinn) involves a third Quinn brother as well. And Declan Quinn's cinematography adds warmth to an atmospheric, sentimental tale featuring stellar Irish actors (Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Colm Meaney) in cameo roles. Aidan Quinn's sturdy performance, as a lonely farmer in love with a fiery young lass from a prosperous family, does a lot to help the film override its hackneyed elements and keep it moving (Maslin).
 
* "A WALK ON THE MOON," starring Diane Lane, Viggo Mortensen, Liev Schreiber, Tovah Feldshuh and Anna Paquin. Directed by Tony Goldwyn (R, 107 minutes). This evocative 1969 period piece, set on the brink of Woodstock in a Catskills holiday camp, is as seductive as the handsome, itinerant hippie who turns its heroine's life upside down. Thoughtfully conceived and movingly acted, it sweeps a housewife and mother named Pearl Kantrowitz (Ms. Lane) into a torrid extramarital romance and then weighs the consequences. With a tenderness that is unusual for a contemporary American film, it tells an enveloping tale enhanced by artfully selected Woodstock-era music. Mr. Mortensen may strain credulity as the foxiest blouse salesman in the Catskills, but he certainly does wonders for the movie (Maslin).
 
* "THE WINSLOW BOY," starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play, about the 1910 schoolboy's trial that created a furor in England, has been artfully pared down to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist character a sharp edge (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"THE SHARPEST GIRL IN TOWN: ANN SOTHERN." Long before "Working Girl," Ann Sothern was a feminist icon in the 10 MGM Maisie films in which she portrayed a working woman getting ahead in the years of the Depression and World War II. The versatile actress won wide popularity playing street-smart, wisecracking characters in musicals, comedies and melodramas. And now she is being celebrated in a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. At 6 P.M. today, she will be seen in one of her most brilliant dramatic roles, as a career woman, wife and wise friend in "A Letter to Three Wives," directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who won an Oscar for his screenplay about three women who receive a letter from a friend saying she has run off with one of their husbands. Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell, Kirk Douglas and Thelma Ritter play leading roles. Continuing through Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults; $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 P.M. Information and screening times: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: Wealth and Taxes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Shaw (letter, May 8) argues that the national income accounts should classify workers' Social Security tax payments as a form of saving, because workers view them as such. However, this treatment would be incorrect, because the taxes are not invested in capital that increases the country's wealth. Instead, the taxes are transferred to current retirees as benefit payments. 
The only wealth that current workers acquire from the Social Security system is the expectation that when they retire, part of future workers' incomes will be transferred to them. From a national standpoint, this increase in current workers' wealth is offset by a reduction in future workers' wealth. Since national wealth is unchanged, no saving has occurred.

HEADLINE: Latest Economic Report Card Shows a WholeLot of B+'s

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The economy continues to grow with few signs of accelerating inflation, Government reports showed today.
Retail sales rose one-tenth of a percent in April, matching March's increase, the Commerce Department said. That was a welcome slowdown from the average 1.4 percent rise for the previous three months that suggested the economy was in danger of overheating, analysts said. 
 A separate Labor Department report dispelled fears of higher prices by showing that producer prices rose only one-tenth of a percent last month when the largest increase in oil prices since the 1990 Persian Gulf crisis was excluded.
Retail sales last month were restrained by a drop in auto and department store business and would have actually fallen one-tenth of a percent if it were not for a 2.4 percent rise in gasoline sales.
The overall Producer Price Index rose five-tenths of a percent in April, more than double March's two-tenths of a percent increase, as energy prices surged 5.1 percent. The rise was limited by a 3.9 percent drop in computer costs and the second decline in food prices in three months.
For the first four months of the year, the core rate of the index, which excludes often-volatile food and energy costs, has fallen at a two-tenths of a percent annual rate, compared with an increase at a 2.1 percent pace through last April.
The economy's prospects are for "solid growth and low inflation," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today.
It is also a combination that will probably keep Federal Reserve policy makers from raising the overnight bank loan rate at their next meeting on Tuesday -- or for months to come. "These reports are a clarion call for monetary policy stability," said William Sullivan, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
Also today, the Labor Department said first-time claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged last week at a seasonally adjusted 303,000. The less volatile four-week average declined to 304,250 from 308,250.
The news in the producer price report was almost all related to oil. Crude oil prices rose 27.3 percent in April, the biggest jump since October 1990. That pushed gasoline prices up 29 percent, a record increase, the Labor Department said.
In New York, prices for June crude futures ranged in April from a low of $15.88 a barrel on April 8 to a high of $18.66 the last day of the month.
Even so, few economists are worried that higher oil prices will bring about a huge acceleration in inflation.
In high technology, competition and the quest for faster computers are keeping prices low. Producer prices for computers fell 3.9 percent in April.
Analysts expect the Consumer Price Index, scheduled for release on Friday, to show prices Americans pay for goods and services increased four-tenths of a percent in April. Excluding oil and food, the index's core rate probably climbed two-tenths of a percent last month, the analysts said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazilian Economy Expanded in First Quarter

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 13

 BODY:
The Brazilian economy defied pessimistic forecasts of stagnation in the first quarter and actually registered some growth, the Government said today in a report that showed Brazil's surprising resilience to the effects of the currency crisis that erupted in January.
The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic performance, grew by 1 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the last quarter of 1998. Agricultural production rose 18 percent, leading the expansion. 
 Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, and the second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. The weaker currency may have even contributed to the economy's growth by encouraging farmers to increase output of these and other products since their prices became more competitive abroad.
"There was an immediate reaction throughout the entire chain of our production following the devaluation," said Nathan Herszkowicz, president of Brazil's coffee industry union. According to the organization, coffee exports more than doubled in the first quarter of 1999 compared with the period a year earlier.
Although higher agricultural output contrasted with weak industrial production, the Government figures released today suggest that Brazil's economy is recovering more quickly than thought.
While some analysts earlier this year forecast the economy to shrink as much as 6 percent, most economists are now predicting a contraction of only 1 percent to 2 percent. Optimism has been stoked by six interest-rate cuts over the last seven weeks. On Wednesday, the central bank reduced its main lending rate to 27 percent from 29.5 percent, the lowest level in nine months.
"Interest rates coming down, coupled with controlled inflation, have had a tremendous impact," said Winston Fritsch, president of the Brazilian unit of the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. Progress made by the Government in reducing the budget deficit is likely to allow the central bank to continue lowering rates below 20 percent by the end of this year, Mr. Fritsch added.
Brazilian stocks rallied on the growth figures, with the benchmark Bovespa index here rising 2.56 percent. Increasing foreign investment in Brazilian equities together with greater optimism among domestic investors have pushed the index up 83 percent in local-currency terms and 34 percent in dollar terms so far this year.
The better-than-expected growth figures and buoyant stock market contrast sharply with other indicators that show an economy struggling with its worst crisis since a stabilization program was carried out in 1994. The plunge in January in the value of the currency deeply hurt Brazil's financial credibility and borrowing power abroad, which reverberated through the economy with slumping sales, bankruptcies and layoffs. Manufacturers and construction companies were the hardest hit.
An example of the economy's strains was seen this week when 50,000 unemployed workers lined up outside municipal buildings to compete for 10,000 openings for street-cleaning jobs in the city of Sao Paulo. The salary for the temporary, six-month work is 136 reais a month, or $82, Brazil's official minimum wage. Unemployment here in Sao Paulo, the country's wealthiest city, is at a record level of nearly 20 percent.
Brazilian companies have started to shift toward increasing their exports, partly because domestic demand has remained stagnant. A large food processor, Perdigao S.A., exported 18 percent more in the first quarter after the devaluation in January. "In dollar terms, we have the cheapest chickens in the world right now," said Wang Wei Chang, chief financial officer of Perdigao.
Still, the opportunities for companies such as Perdigao to fuel a stronger recovery are limited since domestic borrowing rates remain punitively high and foreign credit markets are still largely shunning Brazilian borrowers. With deeper cuts in interest rates largely dependent on the Government's success in narrowing the budget deficit, companies are anxiously awaiting fresh evidence of spending cuts from the capital, Brasilia. "Now is not the time to relax, not even a little," Mr. Wang of Perdigao said. "We need to see the Government deliver."

HEADLINE: Easy Approval Is Predicted For Summers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
President Clinton's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, appears to be facing relatively little opposition in the Senate, even from Republican critics of the Administration's economic policy.
Mr. Summers and Robert E. Rubin, who announced on Wednesday his intention to resign, spent part of the day on Capitol Hill, dropping in on key members of the Senate. Mr. Summers left this evening for Malaysia, for a long-scheduled meeting of Asian finance ministers. But he is to return by Monday and is expected to say little in public while preparing for his confirmation hearings. 
 Hearings for any appointee toward the end of an administration are always a bit unpredictable, and it is always possible that Mr. Summers's nomination could become a political football. White House aides said that they suspected Mr. Rubin tried to time his departure to maximize Mr. Summers's chances of confirmation. "The closer you get to the Presidential election," one White House official said, "the more risks you run."
Nonetheless, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who in recent weeks has cast himself in opposition to several Clinton Administration economic initiatives, said this morning that he saw no problems with Mr. Summers's nomination. Later in the day, he met with Mr. Summers, as did Senator William Roth, the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will consider the nomination.
Mr. Roth said today that his committee had "a good working relationship" with Mr. Summers, suggesting that he saw no large hurdles to confirmation. His committee might have felt differently a few years ago, when Mr. Summers clashed with the panel over the $12 billion bailout of Mexico. To raise the money, the Administration circumvented Congress and drew on the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is under the Treasury's control.
Mr. Summers himself was uncharacteristically quiet today, and aides said he would keep public comments to a minimum while his nomination was under consideration. That is hardly unusual for any nominee. But it is considered a particularly important strategy for the sometimes blunt-speaking Mr. Summers, who went out of his way at the White House yesterday to repeatedly use the phrase "subject to the will of the Senate" when referring to his new appointment.
This morning, Mr. Rubin devoted the entirety of a short commencement speech at New York University to talk about decision-making -- detailing how he approached problems on Wall Street and the Treasury by weighing probabilities and focusing more on how a decision was reached than whether its outcome was successful.
It was a subject he often discussed during the Asian financial crisis, when he was often faced with the question of whether propping up a country -- or its currency -- would help promote reform or, in the alternative, take the pressure off politicians to change the country's economic fundamentals.
Several of those bets went bad. More than $4 billion committed to Russia was essentially lost, with no reforms. But the bailouts of Thailand and South Korea went hand in hand with at least some modest changes in banking systems and regulation.
Mr. Rubin recalled facing the decision in June 1998 about whether to prop up the Japanese yen, whose value had been falling sharply -- threatening to touch off devaluations elsewhere in Asia.
"It was, to say the least, a very complicated situation," Mr. Rubin said. The discussion could have gone on indefinitely, he said, not adding that in the Clinton White House, discussions usually do go on at great length. "but we didn't have that luxury: markets wait for no one."
That bet worked out, and the yen's decline was halted. But Mr. Rubin argued, as he did last year during several failed attempts to prop up Russia and Indonesia, that "judging solely on results is a serious deterrent to taking the risk that may be necessary to making the right decision."
"Simply put, the way decisions are evaluated affects the way decisions are made," Mr. Rubin said. "I believe the public would be better served, and their elected officials and others in Washington would do a more effective job, if judgments were based on the quality of decision- making instead of focusing solely on outcomes."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: BEIJING;
China Honors 3 Killed in Belgrade, but the Street Protests End

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 13

 BODY:
In an elaborate ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, China's leaders bestowed the title of "revolutionary martyr" today on the three Chinese journalists killed by NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last week.
The title is one of the Communist Party's highest honors to the dead and the ceremony appeared intended to bring an emotional close to the anti-American activity that took over Beijing in recent days, a rare dovetailing of public sentiment and official purpose. 
 The bombing is widely seen here as a deliberate attack and not the mistake that NATO maintains.
Student-led demonstrations cordinated by the Government have now stopped, and street traffic returned to normal today in the diplomatic quarter, which was besieged by raucous and rock-throwing demonstrators after the bombing.
Yet even if China's leaders want to cool mass displays of emotion, President Jiang Zemin warned at today's ceremony that China would not consider the matter closed until the United States and NATO make a full accounting of the bombing.
"Otherwise the Chinese people will never let the matter go," Mr. Jiang said in a speech.
On state television's evening news, Mr. Jiang and five of China's most senior leaders were shown trooping from one hospital room to another to visit some of the Chinese citizens who were hurt in the bombing and returned to Beijing on Wednesday.
"You are all heroes," Mr. Jiang said to one of the wounded.
In the first of what is likely to be many state-sponsored commemorations of the journalists, The Guangming Daily Press said it would publish a book next week honoring Xu Xinghu and his wife, Zhu Ying, both of whom worked for the newspaper.
The swell of anti-American and nationalist sentiment is likely to have far-reaching if not entirely predictable consequences on China's political, economic and social climate. For instance, Zhu Bangzao, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said today that the atmosphere of negotiations over China's entry into the World Trade Organization would inevitably be affected.
Although Mr. Zhu reiterated Beijing's wish to seek entry to the trade group by the end of the year, his remarks reflect a consensus here that the intensely strained political mood will further stiffen the negotiating position of Chinese officials.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- The Hype Is With Us;
The Lucas Empire Is Invading; Resistance Is Futile

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Coming soon, a film with marketing more choreographed than a Fred Astaire version of "Saturday Night Fever"! More skillfully planned than the mission to save Matt Damon! A campaign more orchestrated than all of Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred Hitchcock! Yes, a movie even more unsinkable than Titanic!
It's no surprise what we're talking about. Only those overheated trailers at the Bijous and Orpheums of the 1940's and 1950's can approximate the frenzied peddling of "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace." Though the movie does not open until Wednesday, merchandise is already flooding toy stores, Web sites, fast-food restaurants, computer stores, music stores, supermarkets, bookstores and newsstands. 
 Fed by legions of enthusiasts who have waited years for this moment -- at some theaters, they camped out for weeks to get advance tickets that went on sale this Wednesday afternoon -- the fourth "Star Wars" film has taken on a life of its own.
"There's genuine passion here; no one is telling those people to line up," said Dawn Hudson, senior vice president for strategy and marketing at the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., which is spending $2 billion to sponsor "The Phantom Menace" and sequels to be released in 2002 and 2005.
The new installment, the first "prequel" to the original trinity, is largely selling itself -- thanks in no small part to the eager involvement of licensees, merchandisers, retailers and, of course, the news media, churning out programs and articles like this one.
Behind the groundswell of excitement, though, is a well-tended machine, cranking out the biggest marketing blitz ever for a mere movie. And that effort is being supervised down to the teensiest detail by George Lucas, the zillionaire writer-producer-director who created the "Star Wars" juggernaut and whose Lucasfilm Ltd. has been assiduously working on the next chapter since the last film was released in 1983.
Indeed, "the marketing of an entertainment property is becoming the story instead of the property itself," said Michael Schau, executive editor of the Entertainment Marketing Letter newsletter.
"When we went to college," he said, "we didn't ask each other, 'What do you suppose the top-grossing movie was this weekend?' Now we do."
Not since "Gone With the Wind" has there been so much spontaneous anticipation so far in advance.
"There's something there that touches their hearts," said Howard Roffman, vice president for licensing at Lucasfilm in San Rafael, Calif.
"If there's any hype at all, it comes from the media," he added. "They see this as an important story that will get viewers and sell newspapers and magazines. It has resulted in a level of attention we frankly are not seeking ourselves."
At least two major newspapers are printing daily "countdown" features. Magazines with cover articles include Entertainment Weekly, GQ, Newsweek, Premiere, Time, Vanity Fair, Wired -- even Popular Mechanics ("The Machines of 'Star Wars' "), Vogue (" 'Star Wars' Couture") and TV Guide.
"You can't plan on becoming a cultural phenomenon," said Mr. Roffman, who joined Lucasfilm in 1980, or as he dates it, "a couple weeks before 'The Empire Strikes Back' was released."
"It's not like people sat down in 1975 and said, 'Let's create a space mythology that'll last for generations,' " he added. "It all stems from demand from the fans."
That was underscored in November, when thousands of "Star Wars" fans bought tickets for clunky films like "Meet Joe Black" just to catch the 130-second trailer for "The Phantom Menace." And it was further verified this week by the telephone and Internet traffic jams that occured on buying sites around the country after tickets went on sale.
Indeed, "Star Wars" has become a consumer brand, promising quality and performance the way brand-name cars, candy and clothing do.
"Great brands create a relationship between a company and a consumer that secures future earnings," said John Grace, an executive director at Interbrand, a consulting company in New York owned by Omnicom Group. " 'Star Wars' has all the characteristics of a great brand of our time."
Just look at Hasbro Inc., the toy company whose licensing deal with Lucasfilm dates to the first film in 1977. One Hasbro executive, Tim Hall, has a title that says it all: vice president for "Star Wars."
To renew its agreement with Mr. Lucas, Hasbro is guaranteeing an estimated $500 million in royalties from "Phantom Menace" products that range from Darth Maul With Lightsaber to the Anakin Skywalker Podracer to the Hidden Majesty Queen Amidala.
Behind it all stands Mr. Lucas. "I've got to hand it to George," said Jack Trout, president at Trout & Partners, marketing consultants in Greenwich, Conn. "He's turning an 800-pound gorilla into King Kong."
"It's brilliant the way he has carefully nurtured this property over many years," Mr. Trout said. "Eat your heart out, Walt Disney."
The usually reclusive Mr. Lucas, who oversees Lucasfilm and other companies like Lucasarts Entertainment, has granted a score of interviews to help stoke the bonfires.
"You have to admire Lucas for his long-term approach," said Peter Waller, president and chief concept officer at Taco Bell in Irvine, Calif., one of three chains owned by Tricon Global Restaurants that are the fast-food marketing partners for the film.
"It's not just about a great summer movie," Mr. Waller asserted. "It's about building 'Star Wars' in a real brand sense as an experience people want to keep re-entering."
Thus the goal of the promotional blitz for "The Phantom Menace" is to make millions of moviegoers chant once more "May the force be with you" without perceiving they are being force-fed.
There are predictions that "The Phantom Menace," which will be distributed by the 20th Century Fox unit of the News Corporation, could set records by taking in as much as $100 million in its first five days. Topping "Titanic," which garnered worldwide grosses of more than $1.8 billion, would be "a tall order," said Paul Dergarabedian, president at the Exhibitor Relations Company in Los Angeles, which tracks box-office performance. Even so, he added, "if any film has the chance to do it, it would be this one."
Still, "any high-profile film that gets lots of interest and attention can fall victim to the double-edged sword," Mr. Dergarabedian warned, adding that it is particularly true for a film that "has had such a high profile for so long."
Indeed, there are already signs of trouble. Both Time and Newsweek dubbed the new film "The Phantom Movie," and there have been harshly negative advance reviews as well as derogatory columns by critics like Jack Mathews of The Daily News in New York; he mocked the selling of the film with such lines as "May the Sales Force be with you" and "We'll always have 'The Phantom Menace' -- up to here."
And remember "Godzilla" last summer? That brand fell far short of the promises it made in a lavish pre-release marketing assault.
To help cool the overheated expectations, the advertising budget for "The Phantom Menace" is less than $20 million, not much for a film with a budget of $115 million competing in the blockbuster sweepstakes.
"You don't want to overdo it," said Mr. Roffman at Lucasfilm. "The worst thing you can do is to create a plan based on your needs instead of the consumers'."
Mr. Lucas recognizes the potential pitfalls, said Jill Wilfert, senior brand manager at Lego Systems, a unit of Lego Group, who met with him as part of planning for her company's "Phantom Menace" line -- its first licensed merchandise ever.
"He wants people to have a good experience with the movie and not see it as being overly commercialized," Ms. Wilfert said, "because he doesn't want them to be sick of it after a few months."
Of course, the movie will benefit from the spillover of its partners' own marketing campaigns, which will include glitzy commercials by the BBDO New York and TBWA/ Chiat/Day units of Omnicom for Pepsico and Tricon.
"We expect this to be one of our most successful promotions" across "our entire peak summer selling season," said Ms. Hudson at Pepsi-Cola, which hopes to sell millions of cans of five soft-drink brands that feature "Phantom Menace" characters. Consumers who find cans bearing the venerable visage of Yoda can redeem them for " 'Star Wars' checks" worth $20.
At Tricon, which owns Pizza Hut and KFC in addition to Taco Bell, the campaign marks the first time the three brands have united under a single promotional theme. "It's all in the never-been-done-before league," Mr. Waller said.
Each chain will align with one of three planets in the film, Coruscant, Naboo and Tatooine, selling toys and drink-cup lids with names like Opee Sea Creature Chaser, Jar Jar Binks Squishy and Hovering Watto.
For true believers, though, even too much commercialization may not be enough.
"Fans are so into 'Star Wars' that the advertising is almost entertainment to them, part of the cultural impact the film is making," said Tim Doyle, a copywriter at Leo Burnett Interactive in Toronto, part of the Leo Burnett Company. Mr. Doyle and two fellow fans in Australia and Los Angeles have on their own put up a "Phantom Menace" site (www.starwars.countingdown.com).
So how will "The Phantom Menace" do? Beyond the box office, total merchandise sales may reach $2 billion this year -- almost half what the entire "Star Wars" franchise has sold since 1977.
And in theaters, "America is ready to climb back into fantasy land and see the good guys beat the bad guys," Mr. Trout predicted. "Wait till it opens and the lines are wrapped around the block. Wait till you see the press for that."
The final word goes to Mr. Dergarabedian at Exhibitor Relations.
"It will make money whether there is good word of mouth or bad word of mouth," he said, "but what will keep it playing is terrific word of mouth. There's no better marketing than that."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: WASHINGTON;
Clinton Blames Milosevic, Not Fate, for Bloodshed

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he had misread Balkan history and he apologized for any past suggestions that there is "some Balkan disease" that condemns all sides in Yugoslavia to an endless cycle of ethnic blood feuds.
"The truth is that for centuries these people have lived together in the Balkans and southeastern Europe with greater or lesser degrees of tension, but often without anything approaching the intolerable conditions and conflicts that exist today," he said in a speech here to combat veterans of World War II. 
 Of the notion that the Yugoslavs are locked in implacable hatreds, he said: "I, myself, have been guilty of saying that on an occasion or two, and I regret it now more than I can say."
The President's 35-minute rumination on Kosovo came as the fighting grinds into its eighth week, persisting longer than the war in the Persian Gulf. The President acknowledged that Americans are impatient with the pace of NATO's air campaign.
Taking a cue from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Clinton warned against "refugee fatigue" and forcefully retold the stories of Albanians who have been executed, raped and routed from their homes.
"I know we see these pictures of the refugees on television every night, and most people would like another story," Mr. Clinton said. "But we must not get refugee fatigue. We must not forget the real victims of this tragedy."
He was voicing a concern that Mr. Blair raised on Wednesday: that without the ability to show pictures of the atrocities being committed inside Kosovo, the news media would tire of repetitious footage of fleeing refugees, and that reduced exposure to such scenes could then weaken public support for the war effort.
Mr. Blair said the Serbs benefited by barring reporters from Kosovo, because that factor, along with editorial boredom with the refugees, was leading the media to highlight NATO mistakes like last week's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, coverage that cost NATO an edge in the propaganda war.
Taking that argument to heart, Mr. Clinton tried to paint a compelling portrait of the atrocities inside Kosovo, evoking images of Hitler's slaughter of the Jews and detailing eyewitness accounts of mass executions, rapes and people being set on fire.
"Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic extermination of the Holocaust," Mr. Clinton said, "the two are related -- both vicious, premeditated, systematic oppression fueled by religious and ethnic hatred."
He added: "Nine of every 10 Kosovar Albanians now has been driven from their homes, thousands murdered, at least 100,000 missing, many young men led away in front of their families, over 500 cities, towns and villages burned."
The President uttered no new policy in his speech, but seemed determined to clarify, again, the moral imperative for American participation in a war in Europe that began March 24 and shows little sign of ending.
He called the campaign of "ethnic cleansing" being carried out in Kosovo by the forces of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, "an affront to humanity and an attack not only on a people but on the dignity of all people."
In saying he was mistaken to portray Balkan infighting as inevitable, he said Mr. Milosevic, like Hitler in Germany, had been the catalyst.
"You think the Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on their own without Hitler?" Mr. Clinton asked. "Was there something in the history of the German race that made them do this? No."
Brushing aside any half-measures -- like the partial withdrawal of Mr. Milosevic's troops from Kosovo that was staged today for cameras that his forces controlled -- Mr. Clinton said that NATO would continue its bombing campaign until Mr. Milosevic met the allies' demands in full.
"The central imperative is this," Mr. Clinton said in his speech, delivered at Fort McNair. "The Kosovars must be able to return home and live in safety. For this to happen, the Serb forces must leave; partial withdrawals can only mean continued civil wars with the Kosovar insurgence."
At the same time, the Administration played down any effect that the internal political turmoil in Russia might have on diplomatic efforts to negotiate a settlement.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, was continuing to work "constructively" with the Russians and that he had detected no setbacks despite President Boris N. Yeltsin's firing of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov.
Mr. Talbott was in Moscow for two days and had been expected to work with the Russians on plans for the composition of an international security force that would be stationed in Kosovo. He was headed to Brussels for meetings at NATO offices and was also expected to meet Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, officials said.
As he left Moscow, Mr. Talbott offered no new details, but said, "There are many problems here, but there is reason for hope and we must continue our diplomatic efforts."
The harshest words of the day came from China, where fury still raged at the United States for the embassy bombing, which killed three Chinese. President Jiang Zemin said the United States was using its economic and technological superiority to aggressively expand its influence, pursue "power politics and wantonly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."
Administration officials said that despite Mr. Zemin's fiery public comments, tensions with China appeared to be easing. David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said that in a visit today with the Chinese Ambassador, Mr. Clinton said that the United States would carry out a full investigation of the bombing and would inform the Chinese people of its results.
In exchange, the Ambassador told Mr. Clinton that Mr. Jiang was now ready to speak with him by telephone -- an overture that the Chinese had rebuffed since the bombing. Mr. Leavy said that Mr. Jiang was trying to reach Mr. Clinton and that the two leaders might talk as early as tonight.
At the White House, Mr. Clinton signed a book of condolences for the deaths, writing next to his signature: "With profound grief and sincere condolences to the victims, their families and the people of China."

HEADLINE: Cadbury and Coca-Cola Said to Discuss Deal

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
A senior Cadbury Schweppes executive said yesterday that the company planned to sell its brands in France to the Coca-Cola Company after Coca-Cola completed its negotiations with the French Government over the purchase of the Orangina soft-drink brand.
Speaking to reporters in New York at a beverage industry conference, John F. Brock, Cadbury's global managing director for beverages, said, "Once Orangina is resolved, we will sit down and negotiate an arrangement with Coke for France." 
 However, a spokesman for Coca-Cola said the company had no plans to buy Cadbury brands in France. "There is nothing on the horizon at all that would have us buying Cadbury brands in France," said the spokesman, Randy Donaldson.
Coca-Cola's efforts to buy Orangina, the second-highest-selling brand in France, from Pernod Ricard S.A. have run into resistance from the French competition authorities, who said Coca-Cola would have too much market share if the $850 million deal went through. Coca-Cola announced the deal in December 1997 and is still trying to work out a plan with the French Government.
Last December, Cadbury agreed to sell its brands outside the United States to Coca-Cola for $1.85 billion, excluding France and South Africa. The deal was hailed at the time as one that provided benefits to both sides. Since then, many objections have been raised by governments from Australia to Belgium, mainly over the market dominance Coca-Cola would have. The European Union has also balked at the plan, although Coca-Cola and Cadbury executives say it is not clear whether it has jurisdiction in this case.
"We and Coke went into this deal having done a lot of homework," Mr. Brock said yesterday, adding that "we were surprised" by the reaction in Belgium, for example.
"It's a political issue as much as a regulatory issue," he said, noting that "the relationship between the U.S. and the E.U. is not at an all-time high right now."
Mr. Brock said he expected the Coca-Cola-Cadbury deal to be completed eventually.

HEADLINE: City Considering a Modern Fulton Fish Market at a New Site

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
The city is considering a multimillion-dollar plan to modernize and move the Fulton Fish Market from the storied but gritty site it has occupied for 166 years in lower Manhattan, a top Giuliani administration official said yesterday.
Forced to act because of more stringent Federal requirements regarding the refrigeration of fish, the administration plans to decide by this summer whether to renovate the existing market or to build a new center for wholesale fish and shellfish companies elsewhere in the city, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said in an interview. Either alternative would cost $30 million to $55 million, Mr. Washington said. 
 He declined to identify what sections of the city were being considered as possible sites for the market, the nation's largest wholesale seafood distribution point, with annual sales of $800 million to $1 billion. But as fishmongers and workers toiled yesterday in the early morning mists, many said they believed that City Hall was reviving previous proposals to transfer them to a spot near the Hunts Point Produce Market in the South Bronx.
Some merchants and employees also said that the administration was bent on razing the two main buildings of the market, a remnant of 19th century New York that has figured in the writings of Joseph Mitchell and others. Moving the market, people who work there say, could clear the way for real estate development of valuable city-owned land near the South Street Seaport and alongside the East River. Mr. Washington acknowledged that the city could profit from the sale of a three-block area for commercial and residential use if the market is moved. Real estate developers and brokers estimated the property could be sold for $40 million to $60 million.
Mr. Washington said the city was being forced to act because of stricter Federal regulations for the handling and refrigeration of perishable seafood. Much of the seafood brought to the market daily by refrigerated trucks is kept for hours in containers packed with ice but not refrigerated before it is sold to retail fish stores and restaurants, Mr. Washington noted.
He emphasized that there were no health dangers or sanitary violations in the current system. But he said that new rules from the Federal Food and Drug Administration would eventually require more refrigeration, especially in the summer, and other food-safety protection programs that cannot be easily accommodated by the market's antiquated electrical system and in its scruffy buildings.
"To come into compliance with the new regulations," Mr. Washington said, "we must come up with the most economical plan for the city: to retrofit the old buildings or relocate and build another structure."
F.D.A. officials want the city to produce a compliance schedule by this summer, he added, and that is the deadline for a decision on the market's future.
Mr. Washington, who is Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services, said that food safety was not the only reason to revamp the market. "The wholesale merchants understand as well as we do that something has to happen," he said. "The market was built with technology from the turn of the century, not the millennium we are about to enter."
The cost of renovating the old market or erecting a new one will be borne by the city, Mr. Washington said. But the expense, he asserted, could be recouped by enlarging the market and making it more efficient. The changes, he said, would generate more business, more taxes and higher rents by providing space for more wholesale companies.
The city collects $3 million a year in rents from 60 wholesale companies licensed to operate at the market, which extends on South Street from Fulton Street to Peck Slip. The overall market consists of two main buildings and a dozen other buildings in which venders have stalls.
Merchants expressed mixed emotions about overhauling or leaving the market, which traces it origins to fishmongers who set up outdoor stalls on Fulton Street at the edge of the East River in 1833. Some would welcome an enclosed, state-of-the-art facility that would no longer require them to work outdoors in frosty winter weather, dodging trucks and handcarts on clogged, narrow cobblestone streets.
"The conditions we work in are primitive," said Robert Smith, an owner of the Arrow Seafood Company and vice president of the New York Wholesale Fish Dealers Association, one of three trade groups at the market.
Saying that the market lacked water and electricity for increasing business, Mr. Smith said, "It's great for writers to be nostalgic about this place, but this is an industry, not a museum."
Michael Driansky, vice president of Caleb Haley, a company that has been at the market since 1859, said a new facility with better refrigeration would increase business. "I'd love it, if the city put us in a high-tech building for the next 50 years," said Mr. Driansky, who is the secretary of the Fulton Market Fish Mongers Association.
Others said that a move could hurt their businesses by disrupting long affiliations with customers. They also said that lower Manhattan was an ideal hub for supplying seafood in New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Frank Mineo, the owner of Smitty's Fillet House, and president of the Sidewalk Dealers Association, had reservations about moving and said that many dealers had made expensive renovations in recent years. "The city has only given us vague generalities and we need specifics about what they are planning," Mr. Mineo said.
"We would be crazy to turn down a new facility if it is in the right place and the deal is right for us. But I love this location because of its accessibility to customers from the tristate area."
Eddie Monani, the head of the Joe Monani Fish Company, said the Giuliani administration wanted to close the market mainly to encourage real estate development.
Noting that the administration in 1995 rejected a proposal by some merchants for a new market in Brooklyn, Mr. Monani said that overall working conditions had improved in the last five years and since the city began to closely monitor the market. "We can meet the government's regulations by icing fish properly." he said. "We know how to handle fish, we've been doing it for 100 years."
Dennis Faicco, secretary treasurer of Local 359 of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, a unit that represents 400 market employees, said relocating would be burdensome for many workers who live near the site.
In 1995, in a campaign against entrenched Mafia influence and corruption, the Giuliani administration began licensing and requiring integrity checks of all companies and employees at the market. More than a dozen companies were ousted and law enforcement officials say that organized crime rackets appear to have been eliminated.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With a big and boisterous rally on Wednesday that drew tens of thousands of marchers, New York's labor unions signaled that they were on a collision course with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki -- one that could have major effects on coming contract talks and political campaigns.
As they harangued the Mayor and Governor from a sound stage within earshot of City Hall, labor leaders insisted that the two Republicans had policies that favored the rich and shortchanged working families, and several leaders threatened to make life tough for Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki in any future campaigns. 
 With contract talks approaching, the city's unions have rallied their troops and sought to throw the Mayor on the defensive, but City Hall officials say they will not be intimidated and will not grant labor's demands unless the city receives something in return. Mr. Giuliani asserts that several previous mayors have driven the city to near bankruptcy by being too generous to municipal unions, but he said this week that he would not cave in to them.
These tensions between labor and the two Republicans indicate a sea change in their relationship; a few years ago, the two politicians received many union endorsements when they ran for re-election. In 1997, Mr. Giuliani won over the city teachers' union by increasing spending on education; Mr. Pataki last year pleased health care unions by increasing health care spending.
But in a few short months, these two politicians and New York's unions have changed course, making conflict inevitable.
With an eye to higher office -- and to the Republican Party's conservative base -- Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki have both tacked to the right, in ways that many unions see as a slap at them. Mr. Giuliani's embrace of a plan to issue vouchers to send children to private schools has angered the teachers' union, while Mr. Pataki's plan to cut $2.1 billion in health care spending this year has enraged the city's largest health care workers' union.
"Last year the Governor and Mayor were focusing on being Governor and Mayor," said Norman Adler, a political consultant, "and now they're focusing on being President and Senator. Both of them see themselves in primaries, and they know that people who participate in Republican primaries are to the right."
At the same time, several New York unions have tacked to the left, often because of changes at the top. Lee Saunders, the trustee named to clean up District Council 37, the giant municipal union, advocates a more confrontational approach than did his predecessor, Stanley Hill, a Giuliani ally who agreed to a two-year wage freeze in the current contract that angered many union members.
Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, and Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., are taking a more activist approach than their predecessors. And Dennis Rivera, one of the city's most liberal labor leaders, has greatly expanded his clout, heading not just 1199, the 150,000-member National Health and Human Service Employees Union, but also the 350,000-member state division of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union.
Some critics of labor say its new activism could be bad for the city and the state. They contend that greater union gains could produce budget deficits and ultimately higher taxes, which in turn could discourage businesses from expanding or investing in New York.
Many union members say they have not shared in the city's economic boom even though the wage freeze they accepted helped create the city's $2 billion budget surplus.
"Unions feel a sense of betrayal in that the city was quick to come to the unions when it needed them," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. "But after the unions helped the city create a budget surplus, the Mayor is talking antiunion."
And labor's antagonism could complicate Mr. Giuliani's life if he runs for the Senate. This hostility might not hurt Mr. Giuliani much in a Republican primary -- it might actually help him there -- but it could hurt him badly on Election Day, when he would have to woo all voters, not just conservatives.
Politicians who want to succeed Mr. Giuliani will no doubt take note of labor's new militancy. Several mayoral aspirants, including the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, appeared at Wednesday's rally.
"Whoever the next Mayor is has a force that has to be reckoned with," said Fred Siegel, a Cooper Union history professor. "I don't think it means they're going to have to give in big time to labor, but it means they have to engage in a complicated dance."
Mr. Giuliani said he objected to what he saw as the goals behind Wednesday's demonstration: weakening him politically, pressuring the city in future contract talks and helping elect a labor-friendly Democrat as the next Mayor. Mr. Giuliani warned the unions and any politicians sympathetic to labor that New York voters might prefer politicians who stand up to labor and safeguard the city's fiscal health.
A few marchers joked that the demonstration was the first big unofficial rally for a possible Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, although some Giuliani supporters, like Edward Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, were on hand as well.
But the rally and its implications could complicate the First Lady's political future. "These older institutional interests in the Democratic Party are reasserting themselves," Mr. Siegel said. "It will make it harder for Hillary to position herself as a centrist."

HEADLINE: AIRLINE IS ACCUSED OF ILLEGAL PRICING

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON with LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The Federal Government accused American Airlines today of driving smaller competitors out of one of its most important markets by illegally slashing ticket prices below cost and increasing flights sharply.
The Government said American used its dominance of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to prevent weaker competitors from gaining a foothold there in the mid-1990's, only to raise prices and reduce service after they departed. 
 The antitrust case is the first predatory pricing action brought by the Government against an airline since the industry was deregulated 21 years ago. It is part of a broader 18-month examination by the Justice Department's antitrust division of the steps that may have been taken by major airlines, including Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and United, a unit of UAL, to discourage lower-priced competition in cities they dominate.
Following deregulation in 1978, the largest airlines have moved to strengthen their control of major metropolitan airports. While airlines have on occasion sued each other on antitrust grounds, the Government has rarely intervened beyond threats of fines from the Department of Transportation.
But a growing chorus of consumer complaints about rising fares and declining service has led to a strong backlash against the industry in Congress, where lawmakers have introduced measures to force the airlines to disclose more about fares and delays, and offer compensation for inconveniences. In addition, the Transportation Department last year proposed punishing airlines that tried to stifle competition.
Senior officials at the Justice Department said the American case was particularly compelling because company documents showed that American, the nation's second-largest airline, had deliberately embarked on a strategy of selling tickets below cost and incurring significant short-term financial losses in recent years to drive out three low-cost competitors -- Vanguard Airlines, Sun Jet International and Western Pacific -- from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Executives and lawyers at American said the airline had not violated any antitrust laws but simply matched the fares of its competitors.
In 1998, American flew 70 percent of the scheduled seats out of Dallas-Fort Worth, up from 60 percent in 1991. The Government presented evidence showing that after Vanguard announced in September 1996 that it was adding service to Dallas-Fort Worth from three cities in addition to Wichita, Kan., American responded by cutting prices and adding flights on nearly all of Vanguard's Dallas routes. Two months later, Vanguard abandoned its expansion plans. By June 1997, American had reduced capacity between Wichita and Dallas by 30 percent and raised the average one-way fare by more than 50 percent to more than $90 from about $60.
"American quickly realized that these new carriers could be a significant competitive threat, estimating that as much as a billion and a half dollars of its annual revenues were at risk if they were to succeed," said Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division. "To make sure that this didn't happen, American adopted a predatory responsive strategy, saturating the market in which the start-up carriers had begun service with as much new, low-fare service of its own as was necessary to drive out the start-ups."
Attorney General Janet Reno said American "invested in short-term capacity increases and fare reductions to maintain its monopoly -- an investment it was able to recover many times over once its smaller rivals had been driven away."
American Airlines disputed the accusations by the Justice Department that it had priced its fares below cost or flooded the market with flights, and said the lawsuit was little more than sour grapes by smaller airlines, which, unable to compete, had persuaded regulators to bring the case.
"Contrary to the Justice Department's lawsuit, this action today is very potentially anti-consumer," said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the AMR Corporation, the parent company of American. "It would have a chilling effect on the marketplace if companies felt they could not match prices of competitors. We simply matched the competition."
The Justice Department complaint, filed in Federal court in Wichita, seeks an injunction barring American from cutting prices below cost and increasing flights as part of any effort to stifle competition. The case is being brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Justice Department officials said Federal antitrust law does not permit them to seek any fines or monetary awards, but that smaller airlines that were harmed by American's conduct could file their own civil antitrust lawsuits for money.
The complaint quoted from company papers describing its "Dallas-Ft. Worth Low Cost Carriers Strategy." The Government said the strategy recognized that "it could prove unprofitable in the short run." But, according to a company document, the strategy concluded: "The short-term cost, or impact on revenue can be viewed as the investment necessary to achieve the desired effect on market share."
The Government also quoted from internal American papers that suggested that the carrier intended to add flights to Kansas City to drive Vanguard from the market and that American decided to get Western Pacific out of the Dallas-Colorado Springs route before Western Pacific increased its service there.
Company executives declined to answer questions about the American Airlines documents that the Government has called incriminating but defended them in general terms.
"There is nothing wrong or illegal with tough talk about competition," Mr. Chiames said.
Trey Nicoud, a senior lawyer at American, said, "Looking at aggressive conversations in board rooms is very misleading."
To win against any airline, the Government's evidence would need to be strong because predatory pricing cases are difficult to prove. But Justice Department lawyers have argued that it is relatively easy for a large airline to profit after undercutting a rival and driving it out of a market. In the past, the Government has distinguished between legitimate competition and predatory pricing when an airline cut its fares below its costs and added capacity in a strategy that only made economic sense if the smaller rival were forced to leave the market.
Executives from the smaller rivals portrayed as victims by the Government praised the lawsuit. Of the three, Vanguard has since returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth market, Sun Jet no longer serves that airport, and Western Pacific has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors and stopped flying in early 1998.

With Prices Rising, Indians Go Up for Sale

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Tantalized by escalating franchise prices, Richard Jacobs put his Cleveland Indians up for sale yesterday, less than a year after taking the team public.
"I'll say this," said Jacobs, a 73-year-old real estate developer. "Somebody said Steinbrenner said his team is worth $1 billion and he had a buyer. And I said, 'If that buyer has a brother, give him my number.' " 
 The news that Jacobs may sell drove Indians stock up by 63.5 percent, to close at $16.25. Since going public last June at $15 a share, the stock has underperformed the market, sinking to a low of $5.375 a share. Based on yesterday's closing price, the team is worth about $224 million.
"It'll go for more than that," Jacobs said.
Larry Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer whose brother, Charles, is the chairman of Cablevision, said the plan to sell the Indians came as a "real surprise." In a statement, he said, "It is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective buyer." Recently, Larry Dolan unsuccessfully bid for the Cincinnati Reds.
Jacobs said he was not selling for estate-planning reasons. In fact, he had tried to diversify the company by adding real estate properties like hotels or television and radio stations, which might have made the stock more attractive.
"Maybe he felt the easiest way to boost the stock was to sell the team," said Jeffrey Phillips, a vice president at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, a Chicago-based investment banking firm that specializes in sports.
But Jacobs was motivated to consider selling by the prices paid last year for other Major League Baseball teams, like the Los Angeles Dodgers, at $311 million, and the Texas Rangers, at $250 million. Earlier this year, the Yankees were valued at $600 million for their merger with the Nets.
Jacobs watched as the National Football League sold the expansion Cleveland Browns for $530 million -- Jacobs was an early candidate in the team's auction -- and kept an eye on the pending $800 million sale of the Washington Redskins.
On Wednesday, Abe Pollin, 75, sold the Washington Capitals and a small stake in the Washington Wizards and the MCI Center for about $200 million.
"I never had any interest in disposing of the franchise until recently," Jacobs said. "But there's a market for it."
Jacobs said he wanted to control the process and keep the Indians in Cleveland. If he is unhappy with the prices offered or the suitors, he said, he will yank the team off the market. But Jacobs has hired two investment banking firms, Goldman Sachs Group and McDonald Investments, to identify buyers.
Whatever the price, Jacobs will profit handsomely. He and his late brother, David, acquired the once-moribund team in 1986 for $36 million. When the team went public, Jacobs collected $60 million from selling four million shares.
Last year, Jacobs was paid a $467,424 salary.
It is difficult to imagine a future owner wanting to flee Cleveland or lose the financial foundation of revenues that flow from the publicly owned Jacobs Field. The five-year-old stadium has sold out 308 consecutive games.
Last year, the team earned operating income of $12.7 million on revenues of $144.5 million, which included $55.8 million for tickets, $16.2 million for concessions, $9.4 million for luxury suite and club seat rentals and $9.8 million for advertising. Playoff revenues totaled $8.7 million.
Although the Indians have maximized most existing revenues, Jacobs said the team expected to benefit greatly when baseball's national television contracts expire after the 2000 season and from selling naming rights to the ball park.
"They can do better than they've been doing," said Andy Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. "They have excess demands for all tickets, and they've thought of merging with the Cavaliers into a holding company that would present a united front to sell TV rights."
Since moving into Jacobs Field, the Indians' record is 464-310, a winning percentage of .599. The team lost the 1995 and 1997 World Series and the American League Championship Series to the Yankees last season.

HEADLINE: THE FINE PRINT: The Emergency Spending Bill;
Relief Bill Is Laden With Special Projects as It Creaks Through Committee

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK with TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 13

 BODY:
On the face of it, the seven-year battle over a mining company's petition to blow a 900-foot hole in a mountain in northern Washington State and extract the gold inside would seem to have nothing to do with an emergency bill in Congress to aid war refugees in Kosovo and victims of the recent Midwest tornadoes.
But that is only on the face of it. In fact, before House and Senate conferees reached agreement tonight on the emergency spending bill, negotiations were bogged down by the efforts of lawmakers to cut deals, trade favors and insert pet projects. The agreement they reached this evening more than doubled the amount President Clinton had sought for war and disaster relief, to a total of $14.7 billion and included a host of non-budget provisions. 
 That is where Buckhorn Mountain, in the Okanogan Highlands of north-central Washington, comes in. So far, Washington's senior Senator, Slade Gorton, a Republican who is running for re-election next year, has succeeded in attaching language to the spending bill that effectively overturns a Clinton Administration decision to deny a permit for the mine. The Administration has said mining would leave far too much waste rock and cyanide-treated ore on Federal land at the mountain, near the Canadian border.
The pro-mining measure, or rider, is just one that members of Congress from all over the nation are attaching to to the spending bill. Others include hundreds of millions of dollars in farm aid, loan programs for the steel, oil and gas industries and a host of other measures.
Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, fought, unsuccessfully, for language to force the White House to keep the Alabama sturgeon off the endangered species amendment. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, did succeed in adding $3 million for commercial reindeer herders.
Legislation, of course, is often made in ways that are not pretty, and riders have been around almost since the dawn of the Republic. But many involved in the fight in the Capitol say they find something particularly execrable about the way that this bill, also intended to provide help for victims of last year's Central American hurricanes, has been delayed by matters affecting so many other people whose interests are, to say the least, less urgent.
"I think this is about as low as it goes," said Marty Hayden, director of policy and legislation for the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental group that opposes the Buckhorn Mountain mining project. "The supporters of these efforts are cynically taking advantage of a very real human tragedy, by including this provision and others like it in a bill meant to aid victims of natural disaster and war."
But supporters of the provisions are in a dudgeon no less high. Senator Gorton, for instance, who huddled with a mining lobbyist late Wednesday night outside a Capitol basement conference room, reviewing proposed language, said that including the rider in a bill that is unlikely to be vetoed was a perfectly acceptable way of overturning the Administration's decision to block the mine.
The mining company, Battle Mountain Gold of Houston, and a partner, the Crown Resources Corporation of Denver, have spent years and an estimated $80 million on the permit process and have obtained permits from lower agencies.
Senator Gorton criticized the decision by the Interior Department to block the mining project.
"This is just immoral," he said. "This is not how an honest government deals with its citizens."
The decision is part of the Administration's effort to overturn a century-old mining law that has allowed companies to extract billions of dollars of minerals from Federal land and pay no royalties.
Even though the President is pressing for speedy passage of any package that will allow the United States and its NATO allies to fight the war in Yugoslavia and aid refugees, a White House spokeswoman held out the possibility of a veto and blamed Congress for "trying to take advantage of emergency needs in Kosovo and Central America by loading up this bill with everybody's pet projects."
Senator Gorton has strongly defended the project as an economic boon for a depressed area of Washington, Okanogan County, which has an unemployment rate of about 11 percent, more than twice the state average.
Some residents of the area are enthusiastic about Senator Gorton's support of the mine project, which could employ 140 people for about 10 years and yield as much as half a billion dollars of gold.
"We've had several bad years in a row in the apples market; the timber industry is down," said Jimmie Dale Walker, the Mayor of Oroville, a town of 1,500 people near Buckhorn Mountain.
Others, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, whose members live near five streams with headwaters on Buckhorn Mountain, are bitterly opposed. Many of the critics say the mine threatens the spectacular qualities that have made tourism an important part of the local economy.
"Some people have this kind of star in their eyes that they're going to get rich on the gold mine, instead of looking at the natural beauty all around them and working with that," said Dave Kliegman, executive director of the Okanogan Highlands Alliance, a local environment group.
For Senator Gorton, the legislative maneuver is consistent with his strong support for mining and logging companies in his 17-year career in the Senate.
Such moves have earned him the enmity of environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, whose Northwest regional director, Bill Arthur, said today that the Senator's "latest back-room deal continued a long line of shameless acts on behalf of corporate interests to run roughshod over America's environmental laws."
The Senator's actions on behalf of Texas-based Battle Mountain Gold have also inspired considerable ire in his home state, including that of one Seattle Post-Intelligencer reader who recently wrote to the paper: "Three Senators from Texas and only one from Washington is surely unconstitutional."
In the conference committee, Mr. Gorton succeeded in obtaining language that overturns the Clinton Administration's decision on the mining project, which hinges on a reading of the 1872 law.
That law, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant to encourage Western development and in the pickaxe-and-mule era of mining, still allows mining companies broad access to Federal land for just a few dollars an acre.
Critics, including the Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, say it amounts to a huge giveaway of public resources and has left a dangerous legacy of 500,000 abandoned mines across the West.
Beyond the debate over the 1872 law is the question of whether a measure blocking the Administration's decision belongs in an emergency spending bill.
Mr. Gorton's Senate colleague from Washington, Patty Murray, a Democrat, said late Wednesday that his rider was "the wrong manner" to debate the mining law.
"To address this in the middle of the night in an emergency bill that seeks to address the Kosovo issue is wrong," Senator Murray said.
And nearly two dozen House Republicans, led by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of Utica, N.Y., signed a letter earlier this week urging that the spending bill be kept free of "extraneous provisions" and riders.
"The supplemental bills address serious and urgent matters, including emergency aid for farmers and money for our troops in Kosovo," the letter said. "Controversial policy decisions ought to have a full airing on the House floor, and should not be added into must-pass bills during conference negotiations. This is particularly true in the case of these supplemental bills, which address genuine emergencies."
But other members of Congress seemed prepared to stretch the definition of what belonged in the bill. "The question of whether it's an emergency or not," said Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, "is in the eye of the beholder."

Elizabeth King -- 'Homunculus'

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:

Kent Gallery
67 Prince Street
SoHo
Through May 22
Elizabeth King's sculptures and videos aim to be part of the long history of the lifelike automaton, which means they are both hokey and uncannily mesmerizing. 
 Her third solo show in New York includes impeccable human heads made of porcelain with full lips and big, searching glass eyes; a pair of small hands with the requisite number of joints, a few of which move ever so slightly (from the action of an invisible pendulum and magnets); and an isolated glass eye and its lid, beside a tiny jewel-like video of the two in action. (Think of Tony Oursler, ultra-refined).
There are also two high-definition videos. In "Eidolon," a porcelain head appears to shift and turn, its unchanging gaze replicating anxious attention. In "The Sizes of Things in the Mind's Eye," another, more complete doll is shown examining her hands and fiddling with her fingers. These movements result from a painstaking process of minute adjustments of the figure, alternating with frame-by-frame recording. In this final work, the miraculously moving automaton is nearly upstaged by the video itself, which projects the doll's image in space so that it appears to be suspended within a freestanding metal frame.
Ms. King's ultimate subject may be the transformative wonders of human technology, both old and new, and she makes us see them -- through creatures who themselves do nothing but look -- with unusual intensity. At times the melancholy innocence of these creatures (enhanced by their newbornlike baldness) gives you a view of the human soul in its perpetual isolation.
At other times, they seem overwhelmingly theatrical -- no less breathtaking, but better suited to a high-priced puppet show or a window at Tiffany's. Ms. King deploys her skills with undeniable passion and admirable economy, but her goal, the imitation of life, is rarely more than a fascinating sidebar to either life or art.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: CHINA'S MOOD;
Real Public Rage Stoked By Propaganda Machine

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 13

 BODY:
Ever since NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday, China's state-run media have dished up a ceaseless stream of banner headlines and jarring photos: of bereft parents crying over victims' bodies, of President Jiang Zemin in tears as he greeted families of the dead.
Newspapers and television programs have called the bombing an intentional "criminal act" perpetrated by "U.S.-led NATO forces." The three dead Chinese have been anointed "martyrs." The NATO forces, "barbarians," or worse. 
 But there has been no mention of the rock-throwing that damaged the facade of the United States Embassy in Beijing, nor have the words "ethnic cleansing" ever appeared. And it took two days for China's news media to report President Clinton's initial apology, fanning the flame of public outrage.
State-controlled reports have played a crucial link in the cycle of hatred that has rolled through China this week, both reflecting genuine public outrage and urging it on, sometimes with half-truths and inflammatory calls for the "revenge of blood debts."
The Government's somewhat rusty propaganda apparatus seemed to spring back to life in response to this extraordinary event.
In a country where newspapers and television programs are generally quite diverse and distinct, it was startling to watch China's news media once again speak with one voice. And many Chinese people were moved by what they heard and saw.
"Seeing the news reports and those pictures, I felt furious about America's actions," said Wei Fang, a 24-year-old auditor at an American accounting firm in Beijing.
Luo Zhanggong, a 28-year-old independent businessman who spent the weekend making protest posters for display near his home, said he "simply didn't believe" Western claims that student demonstrators had trashed the American Embassy.
But these days it may be hard to conduct an old-style propaganda campaign in China, where millions of urban Chinese have access to foreign Web sites, watch television beamed in by satellite from Hong Kong and have friends and relatives overseas.
"Chinese people are much more sophisticated than they were 20 years ago," said Minxin Pei, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
There were some signs that by week's end the official version of events was fraying around the edges. At a Government press conference today, a Chinese television reporter boldly asked the Foreign Ministry spokesman to comment on Western accusations of ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia.
And on the front page of today's Southern Weekend, a popular weekly with a liberal bent, editors condemned the NATO bombings, but also warned against developing xenophobia and "blind, fanatical, narrow-minded nationalism."
The Chinese news media have become far more lively and diverse in the last decade, partly because, to survive in the country's new market economy, television programs must rely on advertising and newspapers need to attract paying readers.
To this end, dozens of newspapers and television programs have branched into investigative reporting, run editorials on topics like legal reforms and cover stories about unemployment, crime and domestic violence. Today more than ever, China's press and news broadcasts look more like journalism and less like propaganda.
And readers and viewers are more inclined to expect the truth. As one university student told his American professor this week: "The protesters didn't set fire to an American consulate -- that's a lie. If it was true it would have been on China Central Television."
But the news media's core task is still to protect and promote the Government's point of view and this week they moved back to basics. Hours after the bombings, Ding Guangen, the head of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department, called a meeting of newspaper editors to order up coverage.
Since then, virtually every newspaper -- from the trendy Beijing Youth Daily to the party's mouthpiece, People's Daily -- has devoted pages and pages to the bombings, all expressing identical views and often using the same catch phrases. Even specialty papers like Farmers Daily and Health News joined in. Enterprising television programs that normally focus on corruption, has bellowed a similar outrage.
For example, Beijing Youth Daily has devoted at least eight pages to the bombings every day, a dramatic shift from its usual lively mix.
Last Sunday, the newspaper's banner headline "Shock -- Outrage -- Protest" was punctuated with tiny targets, the symbol of Serbian defiance. In another issue, a headline said "The Bomb Attack Was Premeditated." Virtually all newspapers have offered up columns by military experts contending that the bombing was intentional.
The youth paper did not give full coverage to the Western apology until Tuesday, two days after Western leaders first expressed regrets.
Such manipulations left the Chinese people stewing over the apparent lack of an apology for an extra 48 hours.
"Russia and smaller countries all over the world are expressing their condolences, but I haven't seen anything about Western countries expressing these thoughts," said an angry doctor who would give only her surname, Han. "It doesn't seem like the West regards all this as important."
Many Beijingers point out that the vast propaganda campaign was principally effective because it dovetailed with the public's initial gut fury about the bombings, even if careful management fueled that rage and channeled it into certain directions.
The vast majority of Chinese have steadfastly disapproved of the NATO bombing campaign, in part because there has been no reporting about ethnic cleansing and in part because they regard the Western forces as bullies who have no business being there.
"Whatever the disparities between the Chinese media and the Western press, for us there are two simple facts: That NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy and that three people died," said Mr. Luo, who owns a chemical company. "Now I'm not a party kind of person, but this is a matter on which the Chinese people, from the lowest peasant on up, are extremely unified."
Mr. Luo and others dismissed the notion that in 1999 a propaganda campaign could ever manipulate Chinese people's thoughts.
"These days China has become quite open and we get news from a whole variety of sources," said Li Pingwei, a 35-year-old who works in advertising. "I get it from TV, newspapers, the Internet and from speaking to my friends and colleagues who are overseas. I know what the outside world is saying."
For example, Mr. Li said he "had heard" that the American Consulate in Chengdu had been burned. And he said he debated with his Chinese friends working in the West about whether the bombing was intentional or not.
"They definitely have a different understanding of the events from Chinese people here," Mr. Li said. "But they think the American media are to some extent also controlled. Our media say it was deliberate and theirs say it was a mistake. So our opinions differ."
But others had more basic reasons why the media blitz here left them unmoved.
"Of course everyone's furious, three people were killed," said a man surnamed Wang, a shopkeeper. "Would I demonstrate? Of course not! You can't make money demonstrating. And that's what it's all about now, isn't it?"

New Jobs Expected For Seneca County

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A new maximum security state prison and a treatment center for troubled youths will create nearly 1,000 jobs in rural Seneca County, N.Y., starting next year, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.
Construction of the $180 million, 750-cell prison is under way at the Seneca Army Depot, an 11,000-acre base that stored nuclear weapons during the cold war and is scheduled to close in 2001. 
 The prison, due to open in summer 2000 near the village of Ovid, is designed to hold up to 1,500 inmates. It will employ 638 people and have a payroll of $25 million, state officials say.
Work is to begin in July on the Seneca Woods Youth Residential Treatment Center at the northern end of the depot, state officials said. It will enroll New York children with clinical emotional problems and histories of delinquency.
The center, which is expected to employ more than 350 people and have a payroll of $12 million, is to be operated beginning next spring by KidsPeace, a nonprofit group that runs 25 such children's centers around the nation.
"We can look with confidence to our future," Mr. Pataki told county employees and officials gathered in a county building in Waterloo. "It's happening. Those jobs are going to be here in Seneca County."
Nearly two-thirds of the depot's 800 civilian workers were laid off in 1993, and 500 soldiers were transferred, leaving just a base commander and fewer than 100 other employees.

Ruling on Special Fees

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled yesterday that it is legal to charge fees to owners of commercial property in business improvement zones even though residents of the same zones do not have to pay the fees.
Owners of buildings in the Headquarters Plaza mall and office complex in Morristown had filed lawsuits claiming that the extra fee was unfair because homeowners living in the improvement zone did not have to pay it. 
 Their lawyers argued that such selective taxation violated the State Constitution. They also said the exemption for residential property owners meant that the commercial owners had to pay proportionately more.
In 1994, the Morristown Special Improvement District charged a special assessment of 0.1 percent of a property's assessed value, billing the fee on commercial properties only.
Roc-Jersey, a group of businesses that owns Headquarters Plaza, was charged $64,000 in improvement district fees in 1994. The district's budget was used to pay for tourism promotions, visitor guides and downtown beautification.
In their unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court judges said the fee was not a tax, but a special charge in exchange for services of unique value to the business owners.
Associate Justice Alan Handler wrote that homeowners should not have to pay the improvement fees, even though they might benefit from the improvements, because the main purpose of the fees was to improve the business climate.

HEADLINE: Taking on Sex and the Single Saint;
For Gary Wills, St. Augustine is Just the Latest Chapter in His Study of Culture

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Sinners have always loved Augustine, the fourth-century saint, for he has seemed like such a great sinner himself. He was obsessed with sex, or so it appeared in his great work "The City of God." And he was willing to undertake a rigorous self-analysis in writings like his "Confessions," giving him an almost contemporary accessibility.
But now the journalist Garry Wills has written "St. Augustine" (in the Penguin Lives series of brief biographies), which tries to revise the popular view of the saint, and the work may disappoint some sinners. In the book, Mr. Wills says that Augustine wasn't sex-obsessed at all but concerned with how sexual dysfunction reflects man's fall from grace, and that the "Confessions" was not an autobiography in the conventional sense but "mainly a theological meditation on his own life." "Revelation is not simply a text outside life," he says. "Rather it enters your life in the form of your own experience." 
 Could Mr. Wills explain then, St. Augustine's relevance to the modern world?
But Mr. Wills will not reduce St. Augustine to "sound bites," as he puts it. His full, cherubic face often remains expressionless when he speaks; sometimes there is a thin smile. He is 64 and lives in a large yellow brick house in Evanston, Ill., where one of the interviews with him was conducted. He seems impatient with people who are not as well read as he is. "He's sort of like a good boxer," said his good friend, Studs Terkel. "He doesn't waste any punches."
Nor does he let down his guard for a moment. Perhaps there are parallels between him and St. Augustine with respect to Augustine's quest for self-knowledge? "There are no parallels with my own life. That's nonsense," Mr. Wills said, annoyance coloring his voice. "Don't try to push that idea. It makes no sense. I have no identification with him whatsoever."
Asked how many books he has written, he curtly replied, "Look it up in 'Who's Who.' " "Who's Who" lists 19, including one with a co-author and one he edited. That would make "St. Augustine" his 20th book, and next fall he will publish another, "A Necessary Evil" (Simon & Schuster), about Americans' fear of government.
More impressive than the number, however, is the range. He has brought his talent as a scholar to everything from Italian film to opera, from President Clinton to the Declaration of Independence. He has a mimetic memory of obscure fourth-century North African ecclesiastical texts in his book on Augustine, of Homeric boxing references in an article on Muhammad Ali and of ancient Greek rhetorical terms in his 1992 book, "Lincoln at Gettysburg," a study of the Gettysburg address, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize.
Mr. Wills said he owes his retentive memory to his Roman Catholic school education, with its emphasis on recitation. Robert Silvers, his editor at The New York Review of Books, says the breadth of Mr. Wills's learning sometimes makes him "a little speechless."
"I can't think of anyone who combines this remarkable range of interests and abilities," Mr. Silvers said.
Pressed to identify the common thread in his work, Mr. Wills responds: "I suppose the study of culture." The Presidents he has written about -- John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan -- are what he calls "cultural indicators." They "tell you a good deal about the America they were in."
There is another theme that stands out in Mr. Wills's writing: the constant interplay between myth and reality in American life. In his first big success, in 1970, "Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man," he famously called Nixon a liberal trying to resurrect "a web of myths that have lost their magic." The Emersonian ideal of hard work has lost its power, Mr. Wills argued, and Adam Smith's notion of a self-regulating market place hasn't worked. Politicians must give up their atomistic vision for a more communitarian ideal, he wrote.
"Reagan's America: Innocents at Home," continued the theme of myths. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Wills wrote, "is the sincerest claimant to a heritage that never existed, a perfect blend of an authentic America he grew up in and of that America's own fables about its past." He embodied "an American instinct to claim simplicity," but his sunny nature belied a painful Depression-era childhood. He opposed welfare, but his family received Government relief during the Depression. As President, Mr. Reagan claimed to have reduced Government spending, but he actually increased it.
And in "John Wayne's America," Mr. Wills wrote that Wayne presented himself as the awkward individualist, the brave warrior, defending the endless frontier even though he never served in the military. He played the cowboy but hated horses. He became for Americans "a conduit they used to communicate with their own desired selves or their own imagined past."
Like Wayne, Mr. Wills is a child of the Midwest. He was raised for the most part in Adrian, Mich. His father, John Wills, sold appliances. His mother, Mayno, worked for the State Department of Unemployment. Mr. Wills parents were divorced, then remarried.
Inspired by his Jesuit high school teachers, Mr. Wills entered a seminary. But he didn't make it as a priest. "It was eros specifically and generally," Mr. Wills said. Today he is a practicing Catholic who regularly attends church but says he believes in a right to abortion, marriage for priests and the ordination of women.
He went on to get his Ph.D. in classics from Yale, writing his dissertation on Aeschylus. While at Yale he sent an unsolicited article attacking what he called the glib style of Time magazine to William F. Buckley Jr., the editor of the conservative National Review. Mr. Buckley printed it and began giving him assignments.
When they met, "he asked me if I was a conservative," Mr. Wills said. Mr. Wills told him: "I'm a distributist, like G. K. Chesterton. Communitarian. Anti-capitalist. Anti-government."
"Is that a conservative?" Mr. Wills asked.
"I'm afraid not," Mr. Buckley replied. Nonetheless, Mr. Wills became one of the young writers of National Review's golden age, among them Joan Didion, Renata Adler, John Leonard and Arlene Croce.
But during the Vietnam War his politics began to change. He was arrested twice in antiwar demonstrations. When Mr. Buckley rejected one of his articles on Vietnam, they parted ways amicably, Mr. Wills said. Today Mr. Wills describes himself as a cultural conservative, but when it comes to politics, "I'm more a Democrat than a Republican."
In 1957 Mr. Wills covered the Senate hearings on Jimmy Hoffa for National Review. He was on the shuttle from Washington when a stewardess with "big and mocking Italian eyes" noticed he was reading Henri Bergson's "Two Sources," Mr. Wills wrote in "Confessions of a Conservative." "She said, 'Aren't you a little too young to be reading that?' " The stewardess was Natalie Cavallo, and Mr. Wills married her.
Even on their honeymoon in England, Mr. Wills wasted no time, doing research for his first book, "Chesterton: Man and Mask," published in 1961. Today Natalie Wills is her husband's first reader. She takes photographs to aid his memory. She handles the financial aspects of his career, leaving him time to write in the mornings at home and in the afternoon to do research at the library. They have three children, Lydia, 35, a literary agent; Garry Jr., 38, a film maker, and John, 39, a programmer.
For much of his adult life, Mr. Wills has been an academic. At times he has been accused of having an academic style. "Garry Wills is a bright young man who left his Yale Ph.D. in classics behind him only to bring the academic vices of preciosity and obfuscation to his new career as a political journalist," one Newsweek critic wrote.
In 1988 Mr. Wills gave up tenure at Northwestern University, though he has remained in Evanston, teaching one course annually. He prefers living far from Washington and New York, he said. "I'd rather be remote. I get more work done."
Mr. Wills said he had long been preoccupied with St. Augustine. Augustine was born in 354 in Tagaste, Numidia, in North Africa. From age 16 to 31 he lived with a woman who bore him a son. He converted to Christianity and eventually became Bishop of Hippo. His doctrines on original sin, divine grace and free will have influenced every branch of Christianity.
Augustine wrote frankly about sex in "The City of God:" "At times, without intention, the body stirs on its own insistent," Augustine wrote. "At other times, it leaves a straining lover in the lurch." At another point he describes the Stoics' wanting to defy social codes by having public intercourse. But because they couldn't respond on command, they used clubs to simulate an erection. Still, despite the almost graphic nature of some of his writings, Mr. Wills said, for Augustine sexual turmoil is "one sign of the inner dividedness of the human being. Your body doesn't respond the way you want it to."
"Greed, violence and deception were greater concerns in his sermons," Mr. Wills writes.
Mr. Wills is translating "Confessions" from the Latin and writing a commentary on it. He said he was drawn to Augustine because "he has such a questioning mind, such a fresh way of going at everything."
"In a way the quest for God is a quest into himself," Mr. Wills said. "He's also just a great writer."

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley's New Think Tank Stakes Out 'Radical Center'

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
In Thinktankland, the main attractions are by now wearyingly familiar. The conservative Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute and the liberal-centrist Brookings Institution along with several others have for years competed to convert their ideas about taxes, foreign policy, the environment or whatever into policy in the real world.
But since the beginning of this year, a new entry in the public policy community, the New America Foundation, has been trying to provide something different. Led by Ted Halstead, its president, New America has ensconced itself in handsome quarters near Dupont Circle and hopes to change the think tank landscape. Mr. Halstead boasts that New America will introduce younger voices, break out of the traditional liberal and conservative categories and produce unconventional ideas. 
 Yet no matter how many innovations New America offers, none may be as inspired as the one associated with its founding: getting money from the cyberbarons of Silicon Valley. New America's board includes Eric E. Schmidt, the chairman and chief executive of Novell, and Eric A. Benhamou, chairman and chief executive of the 3Com Corporation. Mr. Halstead and James Fallows, the chairman of New America, are courting other leaders in Silicon Valley, most notably Andrew S. Grove, the head of Intel.
Mr. Schmidt of Novell said in an interview that New America was attractive to him and his fellow high-tech entrepreneurs because it was trying to escape the classic liberal versus conservative divide.
"I thought that here is a place in which new ideas can flourish which are not aligned with any partisan view," he said. "A large number of people out here are tired of the left-right debate, which exists largely because it makes for good television."
High-tech entrepreneurs have been so busy making money, he said, they have ignored Government and public policy issues. "But the Government is no longer ignoring us," he said, "so we have to get organized, to have vehicles for this, and this -- New America -- is one."
Mr. Schmidt said that typically when a corporate leader in Silicon Valley meets with a member of Congress, the talk invariably ends with the Congressman's disingenuous interest in the businessman's ideas and a naked pitch for campaign donations.
New America, he said, will not be obliged to champion the broad tenets of Silicon Valley, which some loosely define as meritocracy, individual incentives and as little Government interference as is feasible. "The ideas that come out may well include some I might not agree with," Mr. Schmidt said.
For nearly two decades, the center of gravity in Thinktankland has tilted to the right. The Heritage Foundation, brash and aggressive, and the American Enterprise Institute, its more staid cousin, have been able to wield influence in the Reagan and Bush Administrations and more recently in the Republican-dominated Congress. They have outpaced their counterparts on the left in both influence and money.
The success of places like Heritage -- and perhaps New America -- also underlines the remoteness of universities from real policy-making, which has stirred some ambivalence in the academic world.
Just as Silicon Valley has embraced a youth culture, so does the New America Foundation. Mr. Halstead, who thought up the idea for New America with a few friends, is 30 years old and already on his second think tank. When he was 25 he founded Redefining America, a San Francisco-based foundation that specializes in environmental and economic programs.
In a forthcoming article in The Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Halstead argues that people his age have removed themselves from politics and policy in overwhelming numbers, largely out of distrust of political leaders and institutions as well as impatience with the constricting right and left labels.
At the American Enterprise Institute, the term senior fellow applies to people like Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the chief American delegate to the United Nations in the Reagan Administration, and Herbert Stein, the Chairman of Economic Advisers in the Nixon Administration.
At New America, senior fellows are in their 30's and mere fellows are in their 20's because, as Mr. Halstead said in an interview, they have not acquired the seasoning to have made a name for themselves.
One of the Heritage Foundation's strategies has been to produce a report to promote an idea and hold a news conference or distribute the report to reporters, but New America's approach is to subsidize the journalists directly.
"The new way, we think, is to get people to write and place their ideas in newspapers, magazines and to discuss them on talk shows," Mr. Halstead said.
The senior fellows this year, Debra Dickerson, Michael Lind and Margaret Talbot, are being given annual grants of $50,000 apiece, health benefits and an office plus whatever fees they earn from publishing their writings. Five fellows are given $25,000 each plus an office and benefits. In return, they are expected to identify themselves as fellows at the New America Foundation when they write. Mr. Lind and Ms. Talbot have each written two articles for The New York Times in which they were identified as senior fellows of the foundation.
So what is the working philosophy of the New America Foundation?
The question produces a series of agonized answers from Mr. Halstead and just about everybody else connected with New America. New America, it seems, has defined itself more by what it isn't than what it is.
"For a young person who is not a conservative and who wants to comment on public affairs, there is an intellectual loneliness," Mr. Halstead said. "There are not enough partners on the ideological center."
In the end, Mr. Halstead said he favors the description "radical center," a term that neatly combines the notion of ferment (radical) with steadiness and a sensible avoidance of fringe ideas (center).
To Mr. Halstead, a shorthand definition of the radical center includes economic populism (as in say, support for higher minimum wages) and skepticism about social programs (including an unease with many forms of affirmative action).
In addition to subsidizing fellows, New America plans specific projects, Mr. Halstead said, like one investigating whether it makes sense for the United States to sell assets like mineral rights or polluting permits to the highest bidder.
"I'm looking for the next New Deal," he said.

World Trade Group Hiding Substance Behind Emotion

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 14

 BODY:
Anger and betrayal have colored the World Trade Organization's deadlocked talks to choose a new leader, but behind the emotions are three substantive issues -- the interests of workers, farmers and the environment -- that have generally polarized the 134-nation group, producing odd alliances of rich and poor, big and small.
Whoever is picked as director general of the organization that sets rules for global commerce will have an important impact on whether it tries to impose some labor and environmental protection rules on everyone, and tries to clear away some existing domestic protections for agriculture. 
 Such changes, on the surface, seem fair and reflect the global forum's commitment to level playing fields in the competition to sell goods and services across borders. But they represent threats to countries heavily dependent on agriculture, farm imports or the use of inexpensive labor.
 These issues have factored into the reasons why member countries are refusing to compromise over the two finalist candidates, Mike Moore of New Zealand and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand.
The deadlock, now entering its third week, has left the organization leaderless since the four-year term of Renato Ruggiero of Italy expired May 1.
The choices of Japan and the United States, the two giant trading powers, particularly reflect concerns over these issues.
The United States wants Mr. Moore, who is seen as a strong advocate of better worker treatment and free trade in agriculture. Japan favors Mr. Supachai because he is viewed as more sensitive to the interests of farmers who worry that they cannot compete with inexpensive imports.
The United States' preference rests partly on concerns that Mr. Supachai would not advocate environmental and labor issues. "It became clear that these issues would take a back seat, as far as Supachai was concerned," a United States official said.
 American environmental setbacks in trade organization decisions, most notably an overruling of United States safeguards for endangered sea turtles caught in shrimpers' nets, contributed to Washington's concern that a new trade leader be attuned to such issues.
Japan and the United States also differ on which candidate would serve each nation's interest best in agriculture. The Americans view Mr. Moore as a forceful advocate of ending subsidies for farmers that keep prices artificially high. The Japanese say such a position is unfair to countries that want to protect small, family-run farms. Yoichi Suzuki, Japan's envoy to the trade organization, said, "Politically speaking, it is not very easy to accept someone from a country which is a free trader in agriculture."
However, Thailand, too, is a large agricultural exporter, especially of rice, a sensitive commodity in Asia, as well as being a member, along with New Zealand, of a major pro-free trade group. So why would Japan back Mr. Supachai? "He is viewed as having a more receptive attitude to the Japanese view that agriculture is a pillar of rural life, of the environment, of conserving old ways," a Japanese negotiator said.
 Not every country with big agricultural interests has based its decision on agriculture alone. France, with entrenched farm subsidies and a powerful farmers lobby, supports Mr. Moore. "This is a case where the labor forces who fear low-wage competition have won out over the agricultural interests," a European diplomat said.
 Other European countries have also split between the two candidates, leaving the 15-member European Union with no unified choice for director general.
Although Washington favors Mr. Moore it has remained conspicuously silent. This has created resentment among a number of trade diplomats in Geneva, who are convinced that American trade officials are maneuvering clandestinely to insure that Mr. Moore wins.
Resentment is also fueled by a belief among many developing countries that they have not benefitedfrom free-trade rules, that liberalized agricultural trade and higher labor standards would hurt them. Many are also convinced that a representative from a developing country, such as Thailand, should lead the organization. Among the most vocal advocates of Mr. Supachai's candidacy are India and Mexico.
"There is a strong feeling, right or wrong, that the United States has prolonged this race to influence the outcome," one envoy from a developing country said. "That has upset a number of delegates, and entrenched positions."

U.S. Threatens Europe With Duties in Beef Dispute

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The United States escalated a trade war with the European Union today by threatening to impose $202 million in punitive duties on the trading bloc for banning imports of American beef from hormone-treated cattle.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said Washington remained open to negotiations to resolve the decade-old dispute. But she told reporters, "We will absolutely protect our rights and we will without question retaliate if the E.U. persists in disregarding the rules." 
 In Brussels, the European Union Farm Commissioner, Franz Fischler, said it would ask the World Trade Organization to review the United States plan to impose $202 million in 100 percent duties on European Union goods.
"We will certainly challenge this sum and the U.S. will have to try to justify before a W.T.O. arbitrator," Mr. Fischler said in a statement.
That review, which could result in a higher or lower figure than the one sought by Washington, would delay any duties until at least July 12 -- the deadline for the trade organization's arbitration.
Goods subject to the duties could include European pork, beef, poultry and other goods like Dijon mustard and spring water. Oats and small-engine motorcycles could also be hit.
Those items were on a preliminary list released by the Clinton Administration in late March. The United States will wait until the arbitrator decides the final amount before announcing which products will be subject to the duties, Ms. Barshefsky said.
American officials said they were forced to seek retaliation after the European Union failed to meet a May 13 deadline set by the trade organization.. Two trade organization panels have ruled that the European Union ban is illegal.
"There is no legitimate reason for the E.U.'s unfair restriction on free trade," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. "The W.T.O. decision recognizes that American beef is safe. Scientific study after study confirms this."
Nonetheless, European officials say they remain concerned about potential health risks from eating the beef.
In a trade dispute about bananas, the United States sought permission to impose $520 million in punitive duties on European products. But after the European Union sought arbitration from the World Trade Organization, the final figure was whittled to $191 million.
Given that experience, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said it supported the Clinton Administration decision to seek only $202 million in retaliation "in order to expedite the W.T.O. review that will now proceed."

HEADLINE: U.S. Industry Back on Its Feet in a Wobbly World

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
When financial crisis swept through Asia, Brazil and Russia last year, American industry prepared to duck. With goods accounting for over 70 percent of exports, manufacturers were sure to take a hit.
And sure enough, they did. Manufacturing exports, as estimated by the National Association of Purchasing Management, fell for 14 consecutive months starting in the fall of 1997. Employment in manufacturing, meanwhile, fell by 400,000 last year and the association's widely publicized measure of manufacturing production indicated steady declines throughout 1998. 
 But the negative arithmetic misses the point, says Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, the industry's largest trade group. "The best estimates show that manufacturing survived the Asia crisis just fine," he said. "In fact, it is thriving."
He backs his assertion with Government statistics different from those compiled by the purchasing managers. His data show that production, which certainly stumbled for a while, has now recovered and is again rising at a brisk pace.
Another sign of manufacturing's revival came yesterday, when the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the strongest gain since August.
Industrial employment is continuing to fall, but that trend actually reflects the sector's enduring strength -- fast-paced innovation that drives up productivity, allowing manufacturers to churn out more automobiles, refrigerators and computers with fewer workers. Some of the productivity gains can be traced to "hard technology" innovations embedded in high-speed data processing systems and computer-driven machinery. But other gains are driven by "soft technology" innovations, which alter the way people, equipment and materials are organized and managed.
According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA, an economic consulting firm based in West Chester, Pa., growth in production peaked in November 1997 when it was advancing by more than 7 percent a year. Once Asian economies collapsed, manufacturing slowed, but never actually fell. Now that exports have stabilized, the vigorous domestic economy is pulling demand for manufactured goods back up. According to Government estimates, production rose more than 4 percent last year, about the same rate of growth as in the economy at large.
"The trade shock merely brought manufacturing down from its giddy pace before Asia collapsed to the pace of other sectors of the economy," Mr. Zandi said.
That raises the question of how manufacturing kept pace with services, which suffered little shock from Asia. Chalk the neat trick up to the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates last year as an insurance policy to keep the American economy upright. Lower interest rates made housing, autos and other goods that Americans buy on credit cheaper.
According to Government estimates, the production of durables -- furniture, industrial machinery, computer equipment, automobiles and the like -- rose over 5 percent from the end of 1997 to the end of 1998. But output of nondurable goods like tobacco products, textiles and apparel fell almost 1 percent during the period.
Economic collapse abroad hit particularly hard at commodities. As Asia bought less oil, steel and other basic goods, their prices fell to punishing levels, forcing cutbacks. That was a boon for consumers, but a blow to American producers.
Yet American industry has proved remarkably resilient. A striking feature of the last several decades is that the share of manufacturing in the overall economy has remained rock steady. "It may appear to the public that we are becoming a nation of hamburger flippers," said Ed McKelvey, an economist with Goldman, Sachs, "but the simple fact is that manufacturers are holding their own."
Yesterday's report by the Federal Reserve on production showed that manufacturing advanced six-tenths of 1 percent during April after rising a revised five-tenths of 1 percent in March. Mining output increased one-tenth of 1 percent; output of utilities rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. Capacity use, meanwhile, remained low, at 80.6 percent, compared with 80.4 percent in March.
Manufacturing accounts for about 20 percent of total production today, and about 20 percent for the last three decades. What has fallen is the share of the nation's labor force working in manufacturing -- from about 35 percent in 1947, to about 18.5 percent in 1988 and about 15 percent today.
The productivity record in manufacturing in recent years has been striking. It has been growing about 4 percent a year since 1995, about twice the rate of productivity growth in the overall economy. In the first quarter of this year, manufacturing productivity advanced at a 5.8 percent rate.
Prof. Paul Swamidass of Auburn University says he thinks he knows why. In a 1997 survey of more than 1,000 factories sponsored by the manufacturers' association and the National Science Foundation, he found that about 85 percent of the companies involved had adopted computer-aided design technologies that permit them to introduce new products more quickly. About 70 percent had adopted computer-run machines. More than 60 percent of the plants had built computer networks linking customers to the plant and linking machinery within the plant. And at least 25 percent of the factories used robots for welding and other repetitive tasks.
One of the newest innovations -- an organizational concept known as cells, which uses small teams of workers to make an entire product rather than passing unfinished product from department to department, each with its own crew of workers -- is spreading fast. The survey showed it had been adopted by more than 50 percent of the companies.
John Heggestad, director of operations at Mine Safety Appliances, a Pittsburgh company that makes safety equipment, including gas masks and other breathing devices, said that "manufacturing cells have allowed us to cut paperwork, transportation and inspections."
Under the new system, a worker inspects aluminum forgings brought onto the factory floor, and, using machines placed nearby, does whatever milling, drilling and threading is needed. Under the old system, the aluminum would have been brought to a receiving area by one worker, logged in by another, inspected by a third, then transported to different areas of the factory floor for milling, drilling, threading and further assembly.
"By moving to manufacturing cells," he said, "we doubled revenues per worker over the past 10 or so years."
Peter Probst, manufacturing engineer at the Falk Corporation in Auburn, Ala., tells a similar story. Falk makes coupling devices that connect motors to equipment. Under its old system, the assembly of a new coupler would start at one end of the factory floor and finish at the other. Now machines are arranged in clusters, sometimes run by a single worker who completes all the steps himself. The process eliminates the need to have unfinished parts sitting around in various stages; Falk has reduced its delivery times from four weeks to one.
Professor Swamidass, in his survey, found that companies raised productivity by about 4 percent a year from 1993 through 1997 and reduced inventories by more than 20 percent. "The record suggests," he said, "that in a tight labor market that chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve fears, the use of hard and soft technologies can boost productivity and take the pressure off of labor costs."

HEADLINE: White House Gives Support To Measure On Spending

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Eager for money to pay for the war in Yugoslavia, the White House today said it expected President Clinton to sign a nearly $15 billion emergency spending measure that doubles what the President had requested for the Balkan conflict, for Central American hurricane victims and for hard-pressed American farmers.
The package was completed by House and Senate negotiators late Thursday night. Republican leaders planned to pass it next week in an effort to bolster their party's credentials on national security after the House's refusal last month to give its political support to the air war in Yugoslavia. 
 The President had sought $6 billion for the air campaign and aid to Balkan refugees and nations bordering Yugoslavia. The Republicans provided $11.8 billion, including money for a general military buildup and to allow for a pay increase for the military.
"Despite our differences over the Administration's Balkan policy, this bill sends a strong message to our troops in the field that the Congress supports them," said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
The spending bill also has $1 billion for relief and reconstruction efforts in Central America, long-stalled in Congress. And the negotiators took care of the needy at home, approving $900 million for tornado victims, mainly in Oklahoma and Kansas, and $566 million for financially troubled farmers.
The Republicans also used the bill to sidestep a looming confrontation over the next census that could have risked a partial Government shutdown. The package lifts a provision enacted last year that would have blocked financing for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments after June 15 because of a dispute over how the census will be conducted.
Emergency spending bills have become magnets in Congress for special-interest provisions because the legislation is usually considered too important to be vetoed. Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert tried to hold the line against such amendments and riders, although some survived.
Across three days of furious bargaining between the House and Senate, several Republican provisions that the Administration had opposed as anti-environmental were dropped or softened as were some offsetting spending cuts the Administration had opposed. The negotiators also killed a Senate provision providing $40 million for the families of victims of last year's accident in Italy in which a low-flying Marine jet cut the cable of an Alpine ski gondola and sent it plunging to the ground.
The last obstacle to the agreement was overcome on Thursday night when Mr. Hastert persuaded several House negotiators to reverse themselves and reject a guaranteed loan program for some steel companies that was sought by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia. The steel assistance and a similar program for oil and gas companies sponsored by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, was separated from the bill to be considered later in the session. Such stand-alone measures are easier to defeat.
The bill still includes language that effectively overturns an Administration decision to deny a permit for a mine in Buckhorn Mountain in Washington. And it has a provision sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, that would block the Administration from using any of the $246 billion the states have won from a legal settlement with the tobacco industry. Mr. Clinton had wanted to use part of that money for health and anti-tobacco programs.
Earlier veto threats disappeared as the President finally won long-stalled aid for Central America, $100 million in aid to Jordan and the money for the Balkan war.
"While the legislation is not perfect, it accomplishes a great deal and represents significant progress," said Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.
Ms. Ricci said the White House was still reviewing the agreement, but "we expect the President will be presented with a bill he can sign."
Mr. Clinton had not wanted to offset the new spending with cuts in other programs. But the Republicans insisted on offsetting $2 billion of the package's cost, by reducing spending for the food stamp program and subsidized housing. The Administration agreed with Republicans that these reductions would not affect the poor, coming from unspent balances that had not been used because of the improved economy.
Most of the new spending was to be paid for by dipping into the Federal surplus, which in the current fiscal year is entirely due to Social Security tax receipts. Republicans have said they are ready to protect Social Security money from being used for other means, but they have argued that the military is a special case.

HEADLINE: Inflation Jumps Enough to Scare Wall Street

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Inflation, driven in part by rising oil and gasoline prices, moved up sharply at the consumer level in April, the Government reported yesterday, leading analysts to say that the remarkable decline in inflation over the last several years may be over.
But at the same time, economists are not predicting that inflation is taking off. It is just that after the meager 1.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index last year, which can be attributed largely to plunging oil prices, inflation is now likely to return to the 2.3 percent pace of 1997. 
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index for April rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, its biggest monthly increase in eight and a half years. The so-called core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since January 1995.
"It is not as bad as it looks," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
Still the indication of an acceleration in prices was enough to send stock and bond prices sharply lower and interest rates higher yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 193.87 points, or 1.75 percent, to 10,913.32. Still, the Dow is up almost 19 percent for the year. Long-term interest rates jumped to 5.92 percent yesterday, their highest in a year.
Stock and bond investors have been worrying about inflationary pressures for several months because the economy, which has grown at more than a 5 percent pace in the last six months, has shown few signs of slowing to a speed that would prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates to curb growth and inflation. Such a move, at least initially, would have a negative effect on both stocks and bonds.
Because of these concerns, the surge in inflation in April will focus even more attention on the meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers on Tuesday. While analysts do not expect the central bank officials to raise interest rates, policy makers could send a signal that a rate increase would be likely if the April numbers turned into a trend.
The April surge in the overall price index followed an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in March and rises of one-tenth of 1 percent in both February and January. Almost half of the April increase came from a record 15 percent jump in gasoline prices. Overall energy prices jumped 6.1 percent after a 1.6 percent rise in March.
Food prices were up one-tenth of 1 percent in contrast to a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in March. The index for fruits and vegetables jumped 1.4 percent after a decline of 2.2 percent in March.
The more worrisome jump of four-tenths of 1 percent in the core index followed increases of one-tenth of 1 percent in each of the first three months of the year. The jump to four-tenths was driven by higher costs for apparel, tobacco and shelter. Apparel prices climbed 1.5 percent, their first increase since August. Tobacco was up 3.6 percent last month after falling 3.5 percent in March.
So far this year, consumer prices over all are rising at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, compared with 1.6 percent for all of 1998. The core rate is climbing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below last year's 2.4 percent.
In a separate report yesterday, the Federal Reserve said that industrial production rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month after an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
One reason economists were relatively calm -- and why the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates Tuesday -- is that the April jump seems to be an isolated event. The other important barometers of inflationary pressure are still in check. The pace of wage increases, despite the low rate of unemployment, has been declining this year. Worker productivity, which rose a surprising 4 percent in the first quarter of the year, is rising. The dollar is still relatively strong, meaning that the prices of imports are in check.
The index of prices at the producer level rose five-tenths of 1 percent in April, but the core rate increased just one-tenth of 1 percent. And American companies still seem to have trouble making any significant price increases stick.
"I don't remember a time when the C.P.I., in one report, told you the trend was changing," said James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. Nonetheless, he said he was considering raising his forecast for consumer prices this year. His current forecast, of a 1.3 percent increase, is based in part on the assumption that the rise in oil prices will retreat significantly; he said if he were revising his forecast now, it would move to around 2 percent.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said that without the tobacco and apparel increases, the core index would have risen just two-tenths of 1 percent, which is what Wall Street was expecting.
He said the apparel increase was attributable to the marking-up of spring clothing by retailers who were forced to cut prices on winter clothes earlier this year because of the mild weather. In addition, the new calculation method for the index appears to have understated price increases earlier in the year and could be overstating them now.
The tobacco price increases, Mr. Shepherdson said, followed months of discounting by producers. "I don't think any of this tells us anything about the underlying inflation environment," he said.
But there still were some worrisome trends. Medicare costs, pushed up by drug costs, rose three-tenths of 1 percent and are up 3.5 percent over the last 12 months. Donald J. Fine, the chief market strategist at Chase Asset Management, said there were also clear upward trends in hotel, education and public transportation costs. In addition, there is no assurance that the recent break in the price run-ups in crude oil and gasoline means that those surges are over.
One of the big questions for both bond and stock investors now is what happens to interest rates. A move above the 6 percent level could become troubling if it undermined stocks by drawing investors to the bond market.
But Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers and a well-known bull, is not worried. "We are not going to jump the tracks," he said. "We are not going to change our asset allocation; this is an outlier," he said, alluding to the April C.P.I. report. His year-end target for the Dow remains at 11,500.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said at a conference for clients that the country was not facing an increase in inflation nor a spike in interest rates.
In trading yesterday, the Dow was pulled down in part by sharp falls in I.B.M., off 6 3/4, to 239 1/4, and J. P. Morgan, down 513/16 , to 14015/16 . Both stocks had jumped sharply Thursday, I.B.M on Internet hopes and J. P. Morgan on takeover rumors. Yesterday they accounted for more than a quarter of the Dow's decline.
The Nasdaq composite index was down 54.14 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,527.86, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was off 29.76 points, or 2.18 percent, to 1,337.80. Both indexes are loaded with the high-valuation technology and large- growth stocks that investors have shunned recently. Instead investors have flocked to the relatively undervalued cyclical stocks, which have rallied as the economy has shown much more strength than expected.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 130/32 , to 9022/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 5.92 percent, from 5.75 percent Thursday. On Thursday, bonds rallied sharply, and the yield dropped, after the report of the restrained increase in producer prices and the announcement that retail sales had risen only one-tenth of 1 percent in both March and April.
Investors had come to depend on the "strong growth but low inflation" story, said Karen Arrese, head of global bonds at Bank Julius Baer. "But when you pose a threat to that story, the market doesn't like it," she said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Chinese Finally Allow Clinton Time for a Telephone Apology

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
A week after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, President Clinton was finally able to express his condolences directly to Chinese leaders today in a telephone call that also touched briefly on Chinese efforts to gain entry to the World Trade Organization.
While most of the half-hour conversation was devoted to Washington's regret about the bombing, which killed three Chinese citizens, Mr. Clinton also took the opportunity to say that Chinese entry into the trade organization would benefit both countries, officials said. 
 Despite the cloud cast by the bombings, and longstanding concerns in Congress about China, the Clinton Administration still hopes that trade talks can resume within the next month and that China, which has continued its trade talks with Europe, can join the world organization this fall.
President Clinton had been trying to call Jiang Zemin, the Chinese President, since NATO bombs mistakenly fell on the embassy last Friday. But China, which opposed the NATO war with Yugoslavia from the beginning, went into a public rage when its embassy was hit and rebuffed Mr. Clinton's overtures -- until Thursday night, when it signaled a willingness to ease the tensions.
The Chinese Ambassador's visit to Mr. Clinton at the White House on Thursday night led to the phone conversation today. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, described the conversation as constructive.
"The President once again expressed his sincere regrets and condolences to President Jiang and the Chinese people concerning the tragic accident of last week," Mr. Lockhart told reporters. "The President expressed his desire that we move beyond this tragic accident in our relationship," he said, adding that both sides needed to "continue working" on winning China access to the trade organization.
Mr. Lockhart said the Chinese leader "took the opportunity to express his views," but he would not characterize Mr. Jiang's side of the conversation or say whether he accepted the President's apology.
The official New China News Agency gave no clues about Mr. Jiang's reaction either, saying only that he had taken note of Mr. Clinton's apology. It focused on the bombing, which it described as an outrageous act that had shocked the world and generated sympathy for China. But it did not vilify the United States, as Mr. Jiang had done the day before, and did not demand an end to NATO bombing, as it has done before.
Rather, the news agency said Mr. Jiang repeated China's view that there was a "pressing need" for the United States to conduct an investigation into the incident and to make the results public. China had previously demanded that those responsible for the error be punished, but that demand was not included today.
News of the call was quickly disseminated by the news agency and featured on China Central Television, suggesting that the Government is eager to portray the United States as having bowed to its demands. It waited two days to publicize Mr. Clinton's first apology.
Despite the severe strains between the two countries, officials in Washington and Beijing were exploring when and where trade talks between the United States and China might resume. American officials said it would be up to China to determine when a decent interval had elapsed and put the trade talks back on track.
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said today, "We don't have any specific plans to meet with the Chinese next week." She said that she thought China wanted to "remain engaged" on the trade group issue but that "we will have to work out the specific time frame."
Robert Cassidy, a trade negotiator for China, had planned a trip there next week. Now, officials said, that meeting has been postponed at least another week. Officials said they are seeking a neutral site like Geneva, where the agency is based.
Even as the two leaders engaged in their delicate dance toward easing tensions, the governor of China's central bank indicated that his country was willing to advance the trade talks. He said today that the United States should stop demanding any more concessions from China on joining the trade organization.
Gene Sperling, the President's economic adviser, said the bombing had not changed the requirements China has to meet to join the group, which would lower Chinese trade barriers and make the country conform with global trade rules. "China's joining the W.T.O. on solid commercial terms is strongly in both countries' interest," he said, "not that there's been some alteration in leverage."
Some in Congress also indicated their eagerness. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and about two dozen other Senators from both parties sent the President a letter vowing to support permanent most-favored-nation trading status for China. This would eliminate China's need to seek annual approval for its access to American markets -- and would eliminate Congress's use of the trade vote as a chance to criticize China's rights record. Congress has become even leerier since allegations surfaced that Beijing stole American nuclear secrets.

HEADLINE: Wheels Bolognese;
Ducati, Italy's Top Motorcycle Maker, Seeks Niche in the U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: BOLOGNA, Italy

 BODY:
Federico Minoli is not sure if he is selling a luxury accessory, a style of life or a means of transportation.
It is probably a bit of all three, for Mr. Minoli is the new president and chief executive of Ducati S.p.A., the renowned Italian motorcycle maker. And while sales of Ducati's two-wheelers are booming in Europe, where clogged cities welcome anything with fewer than four wheels, Ducati and the builders of other Italian motorcycle classics are casting their net farther afield. 
 Lifting a chapter from the textbook of Italian luxury icons like Gucci and Bulgari and melding it with the profitable formula Harley-Davidson used to create an image out of a pair of wheels, these companies are looking to global markets, notably the United States.
"It's a business opportunity," said Mr. Minoli, who favors jeans and sweaters over ties and suits, "twinned with passion and image."
The Italian drive lifts the spirits of executives in the industry, which boasts a long tradition of making spirited two-wheelers, but whose lack of marketing skill and financial savvy has nearly caused some venerable brands to disappear.
The potential for profit in tapping other markets has not escaped American investors. Last year, the Trident Rowan Group in New York bought out Moto Guzzi S.p.A., another motorcycle maker, and took it public this March. Earlier, Texas Pacific Group, based in Fort Worth, acquired Ducati, which it subsequently took public on the New York Stock Exchange
 Ducati's American depository receipts have been flat since they began trading between $31 and $32 nearly two months ago. On Friday, the A.D.R.'s, each representing 10 common shares, closed at $29.75.
And stock market analysts remain wary. "It's a tough market to get into," said Robert Mescal, who follows initial public offerings at the Institute for Econometric Research in Deerfield Park, Fla. "You're looking at big bucks to get started, and the Japanese and the Americans are not going to give up easily."
Admittedly, Italy has just a sliver of the American market, and little hope of taking any significant share from Japanese giants like Honda and Yamaha, which have parlayed a mix of low-cost manufacturing and high-technology innovation into market dominance. But motorcycle sales are booming again, as baby boomers who flirted with the open road in the 1960's now have the income and the time to don helmets.
So Italian companies like Ducati, whose $263 million of revenues make it the nation's leader, as well as Moto Guzzi, Cagiva and Aprilia, are faring better in Europe and hope to carve off a little of the upper end of the market in the United States. With a wave of sexy new models, they are seeking to exploit the cachet of all things Italian, promoting their bikes as two-wheel Ferraris or the highway equivalent of a Gucci loafer or Versace scarf. Ducati, copying Harley, is opening motorcycle shops, with apparel sections and espresso bars, in the United States.
The Italian crusade got a lift last year when the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York included 21 Italian motorcycles, from a 1924 Guzzi to several 1990's Ducatis, in its wildly successful motorcycle show. "The Italians bring design excellence to everything they do," said Ultan Guilfoyle, deputy curator of the Guggenheim exhibit. "And that is very apparent in their motorcycles."
Yet Ducati, he added, provides a textbook case of how brilliant Italian design is often undercut by poor management.
In 1996, Texas Pacific took control of Ducati from Claudio and Gianfranco Castiglioni, brothers who amassed a fortune selling zippers, then sank it into their real passion -- motorcycles. The Castiglionis acquired Ducati, then nearly bankrupt, in 1983 from the Italian Government, which had bought it in the 1950's from the founding Ducati family.
Despite Ducati's reputation for design and technical innovation, the Castiglionis left the company without a sales organization or strategy and bled it financially by siphoning profits to other projects. "We saw a great brand and a great product, a great factory, but no business around it," said Abel Halpern, a London-based financier who scouts European investment opportunities for Texas Pacific. "The hard part had already been done. The easy part was to design a business system around it."
To do so, Ducati bought business talent. Mr. Minoli, 49, a former Procter & Gamble and Playtex executive with long marketing experience on both sides of the Atlantic, was hired from Bain & Company, the consultants who worked with Texas Pacific before the Ducati purchase. To create a marketing campaign, Ducati hired Kristin Schelter, a former Hill & Knowlton executive who had worked on the Bulgari account.
David M. Gross, a former journalist and Harvard-educated lawyer who is Ducati's director of strategic planning, said the advertising budget, at about $5 million, was meager. But by piggybacking onto big spenders, Ducati makes the ad dollars go further. Neiman Marcus has included Ducatis in its men's catalogue, and Donna Karan New York is outfitting the Ducati racing team. "Now people are coming to us," Mr. Gross said. Ducati's New York flagship store, at 11th Avenue and 43d Street, cost about $250,000, also a shoestring operation.
The efforts are beginning to pay off, at least modestly. In the first quarter, Ducati increased sales 13 percent, to $74 million; motorcycle shipments to the United States rose 26 percent, to 1,541.
If imitation is the purest form of flattery, Ducati is not lacking in compliments. The new owners are also reinventing Moto Guzzi, hiring this year as chief executive Mario Scandellari, a former Ducati manager, and bringing in a nine-year Yamaha veteran, Nicola Poggio, as chief of sales. In the United States, another Yamaha manager, John Porter, was lured away to spearhead Guzzi's drive there.
To revive the American market, this year Guzzi will begin a fast, aggressive model called the Jackal, to sell for about $7,900. Last year, Guzzi sold 651 bikes in the United States, up from 401 in 1997.
"The Italians are good at interpreting life styles," Mr. Poggio said. "If I have to eat, I try to eat well; if I have to wear a watch, I try to wear a beautiful watch."
Others are following suit. Aprilia S.p.A. recently rolled out a new flagship for the United States, the RSV Mille. "The people who rode bikes in the 60's and 70's are now earning higher salaries," said Mark Wilhelm, a former Ingersoll-Rand executive who is Aprilia's marketing manager for the United States. "The kids are gone; they have more time and disposable income."
Italjet S.p.A., which produced motorcycling classics in the 1970's before bailing out to focus on scooters, is re-entering the fray with an aggressive new bike that will be tested in racing before full production begins in 2001.
"We're returning to our past," said Leopoldo Tartarini, Italjet's president and a leading Italian motorcycle designer. "The European motorcycle is still made with heart; it's still endowed with human qualities." In a swipe at the Japanese, he added, "When something is too perfect, you tire of it."
If Harley-Davidson, with its lumbering cruisers, is the Cadillac of motorcycles, and Honda and Yamaha are, well, the Honda and Toyota, the Italians want to become the Ferraris and Porsches.
Glenn Brieton buys that. "People who own them, love them," said Mr. Brieton, an audiovisual systems specialist from Lake George, N.Y., who owns two Guzzis. He became hooked on Italian motorcycles, he explained, while serving in the American Army in Italy, and bought his first Guzzi secondhand in 1989 for less than $2,000. Five years later, he picked up a second. "One of the appealing factors for a guy like me," he said, "is that they go up in value." A 1970's Guzzi in mint condition can fetch $20,000 or more. But, he added, "mainly, it's the way to go to be a little bit different."
Greg L. Salchow, who follows the motorcycle industry at Roney Capital Markets in Detroit, said enthusiasts like Mr. Brieton gave the Italians an entree. "There's always going to be a certain group of people who want the real thing," he said. Ducati and Guzzi, he added, enjoy relatively strong name recognition, while lesser-known companies like Aprilia and Italjet would have to struggle harder. "You'd have to be a very dedicated enthusiast to even know them," he said.
The long-term challenge for the Italians, said Mr. Guilfoyle of the Guggenheim, will be to attract young riders and keep the affluent market rolling when the baby boomers step off their bikes. The same challenge, of course, faces Harley-Davidson, he said, whose "buyers are old, an average 40 years old."
Moto Guzzi says its Jackal is aimed mainly at young riders. "The Jackal project leader is 31 years old," said Mr. Poggio, who is 38. "Our bet is to satisfy the hard core of Guzzi buyers, and draw new customers. The Jackal is definitely aimed at the young."
Ducati is investing $15 million to $20 million a year, about 70 percent of it in product development, Mr. Minoli said. Emulating fashion houses, Ducati is trying to build a cult around its chief designer, Pierre Terblanche, a former Volkswagen designer who learned motorcycle design from Massimo Tamburini, creator of some of Ducati's greatest models, including the 916 Superbike.
But to realize their American ambitions, said Mr. Salchow, the analyst, the near-term challenge will be less spectacular -- distribution. "They are not even in a lot of markets, except for small specialty shops," he said. "They need more models, more apparel."
Ducati's long-term goal is to have 200 exclusive stores globally. And the company is investing heavily to speed production.
"The first thing is to crank out as many as you can," Mr. Minoli said. "I don't believe in scarcity" as a marketing device to maintain Ducati's exclusive image. From 20 motorcycles a day in 1996, when Texas Pacific bought in, production at Ducati has risen to 170, creating 350 new jobs, which were so hard to fill in the full-employment area around Bologna that Ducati had to retrain women textile workers from a local lingerie manufacturer.
In the United States, Mr. Minoli said, Ducati has two constituencies: "people really serious about motorcycling, whose interest trickles down from racing, and the people who want a little of everything," adding, "They will have their Porsche -- and their Ducati."

HEADLINE: Board Proposes Rent Increases For Apartments

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
A proposal by the city's Rent Guidelines Board to increase rents in stabilized buildings by 2 percent to 4 percent came as no surprise to city officials, landlords or tenants Thursday night. But it has nevertheless drawn criticism: landlords say the increase is too low to cover expenses and some tenant advocates call it unfair, especially for the elderly and others with limited incomes.
The board proposed the increases -- 2 percent on one-year leases and 4 percent on two-year leases -- for the one million or so apartments in buildings operating under rent stabilization, which ties increases to overall economic indicators. 
 Increases are proposed after studies are conducted by the Rent Guidelines Board. Current mortgage rates are the lowest in nearly 20 years, and the city's economic growth is at its highest level in 10 years, according to the most recent study.
The meeting Thursday was much quieter than several in the past, when larger hikes were proposed, said Joseph J. Lhota, the Deputy Mayor for Operations. He said the proposed increases were "reasonable -- less than city and national inflation."
Christopher Athineos, whose family's business, Athineos Enterprises, owns seven residential buildings, said that even though the meeting was quiet, landlords were "not thrilled." The proposed increases would not cover maintenance costs, he said.
But Paul Podhaizer, chairman of the tenants' councils for two Coney Island buildings with a total of 1,836 apartments, said the prospect of higher rents has upset many elderly renters. Forty-seven tenants from the two buildings attended the meeting at Cooper Union, he said, making up about half the audience.
"Two and four percent may seem like pennies," he said. "But add it up, and it makes a difference in how people eat and how they live."
Erma Rabinowitz, 80, said she pays $575 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the Coney Island buildings. Thirty-five years ago, when she and her husband moved in, the rent was $154, she said. "I live on Social Security," she said. "Most of my income goes for rent."
Mr. Athineos, Mr. Podhaizer and Mrs. Rabinowitz said they planned to attend the public hearing on the rent increases, scheduled on June 22, at 11 A.M., in the Great Hall at Cooper Union.

U.S. Threatens to Impose Punitive Duties in Beef War
The United States escalated a trade war with the European Union by threatening to impose $202 million in punitive duties on the trading bloc for banning imports of American beef from hormone-treated cattle. 
 Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said Washington remained open to talks to resolve the decade-old dispute, but added, "We will absolutely protect our rights and we will without question retaliate if the E.U. persists in disregarding the rules." Page C2.

U.S. Fines Sears on Child Labor
The Department of Labor announced a $325,000 fine against Sears, Roebuck & Company after investigators uncovered 227 teen-agers working in violation of child labor laws at 44 of the 71 Sears stores they visited in 23 states. The most common violation found was that 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds were operating power-driven equipment like paper balers, freight elevators and fork lifts. Federal law bars children from running such hazardous equipment. A10.

HEADLINE: Commuter Tax Helps City Compete

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Is it really in the self-interest of commuters to repeal the New York City commuter tax, as state legislators are planning (front page, May 14)? Without the $360 million a year the tax represents, the city would have to choose between reducing services and raising taxes on city businesses or residents. Either action would weaken the city's ability to compete with other cities, putting commuter jobs and incomes at risk.

HEADLINE: Project to Rescue Needy Stumbles Against the Persistence of Poverty

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE, May 14

 BODY:
Imagine what would happen if society could guarantee every poor person a path from poverty: an assured job at a sufficient wage, with child care and health care as well. How many would take it? How many would prosper?
A decade ago, an unconventional band of reformers here set out to find the answer, and their discoveries offer an unsettling new look at the prospects of low-income families at a time of a national exodus from welfare. 
 The Milwaukee experiment with guaranteed jobs, called Project New Hope, came to its scheduled close this week. But it leaves behind the most comprehensive study of poor families of the post-welfare age, with data on everything from parents' earnings to the number of hours their children watch television.
The program is widely being called a success, and it did have a modest impact in some statistical terms. But a close look at the findings, assembled by an independent team of economists, psychologists and ethnographers, suggests inner-city poverty may be even harder to alleviate than is understood.
New Hope recruited 677 low-income adults and made them a simple offer: sign up here, work 30 hours a week and your family will no longer be poor.
But only 27 percent of the main target group managed to stick with their jobs long enough to work their way out of poverty. The target group's average annual earnings were just $6,602, statistically no better than a control group of poor people not in the program.
And despite the conventional theory that going to work makes low-income adults feel better about themselves, New Hope clients showed no declines in depression and no growth in self-esteem, when compared with a control group.
Indeed, even after two years in the program, the average participant still registered levels of depression above the threshold that most psychologists consider cause for clinical referrals.
The problems that kept people from maintaining steady employment comprise a catalog of inner-city ills: drug and alcohol abuse; jealous or violent boyfriends and husbands; conflicts with employers; unreliable baby sitters and cars, and generally flagging spirits. In addition, some participants said they preferred to work less and spend more time with their families, even if it meant staying poor.
New Hope's admirers acknowledge the persistence of low earnings and high poverty rates. But they say the program still shows ways to help low-income families work somewhat more and suffer somewhat less. New Hope's generous subsidies produced demonstrable, if modest, gains in access to health insurance and formal child-care settings. The guaranteed jobs reduced the number of people who never worked at all. And by complementing paychecks with wage supplements, New Hope raised total "earnings-related income" by 16 percent, to about $8,100 a year.
In a surprise finding, the program also appeared to improve the classroom performance and educational aspirations of its participants' children, though only among boys. In describing that effect, evaluators said its statistical magnitude was roughly equal to adding 100 points to a score on the S.A.T. By the standards of social experiments, that is an unusually large improvement, and it has already caused a buzz among academics who study poor children.
Still, for inner-city adults, the main target of the nation's strict new welfare laws, the economic news remains sobering. Even with a guaranteed job at a subsidized wage, 73 percent of the main target group failed to work their way out of poverty without additional support from welfare or a second earner.
"People had the opportunity to work full time and yet they didn't do it," said Michael Wiseman, an economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington research group, who served on New Hope's advisory board. "We've discovered something new that I think is distressing."
The results challenge conventional wisdoms at both ends of the political spectrum. They suggest that poor people may have less success in replacing welfare with work than some conservatives have predicted. But they also suggest that the reasons many people fail to work stretch far beyond the economic barriers -- low wages and scarce jobs -- that many liberals have cited.
Mr. Wiseman said the results particularly "call into question the shortage of jobs as the explanation for poverty," since participants chose to stop working or failed to work full time even when subsidized jobs were assured.
 
Behind Modest Results, A River of Optimism
 New Hope was not technically a welfare-to-work program since it included people not on welfare. Indeed, if anything, it offers an optimistic look at the prospects of those now leaving the rolls because the project operated under favorable conditions: It had the benefit of Milwaukee's unusually strong economy; it worked with volunteer clients who had more motivation and work experience than the average welfare recipient, and it offered them unusually generous benefits.
Yet even counting informal work, like baby-sitting or hair-dressing, the average participant reported working just 27 hours a week, or about 10 percent more than members of a control group. In a world where anti-poverty programs often produce no gains at all -- or even bring negative consequences -- these modest results are being treated, curiously, as resounding good news.
Linda Stewart, who runs the welfare program for the Republican Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, said it "validates our belief that a work-based social contract" will "help reduce poverty in the years ahead." Olivia A. Golden, who oversees welfare programs for President Clinton, said New Hope had brought "very impressive results in helping families stay in jobs and improve the well-being of children."
New Hope grew from conversations in the early 1980's between David Riemer, a zealous advocate of public jobs, and his friends John Gardner and Julie Kerksick, husband-and-wife union organizers then working with the United Farm Workers. For all three, liberal advocacy took quirky turns. Mr. Gardner won an election to the Milwaukee school board and became a prominent supporter of public-school vouchers. Mr. Riemer and Ms. Kerksick became early critics of the welfare system and advocates for public jobs.
Enlisting everyone from Mayor John O. Norquist, now Mr. Reimer's boss, to the head of the gas company, they raised $17 million from corporate and government sources. Conservatives liked New Hope because of its anti-welfare ethos: participants had to work to keep their benefits. Liberals liked it because it guaranteed jobs and subsidized wages.
New Hope created community service positions, like clerical jobs with nonprofit groups, for people who could not find private work. Those posts only paid the minimum wage. But for anyone working 30 hours a week, either in the private or the community service jobs, New Hope added a cash supplement to lift them above the Government poverty threshold. For a family of three, that threshold is now $12,802.
After years of fund-raising, the program began enrolling clients in August 1994. Participants could keep their benefits for up to three years. To evaluate the results, New Hope hired the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a private group based in New York City.
 
'Culture of Defeat' May Be Biggest Barrier
Ms. Kerksick, the program's director, said the program's full impact could not be gleaned merely by looking at averages. As she expected, some people were too troubled to respond at all, she said. But for others, the menu of supports -- jobs, wage supplements, child care and health care -- made a marked difference.
"You can look at this and say, 'Oh my God, look at all those people in poverty,' " she said. "Or we can look at this and say, 'Can you see any difference?' And you can see a difference."
The research examined the program's findings on two groups of participants.
The largest, comprising two-thirds of the clients, consisted of those working part time or not at all when the program began. This group most closely resembles those now leaving the welfare rolls.
A guaranteed job did help them work more. Only 6 percent did not work at all despite signing up for the program. By contrast, 13 percent of a control group did not work at all. Likewise, while only 27 percent of these New Hope participants worked their way out of poverty, that was still better than the control group, where only 19 percent did so.
Ms. Kerksick emphasized that these official estimates understated participants' real-world income, omitting self-employment (like baby-sitting) and the earnings of others living in the same household. And, she said, increased earnings were only one goal. New Hope also reduced the amount of stress participants reported and increased their access to health insurance and child care. "We were able to help people in other ways that made their lives better," she said.
Nonetheless, the modesty of the results highlights the many underlying problems. "This shows it can take people years to become steady workers, even when they are given a generous package of jobs and subsidies," said Toby Herr, director of Project Match, a Chicago employment program.
Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University, said he was particularly struck by the high levels of depression participants brought with them into the program. That supports the notion that inner-city poverty is "rooted in a underlying culture of defeat," he said, rather than in the lack of jobs.
New Hope also enrolled a second group: those already employed full-time when they joined. For them, New Hope actually produced a decline in total income of about 8 percent, to about $14,100. Ms. Kerksick argued that this, too, may have been positive, since many entered the program frazzled by 50-hour work-weeks and second jobs.
But others worried the program may have slowed these workers' progress. After two years, for instance, their average hourly wage of $7.28 was about 6 percent lower than that of a control group. "It conflicts with our hopes for advancement," Ms. Herr said.
 
Surprising Side Effect Turns Up in Boys
Ms. Herr and many others, however, were impressed with New Hope's apparent effect on participants' boys. "That's the big finding," she said.
When surveyed by psychologists, teachers ranked the New Hope boys as significantly better behaved and more academically skilled than boys in a control group. And when surveyed themselves, the New Hope boys were much more likely than those in a control group to say they expected to attend college.
Researchers are unsure why this occurred. One theory is that the boys may have benefited from better child-care arrangements. With New Hope's subsidies, the percentage of boys in formal child care, like Head Start or after-school programs, was 60 percent, compared with 52 percent in the control group.
"With more supervision, they may have had less opportunity to develop problem behaviors," said Aletha Huston, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who helped evaluate the program.
Ms. Herr credited the program's caseworkers for helping place children in structured after-school settings, like scouts and boys clubs. "This shows the importance of getting kids into constructive, extra-curricular activities, even as parents move in and out of work," she said.
The girls in New Hope families also spent more time in formal child care, but they registered no classroom or behavioral improvements, partly because they were already doing better than their male counterparts. The program essentially raised the performance of inner-city boys to the level of inner-city girls.
What remains unknown is whether the boys, who ranged from ages six to 12, will continue their progress as they hit adolescence.
"It's certainly not an unqualified, 'Oh wow, we've solved all the problems,' " Ms. Huston said. "But these are striking findings for the children."

HEADLINE: Younger Than Ever -- And Freer.

BYLINE: By Sara Ivry

 BODY:
On the border between youth and middle age, 35 stands like a sentinel. Growing older can no longer be denied: drugstores offer antiwrinkle potions, radio stations pitch mellow music and the American Breast Cancer Foundation recommends the first mammogram. Even so, 35 today is younger than ever. A thousand years ago, a 35-year-old woman would be just shy of menopause and only 20 or so years from death. Now, 35 is not even halfway there; years of fertility remain, and the highest-earning period probably lies ahead. 
 These, of course, are generalizations. The women here, all 35 in '99, show the specifics. They represent the top job categories tracked by the Census Bureau; the highest concentrations are still in full-time mothering and secretarial work, but managers also make the top 10. These women, from different parts of the country and different social, economic and ethnic backgrounds, reflect a range of choices and circumstances for American women on the verge of the 21st century.

When you're at home you need to have outlets other than your children. Women in my situation, in a real rural area, you can get pretty well set in your ways, afraid to go anywhere. I don't want to get that way. I want to hop in my vehicle and drive the busy highway like everybody else."; Jodi Peikoff, lawyer Los Angeles, single, no children: "I love what I do and want to continue but with more moderation. You get to a point where you think, Have I put in enough hours? Now I can go read the books I want and have a child and do all the things that intellectually I remember are precious. My best friend got AIDS. It really put life into perspective; he's a constant reminder and reality check on what's really important and how long I want to have ridiculous hours, and how much success I need."; Earline Riggins, waitress Salt Lake City, separated, two children, one grandchild, another on the way: "I didn't have very many choices; I stayed home with my kids when they were little. I always wished to have the house with the white picket fence and just raise my children. One of the only regrets I have in life is that I didn't finish school. School and me, we just didn't get along very well."; Leah Willhite, casino worker Winnemucca, Nev., married, two children: "I got married when I was 18. I was infatuated with the word 'love.' I didn't have to work for a while because economically I didn't need to. But working you get more self-esteem. In my family, the men worked, the women stayed home. Even until this day my mother goes, 'Now don't work too hard, you shouldn't really be working, you should be with the kids."'; Victoria Sambunaris, artist New Haven, single, no children: "I remember thinking when I was a kid about how old I would be in the year 2000, and thinking, O.K., I'm going to be 35 and what kind of person would I be. I thought I would be settled down, married, maybe with a job. I envisioned something completely different from where I'm at, but I feel like I had to go through everything I went through to get where I am now."; Sue Hillard, F.B.I. agent Conroe, Tex., single, no children: "I look at other people who are balancing marriages and careers and children and their religious life and I haven't quite accomplished that balancing yet. I love what I'm doing but there's more to life than just that. When you're dealing with families that lost loved ones, or you're recovering a little baby that someone has killed and buried -- that's the stuff that's the real challenge for me."; Michell Fredericks, teacher Tucson, Ariz., divorced, no children: "There are still such societal pressures on what is meant for women to do and be, and perhaps a lot of women aren't true to themselves. I've not been open in my personal life due to professional reasons. I've been with my same-sex partner now for 10 years. I'm not in the mainstream at all. My own sexuality has been something that professionally I have hidden. That has been a challenge for me, but it's not going away."; Katharina Pellegrin, surgical resident Los Angeles, single, no children: "I'm not so sure about getting married, because I see that men are really still having a hard time interacting with a woman that's successful. A lot of the guys who are at my same level, they have three or four kids, but they have a wife to stay at home. A woman's partner is not going to stay home, so you have a double responsibility. If you're the first woman in a department and you make a mistake, people are more likely to say all women doctors are bad or don't have good hands."

HEADLINE: A Social Glacier Roars

BYLINE: By Gail Collins; Gail Collins, a member of The New York Times editorial board, is the author, with Dan Collins, of The Millennium Book" (Doubleday, 1991).

 BODY:
A century ago, people who looked ahead to 2000 had an exaggerated faith in the promise of pneumatic tubes. For some reason, when people then thought long-term, they saw everything from business correspondence to ready-cooked meals whizzing across town through underground pipes. Nobody imagined computers. Funny, the things we can't anticipate. When I was researching a book on the millennium a few years ago, I was struck by how people's predictions about the future say much more about the predictors' own era than about what will happen next.
Our ancestors were prescient about the invention of the radio, but never conceived of nuclear warfare -- French cigarette cards in 1899 depicted 21st-century aviators in open planes, dropping little bomblets on the enemies. A writer for an early edition of Ladies Home Journal -- the magazine that made its mark by exposing the evils of the patent medicine trade -- looked forward to our current era and decided that we would all be fit, very fit: "A man or woman unable to walk 10 miles at a stretch will be regarded as a weakling." (L.H.J. also forecast that the English-speaking world would kwit using ekstraneous letters like C, Q and X.) H. G. Wells, who had a particular horror of the clunky 19th-century kitchen, predicted the coal-burning stove would be replaced by a "neat little range heated by electricity" that would make cooking "a pleasant amusement for intelligent invalid ladies." We're still waiting for his self-cleaning windows. 
 Until just a few years ago, women who dreamed of an independent and fulfilling future generally started thinking they had to separate themselves from men. The utopians drew pictures of all-female communes or Amazonian civilizations, and those hoping for a real-life career in which they could control their own destinies generally applied to a convent. It was only recently -- speaking in millennial terms -- that average women saw the possibility of achieving equality in the same world as the opposite sex.
Virginia Woolf thought that having a room of one's own and an income of 500 pounds a year would do the trick. The flapper generation, born at the turn of the last century, was the first to enjoy the outer forms of sexual liberation, like social drinking and one-piece bathing suits. But even flappers knew that they had little of substance, and that their well-being still hinged on picking the right husband. "Oh, why am I a girl?" wails one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's smart, semihysterical heroines, who complains of being born a hundred years too early, "with the brains to do everything, yet tied to the sinking ship of future matrimony."
Women had no faith in their own ability to support themselves, but they had confidence that their great-granddaughters would no longer have to toss down one last cocktail, straighten their shoulders and marry the wrong man because he was the one with the money. Women who had been freed to cut their hair, discard their corsets and cuddle in the rumble seat with the football hero would eventually get the vote, get careers and get more efficient birth control, and before you knew it, the sinking ship of future matrimony would be totally optional.
History seldom evolves by tidy progression toward happy endings -- the Muslims who welcomed Jews and Christians to tolerant little kingdoms like Granada a thousand years ago got driven out by the folks who gave us the Spanish Inquisition. But in 20th-century industrialized nations, women really have kept marching forward. In America, the proportion of women in the work force has been steadily increasing since those flappers were in diapers, while the number of children they bear has been dropping.
Women are now a majority of the electorate. They receive 55 percent of the nation's college degrees and are much more willing to reinvent themselves as adults by returning to school. They live longer, and because they survive their husbands they wind up controlling a large share of the nation's personal wealth. They own more than a third of the businesses, employ a quarter of the workers and make up nearly half the students in medical and law schools. Among two-income families, nearly a quarter of the wives now earn more than their husbands.
That's a very narrow snapshot -- this is still the same planet on which many women can be killed by their male relatives for refusing to marry the man of the family's choice, or on the mere suspicion of promiscuity. The status of women has actually declined in parts of eastern Europe since the collapse of Communism. But you still might say -- with dozens of qualifications and a nervous glance over your shoulder -- that women have won. If they haven't achieved gender equality, then at least they've created the tools to get it in much of the developed world. We mate by preference, not out of necessity. We can get all the education we desire. If we do not all achieve the careers we want, at least our chances are not dictated by Y-chromosomes.
A romantic modern young man who builds castles in the air generally presumes that his future wife will help pay the mortgage. Men who may be chauvinists on the job and patriarchs in the living room will nevertheless kill to make sure their little girls get all the opportunities the little boys get. Given daughters' tendency to stick closer to their parents than sons do, there is no better hedge against old age than a female child with a good income.
But it still seems doubtful that women will soon reach full equality. At the present rate, it will be 2270 before women are as likely as men to become top managers in corporations and 2500 before there is gender parity in Congress. So far, no culture has constructed a truly level playing field for sharing family responsibilities and job opportunity. "Women in Sweden have lots of day care, but when you look at where most of their jobs are, they work in the public sector," says Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. "You can't make partner in a Stockholm law firm working six hours a day. Mothers get more support caring for children, but it doesn't remove inequities in the labor force."
We presume that all these things will change as women use their present and potential power to remake the world. Analyses of how women will vote and set social policy, in fact, generally seem to presume that our instincts and priorities are just, well, better. Women are less enamored of the use of force, leery of quick fixes and more willing to pay more taxes for social concerns like feeding the poor.
If women continue to gain economic and political power, the government of the 21st century will probably spend more on nursing homes and home attendants for senior citizens, and on better schools. There might not necessarily be more access to abortion services but there would be stronger gun controls. Their attitudes also reflect an emotional conservatism, a fear of sudden moves or drastic action. If women get to run the show, Americans had better hope they're running it in other countries too, because our economy will probably be more regulated and less able to compete against a testosterone-fueled capitalism elsewhere.
Our attempts to hedge against disaster and provide more services might also create a larger bureaucracy. "It would have a strong safety net," says Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. "It's hard to know how bureaucratic it would become. Women do tend to perhaps value security and stability more. If men spent as much time being caretakers as women, their attitude toward risk might be different, too." When most women lived on family farms, Hartmann noted, they ran the truck gardens that produced a modest but steady income from vegetable sales, while men focused on the large, high-risk crops. "Women's economic strategy was always, Well, let's make sure we have a little bit to count on here."
But all these projections say more about us now than in the future. Right now we know we want children and careers, but we don't want to be deprived of job advancement because of one or be forced to scrimp on our attention to the other. We want our husbands to take equal responsibility as parents, but are often reluctant to drop our role as the primary caregivers. James Levine of the Families and Work Institute in New York says he believes that while women often want men to do more of the parenting, "they want them to do it the 'right way,' and if Dad doesn't do it, Mom takes it back and the cycle continues.o
Levine, the author of "Working Fathers: New Strategies for Balancing Work and Family," has been running workshops on this issue for 25 years, and whether he's in Omaha talking to the agricultural extension or in midtown working with corporate executives, he hears the same complaints. One classic involves getting kids ready for school. "Dad is dressing them and the preschooler comes down with purple pants and an orange top. Mom says, 'She can't wear that,' which is saying: 'You don't know how to dress the kid. I have to do everything myself.' " Working-class parents are showing their wealthier peers a way out of this particular battle: if Dad is the only adult in the house when the kids are dressing for school, purple and orange rules. Nearly half of fathers who have municipal jobs like fireman, or service jobs like gas-station attendant, care for the children while their wives are at work. "All I do is watch the kids and work," says a Wisconsin correctional officer who chose a night shift so he could be home while his wife worked days.
That is, of course, what women have been saying for decades, and the ideal answer would be an economy that allows both sexes to advance on the job without requiring so many hours at work. In that early era we now refer to as "the 60's," many young women believed that's what the developed world would look like by the year 2000. Technology would improve productivity, creating a society in which job-sharing or 20-hour workweeks were the norm. Even single mothers would be able to pursue careers and still get home in time to pick up the kids after school. Needless to say, that leisure society wound up in the same category as the self-cleaning windows.
Instead, we got a global economy that pits the American factory worker with a 12-year-old alone at home against a third-world sweatshop in which the 12-year-olds are the workers. Unless the underlying economy changes strikingly, our future will probably involve opportunities that are limited only by our ability to come up with jerry-built solutions to the competing demands on our time.
The most significant development on the immediate horizon is the graying of the industrialized world. People 65 and over accounted for 4 percent of the U.S. population in 1900, but in 2015, some say, they could be at least 20 percent, and two-thirds will be women. If Social Security gets propped up and the political power of seniors continues to increase, those older women will consume a large portion of the national budget -- and control a hefty portion of the assets.
Our great-great-grandmothers waited a lifetime for the social glacier to creak forward an inch. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a turn-of-the-century American utopian, spent her life agitating for the liberation of women from the chains of household duties, for a world where child care and housework would be done by well-paid, well-trained specialists who preferred that kind of career and where every family would enjoy "the professional service of cooked meals to the home." When she started writing her autobiography in the 1920's, Gilman admitted that she'd seen only the tiniest of changes after 37 years of effort: Reason has no power against feeling, and feeling older than history is no light matter,o she said philosophically. It would have been nice if she could have at least lived to order takeout pizza.
These days, you wake up one morning and a social phenomenon that you thought immutable will have vanished. I must have written at least a dozen essays decrying the fact that the entertainment industry targets boys when it creates movies and TV because everybody knows that girls will watch male heroes but boys usually won't watch girls.
It was just the other day, really, that I noticed that teen-age girls now seem to have their own TV network, WB, while teen-age boys get professional wrestling and Ninja Turtle reruns. One of the most famous WB series is "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," in which a teen-age girl rescues humanity from extinction every week. Last year she had to kill her vampire-boyfriend, and though he has been resurrected, she keeps noting that it could happen again at any time. Buffy really rides alone, just like the male heroes in the TV westerns that dominated my own childhood. The most popular was "Bonanza," the story of Ben Cartwright, a rancher and three-time widower, and his three adult sons. The Ponderosa took out wives faster than a toxic-waste dump, and even the least sophisticated viewer eventually got the message that you could not have an interesting time on the frontier if you were saddled with a woman.
At some point while I wasn't looking, the idea that girls didn't have adventures seems to have faded out of our popular culture, just like the idea that only boys get to play rock music. The most successful movie of the last decade is "Titanic," in which a young woman falls in love with a charming artist, who dies after making a long speech urging her to seize the day. She lives for about 80 years of thrills and romance before being reunited with him after death.You do have the feeling that if he hadn't drowned, he would have got in the way. I always hoped that some day women would become co-heroes with men in entertainment programming. But instead, the sexes may just be switching responsibility for suffering an untimely death in the second act. Things progress, but never exactly the way you'd expect.

How much have women changed over the last 10 centuries? Anthropology offers informed estimates of the physique of French peasants of the year 1000 and cultural history tells much about what they wore. To find a modern-day equivalent, the magazine sent scouts to comb the countrysides of France, Louisiana and Quebec. In Burgundy they found Martine Jouttier, a 40-year-old medical technician and horse breeder.
 
A French peasant woman dressed in layers, for both warmth and varying degrees of formality. Her only undergarment (not shown) was an open-necked, short-sleeved, ankle-length chemise of fine bleached linen. Over it went a heavier natural-linen dress, unfitted and of sweeping length. For modesty, the sleeves hugged the wrists and the front opening was laced close to the neck.
 
Married women wore a draped head covering of fine bleached linen with an oval opening for the face that completely covered the hair, which was pulled tightly back into a bun.
 
A braided girdle tied around the waist allowed her to hitch up the skirt. For church or festivals, she would add a tunic, also of heavy linen, dyed with madder to a rich red and trimmed with embroidered bands. She might add another braided girdle.
 
Thigh-high stockings of soft linen were cut on the bias, sewn up the back and gartered around the knee with strips. Over them went flat leather shoes with pointed toes.
 
--Anne Hollander, art and dress historian and author of "Sex and Suits" and "Seeing Through Clothes."
 
The millennial woman was not that different from today's inhabitants of central France, Switzerland, southern Germany, northern Italy and the Balkans. Living circumstances and nutrition account for the most conspicuous changes. The wear and tear of farm life and successive pregnancies would make a woman of 26 look about 40, by today's standards, with lean, hard muscles and a sturdy build but little subcutaneous fat.
 
The average woman was just about five feet tall and weighed between 100 and 110 pounds. Noses tended to be relatively long with a high bridge. Fine, slightly wavy brown hair and brown-to-hazel eyes were most common.
 
Rigorous chewing of foods that were tougher than today's developed the facial muscles, producing the sharp angle at the back of the jaw and prominent cheekbones that give the face its squarish cast. Teeth were worn flat with an edge-to-edge bite, the result of tearing food into bits.
 
Years of manual labor produced hands that were strong and sturdy. Skin would have been tanned and roughened by a lifetime of exposure. The feet would have been toughened by going barefoot for prolonged periods, with the toes squared and slightly separated.

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
Breath and Shadows, by Ella Leffland. (Morrow, $24.) Suffused with a moonlit melancholy, this novel braids together three generations of a Danish family to pose a haunting question: What do we leave behind to prove we have ever existed?
 
BYRON: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame, by Benita Eisler. (Knopf, $35.) A biography finds that the poet was a spoiled brat, more interested in being a lord than a writer, with a private life that was even a bigger mess than anyone knew.
 
A Dangerous Friend, by Ward Just. (Peter Davison/Houghton Mifflin, $23.) As its well-meaning civilian hero attempts to find an American officer captured in Vietnam, this novel emerges as an allegory for our country's place in the increasingly deranged world of the mid-1960's.
 
ENGLAND, ENGLAND, by Julian Barnes. (Knopf, $23.) This satirical novel suggests that while there may always be an England, its immediate future looks more like a theme park than an empire.
 
FOR THE RELIEF OF UNBearable Urges, by Nathan Englander. (Knopf, $22.) Ambitious short stories by a 29-year-old former yeshiva student from New York, now living in secular Israel; his characters are able to flourish in a borderland between the author's old world and that new one.
 
HOME TOWN, by Tracy Kidder. (Random House, $25.95.) The author turns his investigative eye on Northampton, Mass., a city of 30,000 that most young natives leave when they grow up but that is changing its blue collars to white through the steady arrival of newcomers.
 
HUMAN VOICES, by Penelope Fitzgerald. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) In her wry novel set during the blitz, the author uses the BBC's Broadcasting House as a microcosm in which the 9 o'clock news kept Britain abreast of the progress of its finest hour.
 
Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire, by Jason Goodwin. (John Macrae/Holt, $32.50.) A journalist and travel writer illuminates the history and culture of a former seat of imperial splendor, from its humble origins to glittering eminence to lumbering decline.
 
THE PITY OF WAR, by Niall Ferguson. (Basic Books, $30.) The traditional views on the causes of World War I are called into question, and the author suggests that had England stayed at home, the world might be a different place today.
 
WINSTON AND CLEMENTINE: The Personal Letters of the Churchills, edited by Mary Soames. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) The private correspondence of one of the century's most fascinating couples, edited by their youngest daughter, traces the "love & honour" of one of "the gt romances" through the "colour & jostle of the high-way" of the 20th century.

No Shame
 in My Game
 The Working Poor
 in the Inner City.
 By Katherine S. Newman.
 388 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf/The Russell Sage Foundation. $27.95. 
 Katherine S. Newman got the inspiration for this book in a Harlem traffic jam. Crawling crosstown in the back of a cab, she stared out at one of the country's most famous pockets of poverty and saw throngs of people heading to work, just as in blue-collar neighborhoods. As it happened, Newman, an anthropologist now at Harvard, was on her way to a conference on the poor -- the jobless, welfare-dependent poor who dominate public discussion. "What do we know about the others, the hard-working people of communities like Harlem struggling to get to work?" she wondered. "Not much."
In "No Shame in My Game," a study of Harlem fast-food workers, Newman champions poor workers and seeks to reorient the poverty debate. She wants to de-emphasize self-defeating behaviors like teen-age pregnancy, and to stress what she sees as the larger issues: the injustice of low wages and the apathy of more prosperous citizens. These low-income workers "are not people whose values need re-engineering," she writes. "They work hard at jobs the rest of us would not want because they believe in the dignity of work."
Newman's effort to recast the inner-city poor as neglected, working-class heroes fails on two counts. Even her highly sympathetic portraits make many of them seem less striving and more party to their troubled circumstances than she realizes. And the world is not as unaware of their economic woes as she believes.
Still, she is right to recognize that most poor people do work, at least sporadically. The problem is that work alone often fails to transform their lives. With tougher welfare laws sweeping the country, this is a crucial point -- even programs that get people into jobs may fail to uplift the ghettos. Newman argues that the problem is mainly economics: low wages and scarce jobs. But her findings suggest a more complicated set of issues. Newman and her graduate students interviewed 300 workers and job applicants at a fast-food franchise she calls "Burger Barn." The students spent four months working behind the counters, and the research team followed 12 workers over a longer period. While Newman heralds the "rich, detailed data that poured in," this is not a book of rich, detailed portraits. The workers are known only by first names -- Jamal, Kyesha, Tiffany, Latoya -- and they blur together. There is no narrative or human drama; the organization is topical.
Nonetheless, Newman asks interesting questions, and some new insights emerge. Examining the demeaned "McJob," she finds it more intellectually challenging and socially rewarding than most outsiders would guess. Yes, abuse flows in from disgruntled customers, including mocking peers. But the workers bond among themselves to "build a moral defense of their work." Yes, wages are low and the work is hard. But the Burger Barn managers mix profit motives with "a missionary impulse" toward rescuing inner-city youth. "The fast-food industry is actually very good about internal promotion," Newman writes.
This discovery of a management track is an interesting bit of news, since these are supposed to be dead-end jobs. But like many of Newman's findings, it is at odds with her larger view of a class-bound society where opportunity is "distressingly limited." She does not resolve -- often she does not even acknowledge -- such contradictions. Newman argues that her Burger Barn workers are filled with mainstream aspirations about school, work and family. And she relays some uplifting stories of tenacity against the odds. A particularly affecting tale involves William, a fat, bullied teen-ager who takes refuge in his work despite the derision of others his age.
But Newman sees everyone she meets in a similarly flattering light, as if she is afraid to make any judgments. "Latoya does not lack the desire to go to school, just the life circumstances that would make more education feasible," Newman writes. What "life circumstances"? As a "heavy partygoer," Latoya dropped out of school at 16 and had a baby. Her mother said keep studying but, Latoya said, "I was like, 'Yeah, whatever.' "She winds up with three children by two or three men (the number of fathers is unclear). Latoya is not even poor. While she earns about $15,000, Jason, the father of her third child, is a union carpenter who earns $15 an hour, or about $30,000 a year. Newman vigorously defends the "irregular social structures" of the inner-city family. But if Jason and Latoya would marry, their family income would top $45,000. Finally they do marry -- and they escape poverty. Jason's earnings are unusually high, but Latoya could leave poverty even if Jason earned half as much. "Irregular social structures" -- the lack of stable marriages -- are clearly part of the problem.
Newman is particularly puzzling when she says American society assigns low-wage workers "the untouchable status of the Indian low castes." In fact, support for low-wage workers has been growing at a noteworthy pace. Two years ago, a Republican balanced-budget bill found $24 billion over five years to subsidize health care for low-income families. And that pales next to the $30 billion the country now offers the working poor in annual wage supplements. The program, called the earned income tax credit, provides annual cash bonuses of more than $3,700 per family. This may or may not be enough, but it is scarcely apathy or scorn. Newman races past the program -- the centerpiece of policy toward low-wage workers -- in two paragraphs.
Of all the workers she meets, Jamal steals her heart. She is impressed by the "doting love he has for his young wife," Kathy, and finds him "something of a hero" for boarding a bus to a minimum-wage job each morning at 5. But as Newman goes on to explain, Kathy is not his young wife -- she is his girlfriend. She ran away from home to join him at 16, and soon they had a child. The infant was put in foster care after Jamal apparently struck her. His temper "has its explosive side," and he has had problems with cocaine. Newman sees Jamal as a striving worker blocked at every turn. He has a less romantic view, describing himself as "going from here to here to here, and doing this and that." It is little wonder that he is adrift and depressed -- his mother is a longtime crack addict, and he has never known his father.
No doubt Jamal has appealing qualities and untapped gifts; many needy people do. No doubt better jobs would help. But as Newman inadvertently shows, his problems stretch far past Burger Barn.

THE RETURN
 OF DEPRESSION ECONOMICS
 By Paul Krugman.
 176 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $23.95. 
 In late 1994, just when Mexico seemed on the verge of entering the economic big leagues, its currency suddenly collapsed and the country entered a deep recession that would have been much worse had not Washington put together a $50 billion rescue plan. The blame was laid at the feet of Mexican authorities. They had allowed Mexico to borrow too much and let the peso become overvalued. Then they mishandled monetary policy and devalued the currency in a way that proved they were inept.
Having persuaded themselves that the so-called "tequila crisis" was all about Mexico and not about the rest of us, investors could go back to business as usual in the rest of the world. And they could be stunned -- shocked, really -- when some very similar problems devastated Asian countries in 1997 and 1998.
Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recalls in his excellent new book, "The Return of Depression Economics," that Guillermo Calvo, a prominent economist then at the World Bank, kept telling people after the Mexican crisis that while Mexico had made mistakes, the important question was, "Why was so large a punishment imposed for so small a crime?"
The answer is neither simple nor certain. Part of it surely lies in the way the world's financial system has evolved in recent decades, with big flows of capital moving into countries that are popular with investors and then moving back out again very rapidly. As Krugman notes, countries with controls on capital movements have tended to do better in the crisis environment than those without. That is a long way from conventional economic wisdom, and is one reason that reading Krugman as he glances over the economic history of the past several decades is both enjoyable and thought-provoking.
The title may be a bit misleading. Krugman does not think the world is about to descend into a 1930's-style depression. In fact, he argues that such a fate can be avoided if we instead remember the economic theories born of the Depression, most notably the work of Lord Keynes. Depression economics, Krugman says, "is the study of situations where there is a free lunch, if we can only figure out how to get our hands on it, because there are unemployed resources that could be put to work." He thinks that in some places, most notably Japan, it is time for government to actively seek inflation. I think he is too severe on Japanese policy makers, who finally are pulling out all the stops to get their economy moving, but Japan would be in better shape now if Krugman's advice had been heeded earlier.
Krugman argues that now, as in the 1930's, there is too much emphasis on economic orthodoxy and on somehow restoring the confidence of investors. To be sure, confidence is of immense importance at certain times, and a major reason that country after country suffered currency collapses was that investors took flight. But countries facing crises now are not going to be any more successful than Herbert Hoover was at winning confidence by slashing public works spending while their economies stagnate.
What appalls Krugman now is not the problems the world faces but the reluctance to learn from them. "Those who worried about balanced budgets back when uncontrollable deficits were the problem suddenly insist that raising taxes and cutting spending will actually prevent a recession, because it will improve confidence," he says. "Those who wanted stable prices back when inflation was the risk now claim that 'managed inflation' will somehow backfire."
The reality to Krugman is that there are few, if any, economic policies that are always right for all countries. What you should do depends on where you are and on an ability to think clearly about how you got there. There are times when capital controls can work, and when they would be disastrous. There are times when fixed exchange rates can work wonders, and times when they can blow up. That is not the easy answer, but it is the right one.

Everybody Was So Young:
Gerald and Sara Murphy. A Lost Generation Love Story
By Amanda Vaill. Broadway, $15.
The Murphys were a dazzling, rich American couple who knew and entertained just about everybody who was anybody in Paris and on the French Riviera in the 1920's, from Fitzgerald to Picasso. In 1998 our reviewer, Brooke Allen, called this "a marvelously readable biography" by "a skillful and compassionate writer."
 
About a Boy
By Nick Hornby. Riverhead, $12.95.
Will Freeman is a smug but aimless London bachelor in his 30's who devises a dating scheme to tap the market in sexy divorced women by pretending to be a single dad and joining a support group full of single mothers. Before long, though, he runs into a troubled 12-year-old boy who sees right through him, and the two become unlikely soul mates. "Hornby . . . combines a skilled, intuitive appreciation for the rigors of comic structure with highly original insights about the way the enchantments of popular culture insinuate themselves into middle-class notions of romance," Hal Espen wrote here in 1998.
 
A Walk in the Woods:
Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail
By Bill Bryson. Broadway, $13.
The author chronicles in breezy, good-humored fashion his five-month struggle to hike the 2,100-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Bryson is "a satirist of the first rank, one who writes (and walks) with Chaucerian brio," Dwight Garner wrote here last year. Searching for Yellowstone: Ecology and Wonder in the Last Wilderness, by Paul Schullery (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), is an environmental and human history of Yellowstone National Park by a longtime park ranger and administrator. "Schullery . . . has given us a refreshingly unhyperbolic look at the place he loves," Michael Parfit wrote here in 1997.
 
Freedomland
By Richard Price. Island/Dell, $7.99.
This novel tracks the racial turmoil that erupts after a white woman turns up in a New Jersey city and claims her 4-year-old son was abducted by a black carjacker. " 'Freedomland' is infinitely more than a detective story," Francine Prose said here last year. "It aspires to the heft and weight of a 19th-century Russian classic."
 
WORMHOLES: Essays and Occasional Writings
By John Fowles. Owl/Holt, $16.
This grab bag of musings by the 73-year-old English novelist covers a lot of territory -- from autobiographical pieces to cantankerous forays into politics and culture. "The book is as various, quirkily learned, beguiling, opinionated and, in parts, as sumptuously written as Fowles's fiction," Roger Kimball wrote here last year.
 
The Iron Tracks
By Aharon Appelfeld. Schocken, $12.
This Israeli novel is about a concentration camp survivor who wanders through Austria buying sacred books and other remnants of the Jewish culture that once flourished there while searching for the Nazi officer who murdered his parents. "Appelfeld's controlled fiction compresses large themes into small spaces," Jonathan Rosen said here in 1998. Bronstein's Children, by Jurek Becker (University of Chicago, $15), is another novel about the psychic aftershocks of the Holocaust, in which an 18-year-old German Jew in 1973 stumbles onto his father and two other camp survivors as they torture a former Nazi guard. "Becker, writing simply and clearly in an unstrained narrative, speaks with the voice of knowledge," Eva Figes said here in 1988.
 
The Collected Poems of Amy Clampitt
Knopf, $19.95.
Clampitt's poetry is full of restless motion and energy as she evokes places like the Quaker village in Iowa where she was born and Greenwich Village, where she cultivated a resolute bohemianism. In 1997 in the Book Review, Christopher Benfey called this posthumously published collection a testament to an "extraordinary life's work."
 
A Beautiful Mind
By Sylvia Nasar. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.
This biography of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning developer of game theory, follows him from his early career through his crippling bouts of schizophrenia to his recovery years later. The author, who writes about economics for The New York Times, "offers a remarkable look into the arcane world of mathematics and the tragedy of madness," Simon Singh wrote here in 1998.
 
Green Fires:
Assault on Eden. A Novel of the Ecuadorian Rainforest
By Marnie Mueller. Curbstone, $13.95.
A former Peace Corps volunteer revisits the jungles of coastal Ecuador on her honeymoon in 1969 and becomes involved in a battle between the native people and American oil companies. "The characters are well drawn, and the novel has adventure, intrigue and romance as well as politics," one critic said in 1994.
 
Havana Dreams: A Story of a Cuban Family
By Wendy Gimbel. Vintage, $13.
The lives of three unhappy women -- a wealthy bourgeoise, her daughter and the daughter's child by Fidel Castro -- provide a striking perspective on Cuba and its odd destiny. "The result is a shimmering book," Alma Guillermoprieto said here last year. Scott Veale

 BODY:
THE afterlife. Today it rivals Vancouver as one of the most popular movie locations. Ever since Ernst Lubitsch sent a departed mortal hurtling back to earth in "Heaven Can Wait," heaven itself has been fascinating Hollywood. When Wim Wenders sent his angels earthward in "Wings of Desire," a trend was reborn. What with John Travolta, Robin Williams and Brad Pitt all going celestial, heaven has never been more hip. Heaven help future historians tempted to interpret this era's spiritual proclivities from a close reading of recent movies. Luckily, they -- and we -- now have some help from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda. His new film, "After Life" (at the Film Forum) redefines our notions of what comes next in a charming fable that's as profound as it is simple.
"After Life" asks its audience to imagine that humans, after death, enter a sort of purgatory that resembles nothing so much as an aging school building or government depository. There, a helpful staff informs them one by one of their status, offers sympathy ("So sorry for your loss") and then provides assistance with the task that confronts them: to choose one memory out of their entire life to take with them for all eternity. Everything else about their life on earth will be forgotten. 
 Already, "After Life" has proved its ability to cast a spell over its audiences, in part perhaps because of its unusual combination of fiction and fact. What memory would you take with you? What would you pick? In France, the film took the grand prize at the Nantes Festival. In Argentina, where memory and amnesia regularly duke it out for ownership of history, it struck a particular chord, picking up a distributor instantly and winning awards for both Best Picture and Best Screenplay at the Buenos Aires Film Festival. At festival screenings in the United States, it has acquired cult status. Even at the Sundance Film Festival, "After Life" managed to transfix its notoriously untransfixable crowd.
Mr. Kore-eda seems to believe that the very essence of humanity is memory, if his recent career is any indication. In "Maborosi," the feature debut that brought him international fame in 1995, a young widow is haunted by grief over her husband's suicide even after a new marriage offers happiness. Mr. Kore-eda's contemplative regard for this character and the exquisite gravity with which he invested his images of her memory and sorrow captured audiences and awards.
But "Maborosi" told only part of the story. Mr. Kore-eda made eight documentaries, before and after "Maborosi," exploring the lives of Japan's outsiders, victims and renegades. The most recent, "Without Memory," tracks the astonishing case of a man who was the victim of a botched medical procedure. He was left with his memories intact but stripped of the ability to form new ones. In effect, he remains condemned to an eternal present excavated by continual forgetting.
The third of this trio of memory pictures, "After Life" synthesizes the lessons learned along the way. Whereas "Maborosi" was a polished fictional construct, this time Mr. Kore-eda decided to retain his documentary style and process. He investigated the nature of memory by visiting temples, parks and homes for the elderly to pose his question: If they could carry only one memory with them after death, which would they choose? After 6 months and 500 interviews, Mr. Kore-eda came to an unexpected realization. "Originally, I intended to 'steal' their stories," he said through a translator at the Sundance festival. "But I was so compelled by the authenticity of those stories, and their facial expressions as they told them, that I realized I could never beat them and just decided to cast them as they are."
The director's willingness to learn from his own process made "After Life" a hybrid in which scripted actors and nonactors are filmed in the act of actually retrieving their own memories. Mr. Kore-eda eschewed big-movie techniques in favor of natural light, 16-millimeter cameras and extended shots to avoid unsettling his nonprofessionals. It's risky , but it pays off brilliantly. One woman particularly captivates audiences. She recalls a joyous girlhood moment, when her favorite brother bought her a red dress to wear to a special dance and then showed her off to his friends afterward. All these years later, she's still intoxicated by the memory. Other characters recall other memories: the taste of rice balls cooked in a bamboo grove, the feel of a breeze blowing in the window of a tram, the sight of clouds in the sky.
"After Life" is hardly a sober film, however. Its purgatory staff, for instance, assists the dead by filming their memories, for their reliving as well as for the collection they solemnly call "the archives." In one hilarious scene, they even order up a lifetime of surveillance videos for a man who needs a refresher course on his own life. A documentary filmmaker all his life, Mr. Kore-eda cannot resist poking fun at the film production process itself while gently considering the relationship between a film crew and its subjects.
Still, it is memory and its unreliability, its vagaries and gaps, that fascinate Mr. Kore-eda. "I developed this idea, at a young age, that you forget everything, and then you die," he said.
He forged such beliefs in his own childhood, living with a grandfather who started losing his lucidity, then developed dementia and senility as Mr. Kore-eda grew up. Alzheimer's had not yet been named. "One day, he no longer recognized our faces," Mr. Kore-eda recalled. "Finally, he could not recognize his own." Haunted by this experience, Mr. Kore-eda imagined an alternative: "What if you got to hold onto one thing?" Out of this idea, first conceived 10 years ago, Mr. Kore-eda developed "After Life."
His film continually challenges viewers to sift and sort artifice from authenticity, yet the line between the fictional and the factual can never be entirely clarified. One character, for example, recalls her life of prostitution, then chooses to remember a tender encounter that was the exception to the rule. Or was it? Her story changes drastically as she gets deeper into its telling. Surely she must be an actress with a script? Not quite. Now an actress, she was once a well-known Japanese porn star.
Mr. Kore-eda noted how the film's production was shaped by unusual transformations: "There was a script, but the actors on the set were so moved by the stories of the real people that they began to insert their own lives into the script. She wanted to tell this story." It's not surprising to learn that the film's title was suggested by a Japanese vaudeville expression meaning "neither here nor there."
If audiences wonder to what extent "After Life" reflects Japanese attitudes toward life after death, Mr. Kore-eda avoids grandiose claims. Asked about whether the bells heard tolling in "After Life" are a reference to the 108 chimes at Japanese New Year for the 108 sins of man, he said, "I think I just like the sound of bells." He happily discusses a range of Japanese faiths: that there is a heaven and hell; that there is nothing after death, according to scientific empiricism; that the divide between the brain and the objective world is no longer clear. He links this last view to Oliver Sacks's study "A Leg to Stand On," which has had a great influence in promoting the idea of mind-body connection in Japan.
In Mr. Kore-eda's films, what stands out most is the compassion with which characters are imbued. This is a director who is infinitely patient, prepared to wait and to listen. Perhaps this capacity for empathy was forged in childhood, when his family experienced Japan's postwar economic boom of the 1960's within the confines of a poor Tokyo neighborhood called Gumma. "My family was very poor," he said. "We drew our water from a well, our bath was heated with firewood. It was hardly evocative of metropolitan Tokyo life."
If his grandfather lost memory, his father retained it: "He was in the military. He became a prisoner of war in Manchuria and spent two years at hard labor in Siberia. I believe that the deaths of his fellow P.O.W.'s and friends in the camps in Siberia had a major impact on his life." His mother, in turn, loved to watch Hollywood movies on television, especially "those starring Joan Fontaine or Ingrid Bergman," he recalled.
It is out of this mix of pleasure and deprivation, trauma and memory, that Mr. Kore-eda has emerged as one of Japan's most original cinematic talents.
"After Life" taps into a wellspring of emotion in audiences drawing on intensely different public and political histories. In Japan, its sold-out screenings are a striking phenomenon for a culture that prefers to dismiss its memories. As Mr. Kore-eda points out, "The Japanese, after all, at the end of every year have a bonenkai, literally, a year-forgetting party, in which all the events of that year are put aside." Such a party is unimaginable, of course, in American culture, where memory can be malleable or marketable, exposed on daytime television or sold on the memoir circuit, rewritten or restored, but never discarded.
Here, too, "After Life" has riveted audiences. People leave the theater strangely silent, caught up in revery, perhaps reviewing the events of their life. Mr. Kore-eda, by fashioning a story of death and memory, has slyly delivered a movie that reaffirms life -- and the magic of movies.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey;
High-Tech Company Offices Expand in Monmouth

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
TO gain a presence in this country, J. D. S. Fitel, a Canadian company that develops fiber-optic products, opened a 14,000-square-foot office last June at Monmouth Executive Center, not far from Routes 9 and 33 in Freehold Township in Monmouth County. Since then the company has leased an additional 3,500 square feet there.
In Holmdel, also in Monmouth, Market Ware International, a computer software firm that focuses on servicing banks and financial brokerages, grew from a 1,500-square-foot office to 11,400 square feet of space at Holmdel Executive Center, close to Exit 114 of the Garden State Parkway. It is considering leasing an additional 7,600 square feet. 
 In the last 18 months high-technology companies such as these have leased about 500,000 square feet of space in Monmouth County, according to the Schultz Organization, a commercial brokerage in Woodbridge. The space includes offices alone and offices combined with warehouse, research and development and light assembly facilities.
The activity is helping to absorb available space in the one-time resort area's 6.3-million-square-foot office market. In the first quarter the vacancy rate for Class A space fell to 2.8 percent, from 6.3 percent the year before, and the rate for Class B space dropped to 11.7 percent from 16.9 percent, according to Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage.
The brokerage put the average annual rents for Class A space at $20.89 and for Class B space at $18.19. Average rents for space in North Jersey are $25.98 and $21.26, respectively.
Jonathan B. Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, said that because of the county's lower rents, access to skilled labor and highways as well as its projected residential growth he expected the flow of such firms to continue into the next millennium. This flow, along with an infusion of back-office operations of service firms, "will create the potential for new construction," he said.
And build-to-suit projects have sprouted. One is a 138,000-square-foot building recently completed in the Eatontown Business Park, off Route 35 in Eatontown, for TSSL Laboratories, the research and development arm of TYCO Submarine Systems Ltd., based in Morristown. In addition, work began last week on the renovation of an empty 737,000-square-foot building in Tinton Falls into modern office space. The developer is the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury.
The activity by high-technology firms in the county also reflects the broader trend of such firms expanding in or relocating to New Jersey. The state has identified the industry as one of five influencing New Jersey's economic growth. The others are health care, financial services, entertainment and logistics, which collectively added 37,000 of the 78,000 jobs the state gained in 1998.
THE high-technology sector had the greatest expansion, adding nearly 14,000 jobs, a 5.2 percent rise over 1997, for a total of 279,400 high-technology jobs statewide in 1998, state figures show.
Some of those jobs are filtering into Monmouth County for several reasons, industry professionals said. Among them is the fact that it is home to the Army's Fort Monmouth in Eatontown, which has long been associated with developing high-technolgy communications systems, as well as to the telecommunication giants AT&T and Lucent Technologies. The three are among the county's largest employers.
In January AT&T renewed its commitment to the county. It completed the renovation of an 836,000-square-foot building and built additional structures, totaling 1.4 million square feet, at a 262-acre campus off Laurel Avenue in Middletown. The site is AT&T's main research and development complex.
Of the company's statewide work force of 24,500 employees 22 percent now work in Monmouth County, said Ritch Blasi, an AT&T spokesman.
Lucent has a statewide workforce of 20,000. Some 5,300 of them work in Monmouth County, where the company has concentrated its research and development in optical networking and software, said William Price, a Lucent spokesman .
Given that scientific base, Edward J. DaCosta, a senior vice president at the Iselin office of CB Richard Ellis, another national commercial brokerage said: "Many high-tech companies are drawn to the county because they have government contracts with the Army or working relationships with AT&T or Lucent."
For example Lucent, through its New Ventures Group, helps launch new technology firms, including its first in New Jersey -- Persystant Technologies, a developer of software that integrates voice and data communications over the Internet. Launched this month, Persystant is based in Eatontown and is owned by Lucent and Unixpros, a software development company also based in Eatontown.
Mr. DaCosta said another draw for large and small high-technology firms was the availability of skilled labor. Mr. Schultz added that with the state's unemployment rate at 4.6 percent, finding qualified workers is becoming a critical issue for many firms.
Marc R. Rene de Cotret, a spokesman for J. D. S. Fitel, the Canadian firm, said his company had selected Monmouth County because it offered "proximity to AT&T and Lucent and access to a pool of qualified labor." Its Freehold office, in the 173,000-square-foot Monmouth Executive Center, employs 30 people.
"This office allowed us to gain a foothold in the U.S.," he said. "The industry is robust and we feel we are well-positioned to take advantage of that."
THOSE factors, along with more affordable office rents, were also important to Market Ware International, said Jose Pierre, its chief executive. He traded off his job as a technology executive on Wall Street to start the firm in 1996 in an office at the 78,000-square-foot Holmdel Executive Center.
"The key," Mr. Pierre added, "is that we wanted to be away from hustle and bustle and in an area that offered a better quality of life." He said his firm would add 14 employees this month for a total of 44 and anticipated adding 14 to 30 more, fueling a need for more space.
From 1990 to 1998, population in the 472-square-mile county rose by 9.6 percent to 606,229 and it is expected to grow by an additional 2 percentage points by the end of the decade, according to the Monmouth County Planning Board.
There were 3,148 housing permits issued in the county in 1998, second only to Ocean County in the number of permits issued among the state's 21 counties. And since 1997 construction of 876,418 square feet of retail space, as well as nearly 2 million square feet of office and industrial space, has either been under way or has been proposed.
"Monmouth County is like an untapped market for retailers and high-technology firms," said Bruce Fary, who heads the county planning board's development review section.
Because there has been no significant office construction in the last decade, Mr. Schwartz said, "the county can use more space."
To make up for this deficiency, Matrix is renovating its huge building in Tinton Falls, equidistant from Exits 105 and 109 of the Garden State Parkway. Kenneth A. Griffin, a Matrix partner, noted that the county offered "more housing choices and lower labor rates" than in northern New Jersey and Manhattan. Moreover, he said, the building "will have a significant cost advantage" over newly constructed ones in the state.
The seven-story structure was built in 1973 and leased until recently by the Army for its communications and electronics command center. That operation has since been relocated to Fort Monmouth.
"High-tech firms are absolutely among the tenants the building will be targeted to," said Richard S. Baumstein, an executive director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage that is marketing the building. For such companies relocating from North Jersey or Manhattan, "the county is a likely place for them," he said, adding that average asking rents at the Tinton Falls building would be $22 a square foot.
Under the $40 million to $45 million renovation plan, the old building will be stripped to its steel skeleton, and given a new facade and interior space, as well as upgraded mechanical systems and fiber-optic capabilities, said Mr. Griffin.
The building, with four wings and 100,000-square-foot floors, can accommodate users needing one or more floors, though the space can be divided into blocks of 25,000 square feet or less, Mr. Griffin said. He added that completion was expected by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Dancing On Top of the World, With Malaise

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE; Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on the dancer-choreographer Bebe Miller.

 BODY:
DAVID PARSONS sounded distressed. "Lately, every time I start a new project, I get unnerved," he said over lunch in Manhattan recently. Although this 39-year-old dancer-choreographer looks like a hunky, happy-go-lucky movie star, during this conversation he came across as an angst-ridden artist. "In the back of my mind, there's always the word 'accessible' that's constantly thrown at me as an insult. What does it mean? That I attract the masses? That's bad? My work's not about getting people to love me. It's about following what I want to do."
Ever since he established his modern-dance company 12 years ago, some critics have called his work superficial, accusing him of catering to the lowest common denominator. But why do their opinions affect him so deeply now? After all, he has had plenty of time to build defenses. Moreover, his company consistently attracts new fans, makes money and pleases many more critics than it disappoints. Obviously something else was wrong. 
 Events of the last two years have made him especially vulnerable, Mr. Parsons said. His confidence became seriously eroded. "I hit bottom," he said. "I became mean. I gave my dancers a hard time. I had a terrible breakup with a woman. I didn't have a permanent place to stay in the city. I tore the cartilage in my knee and had to have an operation." He winced. "It's coming back very slowly."
Yet in spite of his malaise, Mr. Parsons acknowledges that he still has ample reasons to feel positive. The Parsons Dance Company attracts large audiences, in locations as diverse as Brazil, Italy, Australia and St. Louis. And its two-week engagement at the Joyce Theater, starting Tuesday, is nearly sold out. "Almost all the music will be live," he said proudly; troupes appearing at the Joyce usually can't afford musicians. On the first week's program is his newest work, "Fill the Woods With Light," which had its world premiere at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., last summer. It is set to a commissioned score by the jazz saxophonist Phil Woods, who will play it at the Joyce with his Little Big Band. To a mix of funky rock-and-roll, blues and bossa nova, Mr. Parsons created, according to Mr. Woods, "a warm dance, sort of down and dirty."
The second week's program features six works by Robert Battle, a veteran Parsons dancer. A choreographer new to the New York stage, Mr. Battle offers "Rush Hour," a world premiere, and four New York premieres, all of them to commissioned scores by John Mackey, a 28-year-old contemporary composer, who will perform with his ensemble of 10 Juilliard musicians. "Takademe," Mr. Battle's sixth New York premiere, is to the recorded songs of the Indian singer Sheila Chandra.
Mr. Parsons's widest exposure yet will come on New Year's Eve. The Times Square Business Improvement District chose him to stage a continuous outdoor show on 42d Street from 7 A.M., Dec. 31 until 7 A.M., Jan. 1. "Basically, it's a TV program going by satellite to a billion people," Mr. Parsons said. As chief of a creative team that includes Michael Curry, designer of the oversize puppets in the Broadway musical "The Lion King," Mr. Parsons has been asked to create a series of theatrical events, full of pageantry and with universal appeal. Although the show is still in the planning stage, he already knows he'll use 150 performers, 10 of them his company members, and that well-known composers around the world will do the music.
Mr. Parsons got the job for several reasons. "David has a devoted and very extensive following," said Peter Kohlmann, the executive producer of Times Square 2000. "We also knew he had standing in the dance world. Those qualifications, plus his visual sense and his reputation for being easy to work with, made us pick him."
Like Mr. Kohlmann, presenters and booking agents find Mr. Parsons's wide popularity pure gold. "Last year, David filled our 2,300-seat opera house five nights running," said Maria Rita Stumpf, president of Antares Promotions in Rio de Janeiro. "It's the joyfulness, the exuberant physicality of his work and his dancers." Three years ago, he did as well in Italy. According to Antonio Gnecchi, a producer who began representing Mr. Parsons 10 years ago, his troupe sold out in 18 cities. "David communicates directly, without pretension," Mr. Gnecchi said. Sally Bliss, executive director of Dance St. Louis, was equally enthusiastic. "Both little kids and the elderly love his work," she said. "You can't imagine how many friends his company makes here."
How does Mr. Parsons accomplish this? With a catholic repertory that includes the show-stopping "Caught" (1982), in which a dancer appears to fly; "Anthem" (1998), inspired by the dissolution of Eastern-bloc dictatorships, and "Ring Around the Rosie" (1993), which refers to AIDS. The first two, along with "Union" (1993), to "Nefertiti" by the jazz composer Wayne Shorter, will be presented this season.
But accomplishments aren't enough, and beneath them are deep reasons for Mr. Parsons's blue mood. "Sometimes you get so confused," he said earnestly. "You don't know how to separate your personal life from your professional life. I became bogged down, erratic. There's always a deadline; every time we do a show, there's a critic. I feared my creative juices were drying up. I was afraid of losing the joy in creation."
Mr. Parsons fell in love with dance as a 12-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., and has been immersed in it since, so it's not surprising that he eventually reached an impasse. Frequently dancer-choreographers become devastatingly discouraged in their late 30's and early 40's, when they must look to a future when they can no longer perform. Paul Taylor, with whose company Mr. Parsons starred for nine years, weathered a similar crisis, as did Twyla Tharp. But it wasn't just the inevitable physical changes that got to Mr. Parsons. The responsibility for his dancers -- he provides at least 45 weeks of work and full health and unemployment insurance -- and the constant touring became too much. He had little energy for choreographing.
A couple of changes have slowly begun to turn the tide; for one, Mr. Parsons travels less with the troupe. "The pressures built up in David, and he took it out on us," said Jaime Martinez, who recently became assistant artistic director of the company. "Today he gives older members, Liz Koeppen and me, a lot more responsibility, and it's been great for all of us." Second, Mr. Parsons now plans to produce work by other choreographers regularly, shifting the weight of creating all the company's new dances. Mr. Battle is the first choreographer to benefit from Mr. Parsons's decision. "David sees this as the future of dance," said Mr. Battle. "No more one-choreographer companies."
Mr. Parsons says when he auditions now, he looks for dancers who want to choreograph as well. Before being hired, his three new company members, Kate Skarpetowska, George Smallwood and Sumayah McRae, submitted videotape of pieces they had created. The idea wasn't new to Mr. Parsons; putting it into practice was. For nine years, his troupe spent time every summer at the New Arts Summer Festival in Fort Myers, Fla., teaching choreography and technique. Now he is trying to establish a school in New York, a permanent place to nurture dancers and choreographers. "My school will be open to everybody," he said, dreaming out loud. "I'll have a summer session where semiprofessionals from around the world can come and taste the city and get a feel for other choreographers and our technique and repertory."
His mood picked up. "I want to do more video. I've already used video to teach disadvantaged kids to dance. I'll do my own productions and make films for television to get people who don't go to theater interested in dance."
Mr. Parsons likes collaborations. This season, Missoni and Donna Karan created many of the company's costumes, and he talked excitedly about the possibility of working with Mikhail Baryshnikov on a piece using Vari-Lite, a lighting system run by computers. Made famous in the shows of the rock group Genesis, Vari-Lite can rotate 360 degrees, fading from one color and pattern to another. He then switched to explaining that he might try as backdrops the underwater photographs of Howard Schatz, or enormous close-ups of the dancers: "In film, close-ups are usually what get you emotionally involved," he said. "I'll have to figure out how we can do that."
Rising to leave, he paused to say: "You know, I'm actually feeling better. Something's coming back that is very beautiful." And he was smiling.

HEADLINE: In the Region /Long Island;
In Jericho, a Developer Is Buying a Rural Legacy

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: JERICHO

 BODY:
TIME is soon to catch up to a 19th-century farmhouse, several barns, and the nine acres of fields and paddocks surrounding them that have survived as a rural oasis on busy Jericho Turnpike just east of the Route 107 cloverleaf. They have been owned by members of one of Long Island's older families, the Underhills, for almost 130 years.
But economic realities have persuaded the four owners that renting the property to a boarding stable known as Jericho Run Farms no longer makes good sense. 
 Samuel Underhill Mitchell, 68, his 97-year-old mother, the former Alice Underhill, and Mr. Mitchell's two cousins, Phebe Alice Apgar of Burke, Va., and Morley L. Smith Jr. of Montreal, have signed a contract to sell the parcel to a Manhattan developer, Forest City Daly Housing, which has proposed developing it for 20 houses and a 90-unit assisted-living residence.
Under the sales agreement, the farmhouse must be preserved. But even so Mr. Mitchell, a direct descendant of Capt. John Underhill, who founded the family in 1661, said it was painful to part with the property. "It is full of fond memories," he explained.
His great-grandfather, Samuel S. Underhill, purchased the house along with 160 acres in the mid-1870's. His mother and her sister, his aunt Phebe Underhill Smith, grew up there.
He remembers playing there as a boy and spending his summers helping his grandfather, Samuel S. Underhill Jr., work the farm, which originally extended east to Robbins Lane and south to the Long Island Rail Road tracks.
Most of the land was sold off in the 1950's, as farm after farm in the area gave way to development.
To the west there is commercial development, including a motel and a gas station a half-mile distant near the cloverleaf connecting Jericho Turnpike to Route 107. To the east are office buildings, a shopping center and an industrial park. To the south, high ranches and colonials occupy quarter-acre lots that were once part of the Underhill holdings. To the north there are more houses.
But horses still graze in the fields of the Underhill property, a reminder of the days when the family raised cattle and, later, potatoes, corn, cabbage, tomatoes and other produce.
The five-bedroom farmhouse has two parlors, one on each side of the front door, eyebrow windows on the second floor and wide plank floors. An iron potbelly stove still stands in the dining room. With its sagging front porch framed by wisteria, and with the adjoining barns sporting an American flag, the house looks more like part of rural upstate New York than suburbia.
But property taxes are $62,000 a year, which the rent being paid by Jericho Run Farms, the riding establishment, doesn't begin to cover, Mr. Mitchell said.
Developers have been trying for years to purchase the property, Mr. Mitchell added, but until the idea of an assisted-living facility came up, he turned down all proposals.
"I want to see something built here that the family can be proud of, and with which it can leave its stamp on the property," he explained. "This is a quiet, peaceful use and something many people need. It's also a way to preserve the home."
Forest City Daly has proposed dividing the property into two parcels. A three-acre portion fronting on Jericho Turnpike would, subject to a zoning change, be developed for a 90-unit assisted-living residence for the frail elderly.
Designed by Perkins Eastman Architects in Manhattan, the two-story building would incorporate some of the traditional architecture of the existing farmhouse, said Michael D. Daly, the president of Forest City Daly. The concern is an affiliate of Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, a publicly traded real estate company.
Forest City Daly, which builds only assisted-living projects, would retain ownership and manage the complex here. Residents, expected to be in their mid-80's, would pay up to $4,000 a month. The rent would include three meals a day and all their daily living needs.
THE three acres, which have residential zoning, would require a zoning change from the Town of Oyster Bay, so the developer is first seeking the support of bordering homeowners organized as the East Birchwood Civic Association. The group has met with Mr. Daly several times.
A previous proposal by the Strausman Construction of Great Neck for an assisted-living project with 350 units was met with such intense opposition that it was withdrawn.
The civic association has not yet taken a stand on the current proposal by Forest City Daly, said the association's president, Todd Fabricant. But he indicated that his group was more favorably inclined toward Mr. Daly's plan.
"We realize that we need places for our seniors to go as people get older, and we felt that this compromise, which we are still working on, is a fairly decent one," he said.
The six acres to the rear of the property, which would become a buffer between existing houses and the assisted-living complex, would be developed with 20 houses on quarter-acre lots in line with the existing residential zoning. The new subdivision would be entered from Ellen Place, a side street.
Forest City Daly intends to sell off the six acres to a residential builder, Britt Realty of Hauppauge, which is proposing four-bedroom houses selling in the $600,000 range.
The Underhill homestead, which is very close to Jericho Turnpike, would be moved 100 feet back in case the thoroughfare is ever widened, Mr. Daly said, adding that he intended to restore the building and possibly use it for administrative purposes.
"Saving and refurbishing the homestead is very admirable," said Mr. Fabricant, the civic association president. "Leaving some remembrance of this family for future generations is very important."
Captain Underhill was one of the Town of Oyster Bay's earliest colonists. He settled in what is now Lattingtown and Mill Neck on 150 acres given him by members of the Matinecock Indian tribe after he negotiated a land claim for them. All that is left in family hands of the original Underhill holdings is a burial plot marked by a 40-foot-high obelisk commemorating the family founder, which President Theodore Roosevelt dedicated in 1908.
At one time, various branches of the Underhill family collectively owned thousands of acres on Long Island. But now the Jericho farmhouse and the nine acres on which it stands is probably the last large holding still owned by a family member, said Harry Macy, the editor of the Manhattan-based New York Genealogical and Biographical Record.
Mr. Macy is himself an Underhill; his great-great-grandmother was sister to Mr. Mitchell's great-great-grandfather.
According to George Underhill of Louisville, Ky., who is president of the Underhill Society, which collects and preserves family archives, members of the Underhill family live all over the world. But few still reside on Long Island.
And their numbers are dwindling. Margaret Young Underhill, the widow of Henry Willets Underhill, who once owned a 200-acre farm on Jericho Turnpike just west of Route 107, died in February 1998 at the age of 85. She still owned a family homestead on 14 acres, which has since been purchased by neighbors.
In March, Mr. Mitchell's aunt, Phebe Smith, died at the age of 92. Both women are buried in the cemetery of the Jericho Friends Meeting House on Old Jericho Turnpike, where Mr. Mitchell and his mother still attend Sunday services.
The meeting house, built in 1788, is another throwback to rural times, a green oasis surrounded by highways and office buildings. In its cemetery are buried members of many of Long Island's distinguished Quaker families -- the Underhills, Jacksons, Seamans and Woodnuts to name a few.
The Underhills were active in the underground railroad that assisted escaped slaves to freedom and now the family's history has become part of the argument being made for the preservation of 81 acres on Jericho Turnpike, once owned by Henry Willets Underhill.
The Tilles Investment Companies of Woodbury, which purchased the parcel in 1981, is in contract to sell it to the Holiday Organization of Westbury. Holiday wants to develop it as 270 detached homes, but litigation by local groups against the Town of Oyster Bay for approving the project has so far stopped development.
The site has been designated a critical groundwater recharge area, and there are efforts under way to purchase it with public funds so it can be preserved.
Proponents say that the land's place in Long Island's history is as significant as its environmental qualities.
"It is just so extraordinary that this land was owned by the same family for over 200 years," said Denward W. Collins Jr., the president of the Nassau County Historical Society.

HEADLINE: Vacant Schools Now Shelter the Elderly

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
CHURCH schools once built to serve the children of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre are now often empty. But they are finding new use as housing for the elderly. The diocese is in the midst of a program to provide low-income apartments for senior citizens, Long Island's fastest-growing age group, in vacant schools and other church buildings.
The program, administered by Catholic Charities and financed under Federal and state programs and by the church, rents one-bedroom apartments for as little as $100 a month, and provides tenants with social and health services. There are long waiting lists for finished complexes, and new housing on the way. 
 "We took a look at parish properties and saw so many schools that were no longer used as schools and were just sitting there," said Paul A. Chedda, the director of housing for Catholic Charities. "So we thought, why don't we take some of these parish properties and rehab them?"
The program extends the useful life of diocesan facilities and parochial school buildings built during the 1940's and 50's to accommodate a surge in young Catholic families. School enrollment peaked in the 1960's, church officials said, and then began to decline steadily. In the 1980's, when the diocese regionalized Catholic education on Long Island, many schools closed.
Officials of Catholic Charities said the housing program, which is open to all the elderly and not only Roman Catholics or Long Island residents, provides living quarters for people who are no longer able to maintain private homes or are priced out of the Long Island housing market.
In some instances, where renovation of vacant buildings is not practical, buildings will be torn down to make way for apartments for the elderly.
Even before apartments are available, Mr. Chedda said, hundreds are on waiting lists. Under guidelines set by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, tenants must be 62 or older and have annual incomes of under $25,650 for one person or $29,300 for two.
Mr. Chedda said most applicants had no difficulty meeting the income requirements. "They laugh and say they don't even make half those amounts," he said. Under H.U.D. regulations, tenants pay no more than one-third of their monthly income in rent.
Mr. Chedda said a typical tenant was a widow in her 70's, from a community near the complex and with relatives on Long Island or in the metropolitan area.
At St. Hedwig's Gardens in Floral Park, one of three housing complexes now using parish properties, Catholic Charities renovated a vacant school to create a 27-unit complex that is fully occupied with a one-year waiting list.
The complex, dedicated in September, was financed in part by the New York State Housing Trust Fund and by the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits program.
"They are so grateful," said James Verity, referring to the residents of St. Hedwig's. A pastoral care-giver for diocesan housing for the elderly, Mr. Verity said, "They say they never dreamed they would live in a place like this at this stage of their lives. Where else could they go?"
"We are just scratching the surface here," said Mr. Verity, who is 73. "So many others are being forced into poverty. I don't know what to call some of the places they are forced into. It's a terrible way to go out when you've been a productive citizen."
Catholic Charities is beginning construction of a 100-unit low-income senior housing complex in Brentwood to be called St. Anne's Gardens, using the same state and Federal financing sources at St. Hedwig's. Unlike St. Hedwig's, the project entails knocking down a vacant parish school on the five acres where the complex will be situated. Monthly rents will be $475 to $550 for one-bedroom apartments. The complex is set to be completed in the summer of 2000.
In another example of how the housing program uses vacant land, Catholic Charities purchased a parking lot from St. Martha's Parish in Uniondale as the site for a 45-unit residence for the low-income elderly. The 75-unit Bishop Ryan Village in Hampton Bays, which has a waiting list of 200 people, is on land Catholic Charities bought from St. Rosalie's Parish.
Mr. Chedda, a lawyer with with a business background, said Catholic Charities was able to purchase vacant land and surplus buildings from Catholic parishes for less than market value. He said three other projects for the elderly were also planned, and that Catholic Charities was continuing to survey parish properties for more housing.
Housing experts say that public opposition to low-income housing for the elderly had declined in recent years on Long Island.
"I can remember 12 years ago there was resistance to senior citizen housing," said Jim Morgo, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership in Hauppauge. "Now they are much more accepted and much better designed."
The partnership, a private group with support from Long Island businesses that specializes in affordable housing for first-time buyers, is also involved in housing projects for the elderly.
The group arranged financing two years ago for Rivoli House, a 112-unit rental complex for the low-income elderly at the site of the old Rivoli Theater in the Village of Hempstead.
Another project for which the group arranged financing, Broadway West in Brentwood, will provide 72 units for the elderly, with rents ranging from $500 to $690.
Mr. Morgo said his organization also offered counseling on reverse mortgages that helped the elderly who were "house-rich but cash-poor" convert home equity into monthly income that allowed them to remain at home.
Experts said Long Island demographics make it clear that much more housing for the elderly will be needed.
A study by the Suffolk County Department of Planning based on census figures showed that the number of Nassau residents aged 65 or older increased from 80,847 in 1960 to 187,725 in 1996. For the same period, the increase in Suffolk was from 56,814 to 148,193. In Suffolk, the number of people aged 75 or older leaped from 18,005 in 1960 to 65,220 in 1996.
Peter K. Lambert, a senior planner in the department, said the median age continues on a "slow and steady increase" on Long Island, rising up from 30.8 in 1960 to 36.6 in 1990 in Nassau and from 30 to 33.5 over the same period in Suffolk.
The Catholic Charities program to provide low-income housing for the elderly appears to surpass efforts by other religious groups.
The Rev. Thomas W. Goodhue, the executive director of the Long Island Council of Churches, an association of Protestant churches, said many congregations took part in the Habitat for Humanity program, in which they helped construct low-cost housing. But he said he knew of no organized effort among other religious groups similar to the Catholic Charities program.
Rabbi Bruce Ginsburg, the president of the Long Island Board of Rabbis, said enrollment patterns for Jewish religious schools were "just the opposite" of those for Catholic schools. "The schools don't have enough space and are bringing in temporary structures," he said.
Rabbi Ginsburg said that while he was not aware of any housing projects for the elderly by Long Island synagogues, his own synagogue, Congregation Sons of Israel in Woodmere, had considered a project on synagogue property. He said the plan was dropped because the parcel was too small.
"I can't speak in terms of what the Jewish community is doing as a whole, but this is certainly something we have thought of," said Rabbi Ginsburg. "It seems to me all the way around it would be a benefit if there is land or a building that can be used for this purpose."
And at least one municipality is getting involved with converting an empty church-owned school. In Garden City, St. Paul's, a preparatory school formerly operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island was bought by the Village of Garden City for $7.25 million in 1992 after it was closed by the diocese.
The village is now negotiating a long-term lease with a company that wants to convert the 500-room building into an assisted care facility for senior citizens.

HEADLINE: First-Time 'Customs,' Not Cookie-Cutters

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: CHINO HILLS, Calif.

 BODY:
THE home-buying experience of Kevin and Danniele Flora in this community 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles may be a bellwether of current trends in home building, especially in the first-time home-buyer market.
Mr. Flora, 30, is an account executive for a computer company, and his wife, 28, is an account executive for a clothing manufacturer. In August 1998 they committed to buying a house, their first, in Ridgeview, a subdivision of more-or-less conventional single-family homes. 
 What was unconventional was the degree of control that the young home buyers exercised over the design of the house and such things as types of floors and fixtures, which in new construction is usually given only to buyers of more-expensive move-up housing. The Floras paid about $230,990 for a house with 2,141 square feet of space.
Before the house was built, the couple selected one of about a dozen floor plans, with an extra-large kitchen and master bedroom, all included in the basic package priced at $220,990. But because the Floras opted for such things as a brick-and-vinyl facade and special bathroom fixtures not included in the options, they had to pay an extra $10,000.
The Floras were even encouraged to visit the home under construction, and were given a camera to document its progress by the home builder, Kaufman & Broad Greater Los Angeles Division, a unit of Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, both based in Los Angeles.
"We added our own touches," said Mr. Flora. "It felt almost like a total custom home." The couple moved into the house last November.
The Floras' experience in buying a home in the Ridgeview development exemplifies the strategy Kaufman & Broad has been pursuing in the last four years to maintain a hold on the first-time-buyer market.
THAT strategy is driven, in large part, by consumer-preference surveys, conducted among buyers of both new and used homes in each of the company's 16 market areas. Such surveys are common in many industries, but not in home building, according to Bruce Karatz, the company's president and chief executive.
While the company builds homes in several price ranges, Kaufman & Broad is particularly interested in following the tastes of the youngest segment of buyers aged 24 to 34, which it calls "baby zoomers." The name hints at the professional ambition, fast-growing income and high material expectations of many people in that age group.
The surveys found a desire for greater choice among first-time buyers.
With the current strong economy and low unemployment "people don't feel boxed in, they have lots of choices," Mr. Karatz explained.
Home buyers "want it their way," added Jeffrey Charney, the company's senior vice president of marketing. "They don't want a cookie-cutter house," he said.
The surveys also showed that many buyers value practicality over display, according to Glen Barnard, a senior vice president who is regional general manager of the company's Denver office.
"This generation may be less interested in glitz and more interested in functionality," he said. The current generation, he added, are "more utilitarian than other generations."
That trend corresponds to a "back-to-the-basics" theme in both car design and volume-discount retailing, according to Mr. Barnard.
One response to the desire for choice was to offer up to 12 floor plans, each of which allows further permutations. Previously, Kaufman & Broad offered two or three floor plans.
SOME buyers opt for nontraditional features not often found in tract housing, such as media centers, sleeping lofts, Jacuzzi bathtubs, or kitchen islands.
In general, the surveys revealed that buyers in the 24-to-34 age group were interested in buying enough space for growing families, and something more luxurious than the traditional image of a starter home.
The most sought-after amenity, it turned out, was size, according to Mr. Barnard. "In every market that we have surveyed, the single most important factor, beyond just being able to buy a house, is getting the most square footage for the money," he said.
That trend, he observed, is a "reversal from the 80's when people wanted upscale amenities," such as cathedral ceilings, bay windows, marble-floor entries, chandeliers and other symbols of affluence.
Maximizing space was a deciding factor for Benjamin Jackson, 30, an emergency-response social worker, and his 30-year-old wife, Charlotte, a tax auditor for the State of California.
Although the Jacksons, who have two children, had originally looked at existing houses near their place of work in neighboring Orange County, "I was looking for as much space as I could possibly get for the money," said Mr. Jackson, who said he liked to retreat to "a little corner of the house" after stressful days at work. "This space allows me to do that," he added.
The three most important places to add space in developments like Ridgeview with larger than usual starter homes, according to Mr. Barnard, are kitchens, master bedrooms and storage areas, particularly closets.
OFTEN, home buyers are willing to "trade off" or live without other home features to maximize the size of those amenities, Mr. Barnard said.
If necessary, buyers are often willing to accept smaller garages or lesser number of bathrooms. They will settle for smaller living rooms, or for consolidating the dining room and living room into a single "great room."
Buyers also have a choice of facades. "If somebody is an achiever and wants his or her house to make a statement, we've got the elevation that allows them to do that," Mr. Barnard said. On the other hand, he added, if people with "inner-directed values and lifestyle prefer that a house does not make a statement, we've got that, too."
Even without the surveys, Kaufman & Broad executives sensed that current home buyers were often experienced consumers and wanted to make home buying more of what Mr. Karatz calls "a retail experience."
To emphasize that "retail experience," Kaufman & Broad has created large showrooms, sometimes as large as 20,000 square feet, in most of its major markets, where prospective home buyers can select fixtures, paint colors and such things as carpets, tile, cabinet styles, bathtubs and fireplaces for their future houses.
The showrooms are intended to make home buying into something more like shopping, to make buyers feel more comfortable, more "in control" during the often intimidating process of making a six-figure purchase.
"I want to take the mystery and anxiety out the home purchase," Mr. Karatz said.
The Floras, for example, opted for a carpet with extra padding to extend the life of the carpet, as well as tile, ceiling fans, his-and-her bathroom sinks and windows for the garage door.
 For Mr. Karatz, the good reception of Kaufman & Broad's recent developments may augur some changes for the home-building industry away from the cookie-cutter sameness that has typified American home building since Levittown.
"This is not the assembly line," he said. "We are going to build 22,000 homes this year, one at a time."

HEADLINE: Flounder Are Down, But Who's at Fault?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SINCE Colonial times, winter flounder have generally been so plentiful in Niantic Bay that an angler could quickly fill the bottom of a small boat with the odd-looking but popular flatfish.
But since the 1970's the catches have been noticeably dwindling, and some environmentalists blame it on the Northeast Utilities nuclear plants at Millstone Point, on the east shore of the bay, which suck in millions of gallons of water each minute -- and many billions of fish larvae over the years -- in the process of cooling the reactors. 
 "I've been fishing in Niantic Bay since I was 10, and back then we used to fill bushel baskets with flounder," said Martin T. O'Rourke of Willimantic who was recently fishing in the bay. "Now, you're lucky if you catch three if you stay out all day."
Late last month, Judge Robert Hale of Connecticut Superior Court in Hartford agreed that the environmentalists might have a case.
Despite the impending approval of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Millstone 2 could restart after sitting idle for three years because of safety problems, the judge ordered that the plant wait until after the flounder spawning season had ended.
Though the judge has since lifted the injunction, critics of the power plants said that the eight days that Millstone 2 remained shut down because of the judge's order has created ripples that will spread out from Niantic Bay and around the world.
"It's an issue that is still in its infancy, but it will continue, and grow," said William N. Smith, executive director of the Long Island-based Fish Unlimited, one of the organizations that filed suit against Millstone. "You can already see signs that the nuclear industry in general is watching this fight very closely. They realize how vulnerable they are, that this is something they're going to have to deal with. This is their Achilles' heel."
Nancy Burton, the Redding, lawyer who argued the case for the environmentalists in court, said that the preliminary court order barring the restart of the plant would encourage environmental groups to take action against other industries anywhere in the world that kill fish through large cooling water intakes.
"For eight days, Millstone 2 was shut down for the sake of winter flounder larvae," Ms. Burton said. "That is unprecedented in the history of nuclear power in this country, and was an absolutely amazing victory by itself."
Already, she said, officials from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency are talking about putting stiffer standards in place for industrial cooling water intakes to prevent fish larvae from being killed. "This is now an issue we've put on the front burner for environmental groups around the country," Ms. Burton said.
Northeast Utilities had fought to bring the plant back on line after a long shutdown for safety issues. The company estimates that each month the 880-megawatt reactor is out of service costs it $20 million. The company said it was now preparing the plant for the weeks-long restart process.
Joseph T. Pillittere, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, said the company was considering installing a system that would return to the bay adult fish caught on the intake screens, and it would continue the environmental monitoring program that has provided state fisheries experts with what they call some of their most comprehensive data on a specific winter flounder population.
"We want to become the best, whether that has to do with operations or the environment," Mr. Pillittere said. He also said it was the company's contention that overfishing of adult flounder, not the destruction of larvae, had been the greatest contributor to the decline in the fish population. He said it was also important to recognize that the nuclear plants allow the state to avoid the use of oil- or coal-burning plants. "If we didn't have nuclear, we'd have to be using fossil fuels, and that has its own associated environmental effect, in terms of air emissions."
Anglers agreed that the flounder population in Niantic Bay is in trouble.
Arnold F. Costello of Waterford, who was putting his boat into the water last weekend, said the problem affected all species.
"I used to catch 8- and 10-pound weakfish in the river, and 30- or 40-pound striped bass between the bridges," Mr. Costello said "The last time I caught a weakfish was probably 30 years ago. My grandson here, he probably doesn't even know what a weakfish looks like."
But anglers seem split over the cause of the decline.
"We've seen commercial boats dragging in eight feet of water right in the bay," Mr. Costello said. "They do at least as much damage as Millstone, but no one is trying to shut them down."
Wayne H. Maheu, who owns a summer house in Niantic, said he never believed the plant could cause such problems either, until he saw some of the statistics on fish mortality that came out during the lawsuit.
"Then you start to wonder -- could it be true?" Mr. Maheu said.
Joseph B. Young of Meriden, as he prepared his boat for a day on the water, said it was easy to blame overfishing or Millstone, but a look around the bay shows a lot of residential development, so there are also issues such as sewage runoff and sedimentation that could be affecting the fish population.
"The fact is, everyone wants air-conditioning and all kinds of appliances -- where do they think all that electricity is going to come from?" Mr. Young said. "I think there's a lot more than Millstone affecting the fish, but even if it was Millstone, we can't shut it down."
The state's Department of Environmental Protection estimates there are no more than 7,200 adult flounder in the bay now, down from more than 60,000 in 1991.
And it's undisputed that Millstone 2, which draws in 2 million gallons of cooling water from the bay every minute it is in operation, kills a lot of flounder larvae: 514 million in 1992, the worst year, and 87 million last year, according to the utilities' own environmental reports. About 5 billion larvae were killed from 1986-96, and billions other species were also killed, according to the reports.
Penelope T. Howell, a senior state fisheries biologist, said those larvae represent an average of 12 percent of the larvae population per year. But she said one could not correlate that to a 12 percent decrease in adult fish.
"There's the issue of compensation, which means the ones that are left have a greater chance for survival because there is less competition for the food that is there," Ms. Howell said. "It's not a nice, clear-cut situation."
Ms. Howell says Millstone is just one of the factors causing the Niantic Bay flounder population to collapse, and is not even the major factor. But she said that if Millstone 2 stopped killing larvae, the flounder population would recover faster if other factors, such as overfishing, were also addressed.
The judge's injunction came as a result of a lawsuit filed on March 11 by four environmental groups, three of them from Long Island and one from Connecticut, and the New York Assemblyman, Representative Fred Thiele of Sag Harbor, Long Island. The suit claimed that Millstone 2 was responsible for decimating the flounder population in Niantic Bay.
Mr. Thiele said he believed Connecticut anglers and even regulators might be trying to balance the environmental impacts with the benefits of having a large taxpayer and employer along the coast.
"My sense is that this is an economic issue for Connecticut residents," Mr. Thiele said. "Those plants, that industry, is such a large part of the economy, it tempers any environmental considerations."
Mr. Thiele said he has been a strong supporter of efforts to clean up Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. He said the five towns on the north shore of Eastern Long Island have spent $40 million in the last 20 years preserving open space.
"That's why the issue of Millstone is so maddening for us," Mr. Thiele said. "At the time the government is spending so much money and there is real progress being made, we have reports of radiation in the sediment and fish kills off Millstone. I think people involved in environmental issues see Millstone as the biggest threat to Long Island Sound today."
The plant had already been shut down for nearly three years when the groups filed the suit. On April 27, Judge Hale agreed it should remain shut down until June 15, after the spawning season. Two days after that order, the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the plant was safe enough to be put back into operation, pending the outcome of the environmental case.
Less than 24 hours after testimony in the court case ended on May 6, the judge ruled that overfishing is a more likely cause of the fish decline and lifted the injunction against starting the plant.
"This is a temporary setback, but it's definitely not the end of this battle," Mr. Smith said.
Ms. Burton, the lawyer for the four groups, said she hoped the appeals court would decide that the judge relied too heavily on the company expert witnesses, who worked at the Millstone environmental lab. Her own expert witness, a fisheries biologist from Rhode Island, estimated that 60 percent of the flounder mortality in the bay is the result of the Millstone nuclear power plants.
In fact, the latest survey by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute showed that flounder populations along most of the coast have increased because of state and Federal fishing restrictions, she said.
When Northeast Utilities was issued a permit for Millstone 2 in 1970, the company estimated an impact of no more than 6 percent on the flounder population, she said.
"Their best numbers show the impact has been at least twice that," Ms. Burton said. "This permit was based on seriously flawed predictions. Maybe we would have said no to the plant back then if we knew how many fish it was going to kill. Or maybe we would have required a closed cooling system."
A closed system uses a tower to cool water from the plant, rather than continuously drawing cooling water from the bay and discharging the heated water back into Long Island Sound. The company's experts testified during the trial that such a system would be feasible, and would cost about $100 million.
"It's a small victory that the judge says a closed system would be desirable, but he says that's up to the licensing authority," Ms. Burton said. "Unfortunately, those kind of license changes will take years to accomplish."

HEADLINE: Long Beach, Young Again;
Once an Elegant Resort, Then a Family Haven, Now on a Quiet Comeback

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH

 BODY:
PAUL MISTRETTA and Priscilla Cipollini were veterans of the Long Beach single life when they happened to buy mirror-image condominiums along the boardwalk with facing terraces. One thing led to another, and last June they got married.
Now the couple -- he's 35, she's 37 -- has just moved into a spacious new $375,000 home in Long Beach built in a style that the developer describes as Victorian Colonial. It has four bedrooms, a fireplace and a view of Reynolds Channel, which is named for William H. Reynolds, who developed Long Beach as a planned community, starting in 1906. 
 To Mr. Mistretta and Ms. Cipollini, Long Beach is Long Island's best-kept secret, a city that has made a quiet but impressive comeback after years of decline. They say they never seriously considered buying anywhere else because Long Beach provided everything they wanted: a wide, beautiful and well-maintained beach within walking distance, a community of health-conscious people and a growing selection of appealing restaurants.
Ms. Cipollini, a buyer for Macy's, can also walk to the train station in the center of town and be in her Manhattan office in about an hour. Her husband, a computer technician, works for Chase Manhattan Bank in Garden City.
Their new neighbors -- some of whom live in houses on the channel that cost $500,000 or more -- are other professionals who also discovered the attractions of Long Beach as renters. "Long Beach probably has the reputation for not being as nice as it is," Ms. Cipollini said, "but we all know different."
Ms. Cipollini and her husband are part of a trend that is setting Long Beach apart from the rest of Nassau County. Built on a narrow barrier island separated from the Long Island "mainland" by three bridges, this city of 35,000 is getting younger just as the county is growing older. Between 1980 and 1990, as the proportion of residents over 65 rose by nearly 4 percent countywide (from 10.6 percent to 14.2 percent), the elderly population of Long Beach declined by almost 3 percent (from 21.5 percent to 18.6 percent).
And there are indications that the trend is continuing. More strollers are being pushed along the two-mile boardwalk, the number of children participating in city-sponsored recreational programs has more than tripled since 1990 and a new skateboard park is expected to open next month. Increasing numbers of young singles are moving to the lower-priced West End.
Newcomers say there are several factors that make Long Beach special: Its beach is the equal of any in the Hamptons and yet the city is affordable, unpretentious and an easy commute from New York. Unlike its neighbors to either side, Atlantic Beach and Lido Beach, Long Beach is easy to get around on foot or by local bus.
Angelica Pulvirenti moved from Greenwich Village to Long Beach 15 months ago but has yet to buy a car. "It's not like living in the suburbs," said Ms. Pulvirenti, a pastry chef at Lespinasse, a Manhattan restaurant. "I didn't feel I was going to be stranded."
Long Beach is never going to be the elegant resort it was in the 1920's, when people got dressed up to stroll on the boardwalk. A lot of the retail stores are on the shabby side and most of the retirement homes and other high-rises built smack up against the boardwalk (in the only Long Island community that allows such beachfront construction) are unlikely to win awards for architectural distinction.
But signs of the city's resurgence are everywhere. A Starbucks has just opened near City Hall, not far from the new library. There is a new $8 million public recreation area near the fishing pier at Reynolds Channel, where children can play roller hockey outdoors. A new private health club, where an annual membership costs nearly $1,000, has sprung up in place of a long-shuttered supermarket. The crumbling bulkhead along the bay is undergoing repairs, and trees and flowers are sprouting on the median dividing Park Avenue, the city's main shopping street. And in a year or so, a small rundown movie theater that opened in 1923 is expected to make way for a new theater with seven screens.
A decade ago, Steven Guasco opened the first upscale restaurant on Park Avenue. "I had it nice," Mr. Guasco said recently. "I was the only kid on the block." These days, Stevens Pasta Specialties has competition from a half-dozen or so establishments. Among them are several new Japanese restaurants and a place called Prashanthi that bills itself as Indian, vegetarian and kosher. The owner, Shanker Chapa, said he hopes certification from a rabbi will bring in customers from among the city's sizable Orthodox Jewish population.
Housing prices are keeping pace. A luxury three-bedroom apartment on the boardwalk in the Avalon Towers rents for as much as $3,800 a month, and a one-bedroom can fetch $2,000, said Anthony Chiaravalloti, the owner of Coldwell Banker Beach West Realty.
Large oceanfront condos are selling for as much as $500,000, up from about $350,000 five years ago, said Marilyn Topper, the owner of Topper Realty Corporation. In general, said Richard B. Nunziata, the manager of Century 21 Petrey, "Housing prices have gone up about 20 percent in the last five years, most of it within the past year."
William McCaffrey, who moved from Queens to a well-appointed condo facing the ocean after he retired from the insurance business, said his friends were dubious about his decision.
"They have it in the back of their mind that it's a bad area," he said. "But it has certainly cleaned itself up and is on its way back."
In most places, changes like these would be small beer, but they are remarkable in this city, which was known for years as a nest of political corruption and a dumping ground for discharged mental patients and people on welfare, who took up residence in dilapidated rooming houses and hotels that had once welcomed vacationers. Edwin L. Eaton, the former City Manager, said that about 2,000 people who had been released from mental hospitals under the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970's -- about 80 percent of the total number on Long Island -- were living here. But their numbers dwindled after city officials got the state to close many of the substandard adult-care homes where they were housed. Today, the city has about 225 former mental patients living in two adult homes, Mr. Eaton said.
By 1975, property values had declined so precipitously and the city was being so badly managed that Long Beach nearly went bankrupt and city workers had to accept promissory notes in lieu of paychecks.
With new construction and renovation going on all over town, Bruce Nyman, the new City Manager, recently announced that for the first time in six years, the city no longer had a deficit and would not have to raise taxes in the coming fiscal year, which begins in July, to meet its $38 million budget. Mr. Nyman said the taxable value of the city's real estate had increased by $3.6 million since last year, raising the total assessed valuation to $195.4 million.
Mr. Nyman took office in March, replacing Mr. Eaton, who played a major role in the city's transformation, a process that was slowed by the recession that began in the late 1980's. In a city notorious for its turnover in city managers -- there were eight of them in the 1970's alone -- Mr. Eaton spent a record 20 years on the job. During that time, the city demolished 2,300 substandard apartments and private developers built 1,853 new housing units, he said. He said that Long Beach also had 398 units of public housing, more per capita than any other community on Long Island.
Although he has just moved into City Hall, Mr. Nyman, 48, is not exactly a new face. He was raised in Long Beach and had represented the city's district in the County Legislature (and the Board of Supervisors, which preceded it) since 1986, rising to minority leader before accepting the municipal post.
Mr. Nyman has a vision for his city that harks back to the 1950's, when middle-class Jewish families like his were drawn to Long Beach because of its excellent schools. Here, in this compact city only three and a half miles long, they found a version of suburbia where kids could go to the movies or the bowling alley without being chauffeured by their parents.
In the years after World War II, families from New York would move to Long Beach for the summer because of the easy commute to Manhattan. But as air-conditioning became more prevalent, people no longer saw the need to escape for an entire season, and other vacation destinations, including the Hamptons, pushed Long Beach aside.
Now, Mr. Nyman said, the city is experiencing a rebirth, with young people moving in again just as they did in the '50's. "We are becoming a different community," he said.
Different, yes, but not quite a throwback to the 50's. For one thing, the Long Beach schools are no longer considered among the best in the state, let alone the nation. For another, much of the development that followed the postwar influx is now seen as a mistake. Long Beach, said Mr. Nyman, "would be paradise if we didn't have that Chinese wall of apartments" on the beach.
Mr. Nyman said the city needed to spend millions to repair or rebuild the city's aging streets and fix its storm and sewer systems and water mains.
Some residents voiced complaints about the lackluster shopping district, where stores close before many commuters get home; the absence of amenities on the boardwalk, and the competition for parking spaces during the summer, when the population grows by about 15,000. This summer, residents will be able to rent lockers under the boardwalk for the first time as an incentive to leave their cars at home, Mr. Nyman said.
City officials boast about the city's low retail vacancy rate, but four storefronts near the Waldbaum's supermarket on Park Avenue have stood empty for several years, throwing a cloud over the shopping strip, which is near the center of town.
The new movie theater is expected to swell pedestrian traffic on Park Avenue, to the delight of merchants down the street like Ted Milan, who sells hand-rolled bagels and smoked salmon at his newly opened Max Bialystok. But the multiplex will be a modest community theater, said Michael G. Zapson, the former president of the City Council, and is not likely to raise the profile of Park Avenue's retail district.
"The downtown will never be a thriving retail community," said Mr. Zapson, who won a special election on May 4 to replace Mr. Nyman in the county Legislature. "It's a mom-and-pop kind of community."
Residents say few people from other parts of Long Island will cross a bridge to shop in Long Beach unless their destination is Mimi's Bags, a 40-year-old store that carries alligator purses costing $1,000. Mr. Eaton said national retailers have told him that they would rather be on a major thoroughfare and visible to thousands of drivers each day.
It is also uncertain whether Mr. Nyman and other city leaders can fulfill their goal of bringing Long Beach its first hotel in several decades. Last year, officials unveiled an ambitious plan to develop an empty site next to the boardwalk known as the superblock. The proposal, which called for an outdoor amphitheater and a hotel, did not go anywhere. Mr. Nyman is hopeful it can eventually be revived, but others are not as optimistic.
"The superblock is still high on the list of possibilities," said City Councilman Joel Crystal, who grew up in Long Beach along with his brother, the entertainer Billy Crystal. "But I'm willing to look at Plan B, whatever that might be."
The superblock plan also included an upscale assisted-living center for the elderly, but some longtime residents say Long Beach already has enough services for the aged, including a new extended-care center under construction next to City Hall. "I'd love to see a bowling alley come back into town," said Ms. Topper, the real estate broker.
While the superblock proposal languishes, Arnold Gumowitz, a developer, said he had asked the city to allow him to upgrade his drab luncheonette, the only sit-down restaurant on the boardwalk, and add a clam bar. But Francesca M. Capitano, a former City Council member -- and a Republican in a Democratic stronghold -- said more needs to be done to enable Long Beach to catch up with other resort communities. "There's still very little to do in the boardwalk area," Ms. Capitano said. "It remains underutilized."
More development on the boardwalk would make sense, city residents say, because Long Beach attracts thousands of day-trippers during the summer. The boardwalk is open to all, and to descend to the beach costs $5 for the day. Visitors from Manhattan can buy a $12 pass that includes a round-trip train ticket and admission to the beach. A family membership costs $50 for the season ($65 for nonresidents).
If Long Beach is going to entice more of these visitors to become permanent residents, it will have to improve the image of its public school system. The diverse student population is one-third black and Hispanic (including 2 percent who are non-English-speaking when they arrive), and many people have a negative impression of the schools even though students at the elementary and middle-school level do comparatively well on state reading and math tests.
Donna H. Fielding, president of the Parent-Teachers Association at the Lindell School, an elementary school, said the harshest assessments usually come from people who are looking at the schools from the outside.
"People who have children in the schools seem to feel that the schools are very good," she said, "even though there tends to be a perception sometimes that they're not."
Among the younger people in Long Beach who share that perception are Marcy and Andrew Cohen, both 32 and lawyers who practice in Jericho. They like living in a community they describe as a "private haven" but expect to buy a home somewhere else before their 1-year-old daughter, Jenna, is ready to go to school. "If the schools were significantly better," Mr. Cohen said, "we would consider staying here."

HEADLINE: The State, Quite Contently, Goes Minor League

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
MINOR league baseball, once on the verge of extinction, is booming around the country, and nowhere is its resurgence more evident than in Connecticut.
The state, which last month lost out in its attempt to bring the New England Patriots football team to Hartford, had only one minor league baseball team in 1993. But since then, one after another, teams have moved to the state, taking over old stadiums or building new ones. Today, five teams play in Bridgeport, New Britain, New Haven, Norwich, and Waterbury. 
 The state, aware of the advantages that minor league baseball can bring to a community, has invested millions of dollars for new ball parks. Indeed, of the $10.5 million needed to construct Dodd Stadium for the Norwich Navigators, $6 million came from the state, while another $1.5 million was granted by the Connecticut Development Authority. Another $500,000 to help cover the cost of sky boxes was donated by the Mashantucket Pequots, whose casino is in nearby Ledyard. The state also invested $8 million toward New Britain Stadium, whose overall cost was around $10 million. Of the $17 million spent to build The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, the city contributed $7 million.
James Abromaitis, the commissioner of the State Economic and Community Development Department, said the state money is being well spent.
"It's hard to quantify exactly how much a community derives from the teams and the stadiums," he said. "But in most cases, almost all of the materials, including concession items, are purchased locally. And all of the signage on the outfield fences is usually bought by local area businesses. Then there are all the jobs created. Plus there's the feel-good aspect that is generated in the towns which have minor league teams in the state."
That's certainly the case in Bridgeport, where the Bluefish last year drew 305,123 fans to Harbor Yard, the striking new ball park that is between I-95 and Bridgeport Harbor. That was the highest attendance of any team in the state. The team has been such a success that Bridgeport officials hope that the Bluefish and its stadium will be the catalyst of a billion-dollar redevelopment project along the city waterfront.
"You drive along I-95 on game nights and you can't miss seeing the ball park and knowing that something is happening in Bridgeport," Mr. Abromaitis said.
This year the Bluefish, of the independent Atlantic Baseball League, are off to a strong start, drawing capacity crowds of more than 5,000 to their first two home games.
In New Haven, the Ravens, after spending their first five seasons as the Class AA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies of the National League, have switched their affiliation to the Seattle Mariners after drawing fewer fans at Yale Field than in either of their first four seasons.
To the east, the Norwich Navigators, a farm club of the New York Yankees, have a popular former New York Mets' outfielder, Lee Mazzilli of Greenwich, as their new manager.
In Waterbury, the Spirit will begin their third season on May 28 in a new league after having spent their first two years in the Northeast League, which is now the eastern division of the Northern League.
Bob Wirz, the president of the Spirit, said he hopes his team will be playing in a new stadium by 2001. The Naugatuck Valley Development Corporation has begun feasibility studies for a new ball park on a site where the Rogers Spoon factory once stood.
"Ultimately a new stadium will be needed for the Spirit," said Mr. Wirz, who owns a sports public relations and marketing business in Seymour. "New ball parks, as has been demonstrated in Bridgeport, Norwich and New Britain, make a big difference in drawing fans."
But all those teams are rookies compared to the baseball organization in New Britain, which has fielded teams in the area for 27 years. Although baseball will continue in New Britain, the man who has kept the game in the area as other teams around the state disappeared has said this season will probably be his last.
On an early evening in late April, Joe Buzas, the owner of the New Britain Rock Cats, greeted old friends as they entered the New Britain Stadium for that night's gamewith the Portland Sea Dogs.
"Hi, kid," Mr. Buzas, wearing a Rock Cats cap, called out to a middle-aged man who is a regular at the four-year old ball park in Willow Brook Park.
Many of the fans know that Mr. Buzas may sell the team, after owning Eastern League farm teams of the Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins in Bristol and New Britain since 1973. "A lot of them have been saying to me, 'You're not going to sell, are you, Joe?' " Mr. Buzas said. "And I tell them, I really don't want to because I love it here, but it looks like I will. I know they're very grateful that I kept a team in New Britain despite some difficult times."
Perhaps the worst time was in 1994 when he rebuffed an effort by the Red Sox management to move the New Britain Red Sox to Springfield, Mass. As a result, he lost the franchise, and found himself without a team until he reached an agreement with the Minnesota Twins, who placed their Class AA team in New Britain the next season.
Now, after 17 years in New Britain -- to which he had moved the Red Sox from Muzzy Field in Bristol -- Mr. Buzas has agreed to sell his team to a group of investors headed by Coleman B. Levy, a New Britain native who is a partner in a Farmington law firm, and William F. Dowling, a Manhattan lawyer who was an executive with the New York Yankees in the 1980's.
"It's a done deal as far as I'm concerned," said Mr. Buzas, who has done everything from waiting on customers at concession stands to helping get the field ready for play.
"They've given me a $100,000 deposit and have until Oct. 1 to pay the rest of the $7.5 million price that we agreed on," he said. "These are very respectable people and I don't see any problems developing."
Before winding up in New Britain, Mr. Buzas moved the franchise, a Red Sox affiliate until 1995, from Allentown to York and then Reading in Pennsylvania, to Pittsfield, Mass., and Pawtucket, R.I. Since he became a club owner in the 1950's, Mr. Buzas has had, as he puts it, "88 baseball operations" in 18 different cities, while running as many as four teams in four different leagues at the same time. And Mr. Buzas has even played the game, appearing in 30 games for the New York Yankees in 1945 -- including a start at shortstop on opening day at Yankee Stadium -- and spent about a decade in the minor leagues.
He is proud that in all his years as an owner he "made money in every single town.". That is particularly remarkable because the minor leagues reached their nadir during the 1970's and early 80's when scores of teams, and leagues, folded across the country, mainly because of the proliferation of televised baseball.
Indeed, from 1987 until the New Haven Ravens began play in 1994, New Britain was the only minor league team in the state after teams in West Haven and Waterbury had folded.
"I've succeeded because I've always been a hands-on owner, with good people around me," said Mr. Buzas, who, for the last decade, also has owned the Salt Lake City Buzz of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.
Even with his dedication to the New Britain team, attendance has been chronically poor. Even though the Rock Cats won the Northern Division championship in the 10-team Eastern League last year -- many of the teams's players are now starters for the parent Minnesota Twins -- the Rock Cats drew a league-low 181,643 spectators to 6,146-seat New Britain Stadium. Crowds averaged 2,000 a game. At that, it was a team attendance record in New Britain. By comparison, the Norwich Navigators and New Haven Ravens, who finished fourth and fifth (last) in the Northern Division, attracted more fans -- 243,817 and 197,342, respectively. And the Ravens' attendance was the team's lowest since the franchise was founded in 1994.
"The team has done lousy in attendance, but we think we known how to market it better," said Mr. Levy of West Hartford, a partner in the Farmington law firm of Levy and Droney. "For one thing, we feel that, apart from the baseball, we have to provide more entertainment and enthusiasm at the ball park. Also, we view it as a Hartford area team and want to expand the fan base. After all, there are about a million people living within 20 minutes of the stadium."
Mr. Levy has no experience in professional baseball, but Mr. Dowling does. From 1986 through 1988, he was the general counsel and a vice president with the New York Yankees. After his three years with the Yankees, Mr. Dowling was a part owner of the Spartanburg, S.C., club in the South Atlantic League for several seasons.
"We have the opportunity to exploit a gorgeous ball park," Mr. Dowling said, "and with good promotion and marketing I'm sure we'll do well."
Mr. Dowling, who like Mr. Levy has been a lifelong baseball fan, will be the team's chief executive. "Even though I'll continue with our law firm in Manhattan, I'll spend two or three days at the ball park," said Mr. Dowling, who is a native of Holyoke, Mass. "It's not often in life that you get the chance to do something you've dreamt of doing, and I'm going to get that chance."

Let's Make A Deal

BYLINE: By KIRSTY SUCATO 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
WHEN state officials hired Anthony R. Coscia, a 29-year-old lawyer who had never been to Trenton, to run the State Economic Development Authority in 1991, they did not have much to lose.
The independent agency, whose mission is to stimulate jobs and development by doling out low-interest loans and technical advice to businesses, had bottomed out. The recession was in full swing. Banks were reeling from bad debt and Congress had just overhauled the tax code, reining in a major lure to investors: tax-exempt development bonds. Even as the state's failing economy needed its help the most, the E.D.A. slumped. Its lending had dropped from about $500 million in 1986 to $95 million. 
 Mr. Coscia, a corporate finance lawyer known for his experience as a consultant to troubled financial institutions, was idealistic enough to think he could transform the agency. To everyone's surprise, he did.
"It was a unique mixture of self-confidence and naivete," said Christopher J. Paladino, president of the New Brunswick Development Corporation and deputy director of the E.D.A. from 1991 to 1994. "No one dared tell him that he shouldn't be able to accomplish it."
During the eight years of Mr. Coscia's tenure, the E.D.A. has become one of the most aggressive nonprofit development agencies in the country. Last year it lent $786 million to 258 projects. It has helped finance the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark; a 600,000-square-foot aerospace manufacturing complex in Camden now owned by Martin Marietta, and the Technology Center of New Jersey, a research park in North Brunswick designed to lure high-technology businesses to the state.
Mr. Coscia's tenure, spanning two administrations, has taken him from unpaid consultant to executive director to volunteer chairman, appointed by Gov. James Florio as the first non-Cabinet member to hold the post. Governor Whitman thought enough of his abilities to keep him on in 1994.
Gualberto Medina, Mrs. Whitman's Commerce Secretary, said he intended to fire Mr. Coscia, and take the influential job himself, but changed his mind after meeting him.
"The tendency is basically to replace key people with your own people," he said. "But Tony transcends party politics because he brings a technical know-how, a passion and commitment to the economic growth of the state that frankly defies political affiliation."
Words like vision, dedication, and savvy pop up frequently when insiders talk about Mr. Coscia, a partner in the law firm of Windels, Marx, Davies & Ives, in a pattern that seems almost too good to be true. For his part, he describes himself as a dull family man who loves to put together deals.
That family -- his wife, Alice, and their five children, ages 3 to 11 -- lives in North Caldwell, where Mr. Coscia coaches his 7-year-old son's Little League baseball team and takes the clan to church on Sundays.
"I'm sure if you ask any of my neighbors, they have no idea what I do for a living because I don't even bring it up," he said.
For the record, Mr. Coscia is not active in local politics. He doesn't have any particular hobbies (he says he is terrible at golf). And he doesn't drive a flashy car -- he has a 1991 Acura Legend).
He's simply a man who gets his kicks putting together complicated financial transactions to improve the New Jersey economy.
The Economic Development Agency's turnaround began in 1991 when Mr. Coscia began operating it like a bank, rather than a state agency. He imposed stiffer financial reporting requirements on applicants, fired and reorganized staff and developed new financing programs to lure Wall Street investors.
"Some of the things that you could put in place to clean up the agency's financial situation internally as well the image it would project externally were relatively easy things to accomplish," he said. "But they were never really done up to that point because it never really pictured itself as what it was, which was like a bank."
He instituted a program that bundled loans for small businesses in $50,000 packages, and sold them to large investors. To entice banks battered by bad credit into lending to small and mid-sized businesses, the agency began to guarantee portions of commercial loans and to finance gaps in project costs at lower interest rates, something the E.D.A. had not been done before.
"The E.D.A. used to be a place that would take what money it had and lend it to a company and hope they'd get it back," Mr. Paladino said. "Tony made it a place where he took that dollar and got the private sector to match it with four or five or six dollars."
Douglas L. Kennedy, the president and C.E.O. of Fleet Bank-N.J., said Mr. Coscia was widely respected as an expert in structured financing. Fleet recently agreed to lend $25 million to high-tech companies in the state as part of a larger E.D.A. program.
The Trenton-based agency has 105 employees and is self-supporting, generating its $10 million annual operating budget through returns on investments. (It started in 1974 on a $200,000 state loan.) Its basic mission is to leverage state and Federal dollars into investments that will help companies to expand or move to New Jersey.
In one large project, the Camden E-Center, the agency combined $25 million in state, county and Federal aid to buy a 15-acre vacant industrial lot on the Camden waterfront. It leased the property to Blockbuster, Sony Music and Pace Entertainment, which spent $31 million to build a 25,000-seat amphitheater for concerts and sports events there. The E-Center, which opened in 1995, will return about $23 million to the city and investors over 30 years from a surcharge on ticket prices. It employs 500 people, mostly Camden residents.
Some lawmakers have criticized E.D.A. programs, saying they venture too far into the realm of corporate welfare. Last year, State House Democrats fiercely protested a plan to give A.T.&T. an $8 million incentive grant to open a research laboratory in Monmouth County. Under the plan, the company agreed to create 1,500 jobs. But in a separate move, it announced that it would lay off about 3,500 workers at other sites.
Senator Richard J. Codey, the minority leader, introduced a resolution, still in committee, that would require a net job growth before the E.D.A. could award employment incentive grants to companies.
"A company is not supposed to get a grant if it creates 100 jobs in one location in New Jersey but eliminates 500 positions in another part of the state," Senator Codey said. "Business incentives should be used as bargaining chips to build employment in New Jersey. Commerce officials seem eager to throw a stack of chips at any company that comes calling for them."
Mr. Coscia, who was raised in Paterson as the son of an immigrant cement mason and a seamstress, takes pains to point out that most of the agency's money goes to companies with fewer than 200 employees, with priority going to urban centers and businesses owned by minorities and women.
He points to successes like Eatem Corporation, a Vineland-based company that manufactures soup bases and other food. It has expanded from three men working out of a small cheese factory to 65 employees in an 41,500-square-foot factory. The E.D.A. has backed four loans to the company over the past 10 years worth about $6.8 million.
The agency has increasingly focused on technology companies. In 1997, it approved a $1.3 million grant over 10 years to lure Datek Online Brokerage Services Corporation, then a four-year-old Internet trading company, a division of Datek Securities Corporation, from Manhattan to Iselin.
The company, which started with 30 employees, now has 468 workers; it expects to hire another 700 over the next two years with the help of another $2.5 million grant.
Mr. Coscia says he plans to stay on as chairman for as long as he is needed.
"He has had the opportunity to be creative in areas where people 10 and 15 years his senior usually get to be creative," said Mr. Paladino. "He's gotten to break new ground normally broken by people with gray hair. The only downside now is that people expect him to do it every day."
 
For Rent: 50 Acres of High-Tech Space
IT has been a common complaint among high-tech companies thinking of moving to New Jersey: The state may be known as the pharmaceutical capital of the world, but it has no decent laboratory space for rent.
That is finally beginning to change, thanks to a $35 million project by the State Economic Development Authority to convert an old Johnson & Johnson laboratory and administration building in North Brunswick to a research park.
The 50-acre campus, called the Technology Center of New Jersey, will eventually have five buildings with a total of 300,000 square feet of laboratory space. The project, now about half complete, has already achieved 80 percent occupancy with seven tenants, including Merial Limited, a global company that does research on animal health and poultry genetics, and Celgro, a subsidiary of the biotechnology company Celgene Corporation, which develops herbicides and pesticides.
The companies are neither tiny start-ups that attract venture capitalists nor established corporations that can afford to build their own laboratories, said Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the State Economic Development Authority. Rather, he said, they fall in a middle ground that is less compelling to investors.
"The idea is that if you go back to E.D.A.'s fundamental mission, which is to be a bank to bridge the gaps, we found that even though the economy was strong, we were still lacking in capital for expansion," he said.
The agency financed the project largely through a $22.2 million loan from the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Building Investment Trust, a pension fund that invests in commercial real estate development. The remainder came from state grants, E.D.A. loans and rent paid by tenants, Mr. Coscia said.
John W. Jackson, the chairman and C.E.O. of the Celgene Corporation, said he was attracted by economic incentives including a grant program that offered $100 a square foot for new equipment.
"By getting the funding from the E.D.A., it made it a very simple decision to stay in New Jersey," he said.
Other tenants include Advanced Care Products, which develops over-the-counter hygiene products; Datamark Software Inc., a marketing firm; the Agriculture Research Project of Rutgers University's Cook College, which coordinates the research activities of 37 labs across the country, and Chubb Computer Systems, which provides training and consulting for information systems.
James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Public Planning and Policy, called the park an example of the intelligent re-use of a site.
"It would have had a 'for rent' sign on it and it might have been another discount mall rather than an area of any economic activity," he said. KIRSTY SUCATO

HEADLINE: ON THE MAP;
A Street Chess Club Goes to College

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
In the game room of the Paul Robeson Student Center at Rutgers University's Newark campus, a cacophony of rap music and the clicking and clacking of Ping-Pong and billiard balls ricochets over the bowed heads of the Downtown Chess Club. But what distraction could a few student activities be after you've played chess outdoors on a winter night?
The club had been shooed from its first home, under the awning of the old Bamberger's on Halsey Street. Two years ago, when work on their next location, Military Park, threatened them with another eviction, campus officials invited them indoors to the Robeson Center. The club has since joined the United States Chess Federation,and its members provide competition for the Rutgers-Newark Chess Club. 
 The Downtown president, Ause Dye, 52, a contractor who lives in Newark's South Ward, recently talked about the club.
Q. How did the club start?
A. The Downtown Chess Club is a gathering of street chess players, who started out playing on Halsey Street and Market in downtown Newark. When I first met these guys they were for the most part unemployed older guys. They were interested in chess, but didn't have a formal club setting or any place to play.
Q. Why "Downtown?"
A. Playing downtown was a key ingredient because, for me, for a lot of the other guys, it was an ambassadorship. You come, you play, you see the guys out there. You don't have to be afraid of the citizens of Newark. It's not about carjacking, it's not about mugging or robbing. You know, you sit down to play chess, the first thing you have to do is give me enough respect to understand I have some type of intelligence. And if we can play this game, we can communicate with each other. People have said how safe they felt in working late knowing that we were playing in the park, till 10:30 or 11 at night in the summer.
Q. How did you start playing chess?
A. I've been messing around with chess for about 10 years, on and off. It was in the basement of a coffeehouse, the Presbyterian Church on West Market and Roseville, in the late 60's, early 70's. I used to go to New York, to the New York Chess and Checker Club on 42d Street, right off Eighth Avenue. There was one elderly gentleman who taught me how to play for time and coffee.
I disappeared from chess for a couple years, then I started again at the Driftwood Lounge on Fourth Avenue in East Orange. It was just a bar where a lot of guys got together and played chess. The Peppermint Lounge was like that, that's Orange, Central Avenue. And there's another little place on Springfield Avenue in Newark called Mercedes & Main, where they play chess.
Q. What do you hope the club achieves?
A. Given a formal environment, we're looking to see a lot of productivity. We're looking to see a lot of Bobby Fischers and Maurice Ashley potentials coming out of the woodwork. You give them something to sink their teeth into young. Chess may not be the way they should go, but it will be a venue to help them get where they're going the right way. STEVE STRUNSKY

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Impersonating The Insiders: Yes, It Pays

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week.
E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DO they or don't they? Do corporate insiders -- like company directors and officers -- know so much more than we do about their company's prospects that we can beat the market simply by imitating their purchases and sales?
Opinion varies widely on this question, partly because researchers themselves have changed their minds. The initial answers came more than 30 years ago, in several academic studies that found that investors could beat the market simply by buying the stocks that insiders were buying. Particularly compelling was the fact that unlike some other strategies, this one was so easy to pursue. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires insiders to report their purchases and sales, and several investment newsletters translate that data into investor-friendly formats. 
 The strategy was the conventional wisdom for many years. But serious doubts were raised in the 1980's, when researchers found that the insiders of small-capitalization companies were more likely to buy their companies' shares than were the insiders of larger companies. And they found that insiders of value-oriented companies -- defined as those trading at the lowest price-to-book ratios -- were more likely to buy than those of growth-oriented companies.
That research placed the earlier studies in a very different light. It meant that those landmark studies from the 1960's might have discovered little more than the long-term tendency for small-cap stocks to outperform large-cap stocks, and for value stocks to outperform growth stocks. The upshot of the newer research was that if your portfolio was already concentrated in small-cap value stocks, you gained no advantage from paying attention to insiders.
That new consensus also lasted for some years. But it, too, has come under fire, as a number of researchers have looked into whether the patterns have endured.
In fact, they have found several wrinkles.
One study, circulating as a working paper, was conducted by Leslie Jeng, an associate professor of finance and economics at Boston University, and Andrew Metrick and Richard Zeckhauser, an associate professor of economics and a professor of political economy, respectively, at Harvard. In effect, they have found that the studies from the 1960's were on to something after all. Though the impact of insider buying and selling is strongest among small-cap value stocks, they found that it nonetheless exists among large-cap growth stocks, too.
The professors reached their conclusion by examining every stock insiders bought from 1975 to 1996. A hypothetical portfolio that held each of these stocks for one year, and in the amounts bought by the insiders, would have outperformed the market by 7.4 percentage points annually, before transaction costs. The study found that only one-third of this outperformance could be explained by the disproportionate propensity of insiders at small-cap and value-oriented companies to buy their companies' stocks. That means that even investors in large-cap growth stocks can bolster returns by following the insiders' lead, though not as much as with small-cap value stocks.
FORTUNATELY, you don't even have to react immediately upon learning of an insider's buying. True, such a stock most likely will have already risen by the time the insider's purchase is reported publicly. But the professors, looking at the amount by which such a stock beat the market over the next year, found that two-thirds of the outperformance came after the first month. In other words, you needn't be a day trader to benefit from the strategy.
Still, the professors found that stocks sold by insiders performed no better or worse, on average, than the overall market. That makes sense, because insiders have many reasons for raising cash. But there is just one primary reason insiders buy their company's stock: They think it will go up.
More companies have been lending money to insiders to buy their shares, prompting suggestions that the insider-imitation strategy could become less profitable. But these loan programs have gained steam only in the last two years, after the period in the study, so their effect is not yet known.

A Rent Battle That Arose When Reagan Was President

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
In the sometimes Dickensian world of New York litigation, how long does it take to settle a case? Ask Peter and Alexandra Rose, who have been fighting with their landlord over their rent for 15 years. And it's not over yet.
Flashback: it's 1975. Abraham D. Beame is Mayor, Gerald R. Ford is President. Mr. and Mrs. Rose sign a lease for an apartment on East 58th Street that is subject to the city's rent-stabilization laws. The previous tenant, a commercial one, is the First National City Bank, as Citibank was then called. 
 Flash forward to 1984. The Roses have long been suspicious that they had been overcharged by their landlord. The overcharges are continuing, they say, because under their lease, the periodic rent increases are premised upon the previous rent. The couple file a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
After many stops and starts -- the agency apparently misplaced their paperwork, so that they had to file again in 1986, before the original paperwork was then found -- Mr. and Mrs. Rose won their case. The landlord asked for reconsideration; the Roses won again. Then the landlord filed an appeal. That was in 1989.
Flash forward again, to November 1998. Like a bear lumbering to life after nearly a decade's hibernation, the Department of Housing and Community Renewal renders its decision. It reversed the previous orders and raised Mr. and Mrs. Rose's rent retroactively, rendering them liable for "something like $18,000 in back rent," said Rose Ann Magaldi, their attorney.
Ms. Magaldi has brought a proceeding in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to overturn the procedure used by the state to reach its findings. Her legal arguments involve issues such as "applicable base dates" for rent determinations and the appropriateness of using commercial rents in determining residential rents.
The state and the landlord, Blair House, have submitted papers supporting the increase, which Stuart F. Shaw, a lawyer for Blair House, called "reasonable and rational." Acting Justice Jane S. Solomon is expected to rule within a few weeks.
In the meantime, Mr. Rose, an art dealer, and his wife, a photo researcher, remain liable for the higher rents. They say they will suffer extreme hardship if the rent increase is upheld. "There's a $300 to $400 a month difference," with the new rent pegged at more than $2,000, Mr. Rose said, not to mention the arrears, which he laid to the state's delay.
So why did the state take so long to decide this case? A reasonable question, but an answer is unlikely at the moment. "We do not comment on matters in litigation," said Diane Ackerman, a spokeswoman for the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: Now, Before You Go Cruising You Must Do Some Choosing

BYLINE: By JIM McCRAW 

 BODY:
JUST five years ago, if you wanted a cruiser motorcycle you bought a Harley. End of story.
But that was before cruisers became an American phenomenon. Come summer, highways and parking lots from coast to coast will be buzzing with these machines designed for easy long-distance travel and characterized by their roomy saddles and upright, relaxed riding positions. 
 Cruisers now represent 55 percent of the American motorcycle market, according to Don Brown of DJB Associates, a consulting firm in Irvine, Calif., up from 10 percent in 1991. He estimates that cruiser sales grew 17 percent last year, to 154,000. He expects sales to top 180,000 next year.
Cruiser motorcycles offer their buyers -- many of them baby boomers -- freedom from their cars, and also individuality, adventure and fellowship with other riders. Beneficiaries of increased disposable income in a booming economy, cruisers offer an alternative to adult toys like sports cars or boats. They are more maneuverable than heavy touring bikes and more comfortable than agile sport bikes.
There are more cruisers for sale this spring than ever before. Not only is Harley-Davidson working on new models -- it already has 24 on the market -- but all four Japanese manufacturers have invested heavily in cruisers and the Europeans aren't far behind. There are also two new American manufacturers, Excelsior-Henderson and Polaris.
Harley-Davidson's share of the American cruiser market may have slipped -- to about 55 percent from 100 percent in half a decade -- but it still sets the tone for all cruisers. Harleys have an imposing presence -- visually and aurally -- with their big V-twin engines, big torque, big fenders, big tanks, big saddles for two, small mufflers (the better to keep the noise level high), low seat height (more accommodating for either male or female riders), lustrous paint and chrome and lots of custom accessories.
Harley-Davidson may have had this market to itself for decades, but its tremendous success -- customers routinely have to wait six months for delivery -- convinced other motorcycle companies to jump into the cruiser segment. Here are eight of the leading cruisers on the market this summer:
 
BMW R1200C -- The giant German auto and motorcycle maker introduced its first cruiser last year after going 75 years without one, and it quickly became the company's best-selling motorcycle.
The R1200C uses BMW's traditional horizontally opposed 1,170-cubic-centimeter fuel-injected engine -- the company's largest, most powerful ever. The smallest engine in the senior cruiser group, it produces more than 70 foot-pounds of torque with a five-speed transmission and BMW's time-tested shaft-drive system.
The suspension is unlike most cruisers', with the company's patented Telelever front and Monolever rear suspension instead of conventional forks and swing arms. The R1200C is the most radical-looking cruiser, with its pulled-back handlebars -- nearly chopper style -- a solo saddle with a pillion pad behind it, a simple bar-mounted gauge cluster and more chrome than you'll find on any other BMW. Options include saddle bags, a tank bag and -- unique among cruisers -- anti-lock brakes.
Inside track: The flashiest cruiser.
 
EXCELSIOR-HENDERSON SUPER X -- A combination of two classic American motorcycle brands that went out of production decades ago, the Excelsior-Henderson is built by the Hanlon family and their staff in a new factory in Belle Plaine, Minn.
The Super X has a 1,386 cc 50-degree V-twin engine with overhead cams, four valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection. There is an exposed coil spring leading-link front suspension; the forks go right through the fenders, just like those on the 1931 Excelsior. The fenders are fully valanced -- they cover the tread, and much of the sidewall, of the tires -- another nostalgic touch. The Super X has quiet belt drive instead of chain or shaft drive.
The Super X is pricey -- $18,000 for solid black, more for two-tone versions.
Inside track: Lots of power; great brakes.
 
HARLEY-DAVIDSON ROAD KING -- Of Harley's 24 models, the Road King is the prototypical cruiser. This year, it features the all-new Twin Cam 88, a 45-degree V-twin engine of 88 cubic inches that produces 82 foot-pounds of torque. The engine is mounted indirectly to minimize vibration and is linked to a five-speed transmission and a quiet, reinforced rubber-belt drive system.
Like all Harleys, the Road King makes few concessions to weight reduction; while the Japanese and German bikes are using aluminum, the Harley packs a lot of iron and steel under its paint. Consequently, it weighs 699 pounds on a short 63.5-inch wheelbase.
The Road King can be dressed out with hundreds of Harley-Davidson accessories from windshields and extra driving lamps to saddle bags and chrome dress-up items.
Inside track: The best all-round Harley.
 
HONDA VALKYRIE -- Instead of a V-twin engine, Honda uses the "flat," or horizontally opposed, 1,520 cc six-cylinder engine from the huge Gold Wing touring bike, only with more power and torque. The Valkyrie is the quickest and fastest cruiser you can buy.
For 1999, Honda offers the basic Valkyrie, the dressed-up Valkyrie Tourer and the full-dress Valkyrie Interstate, all using the flat six with six carburetors and more than 100 horsepower. They all have five-speed transmissions, shaft drive and triple-disk brakes.
The dry, or unloaded, weight is 682 pounds. The Honda has a 66.5-inch wheelbase and a relatively tall seat height of 29.1 inches. Valkyries run from $12,799 to $15,999, depending on the model and paint.
Inside track: Tops in power.
 
KAWASAKI DRIFTER 1500 -- The new Drifter is a cruiser designed to look like the venerable Indian Chief last produced in 1953. Its designers chose black paint instead of chrome for its frame, forks, headlamp housing, fender braces and bag mounts -- a decidedly retro thing to do.
The Drifter's 1500 cc V-twin engine has four valves and two spark plugs per cylinder and uses digital electronic fuel injection. There is a counterbalancing shaft and rubber engine mounts for smoothness. The five-speed transmission automatically helps the rider to find neutral and uses shaft drive to transmit power to the rear wheel.
The Drifter weighs 668 pounds, rides on a 65.2-inch wheelbase and has a 29.1-inch seat height. Prices start at $11,499; a lot of accessories are available, including two saddles, a tank trim panel and accessory headlamps.
Inside track: Long on torque and nostalgia.
 
POLARIS VICTORY V92C -- This is the first motorcycle from Polaris, a company famous for its snowmobiles and personal watercraft. Built along very traditional but very clean lines, the deep-fendered Victory uses a 1,507 cc V-twin engine with the cylinders splayed at a 50-degree angle.
It is a single-overhead-cam engine with oil cooling, four valves per cylinder and electronic fuel injection that produces a lot of torque. The Victory uses a five-speed transmission and belt drive, as well as cast aluminum wheels. Unlike most cruisers, the Victory's engine is used as a part of the frame to give the chassis added strength.
Inside track: An excellent first effort.
 
SUZUKI VL1500 INTRUDER -- Suzuki builds V-twin cruisers with the most radical designs, featuring very tall engine cylinders with a narrow V-angle, chopper-style gas tanks and alloy front and rear wheels.
The VL1500 Intruder has a 45-degree V-twin engine like the Harley's, liquid-cooled and tuned for peak torque at very low engine speeds. The engine uses dual-downdraft 36-millimeter carburetors and hydraulic valve adjusters for minimal maintenance. There is also a digital electronic ignition system, a five-speed transmission and maintenenace-free shaft drive. The suggested retail price is $9,899.
Inside track: The four-digit pricing is attractive.
 
YAMAHA ROAD STAR -- This is the most Harley-like of all the Japanese cruisers, and its mechanical formula is simplicity itself. It uses a 1,602 cc 48-degree overhead-valve V-twin engine, the largest in the industry. It has one cam, four valves and two spark plugs per cylinder, and the most torque -- 99 foot-pounds. The single-carburetor engine puts power through a five-speed transmission and Yamaha's first belt-drive system.
The Road Star has a retro instrument cluster with Art Deco graphics, lots of chrome trim and more than 100 accessories from lights to luggage.
Inside track: Awesome torque, Harley looks.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
Wedded To Its Moral Imperatives

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: FALLEN LEAF LAKE, Calif.

 BODY:
HERE amid the snow-covered pines near Lake Tahoe, Patagonia Inc. held its fourth annual weekend training conference last month. In what one participant called a "summer camp for tree-huggers," community organizers in various environmental causes came from far and wide to learn how to be more effective.
David Olsen, chief executive of Patagonia, the trendsetter in specialty outdoor clothing, told the 70 or so participants, "We've invited you here because we want you to raise hell and we support you in raising hell." 
 Known for elegantly simple product design, Patagonia, based in Ventura, Calif., has long practiced environmental responsibility quietly, converting its buildings to wind power, eliminating toxic dyes from its products and making baby clothes from fabric scraps left over from the adult line. But now the privately held company's owners have renounced that reticence. It's their business, and they've decided to use it as their soapbox, as well. "We came out of the closet," said Yvon Chouinard, Patagonia's president and co-founder.
The company's spring catalogue, mailed to 725,000 people worldwide, takes a stand on an issue way beyond the clothing realm: removal of dams in five areas around the country, including the Snake River of Washington. And all six of its board members recently demonstrated to save an ancient redwood forest in Northern California.
In short, Patagonia is risking its brand name and reputation on an unusual brand of corporate philanthropy. Rather than just writing checks to local charities, it is training activists and taking bold positions.
That can alienate customers, of course. Patagonia's latest crusade was criticized as a "biased and misleading diatribe" by Francois X. Forgette, an official of the Tri-City Area Chamber of Commerce in Kennewick, Wash., which could suffer economically if four dams on the lower Snake River were razed. Mr. Forgette called for a boycott of Patagonia and suggested that the company "stick to its knitting."
Mr. Chouinard says it is. He considers environmentalism a fundamental part of the company's image, and when he saw that reputation shifting toward rivals like North Face and R.E.I., he decided to increase company efforts. And this comes even as some of Patagonia's early innovations, like spinning fleece from recycled soda bottles, are being jettisoned by others that had copied them. "Unless Patagonia gets out there and talks about it, they won't be an exemplar," said Chris L. Desser, a Patagonia board member and a recent appointee to the California agency that regulates coastal development. "Most companies are wholly driven by the bottom line, but Patagonia is not going to sacrifice the environment for the bottom line."
Although environmental good deeds would seem to burnish a company's image with many potential customers, donations to environmental causes may not rank very high. Among foundations, grants to such causes make up just 2 percent of all financing, according to the Foundation Center.
There was considerable soul-searching among Patagonia's managers over whether the company should seek to use its environmental ethic as a corporate guide, Mr. Chouinard said. "We don't want to be accused of green marketing" -- trying to profit from the appearance of doing the right thing -- Mr. Chouinard said. But a big change swept in a year ago, after Patagonia commissioned its first customer survey. Executives were appalled to find Patagonia was seen as dead last among outdoor companies considered environmental leaders.
Yet the company's environmentalism may not be helping. The privately heldcompany had sales of $165 million in the fiscal year ended April 1998. It does not report profits, but there are signs that they have been flat. The company donates 1 percent of revenue, or 10 percent of pretax profits, whichever is higher, to local environmental groups, and that figure has held steady at about $1.2 million for the last three years. The company may also have been hurt because it failed to capitalize on two popular sports, indoor rock climbing and snowboarding.
But Mr. Olsen, Patagonia's chief, is unconcerned. "A lot of environmental things we're going to do whether they give us a benefit in the market or not," he said.
One thing the company is committed to is the "tree hugger" camps. The youthful local organizers paid their own way to the three-day event, which cost Patagonia about $60,000. Seasoned organizers shared secrets of fund-raising, marketing and building membership. Their environmental causes ranged from buffalo herds to logging.
Patagonia suppliers are also subject to environmental evangelism, pressed by the company to show ecological gains or risk losing Patagonia's business.
The idea has met with some resistance from suppliers who "thought it wasn't a level playing field," said Rob C. Koeppel, vice president of Shawmut Mills, a division of R. H. Wyner Associates, a maker of laminated fabrics. He said offshore suppliers could more easily show environmental progress because of lower standards.
A private company, though, can afford to pursue moral imperatives since it need not cater to shareholders, an argument Mr. Chouinard said he's heard numerous times.
"I'm absolutely convinced everything we do does benefit the company," Mr. Chouinard said, before leaving for mountain climbing in Tibet. "Most companies give money to the symphony. It's safe. When other companies see nothing bad comes of it," he said of Patagonia's advocacy, "they'll be emboldened. It's not going to come back to bite us."

HEADLINE: At Ivy Club, A Trip Back to Elitism

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
SHOULD the members of the Ivy Club ever face the withering scrutiny of a Fifth Avenue co-op board or a Fairfield County country club, they will be well prepared.
To get into Ivy, the oldest, most expensive and most patrician eating club at Princeton University, candidates must sit for 10 one-on-one interviews with members, whose attempts to plumb their souls touch on what their parents do, where they spend summers and who their friends are. 
 Then the entire century-old club votes on prospects in all-night sessions. Like an English men's club, there is a blackball rule: if one of 130 members vetoes a candidate, he or she is rejected -- "hosed" in the tart campus vernacular.
Lately, more and more students are being hosed who don't fit Ivy's image as a haven for Eastern establishment, Social Register types, what one former member called "a club full of sons and daughters of C.E.O.'s."
At Princeton, where more than 80 percent of juniors and seniors eat meals in one of 11 privately owned clubs on Prospect Avenue, known as "the Street," the eating clubs dominate social life. They determine not only the students' dinner partners but also whom they socialize with on Thursday and Saturday party nights, and in some cases they can imprint a person's identity for life.
A few years ago, in the wake of a widely reported 1990 court decision that forced Princeton's eating clubs to admit women, Ivy became more democratic and socially open. Not only women, but also students of different races and more diverse social backgrounds were welcomed during "bicker," the yearly selection process.
"I remember meetings, open discussions about changing the perception of the club," said Sophie Glenn of Princeton's class of '92, who was one of the first women admitted to Ivy. "It was brought up that it would be in the club's interest to be more diverse, especially in the backgrounds of people, because it was always perceived as a snotty place for rich white kids.
"There was a conscious effort to diversify," she said.
But now the pendulum is swinging back, in part a reflection of an increasingly status-conscious, money-conscious era. The race for credentials and connections like an Ivy membership begins, at least in places like New York and Los Angeles, with selective nursery schools, and is incited by a culture that makes popular heroes out of Wall Street's winners.
Today, Ivy has fewer members from minority groups and public schools than in the early 90's, present and past members say. Atu Darko, a senior who dropped out of Ivy in February, was one of four of nine black members who left the eating club in the last academic year, citing their discomfort. "When I first got there, it was more international, but over the years it became very WASP," said Mr. Darko, who is the son of Ghanaian immigrants and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. "It had to do with the membership's choosing new members. I think less international kids bickered, or less minorities bickered because they felt uncomfortable."
He added: "To get into Ivy you have to know a lot of people. You have to be well liked. You have to have a social background. It's so much social climbing."
As Ivy swings back to what F. Scott Fitzgerald called a "detached and breathlessly aristocratic" club, present and former Princeton students and faculty members are not surprised.
"In a way the Ivy Club is certainly in tune with current trends, if not even ahead of the curve," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton, whose daughter, Kara, was in Ivy. "If you look at American society, in certainly the world Fitzgerald wrote about, we are divided by class. We are sliding back toward a society dominated by a corporate society. I think in our corporate elite, there is a Marie Antoinette complex, and that percolates down to Princeton."
Marshall Heyman, a junior from Bridgewater, N.J., whose mother was congratulated in the supermarket when he got into Ivy, said, "When you got here, you knew it would be academically competitive, but it took a while to learn that it's even more a socially competitive place."
The Ivy Club, where membership costs $5,660 a year, is a three-story brick mansion set behind iron gates. The dining room, billiard room and library are a procession of red leather club chairs, mahogany walls and oil paintings of Fitzgerald-era "lacrosse gentlemen."
Members eat at long tables covered with crisp white linens and set with 19th-century Sheffield silver candelabra, which are lighted even when daylight streams into the windows.
After dinner, the men tend to separate from the women and socialize with drinks in hand, discussing the day's Wall Street Journal, a scene more reminiscent of 30-year-olds at a country club than of college students.
"You might as well train these kids in the mannerisms of the well-to-do because most of them are going to wind up there," Professor Reinhardt said. "They are served food. There are tablecloths. It's very genteel, and I'm not sure what's wrong with that."
The formality can unnerve some not to the manner born. Mr. Heyman said that though he is a product of private schools and professional parents (a lawyer and a doctor), he would have been mortified a year ago at dropping his knife, as he did at dinner the other night. When the knife dropped, he looked into the eyes of his table mates to see if anyone had noticed. No one had. "That would have made me more nervous a year ago," he said, quickly retrieving the knife. "But I'm much better now."
When Nat Zilkha, who grew up in Portland, Me., and went to boarding school at Andover, was accepted by Ivy, his older sister had one piece of advice: "Get a tux." The club sponsors nearly a dozen black-tie parties a year, including one during February's initiation week for new members (which also includes the tradition of passing newcomers naked down a staircase, modified in the 90's to allow women to keep their underwear on).
A woman who dropped out of Ivy last winter, because she felt she was not from a prominent enough background, said the club is full of "people who don't have any concept of money." She did not want to be identified because she felt it would be bad for her social life. Raised in a middle-class family, she felt uneasy being served four-course dinners by a uniformed staff. "If you're not flying off to London on spring weekends, you'll end up feeling left out," she said.
Ivy's current membership of 130 includes Mary Bonner Baker, a daughter of James A. Baker 3d, the former Secretary of State; Moira Forbes, a daughter of Steve Forbes, the Presidential contender, and Mary Firestone, a descendant of the founder of the tire company.
James Q. Griffin, a 1955 Princeton graduate and president of the alumni board that governs Ivy, said that in membership, "I can't see any difference between the way it is now and 50 years ago."
He added: "It's a Jeffersonian democracy, taking the natural aristocracy, as you were. There's no social pyramid."
In essence, cream rises to the top.
He pointed out that interest in joining the club was at an all-time high, and "by that very definition, there is something that seems attractive."
In the latest bicker, 130 sophomores and juniors applied to Ivy, and 67 were accepted. All along the Street, the five clubs that select their members attracted the most sophomore applicants since 1994, and the six eating clubs that accept new members by lottery attracted the fewest since 1994.
The popularity of the bicker clubs frustrates some Princeton administrators, who have never been entirely happy with the system, one that is unlike that at any other Ivy League university. "I think there are problems with selectivity of any kind on the college campus, because selectivity excludes people," said Janina Montero, dean of student life.
But the administration and the clubs, whose relations have swung between hostility and accommodation over the years, are in a period of relative truce in the 90's.
Ivy's popularity seems inseparable from a wider fixation on elite schools, blue-chip addresses and the trappings of upper-class gentility. Alumni in New York in their 40's say that for the first time friends are seeking their help in getting children who are in private secondary schools into Ivy. "It's absurd," said an alumnus who said he was asked to provide references. "Why don't they worry about getting their kid into Princeton first?"
He did not want to be identified because he thought it might spoil the chances for his own high-school-age son to get into Ivy one day.
Collectively, Princeton students are more racially and ethnically diverse than in the past, and as a dress code, the L. L. Bean styles of a generation ago have been replaced by T-shirts, baseball caps and Birkenstocks, a generic geek chic. Ivy, however, is a last bastion of traditional dress and etiquette.
"When you see a movie about Princeton -- proper, WASP, preppy, they dress nice and they are smart and tell you how smart they are -- that's Ivy," said Joe Juliano, a senior, who worked as a bouncer during Ivy parties but is not a member. "Princeton doesn't look like that anymore, but Ivy does."
Still, the question of members' ethnic and economic backgrounds is more complex. The membership seems calculated to be a mix of old-line families, new-money heirs and even a group on financial aid. "Of course, there's still diversity," one Ivy alumnus said. "About 20 percent. They are there to make the other 80 percent show they are democratic and feel more superior."
Ivy members invariably maintain that the club is diverse. "We pick people who are diverse," said Mr. Zilkha, the social chairman. He spoke of members who perform in an a cappella singing group, play the guitar and are active in the arts and drama.
"Exactly," responded Mr. Darko, the student who resigned from Ivy this year. He said the club interpreted diversity to mean members with broad interests, rather than with broad ethnic and economic backgrounds. "Diversity to me means seeing different faces, people with different income brackets and different clothing styles," he added.
Mr. Darko, a senior classics major who won a Fulbright fellowship for study abroad after graduation, said that he did not feel racial bias at Ivy; he simply grew tired of the homogeneity and closed-mindedness. "I couldn't identify with the people in the club," he said. "Everything was the same old same old. Same old music. Same bad beer. The club is not open to change."
"Ivy would never play Motown," he added.
Reared in Manhattan by parents from Ghana -- his mother is a psychotherapist, his father a probation officer -- Mr. Darko said that when Ivy does select blacks, they tend to be from immigrant or foreign families. "Being black to the club means being an international black," he said. "They aren't African-American from New York."
Asked to comment about the high number of black dropouts, Mr. Griffin, the graduate board president, said: "There are plenty of blacks that do feel comfortable. It's just an individual decision. The very fact that the people who dropped out were taken in the first place means what they are implying is not true."
He said the profile of each new class of Ivy members is determined by the undergraduates in the club. Current officers did not respond to repeated requests for comment on their criteria for admission.
"There is no pattern, except the quality of the people is very high," Mr. Griffin said. "The undergraduates have a geometry. Just because they are young doesn't mean the sociology is any less complex."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE/LOWER EAST SIDE;
One Cultural Center Stays, Another to Go

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
Two lower Manhattan cultural centers known for their radically different approaches to City Hall once again found themselves facing divergent fates last week.
For 20 of its 33 years, one center, Charas/El Bohio, an umbrella group of cultural organizations, has been in a former school building at 605 East Ninth Street in the East Village. But last July, the city sold the building to a private developer for $3.15 million. Charas, an outspoken opponent of many city housing and social service policies, was told it would have to leave to make way for an international youth hostel, said a lawyer for Charas, Foster Maer. 
 In papers filed last week in Federal District Court, Charas sought to block the building's sale. It asserted that because Federal money was used to renovate the school, it had to be used as a "public facility."
Charas also accused the city of going ahead with the sale in retaliation for Charas's opposition to city policies.
The Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, also an umbrella group, has been apolitical in the six years since its founding, the center's president, Edgardo Vega Yunque, said last week. Its headquarters, a former school at 107 Suffolk Street on the Lower East Side, was to be auctioned last Thursday.
But, Mr. Vega said, on Monday the Mayor's office called to say the building had been spared.
"We have always been prudent in our approach to the municipal administration," Mr. Vega said. "That has produced an atmosphere of communication.
"Artists have a difficult enough time in a society that doesn't respect what they do," he continued. "So to take on confrontational politics is not a good idea."
Mr. Vega said he hoped the city would transfer the building to the Economic Development Corporation from the Department of Citywide Administrative Services. That would allow it to be sold to someone other than the highest bidder. Mr. Vega said his group hoped to buy the building, appraised at $1,050,000, and had $210,000 for a down payment. ERIC V.

Making a 'To Do' List For the Treasury Handoff

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, was nominated last week to succeed his boss, Robert E. Rubin. When Mr. Summers sits down for the first time at his new desk, he might might find a letter like this from his predecessor.
 
DEAR Larry:
Before you settle in, you might want to run over this list of unfinished business. For all the talk of my having been the best Treasury Secretary of the century (shucks), there remain some explosive problems out there, scattered among the achievements. 
 Let's start on the plus side. I bequeath to you a strong, sound banking and financial system. Most of us in the United States take it for granted these days, but it is nonetheless an absolute prerequisite for taking advantage of the global economy's opportunities and weathering its turbulence. Unless you want us to follow Japan into a deflationary spiral, don't let a credit problem develop on your watch.
I also leave you a close working relationship with Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve. Fed chairmen and Treasury secretaries haven't always gotten along, but you and Alan and I have not only developed a good rapport, we also basically agree on nearly every big issue. On one where we don't -- whether Treasury should cede some of its regulatory authority over banks to the Fed as part of the financial services bill moving through Congress -- you should consider conceding the point, as a signal that your partnership with Alan is more important than a turf fight.
When I took office, we assumed that Federal budget deficits would be with us for a long time. They are gone now, and you will have a key role in determining how we use the surpluses that seem likely to mount rapidly in coming years. If you hold the line and don't allow the surpluses to be squandered, you may even have to begin planning for something that no Treasury Secretary in a century has had to contemplate: Retiring the national debt, possibly within a decade if you believe the rosier projections.
NOW let's turn to a few really complex issues. I've argued for years in favor of keeping the dollar strong. It's always been a tough sell in some quarters -- no doubt Ford, G.M. and Chrysler will come a'knockin' again soon -- and it's not getting any easier, with our trade deficit heading rapidly higher.
If that deficit goes totally out of control, there's going to be pressure from all sides to bring the dollar down. Resist it. The strong-dollar policy has helped dampen inflation and benefited consumers by keeping the prices of imports relatively low, and it has made the United States an attractive place for the rest of the world to invest. And these days, we need price stability and capital inflows a lot more than we need a few extra export sales at the margins.
Then there's the stock market. I have no idea whether it will prove to be a boon or a curse for you. Alan frets over those stratospheric valuations, but even he says they might just turn out to be justified -- if the recent surge in productivity turns out to be lasting. Then again, as Alan said in Chicago earlier this month, no good thing goes on forever. Remember, my trader's instincts are very strong, and they told me to get out of Washington while I was still a hero to the 401(k) brigade.
IF all those matters don't keep you busy enough, there are a few others that could steamroll you if you're not careful. Russia and China come to mind immediately.
You don't have to stretch to come up with nightmare scenarios involving Russia. The good news is that by now, the Russian economy has been reduced to insignificance, so its collapse probably would not drag anyone else down with it. The bad news for you is that the only approach we have to dealing with Russia involves throwing money at Moscow. Doing that in some kind of prudent way without enraging Congress is your responsibility now.
China could be even trickier. No doubt you'll have a deal to bring it into the World Trade Organization within a few months, once the embassy bombing in Yugoslavia has blown over. But selling a deal on Capitol Hill was going to be a tall order before we saw those pictures of our Ambassador, James Sasser, peering through the broken glass in Beijing. It'll be even tougher now.
In the longer run, it's an open question whether China's leadership can continue to encourage development of a market economy without releasing its authoritarian grip on power. The implications for economic development and political stability throughout Asia could be profound.
Larry, it's probably silly for me to run through these issues, since you're smarter than just about anyone in Washington. Congratulations on learning to hide it; nothing irritates Republicans more than a know-it-all Democrat from Harvard. You know how to work the policy and political machinery within the Administration. If you can just learn to smile and tell them what they want to hear on Capitol Hill, you'll do fine.
Never forget that it's now your signature on the dollar bill -- and on that ghastly new 20. I'm going fishing.
 Your friend,
 Bob

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Taking Portfolio Cues From a Magazine's List

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
CAN you get rich investing in the companies that created the wealth of the Forbes 400? Or in those that Fortune magazine lists as America's most admired? You may soon be invited to find out.
Cashing in on the popularity of unit investment trusts, which are similar to mutual funds but hold an unmanaged portfolio of securities for a set period, John Nuveen & Company has bundled into a U.I.T. the stocks on Fortune's annual list of the 10 most admired companies. 
 Not to be outdone, Prudential Securities expects by this summer to begin selling a U.I.T. composed of the 40 publicly traded stocks that are the largest equity holdings of people on Forbes magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
Like many broker-sold U.I.T.'s, these don't come cheap. The Nuveen-Fortune America's Most Admired Companies Portfolio has an up-front sales charge of 1 percent; investors who hold it for its full two-year duration will have an additional 3.5 percent deducted over that time as a deferred sales charge, plus annual operating expenses of 29.25 cents for each $100 invested.
Investors in the Forbes 40 Index Trust will pay 1 percent up front and an additional 1.75 percent deferred sales charge over the one-year term; those who renew at the end of the year will not have to pay another up-front fee, but the 1.75 percent will be deducted every year. There is also an annual trustee's fee of 19 cents for every $100, according to Kenneth Swankie, a Prudential senior vice president. (Sales charges for both trusts are reduced somewhat for purchases over $50,000; the minimum investment is $1,000 for the Nuveen-Fortune trust and $250 for Prudential's Forbes U.I.T.)
In comparison, the average United States diversified stock mutual fund charges 1.42 percent of assets for annual expenses, excluding sales charges, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago. Fees for unmanaged portfolios, like index funds, tend to be far lower.
Most of the trusts' fees go to brokerage firms, but the magazines will also get a portion for the use of their names. Fortune, owned by Time Warner, will receive 10 cents a year for every $100 invested in the Nuveen trust, said Bill Adams, an executive vice president at Nuveen. Forbes Inc. said its cut from Prudential had not been determined.
Defending the fees, Mr. Adams said U.I.T.'s are "a fairly economical way of being able to purchase a basket of securities that pursue a particular strategy."
Nuveen does not offer any back-tested data of the Fortune portfolio in its prospectus. The Forbes U.I.T. prospectus, however, says that a hypothetical portfolio of its stocks -- the Forbes 40 index -- would have had an annual average return of 22.5 percent from January 1989 to December 1998, versus a total return of 19.2 percent for the S.& P.
Executives at the two magazines said they saw no problem with such use of their proprietary lists, noting that publishers like Dow Jones have licensed the use of their names for investment products.
Both trusts include many large-cap highfliers, like Wal-Mart Stores, Microsoft and Dell Computer.
A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., the research firm, said such stocks could be among the most susceptible to a broad market downdraft. But he added that the Forbes trust "directs investment into the more entrepreneurial companies, and over a sustained period that's probably a good thing."
The Fortune U.I.T., he said, is a "much more difficult call." After all, he said, "most stocks at their peak are admired by somebody."

HEADLINE: From Dumping Ground to Destination?;
Staten Island Makes a Bid to Shed Its Outcast Image

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
IN a photo promoting a recent television movie, Mike Logan, a police officer, glowers on the upper deck of the Staten Island ferry, Manhattan behind him. Logan's punishment for punching a politician was reassignment to New York City's southernmost and least dramatic borough. His hope is that if he can navigate the underworld links and possible police corruption involved in a local murder and solve the case, he can get back to Manhattan. He is, as the title of the movie proclaims, "Exiled."
The message is clear. Staten Island is a place apart from the rest of New York City. A place where failures from Manhattan go. A far place vaguely redolent of at least three kinds of rot: police corruption, mob ties and the world's largest pile of trash. 
 A 1998 marketing survey for the Empire State Development Corporation asked New Yorkers to give their reasons for going to Staten Island, if they went at all. At the top of the list? "Visiting friends and relatives." Next was "passing through." ("Because I punched a politician" wasn't mentioned.)
The director of the Columbia Center for Urban Research and Policy, Ester Fuchs, said that because the borough was out of sight for most city residents, it was also out of mind. "The majority of New Yorkers perceive Staten Island the same way New Yorkers perceive Chicago," she said. "They don't."
Staten Islanders themselves have contributed to their isolationist reputation, notably six years ago when they voted 2-1 in a referendum to secede from the city, an effort that failed. But now the borough seems to be showing signs of emerging from its exile.
The Fresh Kills landfill, one of the secession movement's flash points, is scheduled to close on Dec. 31, 2001. And Staten Island has been improving its transportation links to Manhattan. The centerpiece of the borough's efforts to get itself noticed, though, is a half-mile waterfront complex that the Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, has named St. George Station.
Already, most of the financing is in place to refurbish the St. George ferry terminal -- "our front door," as the borough's director of land use, Frank Chaney, calls it -- and flank it with a minor league baseball stadium. Also in the works are the National Lighthouse Center and Museum, and a Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences museum, designed by the avant-garde architect Peter Eisenman, noted for the proposed Holocaust Memorial in Berlin and the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio.
Of course, these developments could falter. But many residents are intrigued by what these plans might bring if they are completed. Will Staten Island finally shed its image as New York's dumping ground and become, in the parlance of urban planners, a destination?
To date, there have been no signs of organized community opposition to any of the St. George Station projects, though residents have expressed concern about traffic jams and parking problems, most recently at a hearing on the baseball stadium at Borough Hall on April 13. And some people are skeptical about whether the complicated project will ever materialize.
The president of the St. George Civic Association, Theo Dorian, said that while he and his organization fully supported the St. George Station project, in the past ambitious development plans have foundered. "The history of positive projects moving forward in St. George demands that an intelligent person be skeptical," Mr. Dorian said. In 1983, he and his family moved from Greenwich Village to St. George. Reading about a proposed revitalization of Staten Island's North Shore waterfront helped persuade them, he said, though the development plans were never realized.
Last week, Mr. Chaney spread the architectural renderings for the remodeling of the ferry terminal on his desk. They showed a building transformed from its current public restroom esthetic to a gracious and light-filled space. Traffic patterns around the building were streamlined and pedestrian access was enhanced by a walkway leading to a curving plaza with a shorefront restaurant. Wide corridors lined with cafes and shops opened on glass walls facing the water, with views of lower Manhattan.
Mr. Chaney smiled. He considered the plan, created by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the designer of the Camden Yards stadium in Baltimore, a vast improvement over the existing building. "I've seen it so many times," he said. "A few tourists get off the boat and trepidatiously wander up a corridor and look at the bus ramps, then turn around and get back on the boat."
The city Department of Transportation estimates that some 19.8 million people -- 1.5 million of them tourists -- take the ferry every year. Mr. Chaney, among others, sees a golden opportunity in the horde. "This is economic development," he said of the terminal renovation. "We want to encourage tourists and city residents to come into the neighborhood and spend money."
Mr. Chaney estimated that the terminal renovation project would cost $75 million to $80 million. Mr. Molinari said the Transportation Department had committed $55 million, and he planned to ask the city for more. Congress, meanwhile, has authorized $20 million for the project. The ferry will continue to operate during the renovation, which is to start this fall and be finished by 2001.
While the ferry terminal is getting its makeover, a 6,500-seat minor league stadium is to go up about a hundred yards to the west. The stadium, also designed by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, will be home to the Class A Staten Island Yankees of the New York-Pennsylvania League. Last year, the city paid $12.75 million for the 52-acre site, a former rail yard that now serves as a municipal parking lot. Beginning this fall, the New York City Economic Development Corporation will spend $29 million to build the stadium, which it will own and manage. Before construction starts, the bulkhead will be repaired and the ground decontaminated, at a cost of $7.6 million.
The franchise is owned by Sandlot Sports, a company held by Stanley and Phyllis Getzler of Manhattan and their son Joshua, and the Sunshine Group, which includes five relatives of George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees. Sandlot Sports owned and managed the Watertown Indians for the last three seasons, but switched to the minor league Yankees last year.
Joshua Getzler, the team's chief operating officer, said the Yankees would play their first two seasons at the College of Staten Island in Willowbrook before moving to the new stadium in 2001. Mr. Getzler said the team sold its 1,000 season tickets on Staten Island in less than two days.
But will other New Yorkers be interested in attending minor league baseball games? Stanley Getzler, a former stockbroker and the team's chairman, said he hoped that the stadium's waterside lights would draw Wall Street workers and others from lower Manhattan to buy a ticket, for $6 to $10, drink a beer and watch the next hot Yankee prospect launch a long ball toward the World Trade Center. The half-hour ferry ride to the refurbished terminal, he said, would be part of the appeal. "I can't help but think that people are going to want to be transported to a minor league game, both literally and figuratively," he said. "Especially after a hard day's work."
As Mr. Molinari sees it, "Each one of these initiatives feeds the other." He remembered pacing nervously at a public event last summer while awaiting word on the lighthouse museum. Staten Island was locked in competition for the museum with seven other sites around the country. The borough's main rival was Mackinaw City on Lake Michigan, whose boosters had a pledge of $1.5 million for the museum from Michigan's Governor, John Engler, who also promised to help raise $20 million more. But Mr. Molinari had lined up $5 million in city and state money to support the Staten Island bid.
The museum's program director, Henry Stephenson, said he expected the first phase of the project -- a lightship, an exhibition space and a restaurant and gift shop -- to open in 2001. But renovating the seven dilapidated historic buildings on the 10-acre site, a former Coast Guard base and lighthouse service depot, will cost an additional $15 million, which has yet to be raised. Five of the buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, and the administration building, which dates to 1869, is also a New York City landmark. Mr. Stephenson said he expected $1.3 million worth of work to stabilize the buildings to begin this week.
Ralph Eshelman, the president of the national steering committee of lighthouse preservation groups that selected Staten Island for the museum, said the historical resonance of the location went a long way toward helping it win, and so did the "visitor potential" of those 19.8 million ferry riders.
The other museum planned for the waterfront couldn't be more different. On a little less than an acre between the ferry terminal and the stadium, the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences wants to build the 150,000-square-foot museum designed by Mr. Eisenman; it would house a permanent exhibit on the history of New York Harbor and environs, with space for rotating shows.
The design calls for five or six levels of overlapping crescent-shaped ramps that wrap around a 10,000-square-foot atrium with a glass wall facing the harbor. The museum would share an entrance plaza with the ferry terminal, and be about the same height. The roof would be a semi-translucent Kevlar skin that would shine against the night sky.
"It will be one of the most interesting postmodern structures that anyone has seen in New York City," said the president of the institute, Michael Botwinick. "The ferry terminal's design will be very clean and appealing, but it won't change peoples' minds about the waterfront visually," he said. "Our project becomes much more the emotional signature of the place."
The building and permanent exhibit are expected to cost $50 million to $55 million, Mr. Botwinick said, and he is shooting for an opening date in 2002 or 2003. But most of the money for the project has yet to be raised. Though the New York State Dormitory Authority has granted the institute permission to issue up to $40 million in bonds, he said, that money will probably be tapped for bridge loans during construction.
Clearly, a fully realized St. George Station has the potential to present Staten Island in a far more welcoming light to tourists and New Yorkers from the other boroughs. But will it move Staten Island politically or psychologically closer to the rest of New York City? Not if the city doesn't close the Fresh Kills Landfill on time, said the president of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce, Lawrence J. DeMaria.
"Any large-scale development plans on Staten Island are going to fail if they don't close the dump," Mr. DeMaria said. "If you think the secession movement was strong the last time, there will be civil disobedience this time."
A Sanitation Department spokeswoman, Paula Young, said: "The city is closing the Staten Island landfill on Dec. 31, 2001. You can take that to the bank." But lawsuits by Brooklyn community groups opposing waste transfer stations in their neighborhoods have slowed the department's plans to ship garbage out of state.
"It would be nice if Staten Island could be known for a baseball stadium instead of the dump," said Dan Mills, the owner of Mills Court Restaurant, which would be across the street from home plate when the ballpark is built. He added, "I'll reserve my cartwheels until I see a hole in the ground for the stadium."
David Goldfarb, a lawyer who has lived in St. George for 26 years, said the borough would have trouble making strides while it remained fixated on shutting down the dump. "Closing the landfill will have to be a huge weight lifted," he said. "We will finally be able to move on to other issues."
The director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, Mitchell Moss, said the fact that there was a dump closing date at all was a sign of how the borough, which often votes Republican, had enjoyed increased clout under the Republican administrations of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Giuliani. "The last three years have been one of those rare political moments when the Governor, the Mayor and the Borough President have all been politically in tune with what Staten Island wants," Mr. Moss said.
Mr. Molinari himself makes much of what he characterizes as his productive relationship with the Governor and the Mayor in obtaining city financing for St. George Station and getting the 1996 state law that set the landfill closing deadline passed. But, he said in an interview, "I am concerned about how this borough will be treated in the post-Giuliani era."
City Councilman Jerome X. O'Donovan, a Democrat from the North Shore, who is considering a run for borough president when Mr. Molinari's term runs out in 2001, said a Democratic lineup would be just as good. "Just as Guy Molinari touts his relationship with a Republican Mayor," he said, in principle "the same thing applies to a Democratic mayor and Democratic borough president."
Mr. O'Donovan said he supported city financing for the stadium, the lighthouse museum and the ferry terminal renovation. He expressed reservations, however, about the siting of the arts and science institute museum. He said it might cheaper to use two vacant buildings at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center two miles away in West Brighton.
Both Republicans and Democrats on Staten Island agree that a major issue in the borough's evolving relationship with the rest of New York City is transportation. Staten Island has no subways, and its commuters have long complained about inadequate public transit. But there have been some recent improvements. The elimination in 1997 of the 50-cent ferry fare and the introduction of the Metrocard, with its free transfers, has reduced the daily off-island round-trip to $3 from $6.50 for many Staten Islanders. The borough's transportation director, Dan Jacobs, said this probably accounted for much of the 2.4 million increase in ferry ridership the following year.
But the fare reduction also hastened the demise of two private ferry lines, Fast Ferry and New York Waterway, that offered commuters speedy service between St. George and midtown Manhattan. The service, which charged $9 per round trip, with cheaper monthly rates, and sold upscale coffee, was popular. Yet both companies dropped it in 1997, after about a fifth of their riders returned to mass transit. The president of Fast Ferry, John Koenig, said his company might reinstitute a daily run during the morning and evening rush hours.
More ferry service arrived last December when the Department of Transportation started a Monday-to-Friday midnight ferry on a trial basis. Staten Islanders, who were tired of rushing from restaurants and concerts to catch the 11:30 P.M. boat to avoid waiting for an hour at Whitehall Terminal, flocked to the midnight ferry, and the service has been extended to at least Labor Day.
But the head of the St. George Civic Association's Staten Island Ferry Rider's Committee, Tamara Coombs, said, "If Staten Island is going to truly be part of New York City, we have to be connected with half-hour ferry service all night long."
South Shore commuters had been advocating more and better express bus service for years. This spring, the Transit Authority replaced 180 old city buses with roomier and more comfortable coaches, and it plans to soon add a high-occupancy-vehicle lane to the median strip on a long stretch of the Staten Island Expressway, which should make the commute to Manhattan quicker.
Mr. Moss of N.Y.U. sees the expanded express bus service as a sign of deepening economic ties between Staten Island and Manhattan. "The express buses used to go only to lower Manhattan," he said, "but now when you walk on Fifth Avenue you can see express buses to Staten Island."
Mike Azzara, who has been a columnist and reporter for The Staten Island Advance, the borough's daily newspaper, for 26 of the past 36 years, said he thought Staten Islanders didn't complain any more than other New Yorkers about how City Hall neglected them.
But Mr. Azzara said that when a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1990 led to the abolition of the Board of Estimate, transferring power from the borough presidents to the mayor and the City Council, "there was a feeling that Staten Island's voice in government would be lost." Mr. Azzara said many in the largely suburban borough felt it would suffer because of its relatively small population, which was approximately 407,000 in 1998, according to the city.
That remains a concern. Mr. Molinari still keeps a brass plate on his desk that reads: "We may not secede, but by God we will fight." But generally, the antagonism has been muted over the past six years as many Staten Islanders seemed to enjoy New York's prosperity and an ongoing honeymoon with Mayor Giuliani, who usually gets standing ovations at the town hall meetings he holds in the borough three times a year.
Tyrone Butler, a deputy commissioner in the Department of Records when David N. Dinkins was Mayor, and a Staten Island resident who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 1994 and 1996 against Susan Molinari, Guy Molinari's daughter, suspects that this contentment does not run deep. "Just watch," he said. "If a Democrat becomes mayor, they'll start pounding the secession drums again."
St. George Station. Better transportation. No more 10,000-ton daily gifts of garbage from the rest of New York City. If Staten Islanders feel they've made real progress on each of these fronts by 2001, some say, those drums may well stay muffled. After all, the borough voted overwhelmingly in 1898 to join a consolidated Greater New York City. So who is to say that if Staten Island becomes less of a place to ignore or pass through, and more of a destination, that sentiment won't return?
The players in the St. George Station complex, at least, are optimistic. "It's exciting," Mr. Botwinick said. "It's the first time in a long time that Staten Island has looked across the harbor and said, 'Hey, look at me!' "

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
A Voice Of Caution In a Chorus Of Gamblers

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Robert E. Rubin went to Washington in 1993 as chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council, the Dow Jones industrial average was under 4,000, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was trading at less than 500 and the Federal budget was $255 billion in the red.
As he leaves as Treasury Secretary, the budget is in surplus. The decline in interest rates as the budget deficit receded has allowed an estimated 19 million mortgages to be refinanced, saving homeowners $23.4 billion, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Some of that money has found its way into the stock market, which has done stupefyingly well. 
 Mr. Rubin isn't uniquely responsible for all these good things, of course. But he will be a tough act to follow. And he couldn't have picked a much better time to cash out.
The bad news is that all good things must end, a fact that worries Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management. Mr. Biggs took time last week to discuss Mr. Rubin's years at the Treasury and the markets he is leaving behind.
 
Q. The sense seems to be that Mr. Rubin would not be leaving Treasury if he wasn't confident the worst of last fall's financial crisis had passed. Do you share that view?
 
A. I am not necessarily convinced Mr. Rubin thinks that things are improving. At a small reception about two weeks ago, Larry Summers, his likely successor, cautioned people against being overly optimistic about global economic recovery. There are a lot of trouble spots, particularly Japan.
 
Q. What do you consider Mr. Rubin's most important contributions to the country?
 
A. We all had the confidence he was a steady hand, that if the markets and the global financial system got in trouble, he knew what to do. He did it with Mexico in 1994 and 1995 and again last summer. He understood markets and had great intuition. The fact that he decided to announce his departure now is because he felt the market was stable.
 
Q. Has this view influenced your investment strategy? Worry about the future doesn't seem to be priced into too many of the world's equity markets just now.
 
A. I am scared but fully invested, and we are hugging our benchmarks because we are scared about the tremendous excesses we see in these markets. There are literally no cheap markets in the world right now.
 
Q. How have you weighted your portfolio?
 
A. We are slightly overweight in equities, underweighted in the United States and Europe but overweighted in the United Kingdom and Japan by about 10 percent in each case. We are overweighted in non-Japan Asia and in the emerging markets.
About 62 or 63 percent of our portfolio is in equities. The remainder is in bonds.
 
Q. Given the performance of Japanese stocks the last decade, how can you say that market is expensive?
 
A. Compared with the United States or Europe, Japan is not expensive. But compared with important market bottoms in the past, it is. Here is a country that is in a depression and its market is selling at 75 times earnings and 2 times book value. In the 1930's, the United States stock market sold at half of book value. So, Japan is not exactly cheap by historical standards.
 
Q. What about the emerging markets?
 
A. Japan, other Asian markets and the emerging markets are coming out of long bear markets. They will be the best place to invest after the next bear market and will be the best places to be in the short run as long as this bull market lasts because they are going to go up more and come down less. But I can't say they're cheap.
The same is true for small- and mid-cap stocks in this country. They are as cheap as they have been in a long time relative to the S. & P. 500, but at about 15 times to 17 times earnings, they are not historically cheap.
 
Q. On what is your worry about a looming selloff based?
 
A. Our economics people are looking for a recovery, but I think the United States is going to lose some momentum, that the Japanese are going sideways at best and that the Germans are bottoming out.
There is still a great deal of overcapacity in the world. I was in Europe last week talking to businessmen and industrialists, and I didn't meet anyone who said economic activity was picking up, either from orders abroad or within Europe itself.
These markets are priced for perfection, and if something bad happens, the market has the potential to go down a great deal.
 
Q. In this environment, what advice would you give to individual investors?
 
A. I would say they should not be deluded by advertisements that suggest any amateur can make money in the stock market.
We are perpetuating a gambling mentality that is similar to the 1920's. I read somewhere recently that 15,000 new Internet trading accounts are being opened every week. That is frightening.

Satisfying an Age-Old Thirst

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
NEARLY half a century ago, on Feb. 21, 1952, the front page of The New York Times hailed a "revolutionary process" for turning sea water into drinkable drops. The process was complicated and expensive, requiring lots of energy to push water through membranes that filtered out salt. Still, the article predicted that desalting would "open vast new reservoirs of fresh water" for use "wherever water is now scarce."
Well, not quite. People drink desalted ocean water in some Caribbean hotels and in big swaths of Saudi Arabia, and local authorities in Santa Barbara, Calif., and Key West, Fla., have toyed with the process at times. But desalting plants do not dot the world's coasts, and water shortages have not been consigned to history. 
 Yet those rosy predictions from 1952 may have only been premature. Years of gradual improvements in membranes, declining energy costs, growing water demand and fears about groundwater contamination are combining to make widespread commercial-scale desalting viable.
"A lot of people spent decades sweating the details of bringing costs down and reliability up, and it's finally paying off," said James D. Birkett, director of the International Desalination Association.
And Arthur L. Goldstein, the chairman of Ionics, a desalting pioneer in Watertown, Mass., has taken to comparing the industry's time line to that of aviation. It took decades from the Wright Brothers' first plane "for airline transportation to become commercial," Mr. Goldstein said.
Sea-water desalting still isn't cheap. Even at the most efficient plants, a thousand gallons of desalted water costs around $2 to produce, twice the typical cost of water pumped from underground aquifers or other freshwater sources.
But in many places, those sources are contaminated, overused or out of reach.
"Desalination is always more expensive than getting water from a lake or river, but those aren't always options," said Larry Pelegrin, vice president of sales for Hydranautics, the Oceanside, Calif.-based membrane technology subsidiary of the Nitto Denko Corporation of Japan.
In many parts of California, for example, the options have narrowed to desalting ocean water or treating waste water, a choice that often brings the local citizenry into the desalting camp, fast. "It's a lot cheaper to treat waste water, and it yields perfectly clean water, but the idea just disgusts people," observed Karen G. Rasmussen, a water industry analyst at Frost & Sullivan, a research firm in San Francisco.
SO ocean desalting is moving to the fore when cities need to shore up water supplies -- and not just coastal cities. "As desalination prices keep going down, it could make economic sense for a desalting plant in California to pipe clean water to inland cities hundreds of miles away," said Robert W. McIlvaine, president of the McIlvaine Company, a research firm in Northbrook, Ill.
Engineering and construction companies, membrane manufacturers and water treatment specialists say they are swamped with requests for information and are increasingly asked to bid on projects.
Lance Johnson, who runs global marketing for the water treatment business of Dow Chemical, called sea-water desalination "one of our biggest growth areas."
Poseidon Resources, based in Stamford, Conn., until recently a wholesale provider of electricity, has sold its power plants to concentrate on providing water, particularly through desalting. "Wholesale power is mature, but this water industry is in its infancy," said Walter Q. Howard, Poseidon's president. And a recent McIlvaine study found desalting to be one of the fastest-growing markets for membrane makers.
The Middle East, Spain and other arid places are eager buyers of desalting plants. Singapore, tired of relying on neighboring Malaysia for its drinking water supply, plans a 36 million-gallon-a-day plant. Even Britain, whose reputation as a dank, wet place ignores large areas on its eastern coast where fresh water is scarce, has a desalting plant under construction.
Not surprisingly, North American corporations want to capitalize on the growth. Hydranautics just relocated an executive to Abu Dhabi, and Zenon Environmental, a water treatment company in Burlington, Ontario, recently set up a subsidiary in the Middle East.
"Desalination is a really healthy global industry that is going to grow at a significant rate," said James W. Hotchkies, a manager of business development for Zenon.
It already has for Osmonics, a membrane and pump company in Minnetonka, Minn. In three years, desalting has quintupled to 10 percent of Osmonics sales, "and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a third of our business," said D. Dean Spatz, the chief executive.
Desalting's prospects in the United States may rest heavily on a closely watched project in Florida, where depletion of ground water threatens vital wetlands. Tampa Bay Water, the water utility serving Tampa, St. Petersburg and New Port Richey, recently hired a consortium led by Poseidon and Stone & Webster to build a plant that will yield 25 million gallons a day, or 10 percent of the area's water usage, at a cost that will average $2 for every 1,000 gallons over 10 years. The plant is scheduled to begin production in 2002.
The consortium will design, build and run the plant for the utility under a single contract, an approach that allows it to make advantageous trade-offs like installing automation equipment to save on operating labor and using more expensive but more efficient pumps. Such combinationswould be impossible if Tampa Bay followed the traditional route of seeking competitive bids for each facet of the plant.
Even the consortium's competitors wish the project well.
"Desalination has never had a lot of public support in the United States," said Fared Salem, the desalination industry manager for the DuPont Company, a major supplier of membranes and a losing bidder on the Tampa project. "But maybe Tampa will cause renewed interest in a technology that can really address the 21st century's water problems."

Of the three main ways to turn salt water into drinkable water on a commercial scale, two depend on special-purpose membranes that have improved and fallen in price in recent years. The third, distillation, requires much more energy than membrane systems do.
 
Electrodialysis
When electric charge is applied, membranes allow ions from dissolved salts to pass through and be carried off in brine, leaving fresh water behind.
 
Reverse Osmosis
When sea water is under high pressure, water molecules, but not salts, pass through membranes and are collected for use, leaving brine behind.

The Bad-Boy Voice of Wall St.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
JONATHAN HOENIG, the 23-year-old founder of Capitalist Pig L.L.C., has just finished broadcasting his morning radio financial report for WNEW, a modern rock FM station in New York, and already he is showing why he is a hit with the MTV generation.
"Don't you just love Maria Bartiromo?" he says, eyeing the CNBC anchor on his television set while taking a drag on a Lucky Strike cigarette at his makeshift broadcast studio in downtown Chicago. "I love what she represents: sexy finance." 
 That's the way he sells young people on investing. For him, it's hard-core. It's sexy. And it's entertaining, or should be. That is precisely why he once booked an exotic dancer on his radio show: sort of Howard Stern meets Louis Rukeyser.
"We had a stripper on with a mutual fund manager to talk about her needs," he said over lunch the other day. "He put her into a short-term bond fund."
Outrageous? Sure. But just a few short years after he began broadcasting a financial program called "Capitalist Pig" on Northwestern University's radio station, Mr. Hoenig has burst onto the scene as a journalist, financial commentator and author of "Greed Is Good," an investment guide for people under 35, to be published later this month by Harper Business.
He was named one of the top 30 financial journalists under 30 by TJFR, a newsletter for public relations professionals. He made the cover of Institutional Investor. ("It's Personal Finance, Dude!" blared the headline.) He is also a regular contributor to P.O.V. magazine and is a financial commentator on "Market Place," the public radio program.
It was bound to happen. Wall Street is hot. Financial programs are multiplying like rabbits and even Grandma is pointing and clicking on E*Trade. So why not the rise of a young man with slick hair and raging blue eyes who finds a way to worship Michael R. Milken and Hugh Hefner in the same breath as Malcolm X?
"This is not a hard sell," Mr. Hoenig says of his Capitalist Pig media operation, which now consists of a monthly newsletter, Capitalist Pig Report; T-shirts; a Web site; syndicated columns; television and radio programming, and even his mom's pig-shaped cookies. "Somehow, the 'Antiques Road Show' on PBS sounds like a lot harder sell than this."
Mr. Hoenig, who flops around in unlaced Doc Martens and a tie studded with pigs, doesn't find anything unusual about the way his often racy conversations veer from rising interest rates to the movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
He says he simply wants to soak up all the good things in life as soon as possible -- an urge he ascribes in part to the deaths of his father and his older brother when he was still in his teens.
He grew up in Glencoe, Ill., a Chicago suburb, in the 1980's, when greed was in style, he said. When he was 9, his father gave him two shares of Boeing stock, and he promptly fell in love with investing. He borrowed his mantra, "Greed is good," from Gordon Gekko, the ruthless financier played by Michael Douglas in the film "Wall Street."
About the same time he got a public affairs radio program at Northwestern, he took a job clerking at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before long, his interests converged and he turned his radio program into Capitalist Pig.
Investment advice, often emphasized with profanities, was delivered against a backbeat of music from bands like Guns 'n' Roses. A highlight of each program was his naming the "finance babe of the week" and running an advice segment called "Ask the Pig."
As for financial wisdom, this self-taught Wunderkind of Wall Street ("I just started on the Barnes & Noble bookshelf and read everything from Benjamin Graham to Marty Zweig") has a very common-sense approach to investing. He preaches diversification, the benefits of compound interest and the debilitating effects of credit card debt. And while he doesn't have a track record as a stock picker, he simply advises young people to educate themselves about the market and start investing.
Making $5.50 an hour just doesn't kick it. "That's good money, if you're 15, Amish or inhabiting a corrugated cardboard box," he says in his new book. And for him: "The notion of being able to make money without actually doing much of anything jazzed me to no end."
The popularity of the campus radio program led to appearances on CNN and MTV. He has also helped write a college textbook, "Personal Finance" (Irwin/McGraw Hill, 1999).
He dropped out of Northwestern in 1998 (he says mother wants him to think of it as a leave of absence) to focus on trading his own money in the futures pits of the Chicago Board of Trade and to begin branding himself and his company under the Capitalist Pig logo, which features a cigar-puffing pig. He even hired the same agent who represents Phil Jackson, the former coach of the Chicago Bulls.
"We speak the language of brands," Mr. Hoenig said of his target audience, 18- to 35-year-olds. "Since Day 1, we've been affixing logos and marketing slogans. What I want to do is start a life-style brand and tie it to something that is central to all of our lives: money."
Mr. Hoenig -- a tireless self-promoter whose press kit arrives as a stuffed suitcase -- is trying to create a brand that delivers financial advice with wacky wit and an unapologetic philosophy that money is everything.
He boasts of having a unique voice. And, well, how often does Mr. Rukeyser mock day traders by coining a phrase like, "Just buy after Regis and sell after Rosie"?
Talking about stocks, after all, is just like talking about sports, he says. "Instead of talking about E.R.A.'s, you're talking about P/E ratios."
He counts James J. Cramer of Thestreet.com and Alan Abelson of Barron's among his heroes. In his office, just above his desk, is a large photocopied portrait of Lou Dobbs, the CNN financial news anchor. Is he another hero?
"No," Mr. Hoenig said, flashing a sly grin, "We just used that as a dartboard at my book party."

In Detroit, a Sex Change

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
RUN your eyes over the Dodge Durango, one of the newest sport utility vehicles on the road. Muscles seem to ripple under its shiny sheet metal, causing its fenders to bulge. Its hood is lifted above the brawn, like the short neck of a wrestler rising from beefy trapezius muscles. Buyers imagine the Durango whispering huskily that it is strong and dependable. And many of its brother trucks at the forefront of Detroit's design efforts are even burlier.
Now think back to Detroit's design heyday in the 1950's. Then as now, cars were big. But they were Eves to today's Adams, Marilyn Monroes to our Hulk Hogans. In the 50's, "there were hood ornaments and bumpers that were bulbous and busty," said David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan. "Nowadays there is no question that a lot of these sport utility vehicles are masculine." 
 Back then, cars looked like women. Now they look like men.
Auto historians and designers puzzle over why. Some say the booming economy gives Americans a go-anywhere, do-anything confidence represented by brawny sport utility vehicles and trucks. Or perhaps the designs have changed because more women are buying cars. Others believe the world feels less safe, causing people to look to their cars for protection, as if their daily commutes require bodyguards.
Whatever the reason, it is as if Detroit's metal has had a sex change operation. Today's design kings are nothing like the voluptuous Chevrolet Corvettes built between 1968 and 1982, the ones with the sultry silhouette of an hourglass on its side. The1950's Cadillacs had chrome bumper guards in the shape of breasts -- the 1953 model was a real looker. Here in Detroit they are still known as "Dagmar" Cadillacs, after the tall, blonde television starlet who went by the single name Dagmar and was known for her ample chest.
Back then, machismo filled the air at General Motors. "It was certainly sexual, but it was the sexual fantasies of men," said Jerry P. Hirshberg, a G.M. designer in the 60's and 70's who is now president of North American design for Nissan. "When we lapsed, we were doing design pornography."
That's what everyone suspected. "The psychologists have thought for years that the auto makers, subliminally or otherwise, would build cars with sex appeal, mostly to appeal to men," said Mr. Lewis, the historian. Women in tight sweaters appeared in television ads for cars, and men got the point: "Here you have a curvy model and a curvy fender." No more. Today, we have muscle cars. Back in the 60's, of course, "muscle" referred to horsepower, not design.
Nissan's first sport utility vehicle, the Pathfinder, was nicknamed the "hardbody," and designers described the "triceps" around each wheel. There are the square-shouldered Jeeps, born of the battlefields, with a look DaimlerChrysler calls "chiseled." Other sport utility vehicles have been growing bigger and bigger, as if the highways have become a survival-of-the-fittest contest: The Ford Explorer spawned the Ford Expedition, and it evolved into the enormous, soon-to-come Ford Excursion.
Each designer or auto historian seems to have a theory about the changes. "In the 90's, people started moving away from the weaker-looking cars to the stronger-looking trucks," said Edward R. Golden, Ford's truck design director. "It has to do with the end of the cold war and people feeling more confident."
OR more endangered. "I don't think there were drive-by shootings in the 1950's," said Neil Walling, design vice president at DaimlerChrysler, which builds the Dodge Durango. "One of the allures or attractions to trucks and sport utility vehicles is that they carry a very protective image."
Perhaps now that women buy about half of all new vehicles, they are objectifying men just as men objectify women. "Women would really rather have a vehicle that's more masculine than a vehicle that is more feminine," said Jerry P. Palmer, director of design for G.M.'s North American Design Center. "People still like vehicles that are sexy," he said, and today's popular models "are masculine but they still have that sex appeal."
Is it sex or is it power? "A lot of women are buying trucks and sport utility vehicles, and I believe that they don't want to be seen as the weaker sex," said Mr. Golden, the Ford designer. "They want to be seen as equals."
OF course, not all the latest models get such expressive designs. The nation's best sellers are mid-sized cars like the Honda Accord, the Ford Taurus and the Toyota Camry. Designers say those boy-next-door cars still carry messages. Mr. Walling of DaimlerChrysler said cars like the Camry are saying, " 'I'm not trying to be powerful, I'm not trying to be fashionable, I'm not trying to be leading-edge. I'm the friend who is always here -- I'm not the Arnold Schwarzenegger.' "
But even sports cars seem less sexy now. Today's Corvettes have just a slight air of femininity -- they are nothing like the Playboy-magazines-on-wheels of the 1960's. The latest Corvettes and other sports cars are more like the "boys with breasts" of Tom Wolfe's latest novel, "A Man in Full" -- the thin, fit, females found climbing stair machines at the neighborhood gym.
"In the 50's and 60's, just when I was fantasizing about Dagmar, automobiles were not only a status symbol but a sex symbol," said Clive Chajet, a corporate identity consultant in New York. "Driving is no longer sexy," he concluded.
Why have bulging metal muscles replaced soft steel curves? The men in the auto industry are still puzzling it out. "If a sports car is a man's mistress, what is a pickup truck?" asks Robert H. Casey, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. "Is it his buddy?"

It's Showtime In Queens As Studios Plan to Grow

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
New York's biggest borough is rapidly becoming one of the country's biggest film and television production centers, too. Two studios are expanding and another may be on the way. Hollywood, apparently, sees the flickering light at the end of the Midtown Tunnel as more filmmakers shout: "Lights! Camera! Queens!"
In the last five years, Queens has become "a vital player in the record-breaking film and television production occurring in the city," said Patricia Reed Scott, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. 
 Industry leaders say that trend will grow with the expansion plans of the two studios, Silvercup Studios in Long Island City and Kaufman Astoria Studios.
Stuart Match Suna, president of Silvercup, at 42-22 22d Street, pointed to "the tremendous growth in feature films and episodic TV in New York" as the fuel for his company's expansion. The studios, with 250,000 square feet, have been used for several feature films and hundreds of commercials. They are also home to two television series on HBO, "Sex in the City" and "The Sopranos."
"Together, they take up half of our studios," Mr. Suna said. "Last year, their shooting schedules didn't overlap, but now they do and they are gobbling up a lot more space."
And so, Mr. Suna and his brother Alan, the company's chief executive, recently acquired a 150,000-square-foot site about a mile away, at Starr Avenue and Van Dam Street, near an entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Built in 1936 as a steel plant, it was also once a concrete factory.
The Sunas bought the site from a Korean agricultural group, which never occupied it. They said they had paid $8 million for the building and property and are now spending $12 million more to construct five studios, each with 16,000 square feet and 28-foot ceilings.
"It was designed to function like a Hollywood lot," Stuart Suna said. "It's self-contained and gated, with its own 12,000-square-foot production shop, 25,000 square feet in offices, set, prop and wardrobe areas and parking for up to 300 cars." He said productions there would create about 500 jobs. The first studio should be in use by next month.
"Queens has many, many advantages," Stuart Suna said. "Buildings cost less, they are much larger than Manhattan, and there's more space around them for parking trucks and getting equipment in and out."
Kaufman Astoria Studios is also planning an expansion, said Jane Bartnett, a spokeswoman. "We plan to announce the news in three to six months," she said.
Meanwhile, Gregg Sullivan, a Queens native who worked in film for a decade in Los Angeles, wants to buy a 100,000-square-foot power plant on the East River in Long Island City and convert it into a film and television studio.
Mr. Sullivan, who also owns Hollywired Inc., a movie industry Web site, said the building, at 50-09 Second Street, once generated power for railroads. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White. Mr. Sullivan wants to name it Stax Studio, after the building's four giant smokestacks.
Mr. Sullivan said he has applied to the city's Economic Development Corporation for $25 million in bond financing for the studio. But, he said, "I'm talking to two different groups about financing. They are huge real estate entities. If either comes on board, I won't need public financing." DAVID KIRBY

The Personality Cults Of Impersonal Economics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE curse and the blessing of the global economy is that no one's in charge. To those it has flattened recently -- the Russians, many Asians, the Brazilians -- it resembles a bullet train on autopilot, roaring across borders and barreling over slower-moving vehicles while a bunch of wealthy Americans down champagne in the club car. To free marketeers, it is the triumph of the invisible hand, a system governed by economic laws and not meddling economic planners, fueled by the Internet instead of ideology.
But global economic forces are not always as faceless and automatic as they seem. And when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced his resignation last week, it was a reminder that in matters economic, personalities and the confidence they inspire still matter. 
 Historians will debate for years whether Mr. Rubin helped spark the amazing boom of the 90's by preaching fiscal austerity to free-spending Democrats, or whether he just got lucky. They will argue endlessly whether his moves to save Mexico created an expectation that America would keep countries from going under, and thus invited a far worse global panic. They will make a convincing case that Mr. Rubin and his colleagues never had a workable plan to save Russia from itself as they poured billions down a pipe dream.
But even Mr. Rubin's harshest critics agree on this: Like his weekly breakfast partner, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, he understands that markets are manic-depressive -- and that averting disaster means making sure that someone, preferably someone in Washington, has the credibility to step in and tame the worst mood swings. When crisis struck -- in Mexico in 1995, Asia in 1997 and New York last September -- it was partly the cult of confidence in the Rubin-Greenspan tandem that restored stability.
Some of that was smoke and mirrors: Governments can tinker with interest rates and budgets, of course, but in a world where a trillion dollars changes hands daily, their firepower is diminished. Yet one of the lessons of the past decade is that when confidence in economic leadership is lost, the results can be disastrous: Just ask the Japanese, who once had it and then squandered it.
Maybe it was the way Mr. Rubin dressed, or maybe it was his 26 years on Wall Street -- which he was always invoking in conversation -- but somehow he had an an uncanny sense for the words and signals that would calm the global herd.
"Rubin was something like an old family doctor in the days before antibiotics," said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "He knew that even if there was not much he could always do, most things get better over time. So the important thing is to have a good bedside manner and help people through it."
Mr. Rubin himself acknowledged, in a conversation last week, that bedside manner is an important element of the job -- though it works only with "the credibility you establish through fiscal discipline and an understanding of how what happens outside our borders can affect our economy."
The power of his presence paid off one afternoon in October 1997, the early days of the Asian crisis, when a huge convulsion in the Hong Kong market led to a 554 point drop in New York -- more than 7 percent -- and shut down the stock exchange early.
Mr. Rubin walked out on the steps of the Treasury, faced the cameras -- and said nothing particularly memorable. But his few lines, all about the underlying strength of America's "fundamentals" and keeping markets operating smoothly even in the face of potential crisis, were intended, he recalled last week, to show that "there was a lot of focus on the issue, a lot of concentration." In the end, whether it was Mr. Rubin's calm or something else, the Dow's fall halted at 7,300. It has since risen another 50 percent.
THE most important jawboning takes place in private. South Korean officials say the only reason they avoided national default in December 1997 was Mr. Rubin's effectiveness in arm-twisting American banks to roll over South Korea's loans -- stopping a panic that many feared would spread to Japan and beyond. Mr. Rubin now counts South Korea's brush with disaster as one of the "scariest" moments of his tenure, along with the near-collapse of the global financial system in the wake of Russia's default on its loans last year.
That was when it seemed as if the driverless train was headed over a cliff -- and it may well have been. The panic around the globe was so broad and deep that it was clear that no words, no walk down the Treasury steps, would suffice. So the strategy was to create the sense in the markets -- some would say the illusion -- that Mr. Rubin and Mr. Greenspan had temporarily taken the wheel, not only of the American economy but of all the major industrial economies.
They coordinated a series of statements by President Clinton and other world leaders that the biggest risk to the world was no longer inflation but rather a global economic slowdown. And then, over a period of weeks, came a series of interest rate cuts that turned the markets around. Of course, the moves were a Band-Aid, and much of the impassioned oratory heard then about the need for remaking the "global economic architecture" has since died out. But the Band-Aid stopped the bleeding. Until the next time, anyway.
To this day, no one is quite sure why it worked. "Credibility is born of past success," says Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund and a key player during several crises. So part of the Rubin-Greenspan magic, he argues, comes from the fact that the American economy has been up for so long.
Japan's Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who at age 78 has had longer and deeper experience than almost any of his counterparts, doesn't cut the same ice. That is because Japan's political paralysis has undercut not only its own economy, but its influence in the global economy. Europe hasn't done much better.
BUT what about President Clinton's designee as the new Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers? While Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers have been close partners, they could not be more different. Mr. Rubin is rail thin and always in a banker's suit. Mr. Summers, a 44-year-old former Harvard economist, tells jokes about his weight and often looks as if he has stayed up all night. Unlike Mr. Rubin, he can be acerbic and cutting, although lately he has tempered his impatience with those who don't understand the bruising dynamics of the global forces at work.
With an inclination to be more of an interventionist, he speaks with greater sweep than Mr. Rubin does, with declarations like, "The major challenge for the United States is whether it can become the first outward-looking, continental, non-imperialist power in history." But whether he can speak the language of the markets -- whether he can walk down the Treasury's steps and convey a sense of calm -- is a test yet to come.

It's Not the Cold War, but There's a Nip in the Air

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
IF a space traveler had returned to Earth last week after 35 years, he could have been excused for thinking that nothing had changed. Russia and China hated the West. Their leaders and citizens were angrily flinging words like "imperialism" and "hegemony." A strange war in an obscure corner of the planet seemed to be the occasion for mounting global tension.
No world leaders were seen banging any shoes, but a Chinese President, after allowing jeering crowds to stone the American Embassy, hinted darkly that if America did not mend its ways, it "will face doom." 
 Of course the space traveler would have to be told that the cold war really was over, and that for 10 years the Americans, the Russians and the Chinese had agreed that their most vital interest was in the common pursuit of prosperity.
That, at least, was how many Americans had come to understand the new world.
But in Russia and China, as events have shown, the picture was not quite so straightforward. Whatever goals Russia and China share with the United States, the crisis in Kosovo -- and especially the mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- has revealed the degree to which these former enemies still distrust Americans, and also the blinders Americans wear as they imagine how Russia and China perceive their own vital interests.
Many Americans might well believe that these two needy behemoths are shooting themselves in their economic feet, with their fulminating hostility over events in an inconsequential place called Kosovo.
But posing the issue this way, Chinese people say, reveals the problem. There can be no doubt that China really wants to open up and become part of the Western-led world economy. But it has other profound interests and fears as well. And many people here have felt with growing force that the United States simply doesn't take China seriously -- that it blithely ignores China's vital security concerns as it constructs a Pax Americana.
The Russians, dependent on the International Monetary Fund's huge loans and suffering a political meltdown that includes an impeachment drama and successive shuffles of the Government, have likewise stewed about what they regard as ignorant and disrespectful treatment from the West.
NATO leaders, having long been lectured by the Russians about NATO expansion, knew the Russians would hate the decision to bombard Yugoslavia, though they may have underestimated the long-term damage to relations if the war persisted. China's vitriol about the intervention in Yugoslavia was another matter. Though surprisingly harsh, it didn't seem that important at first because it was only oratory. And Kosovo was so far away from Beijing.
"Americans don't make the connection between Kosovo and China, they just don't see it," observed Jonathan Pollack, a military expert at the Rand Corporation in California.
But for the Chinese, it is now clear, the decision by what it pointedly called "U.S.-led NATO" to bomb Yugoslavia without United Nations sanction meant the world. Culminating with the attack on their own embassy in Belgrade, the bombing campaign has ignited a major reassessment here of global politics and relations with the United States.
"The bombing in Yugoslavia showed us that the United States can do anything it wants to do," said Zhang Yunling, director of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which advises the Government. "We see that the United States will use its supreme position, its high technology and its allies to dominate the world."
"Although Kosovo is far away, this has alerted the Chinese," Mr. Zhang added, noting that China could face similar demands for international military intervention some day in Taiwan or Tibet.
The bombing in Yugoslavia followed other perceived signs of hostility -- including what is regarded as politically driven opposition to China's entry into the World Trade Organization, rumbles of major military support for the renegade province of Taiwan and a broadened defense agreement with Japan.
THESE created a powerful sense here that the United States was worse than a neglectful friend. America, many people feared, wants to stamp China down, just as it emerges as the world power it was always meant to be.
That fear turned into a certainty last week, after NATO bombs killed three journalists in the embassy in Belgrade. However outlandish the idea seems to Americans, almost everyone in Beijing thinks the attack was deliberate, a belief encouraged by official propaganda. The most common theory voiced by demonstrators was simple: The United States wants to test the upstart China.
So a Westernized generation of Chinese youths, the same people who normally crowd any of Beijing's 44 McDonald's outlets and yearn to attend U.C.L.A, unleashed a fury of anti-Americanism. And this raised the possibility of real hostility growing between the two countries. For however distant the old cold war hostilities have become, frictions are nevertheless inevitable as China's growing power rubs against longstanding American partnerships and interests in Asia.
For now, American diplomats here feel their own sense of betrayal. From Ambassador James Sasser on down, they had devoted the last few years to building a web of friendly ties with China, trying to wall off the obvious disputes over human rights. Last year, President Clinton and President Jiang even inaugurated a hot-line.
But instead of using the hot-line last week, Mr. Jiang initially refused to take a call from Washington. The leaders pushed America to the limit, busing in students and letting them pelt the American Embassy here for four days while the controlled media fanned hatred.
BY week's end, the popular furies had subsided to a slow burn, and Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang had talked. But both sides knew that Chinese-American relations could never be quite the same and both Governments were feeling their way toward new terms.
China was clearly trying to turn down the temperature -- not only by halting the demonstrations but also by making surprisingly minimal demands for redress, including apologies, a public investigation and punishment of those responsible.
Most remarkably, Chinese officials insisted that their economic engagement with the West should not be affected by politics and said negotiations for entry to the World Trade Organization should pick up where they left off.
In a monumental misperception of American political realities, some officials even suggested that the United States should now, in a kind of reparation, relax its negotiating stance.
Mr. Zhang, the scholar and adviser, said the embassy attack had spawned a changing view of Chinese-American relations among foreign policy specialists here. Many, he said, had believed that a generally cooperative relationship with the United States was possible. "But now it seems the United States will dominate the relationship, and where there are disagreements it may resort to military force," he continued. "China might even become a target some time in the future," he said, noting possible conflicts in Taiwan or the Koreas.
In the new circumstances, China may well increase military spending, Mr. Zhang said, although economic development will remain the top priority.
How deeply this new perspective will be entrenched, Mr. Zhang said, will depend on how well the two Governments manage their relationship in the months ahead and how the Kosovo crisis is resolved.
NATO's bombing of the embassy has had the ironic effect of thrusting China into the center of the search for a diplomatic solution in Yugoslavia. The approach Russia developed with the NATO powers involves sending troops under a United Nations flag into Kosovo. This would require China's assent, something likely to be given only grudgingly.
LONG before the current crisis, the one-time enemies China and Russia had realized that it was in their strategic interest to foster better ties. Now, more than ever, China the emerging power and Russia, the flailing one, have been brought together by a shared sense of exclusion.
There is no basis for a serious strategic alliance, but "China has used friendly sniffs to remind the United States that they can shift northward," said Richard Baum, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of California at Los Angeles. "Russia can't offer what China needs for modernization," Mr. Baum said. What it does offer is weaponry in exchange for cash.
Chinese leaders are gambling that even as political relations with the United States go through the grinder, Western trade and investment will continue unaffected.
"Capital and technology are now beyond political control," Mr. Zhang said. "As long as the social situation here is stable and the economy is open, capital will come."

Kosovo War Doesn't Do Much for U.S. Recruitment

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, Americans watched the United Nations' entry into the gulf war almost as if it were a video game, distant and unreal. Each night's newscast brought a fresh batch of satellite pictures of Iraqi targets exploding as smart bombs zeroed in.
The victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were seldom seen, and the greatest moral issue for most Americans was probably that of controlling the supply of oil or protecting Israel. 
 This time, the Kosovo Albanian refugees are all too real. Their stories of mass rapes and massacres echo a level of brutality that evokes the death camps of World War II. Washington is engaged in a war where the overwhelming feature is not oil or geopolitics but the morality of ethnic cleansing.
And yet many young Americans enlisted to fight Iraq in the gulf war.
Today they have been sitting out the Balkan conflict, according to military recruitment experts like John Sibley Butler, a sociologist who is the Reserve Officer Training Corps faculty adviser at the University of Texas. For a few years, the gulf war helped stem the steady decline in enlistment since the end of the cold war.
Thanks largely to a healthy economy that has increased the choices available to those entering the job market, the Army and the Air Force have fallen short in their recruitment goals.
Still, with 1.36 million Americans serving in the military, the United States for the moment runs no risk of a shortfall in troops to face down the Serbs.
But the dearth of recruits limits American options, suggesting that a long war may be problematical. And it raises intriguing questions about attitudes toward military service and the meaning of modern warfare to young people.
The apathy of young people toward the conflict in the Balkans comes at a moment when war is paradoxically at its most intimate and most distant.
Through television Americans have access to virtually continuous coverage of the war, be it NATO bombings in Belgrade or briefings in Brussels, or the live reports from crowded refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. Through the Internet, they can communicate directly with Serbs or Albanians.
At the same time, the American military wages war at a distance, using methods that reduce the likelihood of casualties. Planes fly higher to cut the chances that they will be shot down by Serb forces, even if that means mistaking a civilian target for a military one.
For many young people, such "safe" strategies drain war of its very meaning, said David R. Siegel, author of "Recruiting for Uncle Sam" (University Press of Kansas, 1989).
Although the military has relied on increasing pay and benefits to draw recruits, Mr. Siegel's previous research suggests that young people enlist for patriotic reasons, or to build character. A war that carries risk to only one side strikes many of them as unfair, or at least unworthy, he said.
"It's like they're saying, 'I'm willing to lay my life on the line, but my country won't let me,' " he said.
"The non-war in Kosovo," which batters Yugoslavia from the air but does not risks troops, may be precisely what is keeping young people away, Mr. Siegel said. They sense they are not needed, Mr. Siegel says.
It is also possible that continuous television coverage of the conflict has prompted people to tune out rather than tune in to the war. "War has become a movie that other people do, and something we watch rather than something we engage in," Professor Butler said.
Americans reason that abominations "are going on everywhere," he said, and they ask, "But do we go everywhere to fight them?"

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer;
So, Exactly When Is Bill Bradley Going to Enter the Charisma Phase?

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
It was somewhere near the New Hampshire seacoast that Bill Bradley declined to tell reporters what books he likes.
"I don't want to go down the road of favorite novel," he said, during a three-day campaign tour of youth centers, senior centers and many variations on the theme of the Presidential-candidate forum. There was a credibility issue at stake here. What, he demanded, would the press say if he picked one book now and then changed his mind six months down the line? And what if he mentioned something like "Crime and Punishment"? The reporters might theorize that he was identifying with the murderer-hero. No, we're not going there. 
 Mr. Bradley, you see, is in the Vision Phase of his campaign, and, as he firmly explained earlier in the New Hampshire tour, you do not talk specifics when you are in Vision Mode. "It's discipline and sequencing," he said, in a tone that suggested the reporters would really not respect him in the morning if he lathered them with details of his health-care initiative that night. Sometime this summer, he plans to kick into the Principles Phase, to be followed in the fall by the Policy Phase, when he will be prepared for "taking the necessary hits you get when you are specific." After that comes the Action Phase, in which the candidate responds to the hits and, presumably, comes back with a few good licks of his own.
The Bradley staff swears he did not pay a consultant to think this up.
It may be an indication of the Bradley campaign's self-confidence that it does not seem particularly desperate for attention at this point in the game. Unlike most long-shot candidates, Mr. Bradley does not accept invitations to appear on cable television shows. He resists photographers' attempts to get him near a basketball or a hoop. He is a serious candidate, and if you do not believe it, just try listening to him tell a group of Manchester citizens his opinion on the Uruguay round of the international trade negotiations.
So far, it all seems to be working pretty well. The voters at the forums, coffees and house parties appear to like the Vision Phase, particularly Mr. Bradley's rather fuzzy but seemingly heartfelt concern about "values." His fund-raising pales next to Vice President Al Gore's mountain of cash, but money can't buy you love.
The Gore candidacy is so wobbly that President Clinton recently assumed the role of Spinner in Chief. He said Mr. Gore's leaden speeches and inert staff add up to inevitable victory.
Follow Mr. Bradley around during Phase One and you will learn that what he is most concerned with is children, particularly poor children who do not get enough parental supervision. He has a vague but intense preoccupation with getting people to think of themselves as part of a larger community, a greater cause. The rhetoric of self-realization sometimes sloshes over into other areas. "Before somebody's going to join the international economy, they have to be comfortable with their identity where they are," he said during a discussion of Kosovo.
As a former basketball star, Mr. Bradley, unlike most politicians, has never had to beg for attention. This seems to have given him a quietness that allows him to draw people out by simply sitting there -- head down, chin tucked in, peering up with a look of slightly amused interest -- and waiting for them to volunteer some information. It works particularly well with young people, whom he asks to describe what they are "most afraid of," with sometimes remarkable results. "I'm afraid of not making it," piped up 17-year-old Jose Rivas in Nashua. "What if I've come this far and it's as far as I can go? It's not as far as I want to go, but what if it's as far as I'm allowed to go?" He told Mr. Bradley that he wanted to attend cooking school but might not be able to raise the tuition.
Unfortunately, the same calm confidence that makes Mr. Bradley a good listener makes him a dreary public speaker. Even his most dramatic speech, a really admirable call to re-address the issue of racial division, is devoid of applause lines. It would be a profound problem in a different year. But no matter who wins the Presidential primary, boring is something the Democrats are just going to have to learn to live with.
When it comes to comparing himself with the Vice President, Mr. Bradley says "specific issue differences will be laid out in the fall," when it is time for the harvest and Phase Three. If all goes according to plan, sometime around August Mr. Bradley may also volunteer that he likes historical fiction, and before Thanksgiving the campaign may reveal that he has read "Ragtime" twice.

HEADLINE: New York's Baffling Zoning Code

 BODY:
New York City's antiquated zoning code runs about 900 pages and rivals the Internal Revenue Code in complexity. Unless you are a member of the coterie of zoning lawyers, the odds of accurately interpreting one section of the code in relation to another are slim to none. Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, now plans to rewrite parts of the code so that rules for building height and other crucial standards are not only clear, but sturdy enough to withstand attempts to twist them into pretzels.
The urgency of this undertaking is visible on both sides of the East River. Developers and neighborhood groups have already squared off over the skyscraper Donald Trump wants to build near the United Nations and David Walentas's plans for a retail and entertainment complex on land near the East River waterfront in Brooklyn. Both disputes reflect the muddled state of city land-use policy. 
 Under Mr. Rose's plan, parts of the 1961 zoning code, which he calls a "hodgepodge of conflicting visions and objectives," would be reformulated to encourage innovative design while respecting neighborhood character. Among other things, he would set height limits for buildings outside Manhattan's Central Business District, create a process for granting occasional waivers for buildings of exceptional design, reopen some manufacturing zones to community uses and rethink commercial-use rules for doctors' offices and other businesses.
Equally important is his plan to abolish plaza bonuses for residential buildings. Time and again, this tradeoff -- more square footage for a developer in exchange for a plaza -- has saddled the city with unattractive and inaccessible public spaces.
As useful as it is, Mr. Rose's reform agenda ought to be treated as an invitation to think more broadly about zoning issues and land-use opportunities. When he unveiled his ideas in a recent speech, he expressed a preference for pursuing a short list of reforms. A full-scale review of the code, he fears, would be paralyzing. But rethinking land use does not have to result in civic meltdown.
A number of American cities, including Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, have developed fresh land-use principles, written a new code and survived the process. New York's 50-odd community boards, various civic groups, architects and builders should be invited to compile their own lists of the most vexing zoning problems. A comparison of all these lists should make it possible to choose between full-scale review of the entire code and taking a triage approach by focusing on the top 10 to 20 issues.
The dialogue Mr. Rose has opened should logically lead everyone to grapple with two other areas -- redeveloping the city's vast but often dilapidated waterfront and identifying the environmental values that should be loaded into the building, zoning and tax codes. The dog days of summer that New Yorkers dread will be testimony to the wisdom of examining environmental issues. During extremely hot weather, New York creates heat islands. Dark road pavement, buildings with dark roofs and other impervious surfaces boost already uncomfortable temperatures and help produce ground-level ozone. Planting trees, a zoning code issue, and requiring the use of reflective materials on roofs and streets can lower temperatures. As New York reinvents itself, it should not be hamstrung by a Sputnik-era rule book.

HEADLINE: Pay Raises for Police? Where's the Money?

 BODY:
The police officers of Nassau County do not deserve a pay raise, nor is it in the county's best interest at this time.
Once again the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, has demonstrated poor leadership. Nassau County is in financial crisis and Mr. Gulotta is culpable. He is willing to curry favor with the police union while giving the citizens of Nassau County the political shaft. 
 When will Mr. Gulotta stand up to the police and tell them they are already well paid as it is?
Nassau County police officers can now retire on very high pensions. If Nassau County officers believe they are not well paid, they might try the New York Police Department. Officers of the N.Y.P.D are leaving for Nassau and the attractive pay scale and working conditions.
Meanwhile, instead of defending his record, Mr. Gulotta should apologize to the taxpayers of Nassau for his office's mismanagement.

Ending Up With the Wrong Kind of Bang

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Oh, those unforgiving Fridays. Investors ended the third week in a row pummeling the Dow Jones industrial average, pulling the sell trigger because of fears of inflation.
 The first two times, the Dow recovered, posting new highs the next week. But the outlook for a similar rebound is uncertain. Although the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates on Tuesday, it may be considering higher rates in the near future. 
 One indicator the Fed will consider is the sharp rise in consumer prices reported on Friday. The report shook investors. But Michael Farr, an investment bank-er with Miller & Washington in Washington, brushed off the worry behind the 193.87-point decline on Friday.
 This is an emotional reaction, not a rational re-action, from a market that is more inclined than not to pull back, Mr. Farr told The Associated Press. If you characterize the advance as irrational, then the pullbacks ought to be just as irrational. But you can't complain if you're enjoying the ride up.
 Despite the selloff, the Dow was off just 1 percent for the week, closing at 10,913.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell fractionally, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 1 percent, to 2,527.86. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: Auto Pollution Plan Is Drawn Into a Vortex

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 15

 BODY:
An Administration plan to require cleaner gasoline and automobiles that emit less pollution, described by officials as the most ambitious anti-pollution initiative of the Clinton Presidency, is drawing heavy lobbying by environmentalists and industry and strong interest by politicians eyeing next year's Presidential campaign.
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that imposing the higher standards would reduce respiratory illnesses and save the lives of up to 2,800 Americans a year. These improvements would come at substantial cost -- $3.5 billion annually, five times as much as any other Clinton Administration rule aimed at specific sources of pollution, according to the agency. 
 Industry critics, particularly oil refiners, say the costs would be far higher. Emboldened by a Federal appeals court ruling on Friday rejecting the Administration's plans for tighter national air quality standards in the future, oil industry lawyers warned that the gasoline and auto initiative may not hold up in court. But an E.P.A. official said the appellate court ruling would not stop the agency's plans.
By requiring substantial reductions in car pollution and the elimination of 95 percent of emissions from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, the gas and auto rules would drastically cut smog.
"This is the biggest action by the Clinton Administration to protect the environment and the health of the American people," said Carol M. Browner, the regulatory agency's administrator.
With such high stakes, advocates and opponents are trying to influence the Administration and Congress during the public comment period, which ends on Aug. 2. Environmentalists and auto makers generally support the plan while seeking limited modifications. Oil companies are implacably opposed to the requirement for cleaner gasoline and are encouraging Republicans in Congress to step in, having concluded that the Administration is not likely to make any significant changes before the rules become final at the end of this year.
Vice President Al Gore has strongly backed the pollution initiative. Republicans are keeping a close eye on his comments, particularly regarding sport utility vehicles, in hopes that they can be used against him in next year's elections.
"This kind of position on this kind of an issue is tailor-made" for television advertisements, said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who is one of the 10 members of Gov. George W. Bush's Presidential exploratory committee. "I do think it's a good issue."
The future of the Administration's initiative is clouded by Friday's decision by an appellate court in the District of Columbia. The court rejected only the Administration's plan to set more stringent national targets for smog and soot in the air. The plan did not specify which industries would actually reduce pollution. But F. William Brownell, lead lawyer for the industry coalition that won the case, said that unless the E.P.A. won an appeal, it could no longer prove a need for the stringency of the new gas and auto regulations.
E.P.A. officials and environmentalists disagreed, saying that because the Administration initiative was partly based on longstanding national air quality goals predating the Clinton Administration and unaffected by Friday's decision, the court's ruling should have no effect. E.P.A. officials, planning an appeal, said they would proceed with public hearings on the auto emissions and gasoline proposal next month without modifying it.
Sparring over the air pollution plan is likely to intensify this summer. The Public Interest Research Group, a liberal advocacy organization, is planning to send volunteers to knock on the doors of four million households in a bid to muster 135,000 postcards to Federal regulators in support of the proposal. Other environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club, are backing the Administration plan, although they are calling for faster cuts in pollution by sport utility vehicles.
Oil lobbyists contend that the plan could add 6 cents a gallon to the price of gasoline instead of the 1 or 2 cents estimated by regulators. The lobbyists expect the Administration to change the rules little if at all after the public comments. So the industry is preparing for two hearings in the Senate next week by one of their allies, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who is drafting legislation.
Top American and foreign auto executives met in Washington on Wednesday to map out their strategy. The industry has been pleased with the cleaner gasoline rules, which will make it easier to build cleaner-burning engines.
Increasingly interested in improving their environmental image and irritated by criticism of pollution by sport utility vehicles, auto executives have been reluctant to criticize the Clinton initiative, instead proclaiming their "general support." But the industry is asking regulators to extend by two years, to the 2011 model year, the deadline for large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks to meet car pollution standards.
Mr. Gore said he thought that the Administration would prevail in imposing tough rules this year. "It has taken several years to get to this stage and we of course don't have the final rule yet, but I'm optimistic," he said in an interview this month.
But if Republicans win next year's Presidential election, they might be able to revise the gas and auto emissions standards, possibly citing Friday's court decision.
Republicans have been watching Mr. Gore's comments on automotive issues closely. President George Bush ran television advertisements in Ohio and Michigan in 1992 warning that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore would tighten fuel-economy standards and force tens of thousands of auto workers into unemployment. Mr. Engler, the Governor of Michigan, said similar criticisms could be leveled against Mr. Gore next year.
Mr. Engler, who has won three consecutive races for governor in this fiercely contested industrial state and is a possible Republican Vice Presidential candidate, said American families liked the interior space and perceived safety of big sport utility vehicles. Voters in general and auto workers in particular will be leery, he said, of a Democrat whose environmental views could be portrayed as advocating a return to "little tiny cars" of the sort still seen in Europe.
Though top auto executives may see tighter rules as inevitable, there remains an undercurrent of hostility here toward any limits on automobiles. An editorial cartoon in The Detroit News on May 8 showed Mr. Gore in an immense 18-wheeler labeled "Big Gov't," honking the horn while tailgating a sport utility vehicle. The explanation at the top of the cartoon read, "Al Gore's plan to get oversized S.U.V.'s off the road."
Auto executives have warned that large sport utility vehicles might have to be made smaller or less powerful to comply with the latter stages of the new rules, which will be phased in between 2004 and 2009. But Mr. Gore made a point of saying in a speech here that he thought the new regulations provided enough flexibility to industry to avoid reducing consumers' choices.
Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who has been consulted by Mr. Gore on electoral strategy in the Upper Midwest, said he strongly doubted that voters would hold the new regulations against the Vice President.
"Gore isn't cracking down on sport utilities -- the E.P.A. is," Mr. Dingell said, also pointing out the willingness of auto executives to go along with more stringent rules.
Edward V. Sarpolus, a vice president of EPIC/MRA, a polling firm in Lansing, Mich., which works for both parties and the news media, said there was little evidence that the 1992 Republican advertisements had been effective. Michigan workers tended to blame corporate downsizing, rather than regulatory policy, as the main cause of layoffs.
The E.P.A. estimates that beginning in 2004, the new rules will add $100 to the cost of a car and $200 to the cost of a sport utility vehicle or pickup truck. Auto lobbyists say those are underestimates, but Mr. Sarpolus said the price increases were small enough and far enough in the future to play down their political importance.
Insurance industry studies indicate that sport utility vehicles are not especially safe; their occupants are just as likely as those in cars to die in crashes, while more likely to kill other people in collisions with other vehicles.
Senator Inhofe has been trying to draft legislation that would alter the gasoline provisions of the Administration plan without starting another broad fight over the Clean Air Act, a controversial piece of legislation covering all aspects of air pollution that tied up Congressional leaders for months in 1990. But Mr. Dingell said it was impossible to make any changes in the law without reopening the whole issue.
The Clean Air Act authorizes the E.P.A. to draft national air quality standards, but the appeals court found on Friday that the agency behaved unconstitutionally in not asking Congress for detailed instructions on drafting the standards.
The auto and gasoline rules do not cover fuel economy. In the interview, Mr. Gore said he had been talking with auto executives about ways to triple the fuel economy of sport utilities through joint research programs with the Government to explore alternative fuels.
Though Mr. Gore advocated tighter fuel-economy rules when he was in the Senate, he and Mr. Clinton largely abandoned that position in 1992 after the Republican television campaign, calling instead for Federal research subsidies.

HEADLINE: A More Selective Cuba Rethinks Foreign Investment Policy

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 15

 BODY:
Nearly a decade after Cuba began opening its state-run economy to foreign investment, President Fidel Castro's Government says it has become more selective about choosing partners from abroad.
But the Government also says it remains committed in principle to encouraging foreign investment as a "complement" to its own efforts to guarantee recovery from the economic crisis that hit Cuba after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. 
 "The policy is the same -- the country remains open to new investments," said the country's Foreign Investment Minister, Ibrahim Ferradaz Garcia, in an interview in his Havana office on Friday.
Other factors have changed, he said. "It's not like the first years when we were waiting for the foreign businessman to come looking," Mr. Ferradaz said. "Now, we go out ourselves to look for a partner for an investment need."
Although official figures are unavailable, Cuba is estimated to have attracted more than $2 billion in foreign investment disbursements or pledges this decade.
That figure is small for other Latin American nations, but large for Cuba, whose Communist Government expelled foreign businesses after Mr. Castro's 1959 revolution and has kept its small and fragile economy under strict control since.
With a United States embargo in place for the last 37 years, most external capital has come from Canada and European Union countries, notably Italy and Spain. Although Cuban law theoretically allows 100 percent foreign ownership, the majority of investments are roughly 50-50 joint ventures with the state.
Mr. Ferradaz said 26 new joint ventures had started so far this, compared with 58 in the whole of last year. Cuba has signed 36 bilateral investment accords, and is negotiating two more to eliminate double taxation with Italy and France on top of one signed with Spain.
The traditional investment areas of tourism, oil and mining are being complemented by projects in other sectors such as energy, banking and tobacco, Mr. Ferradaz added.
He also reiterated Cuba's "definitive" rejection of privatization of, or foreign investment in, the sugar industry, a mainstay of the economy.
Asked if foreign criticism of Cuba's recent measures against internal political opponents had affected investments, he said the number of joint ventures spoke for itself.
"Businessmen definitely aren't politicians," he said.
"It is part of the sovereignty of a country to make the laws it decides it should do, and carry out the judicial processes it decides it should do," he added, alluding to the trial of four dissidents and the passing of new anti-subversion legislation, which prompted foreign protests.
The impact of the Helms-Burton law -- passed by Congress in 1996 to tighten the embargo and to discourage other countries from investing in Cuba -- "cannot be undervalued, although it is impossible to gauge it exactly," Mr. Ferradaz added
The law's basic objective to halt investment "obviously has not been fulfilled," he said. At the same time, he added, an unknown number of potential investors, and some loans from abroad, have been deterred by fear of reprisals.
Mr. Ferradaz said the island, despite what is now its third year of drought, was on track to achieve or surpass its goal of 2.5 percent growth this year, thanks in part to a good sugar harvest and tourism.

HEADLINE: Goats in Trial as Urban Weed Killers

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, May 15

 BODY:
A sign in a city park here says it all: "Goats at Work."
A herd of about 100 Cashmere goats that has been munching at the park and other weed-choked areas around the city since April is working for the City of Denver as part of a program to fight invasive weeds that have taken over native plants and wildlife habitats. 
 "It's unusual to have goats graze within the city limits, right along a managed city park," said Judy Montero, a spokeswoman for the Denver Parks and Recreation Department. "We hope the goats will reduce our use of herbicides and pesticides in the long run."
This year, the city will spend $50,000 in grant money on this experimental weed control program. The goats will be used to help restore 25 to 35 acres within the city limits, including sites along the Platte River and around Cherry Creek.
"It's the oldest weed-control technique known to mankind," said Lani Lamming, an owner of Land Whisperer, the Alpine, Wyo., company that is leasing the goats to the city. "It's so logical and simple. In my opinion, we're using life to nurture other forms of life. No natural resources are being wasted."
Mrs. Lamming, who owns the company with her husband, Fred, said goats preferred the broadleaf weeds to grass, unlike cows and horses, which graze grass first. The herds are managed alternately by the Lammings, their three teen-age sons and professional herders.
The goats, which work in two four-hour shifts daily in a temporarily fenced-in area, can mow down about one acre per day. They can reach areas that machines cannot, and they serve other purposes as they graze: tilling the soil, re-seeding and fertilizing.
Part of the plan for the park is to re-establish native grasses. As the goats are nibbling on the broadleaf weed varieties, a park official said, their hoofs are trampling in seeds of desirable native species distributed by city employees.
The cost of a job varies depending on conditions, but Land Whisperer estimates the average cost is $100 per acre, using 50 to 100 goats.
In the past, the city has relied on mechanical mowing, spraying herbicides and pesticides and pulling weeds by hand. But those methods have hazards: air pollution from mowing and contamination of groundwater from chemical sprays.
"The goats alone can't get rid of the weeds," said Gayle Weinstein, a naturalist for the parks department. She said the goats could work the same site only about three times during a growing season and still get enough to eat. After that, most of the seed heads should be gone.
"Then we'll come in and spray when the plants are weakened, " she said. "Maybe with this combination we could get rid of the weeds in a couple of years."
For Denver, like cities and counties in many other Western states, laws require any landowner, whether a private party or the government, to control noxious weeds on the property or risk being fined or even criminally prosecuted.
If noxious weeds are left uncontrolled, they create a chain reaction of ecological and economical disasters. The weeds eliminate native plants and possibly lower the water supply, harming the wildlife that feeds on those plants. The land can then lose its value for future development, for farming and ranching, and for recreational uses.
"We can lose it all if we allow weeds to take over," said Dr. John M. Randall, an invasive-weed specialist with the Nature Conservancy in Davis, Calif. "It's not a stretch to say invasive species -- and that includes insects and wildlife as well as plants -- are the biggest threat to natural habitats next to development, the subdividing land for housing and shopping malls."
Although Dr. Randall is in favor of using the goats, he and other experts say the use of goats and other livestock should be in addition to an arsenal of tools to fight noxious weeds.
"One technique is not going to be the silver bullet, and no one should rely on one method," said Eric Lane, weed coordinator for the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
The state has an annual fund of $225,000 to promote weed control projects on all lands, from Federal to private, Mr. Lane said, and $15,000 was given to the city this year to help pay for the goats. The cost of fighting invasive weeds is even higher in other Western states. In Montana this year, the Legislature passed a bill to put $1.1 million into the state's noxious-weed management trust over the next two years.
"Weed management is extraordinarily expensive, and it requires persistent action," Mr. Lane said. "The advantages to using the goats are that this technique is uncontroversial, and because the goats are attractive, it gets the public interested too."

HEADLINE: Mexico Measures Identity in Dollars

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico

 BODY:
A Mexican conference speaker exploring the possibility that his country might adopt the dollar as its currency displayed a slide of a 50 peso bill alongside a single American greenback. George Washington's benign gaze was fixed on his fierce-looking counterpart, Jose Maria Morelos, the father of Mexican independence.
"Whenever we talk to American officials about dollarizing Mexico, we always ask them when they are going to print Jose Maria Morelos's face right there next to the other one," said the speaker, Francisco Gil Diaz, a former senior official of Mexico's central bank. 
 The audience chuckled. But Mr. Gil's comment pointed up a major sticking point that has emerged in an intense debate in Latin American about whether to abandon local currencies and embrace the legal tender of the United States.
A growing number of economists agree that the dollar's stability would do much to cure the chronic inflation and volatility that undermines growth in many Latin economies, especially Mexico. But political leaders in the region are reluctant to give up the policy powers and sense of national identity that go along with trading in their own money, no matter how unpredictable it might be.
Latin policymakers are quick to point out that the European Union countries achieved monetary accord by agreeing to add a new currency, the euro. But in the Americas the choice that nations must weigh is whether to take on the money of the United States, an overpowering neighbor with which most of them have had uneven relations.
The debate gained new urgency in January when President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina announced he was considering dropping the peso for the dollar and entered into informal talks with American Treasury and Federal Reserve officials.
In March, Eugenio Clariond Reyes, leader of the Mexican Businessmen's Council, the most influential private-sector association, startled President Ernesto Zedillo by pressing him at a public meeting to allow dollars to flow more easily in Mexico.
Another Mexican business leader, Alfonso Romo Garza, the chairman of Pulsar International, was host of a gathering here in recent days of economists and businessmen from both sides of the border to build momentum for dollarization.
To the chiefs of big Mexican industry, whose capital is Monterrey, being legally authorized to do business in dollars would merely ratify well-established de facto practice. Already their costs and prices are quoted in dollar terms and they finance investments with dollar loans from foreign banks. Only workers' wages continue to be based on pesos.
Mexico's economy already runs on dollars at the bottom as well, especially in regions where workers maintain their families by migrating across the border to jobs in the United States.
But mid-range Mexican enterprises must seek financing from Mexican banks where, because of the peso's persistent ups and downs, interest rates remain around a crippling 20 percent.
"Sustaining a currency like Mexico's has an enormous cost," Mr. Clariond, chairman of Grupo Imsa, a manufacturing conglomerate, said in an interview. "Living with its fluctuations is a luxury we can no longer afford."
When Mexicans are asked if they would like to see dollars move freely in the economy, they invariably express overwhelming support. In a poll this month by El Economista newspaper, 86 percent said they would like to be able to open dollar bank accounts in Mexico.
But when the question is whether to do away with the peso, Mexicans are more ambivalent. One financial titan in Mexico who came out against dollarization was Carlos Slim Helu, chairman of Telefonos de Mexico and one of the wealthiest men in Latin America. He argued that switching currencies could not substitute for Government fiscal discipline.
"The way you have to stop inflation is by cleaning up your financial house," Mr. Slim said. "Besides, the idea that the Federal Reserve would want to take responsibility for our financial system is absurd."
The National Action Party, a conservative but nationalistic opposition party, proposed a bill in Congress recently that would rule out dollarization by hardening into law the current policy of a floating peso with some intervention by the Banco de Mexico, the central bank.
Proponents of dollarization argue that what they call "the sovereignty factor" should not trouble Mexicans. Under any plan to dollarize, the central bank would relinquish its authority to manipulate the peso in the event of unexpected shocks.
Steve H. Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, told Mexican business leaders here that if they were allowed to pick and choose freely among currencies for business they would not have to worry about "blowing away the central bank."
"It's a good thing to give up monetary policy sovereignty," Mr. Hanke said. That kind of decision-making power, he said, "only gets you into a lot of trouble."
Mexican finance officials acknowledge that a brisk debate is under way among them over the issue. Guillermo Ortiz, head of Mexico's central bank, has said that the North American Free Trade Agreement could one day be a natural vehicle for a plan to adopt a single currency. "We happen to live in the right neighborhood," Mr. Ortiz said.
But officials also recognize that a serious proposal to sideline the peso would provoke the fury of nationalist Mexicans. And Mr. Zedillo, an economist who has suffered painful setbacks with sound economic policies that were politically unpalatable, does not seem eager to be the President who replaced Jose Maria Morelos with George Washington.

HEADLINE: Uncertain Future for a Nuclear Plant Short on Space to Store Waste

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: BUCHANAN, N.Y.

 BODY:
All the fuel that the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor has ever used since its first chain reaction 26 years ago is here at the bottom of a 40-foot-deep pool about the size of a basketball court.
Plant engineers say the pool, its water made to appear a Ty-D-Bol blue by the boron that smothers further nuclear reactions, is very safe and very clean. But it is also nearly full. Within a few years, the plant will run out of space to store the radioactive waste. 
 The future of the spent fuel and the plant itself is very much up in the air, caught in a tangle of questions about the economics of nuclear power, the deregulation of the energy industry and the environmental safety of nuclear waste disposal. And the uncertainty has left some neighbors of the plant, 35 miles north of Manhattan, deeply uneasy.
Environmentalists and others who have long opposed the plant would like nothing more than to see it shut down forever. But under one possible outcome, they could end up living next to both an operating nuclear reactor and a nuclear waste storage site. (A near-twin of the reactor, Indian Point 3, is operated by the New York Power Authority. But it is younger and has a bigger pool for spent fuel, so it faces no immediate crisis.)
The plant's owner, Consolidated Edison, says it would like to send the spent fuel more than 2,000 miles west to a proposed storage site near Salt Lake City, but that plan has run into fierce opposition in Utah. The alternative is to keep the spent fuel at the plant here, encasing it in giant sealed containers made of steel and concrete, a process known as dry-cask storage.
Further complicating the picture is the possibility that Con Ed may not be allowed to own Indian Point 2 much longer. Under state energy deregulation rules, the utility has already sold most of its non-nuclear generating plants, and it is awaiting a decision from state regulators on whether it will have to sell the reactor here, too.
If Con Ed keeps Indian Point 2, it could apply for permission to extend the plant's operating license and to build dry-storage casks for its spent nuclear fuel. That would require public hearings and approval from the state's Public Service Commission.
If a private company bought the plant, it would probably have fewer hurdles to clear to keep the reactor going. And some of Indian Point 2's neighbors, realizing that the plant could keep running for decades with even more radioactive fuel kept at the site, find this possibility extremely disturbing.
"I certainly don't think we should do on-site cask storage in order to allow it to continue to operate," said Mark Jacobs, director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition, a nonprofit group that opposes Indian Point 2. "It should be very clear if we do not know what to do with the nuclear waste, we should stop producing it."
In the salad days of nuclear power, the 1960's, the Federal Government had grand plans for the nation's spent nuclear fuel. A commercial plant, the first of several planned, was built near Buffalo to reprocess uranium and plutonium for reuse in reactors. But virgin uranium turned out to be cheaper, and President Jimmy Carter, concerned that the spent fuel could be turned into nuclear weapons, banned the process.
Then the Government promised that by 1998, it would have a place to bury the waste permanently. But now, the Energy Department is saying that site will not be ready for at least 11 years. So scores of nuclear plants around the country will soon find that they, too, have run out of room to store spent fuel.
Several plants have already put their fuel into dry-cask storage. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission routinely approves such a step, but state public utility commissions can veto cask construction if they think the expenditure is unwise.
And opponents of nuclear power have used political pressure to prevent dry-storage casks from being built at some sites, hoping that this pressure will force the plants to shut down.
But then deregulation came to the energy industry. New York and about a dozen other states are encouraging private companies to provide electricity, hoping that the competition will mean lower prices for consumers. Those states are either forcing utilities to sell their generating plants or are considering doing so. Nuclear plants are not the easiest properties to sell. But while it costs more to generate nuclear power than it does to generate electricity from water, gas or coal, a private company that can buy a reactor cheaply enough can still be competitive.
Indian Point 2 could flourish in a deregulated market, said Neil S. Carns, senior vice president for nuclear operations at Con Ed. He said he could foresee keeping the plant open 20 years beyond 2013, when its current license expires.
But to keep the plant running, Indian Point 2 needs more storage space for spent fuel.
"It's certainly a major point of vulnerability for Con Ed," said Edward A. Smeloff, executive director of the Energy Project at Pace University Law School in White Plains, "if they have no place to take the fuel and they have significant local opposition to siting a dry-storage facility."
Many experts, including Mr. Smeloff, say dry storage can be safer than storage in pools, because fuel can corrode in water and pools can leak. Mr. Smeloff was the head of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in California when its reactor was shut down, and he supervised the construction of such casks.
Some environmentalists favor storing spent nuclear fuel on reactor sites because shipping the waste creates even more hazards, they say. And many environmentalists are opposed to an agreement Con Ed and other utilities signed with the Goshute Indians to rent storage space on their reservation west of Salt Lake City, calling it environmental racism. In any case, the Utah deal may never come to pass because of opposition from officials there.
In 1982, Con Ed signed a contract with the Energy Department, which promised to begin accepting fuel for burial by 1998 in exchange for payment of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour that Indian Point generated over its lifetime. Con Ed has paid $117.5 million, but the Energy Department has not yet determined whether the site, Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas, is suitable, and now says that it will not be ready until 2010 at the earliest. Con Ed has sued to be relieved of future payments, and a resolution is pending.
Meanwhile, the fuel stays in this village of about 2,000 people on the east bank of the Hudson River. The pool has 1,374 holes for storing the spent nuclear assemblies vertically, and 917 are filled, making the grid look like a giant game of tic-tack-toe that is coming to an end. By 2005, Con Ed will have to move some of the assemblies out or close the plant.
"We have no choice but to bet on every horse in the race," said John M. Sanchez, the project manager for high-level waste at Con Ed.
Not everyone likes all the horses. "We don't want these big concrete things," said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County Executive. "We want it out of there; that's the bottom line. We don't want the construction of these things to hold this nuclear waste."
It is not clear, though, what leverage the county has. Con Ed would need a permit from the village of Buchanan to build dry-storage casks, and the village has made it clear that its main concern is to keep its jobs and its tax base steady.
Westchester County would like that, too, said Martin L. Rogowski, chairman of the county's Public Utility Service Agency. But Mr. Rogowski, who formerly worked at the Energy Department on nuclear waste problems, expressed some uneasiness about the dry-storage idea. "You never know. How good are these casks?" he asked.
Edward J. Rasmussen, Con Ed's assistant controller, said building enough dry casks to make space in the pool for an additional two-year fueling cycle would cost about $3 million, an increase of about 2 percent in the plant's operating and capital expenses.
In the meantime, the fuel sits in a room certified as safe from earthquakes and hurricanes. The water is a steady 97 degrees, warmed by the radioactive decay and cooled by a whining set of pumps. A white bathtub ring has built up from the boron. Bubbles, created for the most part by air pulled in by the cooling pumps, wobble their way to the surface occasionally. The radiation levels on the walkway surrounding the pool are minuscule, the utility says.
Four times a day, a technician checks the pool for changes, but there are rarely any, said Denis Cornax, a watch engineer. Every few days, a worker checks the water chemistry to insure that there are no chlorides or other rust-inducing chemicals present.
"It's cleaner water than you have in your house," he said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: DIPLOMACY;
White House Is Bracing For a Chinese Backlash

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, which once hoped that stronger bonds between China and the United States would be a centerpiece of its foreign policy legacy, is now bracing for a deep deterioration in relations that may not improve before President Clinton leaves office.
From the Chinese point of view, NATO's mistaken bombing of its embassy in Belgrade summed up almost everything that China finds offensive about the United States: a raw exercise of hegemonic power by Washington and its allies, ganging up on China and its interests. 
 In American eyes, China's outrage, expressed in diplomatic demarches and in the undiplomatic marches of enraged citizens at the embassy in Beijing, has seemed overblown, even irrational.
As important as this heightened mutual mistrust, a larger casualty of the bombing could well be the Administration's idea of a "strategic partnership' with China, the notion that the two countries have shared interests in the Asia region, a number of former Clinton Administration officials and other China experts said.
Their putative partnership, which already had been called into question by Administration critics in the last six months, may indeed be turning abruptly into a regional rivalry.
Just one week after the bombing, the Administration is cautious in describing its long-term fallout.
"Too early to tell," is the phrase most used by the White House about the potential effects of the bombing on specific Administration interests, like China's membership in the World Trade Organization. On Friday, Mr. Clinton discussed this and other matters with President Jiang Zemin in a telephone call, their first conversation since the bombing.
But a White House official said that the clout of Mr. Jiang and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji -- the two leaders with whom Mr. Clinton had closest contact -- could be undermined by the internal power struggles that some people detect in Chinese politics since the bombing.
These struggles pit more modernizing leaders like Mr. Jiang and Mr. Zhu against more conservative ideologues. Because Mr. Clinton has personalized his dealings with the two leaders, their difficulties would present a major stumbling block to improving the chilled relationship.
The embassy strike came at a time of mounting quarrels between Washington and Beijing over alleged espionage by China in the last 20 years involving nuclear secrets at American laboratories, over the Administration's enthusiasm for a theater missile defense system that could involve Taiwan and over human rights.
In the next several weeks, the Congressional committee headed by Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, that investigated illicit technology transfers to China is expected to release its long awaited report, an event likely to worsen the already strained ties with Beijing.
"Like us, the Chinese are beginning to ask whether the strategic partnership is workable," said Robert L. Suettinger, until recently the Central Intelligence Agency's senior analyst for Asia and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. Though never clearly defined by the Administration, Mr. Suettinger said, the basic premise of the partnership was that China would have a "good relationship with the United States, build an economy and have peace in the region and the world."
Whether the United States and China move toward an "adversarial relationship" now hangs in the balance, Mr. Suettinger said.
In some respects, the China-United States relationship was proving to be like "a bad marriage, which at the core is pretty hollow," said David Shambaugh, a former member of the National Security Council and now a China expert at George Washington University.
"There is no strategic glue holding it together," he said. "There is no common agreement in Asia and I see it as a relationship of strategic competition in Asia and the world."
Among the disagreements in Asia are quarrels over Washington's strengthening of defense ties with Japan and the Administration's recent decision to approve the sale of an early warning radar system to Taiwan, the island that China considers part of its territory. The Chinese Government warned last month that the actual deployment of the radar system -- designed to detect a missile launch by China -- would have a "serious negative impact" on relations with Washington.
The theater missile defense system was originally intended to protect Japan and South Korea against the threat of missiles from North Korea. If extended to Taiwan, as some in the Administration favor, it would be designed to protect Taiwan against missiles from China.
The idea of theater missile defense for Taiwan has been described by the Chinese as another example of the United States playing the hegemonic power that wants to contain China.
American intelligence agencies, for their part, have been warning about Chinese efforts to deploy new and better nuclear missiles, perhaps with stolen American technology.
That the NATO bombing of the embassy occurred in 1999 is viewed by some Chinese as symbolic. At the end of every decade since the Communists took power in China in 1949, major events have occurred that have dictated Beijing's relationship to the rest of the world.
To name the most recent, the United States and China normalized relations in 1979 during the Carter presidency; in 1989 the West turned away from China because of the killing of civilians by the army in Tiananmen Square.
In 1999, China may turn away from the United States, China experts said.
In talks with Chinese officials since the Belgrade bombing, a former American diplomat to China, Chas. W. Freeman Jr., who has been a voice for strengthening ties, said he saw a grim outlook. Unless there is "miraculously deft handling" by the two sides, any movement on issues of importance to Washington will grind to a standstill, he said.
"I think the Chinese Government is paralyzed and can't make any gestures," Mr. Freeman said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. "That kills human rights, nonproliferation and the World Trade Organization. It hampers cooperation on issues like North Korea." Washington has tried to persuade Beijing to get North Korea to curb the spread of nuclear technology on the Korean peninsula and to persuade Pyongyang to seek a peaceful accommodation with Seoul.
China's most immediate ire may be apparent at the United Nations, an arena that Beijing sees as its most important international platform and which it believes Washington has ignored in favor of other instruments, like NATO.
In the immediate aftermath of the embassy bombing, Administration officials suggested that China would not block efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis at the United Nations. As anger mounted in Beijing, that confidence ebbed, and Administration officials now say it is quite likely that China may at least frustrate or delay United Nations efforts to end the Balkan war as a way of showing its rage and getting Washington pay a price for its actions against Serbia.

HEADLINE: Chinese Intellectuals in U.S. Say Spying Case Unfairly Casts Doubt on Their Loyalties

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD and JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Many Chinese and Chinese-American scientists and engineers in the United States fear they are being tarnished and their careers threatened by accusations that another scientist, Wen Ho Lee, stole the design of America's most advanced nuclear warhead and gave it to China.
The accusations against Mr. Lee, a computer scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, may prove to be true. But Chinese intellectuals in the United States point out that Mr. Lee has not been arrested despite a three-year investigation by the F.B.I., and many are troubled by what they call the circumstantial nature of the accusations, especially the suggestion that Mr. Lee had the opportunity to divulge classified information because he traveled to scientific conferences in China. 
 That puts Chinese scientists and engineers in an awkward position, because many of them, like Mr. Lee, hold significant jobs in government, corporate or university laboratories, have relatives and friends in China, and travel there regularly to maintain contacts and participate in academic conferences.
Until recently, little of this would have provoked suspicion. But news reports of Chinese spying and attempts to buy political influence have changed the political climate, and NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and subsequent protests in Beijing have also charged the atmosphere.
"In this climate, many Chinese feel they are being watched all the time, as if they are not full citizens," said Chang-Lin Tien, the former chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley.
They have not forgotten the case of Qian Xuesen, a brilliant immigrant scientist who was accused without proof during the McCarthy era of being a Communist and held under house arrest for five years, said Dr. Tien, the first Chinese-American to head a major research university, and now a professor of mechanical engineering at Berkeley. Mr. Qian, who had helped develop the American rocket program, was finally deported to China. There, he led Beijing's missile program and became an icon in the country's quest to build a modern military.
The changed climate, Dr. Tien said, "makes many people think twice about working for the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy or national labs."
"We can't tolerate spies. But we need to be sensitive and careful. Mistakenly blaming the whole community for one person's action cannot be tolerated."
Xenophobia was the topic this month at a meeting of prominent Chinese-Americans and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose department supervises America's nuclear research laboratories. The meeting, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, drew a mixed crowd of Asian-Americans, including natives of the Chinese mainland, people who were born in Taiwan and Hong Kong and even Japanese-Americans.
Raymond Ng, a Chinese-American engineer at the Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., told Mr. Richardson that Americans who trace their roots to any part of Asia, from India to Japan, were under suspicion in their workplaces.
"Because of the incident at Los Alamos," Mr. Ng said, "promotions are being held back, we are concerned about discrimination in hiring and a cloud of suspicion appears to hang over all Asian Pacific Americans as a group."
Mr. Richardson told the group that he would not allow racial discrimination at the nuclear laboratories, but he acknowledged an atmosphere of distrust.
"I understand that Asian Pacific Americans are concerned that their loyalty and patriotism are being challenged," he said, adding, "I want to assure you that racial profiling will not be permitted."
To some extent, the suspicions of spying and political influence-buying by Chinese "are a hangover from history," said Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is writing a book on the Asian experience in America. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, barring Chinese immigration, was the only law in American history that singled out a nationality, Mr. Karnow said. "We've always had this lingering suspicion of sinister Chinese skulking about," he said.
But the accusations of espionage at Los Alamos also raise uncomfortable questions about divided loyalty for some Chinese in the United States.
"Frankly, when I bring it up in class, I can see my Chinese students squirm, especially those from the mainland," said Merle Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University and an expert on Chinese intellectuals.
"Loyalty is a big dilemma for Chinese intellectuals," Professor Goldman said. "They want to do everything to help their country regain its greatness, and part of that involves making China a great economic and military power."
Other experts caution that the overwhelming majority of the 2.5 million Chinese in the United States are patriotic Americans.
"One always has divided loyalties in a way, because you want your native country to thrive, but I don't sense that I have divided loyalties at all, because my loyalties are for the people, the language and the art, things that don't come in conflict with my new home in America," said Betty Bao Lord, the author of the best seller, "Spring Moon," and wife of the former ambassador to China, Winston Lord.
This division of loyalties fits a traditional distinction made by Chinese scholars in past centuries, a difference between loyalty to China, a kind of cultural loyalty, and loyalty to the dynasty, or political loyalty, said Weiming Tu, a professor of Chinese history and philosophy at Harvard University and director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute.
The complex emotions of many Chinese-Americans were on display at a banquet in Los Angeles for China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, during his April visit to the United States. Many of the 1,500 Chinese-Americans there wore Chinese outfits like silk gowns or the slit dress known as a qipao. Most speeches were in Mandarin, with little translation. Musicians played the Chinese national anthem. The two masters of ceremonies referred to Mr. Zhu as "our premier."
Such expressions of support for China do not strike Chinese-Americans as disloyal. Many at the banquet complained about the accusations of spying against Mr. Lee, saying that news reports tended to tar Chinese scientists in sensitive positions with the same brush.
Collin L. Lai, a retired aerospace engineer who was among the guests, said he was furious about news reports on the Lee case.
In some aerospace companies, "the unofficial language is Mandarin," Mr. Lai said, adding, "What are you going to do, throw us all out?"
In fact, many university physics departments are dependent on graduate students from China. Over all, students from mainland China account for 21 percent of foreign graduate students in physics departments, and this year foreign students make up half of all physics graduate students, said Roman Czujko of the American Institute of Physics.
A scientist from mainland China who works for the Xerox Corporation in Syracuse said that the espionage accusations had made him and his wife rethink their view of America.
"When we came here 10 years ago," he said, "we thought about staying here forever. After this incident, you really think that maybe this is not your homeland. If people don't like you here, why stay?"
The scientist said he was particularly outraged at the way some news reports described the Los Alamos accusations as "Chinese espionage," lumping together the Communist Government in Beijing and all Chinese everywhere, whatever their background, with little hard evidence.
Mr. Lee, the computer expert at Los Alamos, was born on Taiwan, where most residents are opposed to the Communist Government of mainland China.
To further complicate the situation, China does spy on the United States, just as the United States spies on China, and some spies for China have been caught and convicted.
In 1997, Peter H. Lee, a naturalized citizen from Taiwan who worked at Los Alamos, pleaded guilty to orally passing classified nuclear weapons information to Chinese scientists during a conference in Beijing, a set of facts much like the current accusations against Wen Ho Lee.
And China painstakingly trains spies for missions in the United States, according to a book to be published this year by Larry Engelman and his wife, Meihong Xu, a former lieutenant in intelligence in the Chinese Army. In the book, "Daughter of China: A True Story of Love and Betrayal," (John Wiley & Sons), Ms. Xu describes how she and other attractive young women were selected to be sent abroad, adopt new identities, get jobs, marry and then years later surface as spies for China.
Another factor that contributes to misunderstanding, Chinese say, is the inability of the American public, politicians and the news media to distinguish among different groups of Chinese in the United States.
The first immigrants from China were poor peasants who came in the 1850's to work in the gold mines or build the transcontinental railroads. Better-educated Chinese came as students in the 1930's, or as refugees from the Communists in the 1940's.
Until President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the immigration law in 1965, the total number of Chinese in the United States remained small, about a quarter of a million, according to the Census Bureau. But since then there has been an explosion of immigration -- graduate students from Taiwan, intellectuals from the mainland and working-class people from southern China, near Hong Kong -- so that the total is now about 2.5 million, the Population Reference Bureau says.
Professor Tien and others are concerned that Washington and the news media have been too quick to conclude that all of these people are subject to pressure from the Communist Government in Beijing, just because they are ethnically Chinese.
In both the campaign finance scandal, involving John Huang and Johnny Chung, and the Wen Ho Lee spy case, Professor Tien said, Americans have made the assumption that these individual Chinese were part of a plot orchestrated by top authorities in Beijing, despite a lack of hard evidence.
But Professor Tien also sees some progress.
"I came to the United States as a poor, penniless student, and I made it to become chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley," he said. "There has been tremendous improvement in civil rights in America. So we should be careful not to draw too sweeping a conclusion from those incidents."

HEADLINE: Station Has a Blueprint, but Still Needs Money

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Thirty-six years after New York City tore down the original Pennsylvania Station in an act so widely condemned that it spawned a campaign for historic preservation, President Clinton in a visit to Manhattan on Wednesday is to inaugurate the renovation of the old station's surviving sister, the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue, into a new railroad terminal.
Mr. Clinton's visit promises to provide political momentum to a project that has been planned and debated for six years and still lacks the final commitment of Government funds to cover its expected budget of $484 million, say officials involved in the project. 
 Although a White House spokeswoman, Julie Goldberg, said Mr. Clinton's visit was intended simply to "inaugurate the project," Federal officials said it was envisioned as a way to draw public attention to the architectural work that is now proposed, and to encourage Congress to approve the project.
"We have a terrific design and we thought it was time to show the world what is being planned," said Tony Bullock, the chief of staff to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has been the leading proponent of the project in Congress.
Another Federal official who has been at the center of planning for the project, Robert Peck, the Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, a branch of the General Services Administration, said that discussions in recent weeks had "put us in striking distance" of fully financing the project.
The original Penn Station was widely regarded as one of the city's best early 20th-century examples of neo-classical design before it was demolished to make way for Madison Square Garden, but the railroad station now being planned would be anchored by a distinctly modern addition of glass and steel girders.
Several involved in the project, including its principal architect, David M. Childs of the firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, said the design might surprise those who envision something closer to the ornate grandeur of the original Penn Station. But they said the demands of modern technology and huge crowds dictated a different approach.
"Someone who likes true classicism and takes the attitude of 'don't touch anything' is likely to be on the other side of the table from us," Mr. Childs said. But he added that his design would "honor the relationship between the modern and the classic."
Philip K. Howard, the chairman of the Municipal Art Society, an organization that has championed historic preservation in the three decades that followed the demolition of Pennsylvania Station, said he had reviewed the new design and fully supported it.
"Our principal concern has been to make a train station at a scale that would accommodate millions of visitors and tourists, and you can do that with modern design as well as classical design," he said.
To date, Mr. Moynihan has led a campaign that focused largely on reaching an agreement for shared use of the General Post Office, formally known as the James A. Farley Building, by the Postal Service and the proposed rail terminal.
Under agreements mediated in recent months by Mr. Peck, the Postal Service has agreed to vacate roughly a third of its space in the vast structure of 1.4 million square feet by the time construction begins. Mr. Peck said the Postal Service had also agreed to vacate the entire structure at an unspecified point in the future.
But the arrangement of shared space resulted from years of hard-fought negotiations in which some proponents of a new Penn Station had maintained that the postal operations should simply be moved out, and the Postal Service fought tenaciously to stay in what is one of the nation's largest and most historically distinguished postal buildings.
"The Post Office deserves a lot of credit at this point," said Charles A. Gargano, the senior economic adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki and chairman of the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, an agency established in 1996 with commitments of $75 million from the state and $25 million from the city.
From its inception, the project has depended on far greater commitments of Federal funds, particularly because its anticipated costs have risen. The current estimate of $484 million, provided by Mr. Gargano, is far higher than estimates a year ago that it would cost less than $350 million, and officials say the construction taking place elsewhere in New York City is likely to increase the cost more by creating a shortage of workers and material.
So far, commitments from Congress, the Department of Transportation and other Federal agencies have added $250 million to the amount available, but such aid remains contingent on Congressional votes in the future.
One fear, according to people involved in the project, is that members of Congress will reverse themselves and divert money from the project now that Alfonse M. D'Amato is no longer in the Senate after many years as a powerful voice on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
And even if no money is diverted, Mr. Gargano said, the project is still $134 million short of the present cost estimate. In any case, he said, the development agency he heads plans to adhere to a schedule of breaking ground in 2000 and completing the project in 2003.

HEADLINE: In the Wealthy Silicon Valley, a United Way Runs Dry

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
In what may be a leading indicator of how traditional social welfare agencies are struggling even as technology yields new riches, the United Way of Santa Clara County, in Silicon Valley, collapsed this month as donations slipped, a reserve fund once brimming with $11 million went dry, and on May 1 the agency ran out of money.
Donations to the Santa Clara United Way, the 30th largest in the nation, are expected to total $20 million in the current campaign, down 40 percent from the $32.6 million, adjusted for inflation, that the organization raised nine years ago. 
 The social services agencies it supports have faced even bigger cuts in the 1990's than these figures suggest, however, because the proportion of United Way money that donors designate to organizations other than social services agencies has been rising rapidly and now approaches half the total raised, said Michael E. Fox Sr., a San Jose beer distributor who is the United Way chairman in Santa Clara.
While Internet millionaires in Silicon Valley have drawn attention for multimillion-dollar gifts to higher education and major arts organizations, social services charities there say they struggle with flat or shrinking support and are often spurned by high-tech companies who see no link between their business interests and social services.
Congress has slashed financing for social services charities by 25 percent since 1996, according to a study sponsored by the Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York. Donations to social services charities have slipped about 6 percent since 1990, two other studies show.
To help the 100 agencies in Santa Clara County whose financing was abruptly cut by the United Way collapse, Community Foundation Silicon Valley, a charitable endowment, has created a fund.
The first contributor, Steve Kirsch, the founder of Infoseek, put up $1 million on Wednesday and announced that he had asked a Who's Who of Silicon Valley billionaires and wealthy executives to match his gift. As of yesterday, only Ebay, the Internet auction company, had announced that it would match Mr. Kirsch's gift.
Eleanor Jacobs, the president of the United Way until she was fired on May 6, said that in her four years in San Jose, she approached many high-tech companies only to be told that the social services needs of the county were not important.
"The Silicon Valley way of life is one of the best in the country," Mrs. Jacobs said, "but I don't know that there is a grasp on the part of residents that there are people who need basic social services -- shelters for battered wives, mental health services. I dealt with a number of companies whose officials said, 'Our employees make this much money and they do not need these services, so why are you here?' "
Mrs. Jacobs said she also tried to meet with 12 wealthy Silicon Valley residents about supporting United Way, but 8 of them would not even give her an appointment.
Jennifer Tait, executive director of Friends Outside, which depended on United Way for 20 percent of the money it spends on counseling, job referrals and other help to families who have relatives in jail, said she had encountered similar responses. But Mrs. Tait said the fault may lie with the charities themselves.
"Perhaps in this valley," Mrs. Tait said, "we have done a poor job of educating the public" about how social ills spread when there are no services available.
United Way of America officials sought to portray Silicon Valley as an anomaly. Giving to United Way in other high-tech centers is rising. The officials cited the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, with the biggest growth, up threefold since 1984. And King County, Wash., and the high-tech community around Seattle -- which has about the same population as Santa Clara County -- raised $68.5 million in the current campaign, more than three times the amount raised in Santa Clara.
The level of giving in King County "disproves the claim that young people in high-tech industries will not give for social services," said Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley, which has a $240 million endowment.
King County relies heavily for support on workers at Boeing and Costco and on support drummed up by the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates 3d, whose parents were long active in United Way.
Betty Beene, president of United Way of America, which represents 1,300 local United Ways, said the collapse in San Jose "is about a director with a good heart who made overly optimistic projections about pledges and who was trying to deal with a very high level of designations," in which donors directed which charities received their gifts.
After Mrs. Jacobs was hired in 1995, she expanded the Santa Clara United Way staff to 77 from 52 even though donations were flat. Last fall, the board approved her request for a $1 million line of credit without inquiring about the state of the organization's finances, said Mr. Fox, who holds the volunteer position of Santa Clara United Way board chairman.
In February, Mrs. Jacobs laid off 32 staff members, but the board was not aware that she had paid each dismissed employee a month's pay for each year on the payroll, at a total cost of $1 million.
Mr. Fox, who is also on 34 other charity and civic boards, said he had learned last week that $3 million of pledges from businesses were made orally and are now worthless.
Mrs. Jacobs said written letters were never sent to confirm the pledges and no event was held to introduce these businesses to United Way. She said that when the flow of donations fell, she did not call in the member agencies to tell them they would have to take less "because I did not want to anger them and upset them. I guess, with what happened, it would have been better if I did."
Margie Diaz Kintz, an Intel Foundation director, and Joseph Valentine, former president of the San Francisco United Way, will temporarily run the Santa Clara County United Way and try to keep it out of bankruptcy proceedings, United Way officials said.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: CHINA;
Embassy Blast Churns Political Tea Leaves

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 15

 BODY:
Why did Zhu Rongji, China's popular Prime Minister, cry on TV?
At the end of a tumultuous week when student-led protests and Government-run media dovetailed in a remarkable show of nationalist frenzy, one of the main questions haunting Politburo-watchers in China is why Mr. Zhu shed tears when he and other leaders appeared at memorial services for three Chinese killed in the accidental bombing by NATO of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
 Beyond the first reason, that even a politician as hard-boiled as Mr. Zhu was genuinely overcome by emotion for the tragic deaths of three fellow citizens, Chinese analysts and journalists say that politics also helped darken Mr. Zhu's demeanor. The political stakes in China's current outburst of nationalism are high, and the overriding question of the day is: Has Mr. Zhu been hurt?
Mr. Zhu, seen by many ordinary Chinese as the best hope for combating corruption and transforming the moribund state sector of the economy, is suddenly vulnerable to accusations by rivals that he is too soft on the United States, the country Chinese seem both to love and to hate.
Fresh from his trip to Washington in April, when he made broad concessions on trade issues but failed to win China's entry to the World Trade Organization, Mr. Zhu is being accused of humiliating his country by selling out its interests and getting nothing in return, particularly by officials threatened by Mr. Zhu's reforms.
Now that China's extensive political machinery is issuing spirited nationalist edicts and speeches to be studied and recited by local officials in every province of China, Mr. Zhu's reform program appears certain to be slowed. Even if Mr. Zhu's political standing is not seriously diminished by attacks from opponents, he will doubtless have to delay or soften his more aggressive reforms.
For political scorekeepers who scour the official media for clues to the power struggle that inevitably intensifies during a political crisis, even though it remains hidden, the main event this week was state television's news broadcast on Wednesday evening.
It showed little besides a formal mourning routine by six of China's top leaders at ceremonies for the three Chinese who were killed, recorded in minute detail. Yet in China, even a simple event may offer hints whose political implications are debated by viewers for days afterward.
On Wednesday's broadcast, starting with President Jiang Zemin, each leader performed the same solemn triple bow before photographs of the dead, and then moved slowly down a receiving line of relatives, shaking hands and giving condolences.
The broadcast was clearly intended to convey the leadership's sympathy for the victims of the bombing, since leaders are sensitive to accusations, from students and military officers and conservative politicians, that the official response to the bombing has been too weak.
Mr. Jiang, whose nickname among Chinese journalists is the Actor because of his attempts to stage his appearance at news events, looked saddened and solemn as he shook hands with the grieving families.
Next in line was Li Peng, chairman of China's legislature, who is deeply unpopular for presiding over the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989. Mr. Li appeared to avoid looking at the people with whom he shook hands, achieving less than the desired effect.
Then came Mr. Zhu. He looked each relative in the eye, in silence. His distressed expression said it all: This is unspeakably sad, and I feel your pain. By the time he reached the end of the line, Mr. Zhu was crying and looked genuinely moved. It was a virtuoso performance, several Chinese journalists said.
"Zhu is already the most popular leader among common people," said a magazine editor in Beijing who watched the broadcast. "In a crisis, everyone looks to see how the leadership acts. Zhu did best, in that one moment."
Yet Mr. Zhu's tears also meant something more, the editor said.
"His expression said, 'This is a terrible thing for China,' " the editor explained. "Not just the families, not just China's image, but also the whole economic reform process, which could be affected."
Other close observers of the week's events debated whether Mr. Zhu's tears were a warning to sophisticated viewers, or an appeal for support from fellow Communist Party members, or something else.
"If he were seriously under attack, he would not appear on television at all," said an official at a state-run company who follows politics closely. "I think he was trying to look humble."
The official pointed to another clue, which came on the following day's television broadcast, where China's leaders were shown going to the hospital to visit several Chinese diplomats who were wounded in the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade, and have returned to Beijing.
Rather than show each of the top leaders comforting separate wounded people, as such broadcasts often do, Mr. Jiang and Mr. Li and Mr. Zhu and three other top leaders trooped into each hospital room together. It involved awkward camera work to get them all on screen at the same time, but the effort was made.
"There's only one reason to show them all together, rather than separately," the official said. "The message is that they are united. Whether or not it is true, that is the message."
Almost exactly 10 years ago, China's leading political reformer and Communist Party chief at the time, Zhao Ziyang, made a tearful appearance on national television as he visited hunger-striking student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square just two weeks before the violent crackdown.
It was the last time Mr. Zhao was seen in public. He has been under house arrest ever since.
Mr. Zhu does not seem to be in any imminent danger of dismissal. China's media, by the end of the week, were reporting the activities of Mr. Jiang, Mr. Li and Mr. Zhu in that order, in keeping with their ranking in the Communist Party hierarchy.
Another Chinese journalist pointed out that many people took note when Mr. Zhu said just before going to the United States last month that he actually did not want to go, but that Mr. Jiang had specifically insisted that he do so.
Chinese leaders take few important decisions unilaterally, the journalist said, so Mr. Zhu's statement, though it sounded simple, indicated that it was a collective decision of the leadership that he should go ahead with his trip, implying that a collective responsibility must be borne if things did not go well.
In the 14 months since he was appointed Prime Minister, Mr. Zhu has won loyal admirers and bitter enemies by taking bold steps to kill off unproductive sectors of China's economy.
The sweeping concessions he offered in Washington during his visit there last month were specifically aimed at winning entry to the World Trade Organization, but more generally aimed at forcing open change-resistant parts of China's telecommunications, banking and financial services industries.
Mr. Zhu is also said to be resented by some of his top colleagues, with less talent for public speaking, because he is so appealing, direct and humorous in public.
Yet one of Mr. Zhu's enduring political weaknesses, Chinese analysts say, is that he is so popular among Western businessmen and officials, who appreciate his direct manner. At a time of strong anti-American sentiment, that vulnerability can only become more pronounced.

NATO Admits Civilian Attack
NATO said it had attacked a military commmand post in southern Kosovo and acknowledged that scores of civilians had been accidentally killed as a result. NATO said it had not been aware that ethnic Albanian refugees were in the area, and allied officials suggested that Serbian forces might have invited them into the area to use them as "human shields" against allied air attacks. 1
 
The Pentagon is blocking a plan by the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, to send Apache helicopters into combat against Serbian troops. Seeking to bolster allied firepower, General Clark has pressed Washington to authorize the final combat preparations for the helicopters, but the Pentagon sees the mission as too risky. 1
 
NATO's mistaken bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade has the Clinton Administration bracing for a deep deterioration in bilateral ties. One casualty of the bombing could be the Administration's concept of a "strategic partnership" with Beijing, officials said. 11

But in building their business, the Ciprianis have waged pitched battles with union labor, specifically Local 6 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, while at times antagonizing clients, investors, food critics and others in the restaurant industry. Some restaurant experts cite the family's union troubles and other perceived missteps as evidence that its domination of the industry is far from a sure thing. 37
 
Campaigning as the First Lady
As Hillary Rodham Clinton's advisers contemplate the unprecedented event of a sitting First Lady running for United States Senate, they are beginning to realize that there are pitfalls as well as advantages inherent in Mrs. Clinton's status. 37
 
A Nuclear Plant's Future
Within a few years, the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant will run out of space to store the radioactive waste. The future of the spent fuel and the plant itself is very much up in the air, caught in a tangle of questions about the economics of nuclear power, the deregulation of the energy industry and the environmental safety of nuclear-waste disposal. And the uncertainty has left some of the plant's neighbors in Buchanan, N.Y., deeply uneasy. 37

SERIES: RESEARCH FOR HIRE -- First of two articles

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD and GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
When Thomas W. Parham visited his doctor in the summer of 1995, he expected just another routine checkup. But his doctor had something else in mind.
The doctor, Peter Arcan, suggested Mr. Parham might want to join a study of a new drug to shrink enlarged prostates, according to records of the encounter. Mr. Parham was puzzled -- his prostate was fine. But Dr. Arcan brushed aside the retired metal worker's questions, saying the experimental drug might prevent future problems. Satisfied, Mr. Parham, a 64-year-old resident of La Habra, Calif., agreed to participate. 
 But there was one question Mr. Parham did not ask: What was in it for Dr. Arcan?
The answer was money. The drug's maker, SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., was paying $1,610 for each patient that doctors signed up -- money that covered study expenses while allowing a portion to end up as profit for Dr. Arcan and his associates.
Mr. Parham had no idea. "Nothing was mentioned about money," he said in an interview. "It's a situation where you have faith in your doctor." Through his secretary, Dr. Arcan declined comment.
With his decision, Mr. Parham had unwittingly joined hundreds of thousands of other patients recruited by their personal physicians into a booming venture: the business of testing experimental drugs on people.
Once clinical research was a staid enterprise primarily administered by academic researchers driven by a desire for knowledge, fame or career advancement. Now, it is a multibillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of testing and drug companies working with thousands of private doctors.
In this new industry, patients have become commodities, bought and traded by testing companies and doctors. Almost daily, the industry urges doctors to join the gold rush, bombarding them with faxes and letters blaring such come-ons as "Improve Your Cash Flow" and "Discover the Secret For Obtaining More Funded Studies." In an era of managed care, the pleas are seductive: the number of private doctors in research since 1990 has almost tripled, and top recruiters can earn as much as $500,000 to $1 million a year.
This new system is a boon for drug companies because it reaches out to a vast pool of test subjects who have never before been available for experimentation. But it also injects the interests of a giant industry into the delicate doctor-patient relationship, usually without the patient realizing it.
These changes have prompted little public debate, mostly because the full scope of what is happening is hidden. The industry treats research agreements as corporate secrets and contractually forbids doctors to disclose them. As a result, few people outside the industry, including Government officials, have seen the contracts or know the magnitude of the money involved.
But in a 10-month investigation, The New York Times obtained such contracts and thousands of other confidential documents that present a view of the research industry that has never before been available.
These records, and interviews with participants, reveal a system fueling a pharmaceutical renaissance, but fraught with conflicts of interest; that places a premium on speed and meeting quotas; that relies on Government and private monitoring that can be easily fooled and that some researchers said is inadequate, and that secretly offers a share of the cash to other health professionals who might influence patients to join a study. At bottom, the only thing separating a trusting patient from a study that could be inappropriate or potentially harmful is the judgment of a doctor torn by these unseen conflicts and pressures.
The documents, including contracts, protocols or related financial records from more than 300 recent drug studies, were provided by a number of people in the industry concerned about its direction. The Times also conducted a computer analysis of more than 200,000 filings with the Government and related data submitted by doctors who want to conduct research, and interviewed doctors, patients, ethicists, industry executives and Government officials.
These are among the specific findings of The Times's investigation:
*Drug companies and their contractors offer large payments to doctors, nurses and other medical staff to encourage them to recruit patients quickly. And doctors do not even have to conduct trials to get paid: There are finder's fees for those who refer their patients to other doctors conducting research.
*Doctors who recruit the most patients receive additional perquisites, such as the right to claim a coveted authorship of published papers about the studies -- even though the true author is a ghost writer using an analysis from the drug company. Those who fail to meet the recruitment goals are usually dropped from future studies.
*Testing companies often use doctors as clinical investigators regardless of their specialty, at times leaving patients in the care of doctors who know little about their condition. For example, psychiatrists have conducted Pap smears and asthma specialists have dispensed experimental psychiatric drugs.
*A growing number of doctors conducting drug research have limited experience as clinical investigators, raising questions among some experts about the quality of their data.
In interviews, industry officials and researchers said the emerging drug-approval system was dedicated to quality and offers significant benefits. Since patients are seeing their own doctors, researchers said, it adds a level of continuity and personal contact to the process -- something unavailable from full-time researchers.
Moreover, industry officials said, the new pool of test subjects is a resource of incalculable value that is allowing the development of an avalanche of new compounds. Drug tests "can get delayed if the patients aren't out there and available," said Chris Kuebler, the chairman and chief executive at Covance Inc., a giant testing company.
But some experts said patients were being pushed to participate in the studies because of the financial interests of their doctors.
Doctors working as researchers "are enticing and cajoling patients who are in no position to resist their blandishments to enter clinical studies," said Dr. David S. Shimm, a member of the ethics committee at Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver who has written about research conflicts.
"What the patients are not seeing is that the clinical investigator is really a dual agent with divided loyalties between the patient and the pharmaceutical company," he said.
While patients must sign detailed consent forms to enroll in drug studies, they are often in no position to question their doctor's suggestion that they join.
"The physician has enormous power over you," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, who himself recently agreed to participate in a clinical trial run by his doctor -- in part because he feared annoying him -- and who had no idea that money might be involved. "You want to keep his favor. If you say no, you'll worry that he may not like you."
That is what happened with Mr. Parham and Dr. Arcan. In joining the study, Mr. Parham said: "I just followed his advice, just like if he said to take two aspirin instead of one. He's a doctor and I'm not."
In truth, Mr. Parham should never have been signed up for the prostate study. According to his medical records, he had been hospitalized the previous year with a chronic slow heart rate, a condition that specifically disqualified him for the study. But, saying that Mr. Parham's heart rate was only mildly slow, an administrator handling the paperwork for Dr. Arcan sought an exemption from SmithKline. Based on those representations, the drug company granted the exemption; it was not told about Mr. Parham's earlier hospitalization.
Soon after joining, Mr. Parham complained of fatigue, a symptom of his slow heart rate. Dr. Arcan dismissed the complaints as emotional. Within weeks, Mr. Parham asked to be dropped from the study. Days later he was hospitalized and given a pacemaker; Mr. Parham never brought legal action and it is impossible to know whether his participation in the study affected his heart condition.
His experience underscores a potential danger of the emerging drug-testing system: Doctors with money at stake may persuade patients to take drugs that are inappropriate or even unsafe. Under the current system of monitoring, such actions are almost impossible to catch and no statistics are collected on such events. Within the industry, most of the planning focuses on conducting studies quickly. Patient issues, some researchers said, are often lost in the rush.
"You go to the trade meetings on clinical research; you go for two entire days, and patients are not mentioned," said Dr. Robert M. Califf, the director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, an academic drug-testing center in Durham, N.C., affiliated with Duke University. "The patient is an object to make money. Having patients is just the dirty price for doing business."
 
The Incentives Putting a Price On Every Patient
The letter last July from Merck & Company was nothing if not sympathetic. The company recognized that doctors involved in its study of a hypertension medication were having trouble finding qualified patients. And so, with the letter, Merck offered a little encouragement for them to work harder.
Instead of paying $2,955 for each test subject enrolled, Merck offered $500 more in the study comparing the drug Losartan with a placebo. For those doctors who enrolled their quota of 14 patients by Sept. 30, the company would kick in an additional $2,000 -- making that 14th patient worth $5,455 if recruited in time, and the entire group potentially worth more than $50,000.
"We will forward the first check as soon as the first four additional patients are enrolled," the letter said.
After discovering how effective paying doctors to recruit patients can be, the drug industry has opened the financial floodgates. Special cash bonuses for signing up specified numbers of people by a given date, a practice once unheard of in clinical research, are becoming part of the landscape. Moreover, those payments -- to private doctors, research firms and even to university medical centers -- are only one of a number of incentives that are being dangled by drug and testing companies to entice the medical community.
There are payments to everyone in the system who can come up with a patient, from other doctors who refer them for research to the study coordinators in the researcher's office who screen patients to see if they qualify.
None of these benefits are scrutinized by Government regulators, who said in interviews that they saw little difference between providing grants for university research and paying doctors directly. For academics "the money is just as important as with the internal medicine guy trying to beat the H.M.O.," said Dr. Murray M. Lumpkin, the deputy director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.
But unlike block grants, today's incentives can grow almost day by day, if the doctor works the way the drug companies want. And the variety of the incentives is almost endless.
The most basic form of compensation is a flat fee paid for each patient enrolled. The amount of money paid to the researchers varies widely, depending on the complexity of the study, the number of tests involved and the difficulty in finding patients.
For example, in 1996, a study of a migraine drug sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceutica, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, paid doctors $3,600 for each enrollment. Another study that year sponsored by Organon Inc. on a new birth control pill paid $1,100 for each patient. And a Wyeth-Ayerst study of drugs for hormone replacement in women paid $4,581.
While all of these payments were made to specific clinics, the exact amounts on a single test could vary slightly by region, or even by clinic.
Many executives from drug or testing companies refused to discuss their research programs, citing confidentiality. Those who did grant interviews gave consistent explanations of their payments: They are necessary compensation for the doctors' work.
"We set up contracts that hopefully reimburse investigators adequately for the time they put in to screen patients, bring them in, and provide data to us that is as clean as possible," Dr. Elizabeth Stoner, the vice president for clinical research and contract management at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., said.
Additional payments can be made, she said, when there is "additional effort above and beyond what they anticipated."
But doctors who are particularly successful in recruiting study patients and keeping down their costs can make huge profits.
"There are physicians who can net about $500,000 to $1 million a year doing clinical research," said Ismail A. Shalaby, the chief executive of Nema Research Inc., a network of doctors and hospitals in the Baltimore area performing clinical research. "And that is not bad."
The benefits to the doctors who conduct research are not simply financial. Once, researchers said, the names that appeared on papers describing drug studies were those of the actual authors. That is no longer always the case. Today, the coveted right to claim authorship is often just another reward for doctors who recruit the most patients -- even if they wrote nothing and analyzed no data.
"They used to ask you to write," said Dr. Thierry Le Jemtel, a cardiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx who is a longtime academic researcher. "Now, they send you a paper all written by a medical writer" hired by the drug company.
Dr. Jay Grossman, a private-practice doctor who is an allergy and respiratory specialist with Vivra Asthma and Allergy Inc. in Tucson, Ariz., said he was often a lead author on publications because he had been a top patient recruiter in the clinical trials, even though he rarely did much -- if any -- of the actual writing. "That's common," he said. "It's orchestrated by the drug company's medical writer."
For example, Dr. Grossman cited a study for a SmithKline Beecham asthma medication that was published in The Journal of Asthma and another on an allergy medication sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. While the articles are written by a drug company writer, Dr. Grossman said, he often suggests modifications.
As drug companies compete for top study doctors who will quickly accrue patients, a financial arms race has developed, with each company seeking new ways to use cash and benefits to spur the research.
One practice is to offer finder's fees to doctors who are not conducting studies for referring patients to doctors who are. For example, a letter from a testing company handling the research on a vaginal suppository for the Bayer Corporation in 1996 promised "a $75 referral fee for physicians and area/federally funded clinics, i.e., Planned Parenthood, etc."
Even study coordinators -- the nurses and medical assistants who oversee the administrative details of a study and screen patients to see if they qualify -- are offered fees for finding test subjects. In 1995, for example, Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc. of Wilmington, N.C., which coordinates drug tests, needed a way to speed up enrollment in a study of a drug developed by the Zambon Corporation in East Rutherford, N.J.
So the company sent a fax to medical staff members who were screening patients around the country, offering them bonuses for fast enrollment.
"EVERY study coordinator has the chance to receive $750 just by reaching the enrollment goal of 30 evaluable patients," the fax said. "So GET BUSY!"
The stepped-up competition among drug companies for the services of doctors led to the development of cash bonuses for them, one of the most controversial incentives now offered. But even companies that were uncomfortable with the idea found it hard to resist.
"It's a tough issue," said Dr. Cynthia M. Dunn, the director of the Clinical Research Institute at the University of Rochester and a former drug industry executive. "On one hand, many companies recognize it's part of what we have to do to be competitive. On the other hand, they recognize they are setting up potential conflicts of interest" for doctors.
Some large drug companies have refused to offer bonuses out of ethical concerns. "You don't want to provide an advantage that can be misinterpreted," said Dr. Joseph Camardo, the senior vice president of clinical research and development for Wyeth-Ayerst Research in Radnor, Pa.
The bonuses all reward the same behavior: enrolling patients fast. For example, a contract last year by Ibah Inc., a testing company owned by Omnicare Inc., provided a $750 bonus for each patient enrolled by June 15 or $500 for those enrolled between June 15 and July 16 -- upping the ante for doctors whose enrollments were lagging.
Such incentives outrage some experts. Bonuses in clinical research are "inappropriate, potentially illegal and certainly unethical," Dr. Robert Tenery, a Dallas doctor who is the chairman of the council on ethical and judicial affairs for the American Medical Association, said of such payments in general. "Why would you get an extra $500? How can you explain the rationale? Maybe you took a patient who really didn't need to be enrolled."
If something goes wrong, doctors might never be able to escape the nagging doubt that the bonus program was to blame. "How would you like to confront the family when a family member got hurt, and you got a bonus for enrolling?" asked Michael Leahey, the director of the office of clinical trials at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.
A system that offers so much cash and so many benefits for quick recruitment assumes that doctors would never allow money to distort their judgment -- in this case by causing them to put undue pressure on reluctant patients or to include patients who do not qualify. But the assumption that doctors can resist financial temptations has been proved wrong repeatedly in other situations.
For example, throughout much of the 1980's, doctors could refer patients to treatment centers -- such as physical or radiation therapy sites -- in which they had a stake. The practice was outlawed after studies found that doctors were overusing treatments and tests when they had financial interests in the centers that provided them. A 1992 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that doctors with investments in radiation sites prescribed such treatment as much as 60 percent more often than those without the financial conflict.
With such studies demonstrating the effects of financial incentives on doctors, experts who have studied these conflicts said they were troubled by the emergence of research for hire.
"You have a recipe for trouble or abuse," said Marc A. Rodwin, an associate professor of law and public policy at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University and the author of a book on financial conflicts in medicine. "The risk is that the doctor will subconsciously downplay the risks or overplay the benefits" of a particular study in order to persuade a patient to participate.
Complicating matters, companies sometimes fail to consider how difficult it will be to find patients to meet the requirements they set for admission into a study. Then, when recruitment falls short of expectations, they offer to pay more to meet an unrealistic goal -- looking, for example, for patients with a disease that their drug can treat but who have no other health problems that could affect the study.
"The simplest solution that inexperienced people think of first is to increase the number of sites or to increase the amount of money you're offering," said Dr. Bert Spilker, the senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group for large drug companies. "You can offer to triple the amount of money and it will make zero difference if the doctors are doing everything they can do. It may be that the patients don't exist."
But, with so much money dangling in front of them, doctors could be tempted to bend the rules to get patients into studies, and could get away with it, according to Dr. Martha L. Elks, an associate dean at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. "Let's say you're dealing with an angina study where the requirement for entry is a certain level of pain on a certain number of days of the week," Dr. Elks said. And "suppose the patient's history is not quite that but is borderline."
Dr. Elks said she overheard two doctors talking recently about bonuses. One was telling the other that he would get $500 if he could sign up some patients in the next 24 hours.
"I knew this guy," Dr. Elks said. "He is a practitioner of the highest ethics." But, she said, "he was talking about how to massage entry criteria."
Dr. Elks said she then noisily cleared her throat. "I sort of a-hummed," she said, at which point the doctors "stepped back for a minute," suddenly realizing what one of them had been saying.
What happened next, she said, she was not privy to know.
 
The Doctors Drug Trials Provide New Source of Income
The year was 1989, and Dr. Stuart R. Weiss was bored with private practice.
To liven up his work, the San Diego endocrinologist tried his hand at drug studies. It was an audacious idea -- at the time most trials were conducted by university scientists. But Dr. Weiss worked hard to convince a skeptical drug industry to take a chance on someone with his background.
"I beat the bushes," he said. "I lobbied long and hard with several organizations to give me a shot."
Eventually, he focused on a Merck study of a new drug to treat osteoporosis, a degenerative bone disease. To show his eagerness, he offered to fly to New Jersey to meet with Merck executives at their world headquarters. Then Dr. Weiss went further, spending his own money to buy an expensive piece of equipment that measures bone density. Merck finally gave in, asking him to find 20 patients.
He came up with 40.
And there, in the entrepreneurial spirit displayed by Dr. Weiss, lay the solution to a problem that was suddenly dogging the pharmaceutical industry -- the slow pace of research in university laboratories.
For decades, drug companies had been able to increase their prices almost at will, and thus had little incentive to develop new products. For the comparatively small number of drugs the companies did test, they turned to a trusted group of medical school researchers who dictated how trials were conducted. And the drug companies had to wait in line: Research financed by Government grants was far more prestigious; in the eyes of many academics, drug-company trials were to research what McDonald's hamburgers were to food.
In those days, researchers were reimbursed much differently than they are today. Payments went to the university, not to the investigator. The university doctors were often paid a flat fee for their work, no matter how many patients they actually enrolled.
Then, in the early 1990's, the economics of drug development changed. Managed care put the squeeze on drug prices, leaving companies one option: increase the number of drugs they were selling. As a result, the companies began a rush to drug development, something that was aided by reforms at the Food and Drug Administration that speeded up the approval process for new drugs.
Companies at first turned to their coterie of medical school researchers, but found the academic world was incapable of adapting rapidly to the increasingly intense competition.
"We had concretized bureaucracies," Dr. David R. Bickers, chairman of the dermatology department at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said of the academic response. "And for companies, time is money. Companies figure that out."
Quickly, the drug companies began recruiting a new breed of private-practice doctors like Dr. Weiss, willing to mine their patient base for research subjects.
The transformation is evident in a Times computer analysis of thousands of forms submitted each year to the Food and Drug Administration from doctors wanting to conduct research. According to the analysis, 11,662 private doctors conducted drug studies in 1997, almost three times the number in 1990, when 4,307 doctors conducted such studies. And while the number of researchers and medical schools also grew in that period -- to 4,431 from 2,225 -- their share of the business dropped from a third, to a quarter of the total, according to the analysis.
Private-practice doctors in research said the change was for the better, because the doctor was not simply tending to the patient's needs for the few weeks of a study, but often for a lifetime. "Even though the physician may want to make money, the moment he sits across from the patient, he is not only responsible to himself, he is responsible to that patient," said Dr. Norman Zinner, a Los Angeles doctor who in 1994 formed Affiliated Research Centers, an organization of private-practice urologists who conduct drug studies. "I have got to look you in the eye. I have got to see you again."
Not only that, these doctors said, but participation in research allows them to know the latest ideas for treatment. "I really feel I can offer my patients more," said Dr. Grossman of Vivra Asthma and Allergy. "I know more what the cutting edge is. I know what will be the recommended therapy two years from now."
Because anyone licensed to practice medicine is eligible to be a researcher, medical communities have been transformed in towns where the onslaught of managed care spawned legions of doctors scrambling to replace lost income. In 1980, when clinical research was the fief of medical schools, there were only eight projects in Tucson, Ariz., and all but two were at hospitals affiliated with the University of Arizona. Today, researchers are scattered in offices dotting the city -- in places like the sun-baked barrios and the homely strip malls -- conducting 157 studies in 1997 alone. Drug studies, and with them the competition for patients, have become as common in Tucson as the towering saguaro cactus.
Now, with federally financed research on the wane, it is the academic researchers who are banging on the doors of the drug companies, asking for a second chance. But they are finding it hard to keep up with the private doctors, who have shown themselves more willing to sign contracts overnight, advertise widely, offer financial incentives for patients and open their offices at unusual times to accommodate patient schedules.
"It's very difficult to conduct drug studies at the medical school because of the competition" from private doctors, said Dr. Mark A. Brown, a pediatric asthma specialist at the University of Arizona. "It's difficult to find patients."
To keep up with the competition from private doctors, some academic medical centers have recently begun setting up research divisions to draw on their own private patients for drug studies. But it is a fledgling effort, limited to a handful of universities.
Still, some junior faculty members are now abandoning academia to get into the drug-study business. Dr. Andrew Cutler, a psychiatrist, left the faculty at the University of Chicago to join the Psychiatric Institute of Florida in Orlando, a private practice with a research business. Then last year, he formed his own company, Coordinated Research of Florida, to perform drug studies full time.
Without a patient base to draw from for studies, Dr. Cutler found other ways to recruit subjects, including serving as a nursing home consultant.
"I will strategically pick a nursing home that has a large population that meets the criteria for a study," he said. "If there is a large community practice in town, I may work out a referral arrangement, or make them a co-investigator, and the arrangement is that they would be providing the patients."
But the industry is not passively waiting for doctors to knock on its door. Instead, over the last few years it has been aggressively recruiting doctors with the lure of cash. Every day, in hundreds of medical offices around the country, blandishments arrive by fax, mail and E-mail, encouraging doctors to grab their piece of the research pie.
"Discover the secret for obtaining more funded studies," says a 1992 letter to doctors from Research Investigator's Source, which charges $275 to place doctors' profiles on lists of researchers consulted by drug companies.
A 1998 letter from Clinmark Dotcom, an on-line listing service for researchers based in Irvine, Calif., offered to list doctors for $350 the first year and $195 in the second. But the letter made no secret about the reasons to join.
"Investigator grants average $ 43,000 per study," it said.
Then there are the ubiquitous seminars, sponsored by the industry, with enticing titles to attract doctors, both fledgling and experienced in studies. Some teach the basics, with such titles as "How to Find Clinical Trials: A Physician's Perspective" and "How to Develop or Evaluate a Patient Recruitment Media Plan."
But nothing captured the transformation of research more than a seminar on clinical trials in Nashville, sponsored in 1996 by Associates of Clinical Pharmacology, a professional association.
The title? "Successful Patient Recruitment: The Heart and Soul of Your Business."
Quality questions
Testing Puts Value On Speed Above All
Doctors and drug company executives milled around a racing car parked on the floor of the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center in Boston last year, waiting their turn to be photographed at the wheel. Nearby, other images of speed dotted the exhibit hall at the annual meeting of the Drug Information Association, an industry trade group. Checkered flags appeared on corporate booths and T-shirts. One exhibit featured a giant photograph of a cheetah; another showed a mural of a horse race.
To some at the meeting on drug development in the global marketplace, the images were a perfect metaphor for the industry today: The push to finish trials quickly and move the drugs onto the market has overshadowed every other goal.
"A few years ago it was 'better, faster, cheaper,'" said M. Jane Ganter, the editor in chief of Applied Clinical Trials, an industry publication. "Nobody is saying 'better' or 'cheaper' anymore. The big emphasis is on speed."
The driving forces behind the desire for faster studies are the industry's financial stakes. With the clock ticking on a new drug's patent even as it is being tested, every day's delay is revenue that will never be earned. "Time is money," said James Patricelli, an analyst of the drug-testing industry worry that such singlemindedness has led testing companies to tap an increasing number of doctors with little or no experience in drug testing and only a fuzzy understanding of the rules.
The Times analysis showed that during the 1990's, 70 percent of the doctors conducting human experiments had been involved in three or fewer previous drugs studies, a number unlikely to give them mastery over the process. A quarter of all doctors who did human expriments in 1997, the last year for which complete data are available, conducted only one experiment.
"Some of the companies would be embarrassed if they saw the quality of the people doing the research," said Dr. Angela Bowen, the president of the Western Institutional Review Board, a private ehtics board based in Olympia, Wash., that reviews proposed research on human subjects. "I call them clueless."
One reason may be the predominance of generalists taking part in the studies. The studies test drugs for particular diseases, like asthma, in which a doctor's experience and specialized training are crucial in making assessments such as distinguing between drug reactions and disease symptoms. But doctors conducting clinical trials often have no particular expertise in the disease they are treating. The Times computer analysis showed that the largest single group of doctors conducting investigations was general internists; one in five was either a general internist or a family practioner. These, of course, are the doctors most Americans see for checkups and are thus the industry's most efficient recruiters.
But some doctors who do clinical research say that they often are offered studies that would require them to stretch far beyond their areas of medical expertise.
"I wouldn't do studies for hematology or neurology or lung disease or epilepsy," said Dr. Roy Fleischmann, the chief executive of Rheumatology Research International, a national network of clinical research sites that specialize in arthritis and skeletal diseases. But, he said, "We get calls about them all the time."
Not every doctor has the power of refuse.
"There was a lot of pressure for me to do things I did not feel comfortable doing," said Dr. Claudia Baldassano, a psychiatrist and neurologist who worked for a commercial research center on the East Coast. "They though because I have an M.D., I should be comfortable doing all studies."
She said, for example, that she was asked to do Pap smears as part of a study of hormone replacement and was asked to treat patients with diabetes.
"I said I hadn't done a Pap smear since medical school, and I didn't feel comfortable," she said.
For the diabetes study, "I said how could you expct a physician who is not trained" as a diabetes specialist to run the trials, she said. "I was told by a vice president of operations that I could do diabetic studies with my eyes closed."
In the end, Dr. Baldassano stood her ground on the diabetes study, but participated in the one on hormone replacement. She resigned from the business after just a few months, and now works in academic research.
Why would drug companies accept research even from doctors who doubt their own expertise? Because, experts said, the industry has grown so quickly that no one has yet developed a good measurement of quality. Drug companies are left to review two factors: speed and cost. Systems of measurement for quality "haven't been established to differentiate these companies," said Dr. Patricelli of Dain Rauscher.
In an attempt to protect the quality of date and patients, the Government and industry have put into effect some means of oversight. The first line of defense for the integrity of the data is the dispatch of study monitors employed by the testing companies to the doctors' offices to pore over the test results.
But the explosive growth of the industry has left experienced monitors in short supply.
As a result, "They utilize some people who have very little experience in the disease entity, or the drug, or in pharmacology," said Dr. Fleischmann of Rheumatology Research International. The monitors "don't understand what they are doing."
"They are looking for boxes to fill in," he said.
For example, he said, the most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, is also called "degenerative joint disease." A testing company monitor who came to examine his data announced that his patients were not qualified for the study because she did not know the two terms meant the same thing, he said.
"If they don't have that knowledge," Dr. Fleischmann asked, "how can they read a chart and know what is real and what is not real?"
Some experts said there was a decided difference between the quality of monitors who work for the drug industry and those who work for the testing companies. Monitors sent by testing companies can be so unknowledgeable, said Margaret Chokreff, the president of Margaret Chokreff & Associates, which works with a network of private doctors conducting research in Ohio, that she and her nursing staff must sometimes train them about their own studies.
The monitor's sole task is protecting data, not patients. That job falls largely to the pathwork system of ethic boards, bodies that are required by Federal law to approve research proposals involving humans. The main responsibility of these panels is to insure that test candidates are fully informed of the benefits and risks of a particular study and that they are not coerced to participate.
But the review boards last year fell under criticism from Government officials for reviewing too many studies too quickly and for lacking expertise. And while these boards will get involved in deciding the appropriate language to be used for an advertisement for patients, they do not consider whether patients should be told of their doctors' financial stake.
Dr. Shimm of Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver recalled that when he served on an ethics board at a university medical school, a good deal of time was spent discussing whether payments to patient volunteers were coercive. The concern was that patients might enter studies for the money rather than out of altruism, the ideal that is sought. But, immediately after such a discussion at one meeting, another proposal came up in which a doctor stood to receive thousands of dollars from the drug company for each patient recruited.
"I said, 'Wait a minute," Dr. Shimm said. "If it is coercive to pay a patient $ 500, why is it not coercive to pay the clinical investigator $ 5,000?"
But other members of the research board were not interested in the topic.
"I was told," Dr. Shimm said, "to sit down and shut up."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for ALFRED E. KAHN;
He Freed the Airlines. But What to Do Now?

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
THE Federal Government rocked the airline industry on Thursday when the Justice Department's antitrust division accused American Airlines of illegally adding flights and slashing prices at its Dallas-Fort Worth hub in order to drive out low-fare competitors.
The action is the first predatory-pricing suit by the Government against an airline since the industry was deregulated in 1978, and it follows an 18-month Justice Department inquiry into complaints that the major airlines have acted illegally to thwart lower-priced competition in their hub cities. 
 American Airlines denied last week's charges, contending that the essence of the lawsuit was to deny it the right to compete with new-entrant carriers.
The suit calls into question a basic premise of deregulation: that, economically speaking, unfettered competition is all the safeguard the flying public needs.
The architect of airline deregulation was Alfred E. Kahn, now the Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy Emeritus at Cornell University. He is also a member of a National Academy of Science committee that is evaluating airlines.
Because American Airlines is a client of a research firm for which he is a consultant, he would not speak to the specifics of the lawsuit against American, but did agree to discuss its broader implications. EDWIN McDOWELL
 
Q. Some economists say there is no such thing as predatory pricing. Do you disagree?
 
A. My answer is not only yes, but that the airline industry is particularly susceptible to it. Incumbent airlines can increase capacity and then move it back out of the market again at practically zero cost, and it can easily drive a new entrant out of the market, because the entrant can also just move its planes somewhere else. It's not like a manufacturing plant that can't easily be moved.
Q. Does it make sense for the Government to be scrutinizing the airlines' competitive practices?
A. A series of developments in the industry are a cause for real concern. Hubs are most definitely an efficient way of organizing the business, but most are dominated by a single airline, and that creates the possibility of monopoly exploitation.
Yield management has resulted in a big spread between discount fares and the unrestricted fares paid by a small group of people. Adjusted for inflation, average fares since deregulation have gone up 39 percent, and it appears that unrestricted fares have gone up 70 percent or more. That spread is not bad in itself, but there has to be some limit short of re-regulation, which would be a mess.
Q. Will the kinds of arguments the Government will be making find a sympathetic hearing in the courts?
A. It's difficult to predict, because courts in the last couple of years have become increasingly sold on the idea there is no predation. But the economics profession has moved well beyond that thinking. And you just can't say entry is easy; you have to see how it is affected by the fate of previous entrants.
Q. Is there anything to the claim that the lawsuit is potentially anti-consumer?
A. There's an element of validity to that, because as long as the criteria to be applied to fares are uncertain, it will create some hesitation on the part of incumbent airlines as to how far to respond.
But the answer requires an exercise of judgment on our part. I've seen one case where an incumbent carrier was offering fewer than 1,500 low-fare tickets on a route, and when low-fare competition came in, the incumbent increased its low-fare tickets to 50,000. That's 50,000! And when the low-cost entrant was driven out, the incumbent went back to 1,000.
So there's a balancing that has to be done. Right now it's too much on the side of permitting very deep pinpointed fares temporarily, until the competitors are driven out.
Q. Is re-regulation coming?
A. Not in my view. But the industry usually loves the antitrust laws, and the reason is that they think the doctrine of predation under the Sherman Act has been so attenuated that no one can ever bring a successful suit against them. And if ever a predation suit were brought, they would immediately claim that's reimposing price regulation.
PUB-DATE: May 16, 1999
"Investigator grants average $43,000 per study," it said.
Then there are the ubiquitous seminars, sponsored by the industry, with enticing titles to attract doctors, both fledgling and experienced in studies. Some teach the basics, with such titles as "How to Find Clinical Trials: A Physician's Perspective" and "How to Develop or Evaluate a Patient Recruitment Media Plan."
But nothing captured the transformation of research more than a seminar on clinical trials in Nashville, sponsored in 1996 by Associates of Clinical Pharmacology, a professional association.
The title? "Successful Patient Recruitment: The Heart and Soul of Your Business."
 
Quality Questions Testing Puts Value On Speed Above All
Doctors and drug company executives milled around a racing car parked on the floor of the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center in Boston last year, waiting their turn to be photographed at the wheel. Nearby, other images of speed dotted the exhibit hall at the annual meeting of the Drug Information Association, an industry trade group. Checkered flags appeared on corporate booths and T-shirts. One exhibit featured a giant photograph of a cheetah; another showed a mural of a horse race.
To some at the meeting on drug development in the global marketplace, the images were a perfect metaphor for the industry today: The push to finish trials quickly and move the drugs onto the market has overshadowed every other goal.
"A few years ago it was 'better, faster, cheaper,' " said M. Jane Ganter, the editor in chief of Applied Clinical Trials, an industry publication. "Nobody is saying 'better' or 'cheaper' anymore. The big emphasis is on speed."
The driving forces behind the desire for faster studies are the industry's financial stakes. With the clock ticking on a new drug's patent even as it is being tested, every day's delay is revenue that will never be earned. "Time is money," said James Patricelli, an analyst of the drug-testing industry with Dain Rauscher Wessels. "Speed is the key."
But some in the industry worry that such singlemindedness has led testing companies to tap an increasing number of doctors with little or no experience in drug testing and only a fuzzy understanding of the rules.
The Times analysis showed that during the 1990's, 70 percent of the doctors conducting human experiments had been involved in three or fewer previous drug studies, a number unlikely to give them mastery over the process. A quarter of all doctors who did human experiments in 1997, the last year for which complete data are available, conducted only one experiment.
"Some of the companies would be embarrassed if they saw the quality of the people doing the research," said Dr. Angela Bowen, the president of the Western Institutional Review Board, a private ethics board based in Olympia, Wash., that reviews proposed research on human subjects. "I call them clueless."
One reason may be the predominance of generalists taking part in the studies. The studies test drugs for particular diseases, like asthma, in which a doctor's experience and specialized training are crucial in making assessments such as distinguishing between drug reactions and disease symptoms. But doctors conducting clinical trials often have no particular expertise in the disease they are treating. The Times computer analysis showed that the largest single group of doctors conducting investigations was general internists; one in five was either a general internist or a family practitioner. These, of course, are the doctors most Americans see for checkups and are thus the industry's most efficient recruiters.
But some doctors who do clinical research say that they often are offered studies that would require them to stretch far beyond their areas of medical expertise.
"I wouldn't do studies for hematology or neurology or lung disease or epilepsy," said Dr. Roy Fleischmann, the chief executive of Rheumatology Research International, a national network of clinical research sites that specialize in arthritis and skeletal diseases. But, he said, "We get calls about them all the time."
Not every doctor has the power to refuse.
"There was a lot of pressure for me to do things I did not feel comfortable doing," said Dr. Claudia Baldassano, a psychiatrist and neurologist who worked for a commercial research center on the East Coast. "They thought because I have an M.D., I should be comfortable doing all studies."
She said, for example, that she was asked to do Pap smears as part of a study of hormone replacement and was asked to treat patients with diabetes.
"I said I hadn't done a Pap smear since medical school, and I didn't feel comfortable," she said.
For the diabetes study, "I said how could you expect a physician who is not trained" as a diabetes specialist to run the trials, she said. "I was told by a vice president of operations that I could do diabetic studies with my eyes closed."
In the end, Dr. Baldassano stood her ground on the diabetes study, but participated in the one on hormone replacement. She resigned from the business after just a few months, and now works in academic research.
Why would drug companies accept research even from doctors who doubt their own expertise? Because, experts said, the industry has grown so quickly that no one has yet developed a good measurement of quality. Drug companies are left to review two factors: speed and cost. Systems of measurement for quality "haven't been established to differentiate these companies," said Mr. Patricelli of Dain Rauscher.
In an attempt to protect the quality of data and patients, the Government and industry have put into effect some means of oversight. The first line of defense for the integrity of the data is the dispatch of study monitors employed by the testing companies to the doctors' offices to pore over the test results.
But the explosive growth of the industry has left experienced monitors in short supply.
As a result, "They utilize some people who have very little experience in the disease entity, or the drug, or in pharmacology," said Dr. Fleischmann of Rheumatology Research International. The monitors "don't understand what they are doing."
"They are looking for boxes to fill in," he said.
For example, he said, the most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis, is also called "degenerative joint disease." A testing company monitor who came to examine his data announced that his patients were not qualified for the study because she did not know the two terms meant the same thing, he said.
"If they don't have that knowledge," Dr. Fleischmann asked, "how can they read a chart and know what is real and what is not real?"
Some experts said there was a decided difference between the quality of monitors who work for the drug industry and those who work for the testing companies. Monitors sent by testing companies can be so unknowledgeable, said Margaret Chokreff, the president of Margaret Chokreff & Associates, which works with a network of private doctors conducting research in Ohio, that she and her nursing staff must sometimes train them about their own studies.
The monitors' sole task is protecting data, not patients. That job falls largely to the patchwork system of ethics boards, bodies that are required by Federal law to approve research proposals involving humans. The main responsibility of these panels is to insure that test candidates are fully informed of the benefits and risks of a particular study and that they are not coerced to participate.

But other members of the research board were not interested in the topic.
"I was told," Dr. Shimm said, "to sit down and shut up."

Cost-Cutting Gives Rise to New Research Industry
Drug companies used to supervise all their research, from the discovery of the drugs to the animal tests to the preliminary human tests to the large studies involving hundreds or thousands of patients.
No more. A multibillion-dollar industry has sprung up to take care of all that and more, including designing the studies, finding doctors and patients, analyzing the data, meeting with the Food and Drug Administration, writing the scientific papers and preparing the truckload of documents that must be submitted before a drug is approved.
These new companies have sliced the drug-testing business in every possible way. Some are little more than a Rolodex of the names of doctors willing to help test drugs. Others are major corporations, essentially drug companies without the drugs.
It is an industry that arose to fill a need: the enormous pressure that began around 1992 from managed care companies and health insurers on drug companies to hold down prices, according to industry analysts. Until then, the drug companies had been profitable, making money mostly by increasing prices, not by developing new drugs.
The companies now had to find a new way of generating profits. "Their vulnerability became transparent to the world," said James Patricelli, an industry analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "What you had was a drug industry that suddenly had to make investments in its future."
The companies' response was to search for blockbusters -- the Prozacs and Viagras hidden within the laboratory chemicals. The Food and Drug Administration gave the companies another incentive by speeding up its approval process, with the median review time for new drug applications dropping from more than 22 months in 1990 to just over 14 months in 1997, according to the F.D.A.
"The industry has flip-flopped," said Kim Lamon, corporate senior vice president with Covance Inc., a giant drug-testing and development company. "There is a push for novel, innovative, blockbuster drugs, and to be the first or second to market."
Drug companies found they had to put more effort and money into finding drugs while at the same time slashing their development costs. For many, their solution was to largely dismantle their divisions that ran clinical trials and to turn the work over to smaller companies that emerged to fill the need.
"Everyone had auditors, kids right out of college, telling us how to do it cheaply," said Dr. Cynthia M. Dunn, a former vice president for medical affairs at Fisons, a British drug maker later acquired by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., and now the director of the Clinical Research Institute at the University of Rochester. "They really pushed the outsourcing."
With the new companies came a variety of new names. Contract research organizations were composed of companies that ran parts or all of the clinical trials. Site management organizations -- groups of doctors willing to offer their services to conduct trials -- soon followed.
The growth in this sector has been enormous. Roughly $3.2 billion was paid to the contract research organizations in 1997, up 52 percent from just two years earlier, when payments were $2.1 billion.
Covance, one of the largest contract research organizations, doubled its staff and revenues from 1994 to 1998. Today, the Princeton, N.J., company is an industry giant, with 7,000 employees and more than $700 million in revenues in 1998.
"It's an industry that has been growing and growing and growing," said Ismail A. Shalaby, the chief executive of Nema Research Inc., a clinical research network based in Baltimore. "A drug company doesn't have to invest a lot of its own time and money to develop a drug anymore."
In fact, some industry experts said, a drug company barely even needs to be a drug company any more. For example, Neurobiological Technologies Inc. in Richmond, Calif., has no factories, 11 employees, 3 scientists and less than $1 million in cash. Yet it is using the new testing industry to conduct huge clinical trials, involving dozens of research sites and doctors around the country.
"You could have a company of one person, working out of their home, with no office, develop a drug," said Dr. Bert Spilker, a senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association. "You could have totally virtual companies."
Longtime members of the industry marvel at the change, which has occurred in just a few years.
"One called me; they had two employees," said Dr. Leigh Thompson, a drug-industry consultant in Charleston, S.C., who is a former chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. "They have a molecule and hope but nothing else."

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, the Five Questions column last Sunday, an interview about airline competition with Alfred E. Kahn, the Carter Administration official who oversaw airline deregulation, misstated his assessment of the trend in fares since the regulations were lifted in 1978. Mr. Kahn said that adjusted for inflation, average fares have fallen, not risen, 39 percent.
A front-page picture caption last Sunday with an article about payments by drug companies to private doctors conducting research referred incorrectly in some editions to the document shown. It was part of a letter to a doctor from Clintrials Inc., a testing company working with Janssen Pharmaceutica, describing terms of a confidential research contract. It was not an advertisement.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
In Bangkok, Royal Treatment at Commoner Prices

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
"BANGKOK. Fantastic! I've heard you can find a room there for as little as $6 a night," said the tiny voice inside my head (the voice of the good frugal traveler). A devilishly seductive baritone cut in: "Hey, when are you going to tell that accountant to scram? You've been listening to him for six weeks and you haven't touched a soft white sheet since Cairo. Besides, honey, have you looked at your nails lately?"
The American Express agent in Madras, unaware of the pitched battle raging inches from her desk, diligently punched codes into her computer. "Yes, I can make you a hotel reservation in Bangkok," she said. "Please tell me what price accommodation you are looking for." 
 I hesitated. It was mid-March and I had come to the last stop of a marvelous but definitely not luxurious 21-day visit to India. Bangkok, exactly 12 time zones from New York, marking the midpoint of my round-the-world journey. I'd been on the road for five weeks, and I was having a Princess Attack: I was fed up with cheap guest houses, cold-water showers and power failures. As far away from home as I could get, I craved home's comforts.
"Are there any discounts in the luxury range?" I asked. I knew that Bangkok, like most of Southeast Asia, was still feeling the effects of an economic crisis, and that hotels were often eager to bargain. I hoped the agent might find a deal that would satisfy both little voices inside me. She did: a 30 percent discount (for American Express card holders only) at the Landmark, a luxury hotel with all the amenities. For $87 a night (plus taxes, which brought it to $108), it could be mine. The rate was higher than any I'd paid since leaving New York, but I booked a two-night stay anyway.
"Pipe down," I told my inner accountant. "In New York, a hotel like this would cost three times as much."
Sooner or later, most round-the-world travelers pass through Bangkok because its huge airport is a hub for flights going everywhere from Tokyo to Tashkent. Bangkok is well set up for tourists. Compared with India or Egypt, I found it a breeze. Generally, when arriving in a new country (or New York City, for that matter), I steel myself for unpleasant encounters with cabdrivers. But in Bangkok, as I walked out of the airport, a new bus with cotton seat covers was waiting at the curb. For only $1.89, it whisked me in air-conditioned comfort in less than 45 minutes to the Landmark, on Sukhumvit Road.
My enormous mini-suite had a couch and sitting area, a queen bed and windows on two sides with a view of a white concrete skyline. Sukhumvit Road, seven miles from downtown, is Bangkok's boomtown, a neighborhood of hotels, shops, restaurants and boxy luxury apartment buildings, many populated by expatriates. I danced around the room, jumped on the bed (it had a white linen duvet, with fresh bougainvillea blossoms sprinkled on it) and, when I recovered from the culture shock of living large, made an appointment for a pedicure and a haircut in the hotel salon, while munching on grapes from my ("Compliments of the Manager") bowl of fruit.
Then I went out to explore Sukhumvit Road and discovered -- Americans. They (we) were everywhere. For the first time in what seemed months, I heard my native accent among the babble of voices in the street. There was a lot of activity, for the area around the Landmark, despite its postmodern facade, is a huge, old-fashioned Asian-style market of street hawkers, flower sellers and food vendors. I was hungry, so I stopped to scrutinize the wares.
One vendor had strings of dried squid that flapped over his cart like pennants; I watched as he took one down, fed it through a miniature mangle, then put the flattened fish on a plate with some hot pepper sauce.
It looked interesting, but I decided to pass. I spotted lots of restaurants just off the main road, along the sois (or lanes) that spread from Sukhumvit like a centipede's legs. In Bangkok's urban geography, main roads spawn tentacles of tiny streets and alleys that don't always connect; you must backtrack to the main avenue. Each soi had a different atmosphere. Some were lined with karaoke bars, others with women in hot pants.
I headed down one soi that looked like a restaurant row; it was clogged, as it turned out, with middle-class American tourists. Still, this was Bangkok, and as I settled into a table at Saw Sam Sai, my mouth began to water. At long last, I'd taste some real Thai food.
"Our food very spicy," said the waitress. "We make less spicy for you, O.K.?" I'd heard that line before, many times, in New York, and I was irritated that she lumped me in with the rest of the timid foreigners.
"Please," I insisted, "I like Thai food. I eat lots of Thai food. Do not change the spice."
Out came dinner: a scrumptious marinated salad with slivers of green papaya and peanuts, alongside a Thai green chicken curry that included the lovely round, green baby Thai eggplants. I dug in, savoring the amazing flavors. The lemon grass was so fresh it was like tasting it for the first time.
But soon, sweat began to roll down my neck. My heart started to pound, and my nose began to run uncontrollably. I managed to pay my check ($5) before I could swoon face down into the hottest curry I've ever eaten.
After two days, I was happy to move on from Sukhumvit's tourist enclave. It was much too far from the Bangkok I had come to see, the old city of temples and palaces along the Chao Phraya River. And so I said goodbye to room service and white duvets, packed up my gear and took a taxi ($5) to Bangkok's travelers' mecca, Khao San Road.
The driver didn't speak much English, but he understood exactly where I wanted to go. Music from his tape drifted intoxicatingly through the speakers, a jazz saxophone winding notes sinuously around the backing of a Thai orchestra. I remembered that one of Thailand's former kings had been fond of jazz and had introduced it to his subjects -- resulting in this sweet, engaging hybrid music, part African-American, part Asian.
At Khao San Road, a sea of college-age kids, backpacks hoisted, filed along the street, which is blocked off to cars. Here and there, shuffled a gray-bearded hippie. It was a cross between the East Village, circa 1969, and spring break at Daytona Beach. This is the backpackers' capital of the world: home of the $6 hotel and the 50-cent beer, and with an Internet cafe every 10 yards.
It was a scene, that's for sure, but not mine. I gave the driver another address: Prah Athit Road, Banglamphu. Back in New York, a masseuse who studied in Thailand had given me some tips on cheap stays.
"I think you'll like the Peachy Guest House," she said. At first I didn't. It seemed deserted and worn. But its unassuming entry opened into the spacious courtyard of a somewhat down-at-heels 1950's house.
After the Landmark's pampering, a room with faded walls and polyester comforter was a shock. But it had air-conditioning and a 10-foot ceiling; the bathroom was big, with hot water, toilet and shower, the staff was friendly and the place quiet. For $12 a night, you couldn't beat it.
Banglamphu was full of travelers, too, but the crowd was a bit older and quieter. I discovered to my delight that Prah Athit Road was lined with cool little restaurant-clubs like the Hemlock, which catered to Thai students from a nearby university. At Hemlock, I could get a plate of pad thai, a beer and listen to live jazz for less than $5. Better still, a few blocks away I found a little storefront called Roti Mataba that serves the tasty, hearty cuisine of Thailand's Muslim minority. A couple of rotis -- buttery flat pancakes similar to the ones in Malaysia -- stuffed with vegetables cost $1. They were wonderful, and I ate them for breakfast and lunch.
I began to divide my days between the rich life and the frugal life. By day, I'd cruise the Chao Phraya River on the supercheap ferry (10 cents) and get off at the staggeringly expensive Oriental Hotel. There, I'd jump onto the hotel's free mahogany boat and sail to its elegant riverside restaurant, Sala Rim Naam, where I'd sit on a silk cushion at a low, beautiful table. Attended by seven staff members, I would dive into the groaning lunch buffet, which boasted more than 15 dishes, including a rich stew of crab in tangy yellow curry. Of the eight desserts, my favorite was a kind of petit four, Thai style -- a candy-sized portion of coconut jelly that had nine layers (nine is a lucky number in Thailand) and was shaped like a flower. With drink, my bill came to $16.
My ambitious sightseeing plans evaporated in the pulverizing heat and humidity of Bangkok's early summer. I tried starting out early, but by 10:30 A.M., the narrow lanes and byways of Chinatown, busy with hawkers and merchants selling fine Thai silk by the yard and gold-embroidered formal Thai evening gowns, already felt like a steam bath. I gave up and collapsed into a taxi (they are all air-conditioned, thankfully), annoyed with myself for being a wimp. Later, I read that the temperature had hit 104 that day.
But there were lots of air-conditioned amusements. The Bangkok Gems and Jewelry Fair, a convention of Asian gem dealers, was in progress at the city's main convention center. Although the sign at the desk said "Trade Only," I had no trouble walking in, and lost myself for a few hours ogling rubies and sapphires as big as grapes. Other booths had trays of smaller rubies, poured into tiny heaps on saucers like glittering red sugar. I bought a gold bracelet embedded all around with pin-sized rubies for $65.
Riding the public ferries that ply the Chao Phraya provided some relief from the pounding sun. They move fast, whipping up spray that occasionally splashes over the passengers (who reflexively duck, since the brownish-green Chao Phraya is notoriously filthy).
One morning, I took the ferry to the Grand Palace, and followed the groups of tourists through the giddily decorated and gilded buildings and enormous landscaped courtyards that date from the 19th century. It once housed the Thai royal family, whose members have moved to another palace not far away that is closed to the public. Thailand, never colonized by any Western power, takes its monarchy seriously. It is against the law, for instance, to say anything bad about the king. Even though the Grand Palace is vacant, it remains guarded by unsmiling, white uniformed sentries who stand completely immobile.
Another morning, I hopped the same ferry downriver to Wat Po, the city's main Buddhist temple. I immediately felt energized, standing among Wat Po's filigreed, tapered towers. At the gates, vendors sold religious talismans, copper Buddha statues no bigger than a thumbnail and pictures of former Thai kings and queens. Inside, saffron-robed monks chanted, incense burned and tourists filed through the main temple to view the reclining Golden Buddha, Thailand's largest.
Wat Po is renowned for its massage school, where monks supervise students in their apprenticeship in Thai traditional medicine. Thai massage, which is somewhat similar to Japanese shiatsu, was developed in Buddhist monasteries to relieve the aches of meditating monks. Even if you don't sit cross-legged all day, the sessions are powerful: I got up after my first ($5.50 for an hour), and my soles didn't touch the ground for hours. I went back the next day, and the next day again.
No more Princess Attacks for me, I thought, while seated at a damask-covered table at the Regent Hotel. A waitress brought tea sandwiches and scones with clotted cream on a silver tray (high tea is $15), while a string quartet played on the balcony. I poured some more Darjeeling tea, and marveled at how Bangkok, even in the deadening heat of summer, had transformed one weary traveler into Cinderella.
Then, suddenly, the lobby was invaded by a flying wedge of men in military uniforms and dark glasses with walkie-talkies. They blocked my view, then rushed quickly out the doors. I paid my check and rose to leave, but not before asking the Regent doorman what the ruckus had been about.
"Oh, it was the Princess," he said. "Thai princess and bodyguards."
But of course. I jumped into the nearest pumpkin and headed back to my $12 hotel.
 
The bottom line: $57 a day
I spent $458.81 for hotels, meals, local transportation and activities during my eight days in Bangkok, an average of $57.35 a day.
 
Where to Stay
The Landmark, 138 Sukhumvit Road, telephone (66-2) 254-0404, fax (66-2) 254-0439, is a well-run luxury hotel with the works: swimming pool, health spa, business center, restaurants and beauty salon. I received a 30 percent discount off the single rate by booking through an American Express travel agency. My mini-suite cost $108 a night.
Pleasant and homey, Peachy Guesthouse, Prah Athit Road, Banglamphu, (66-2) 281-6471, was an excellent budget base from which to explore Bangkok. It's across the street from a ferry stop and a short walk from several good, cheap restaurants. My room in the white, 1950's deco-style house was basic, and the air-conditioner a bit noisy, but it was a terrific value at $12 a night.
There are many other little guesthouses and small hotels in the area; most deal with walk-up trade, few offer telephone service or take reservations, and most proprietors speak very little English. Next door to the Peachy, the New Merry V guesthouse has smaller but newer rooms for around $8 a night. The courtyard-lobby has a bustling restaurant and Internet center, so it isn't as quiet as the Peachy.
Next door to the New Merry V, Phra Athit Mansion hotel might be an alternative for travelers who find the Peachy too funky; the small, new rooms with refrigerator and air-conditioning are $23 a night.
 
Where to Eat
Bangkok street food is superb. Vendors offer everything from pad thai to pressed squid, and most items cost less than $1.
One step up from the street food are small sit-down diners like Roti Mataba, on Phra Athit Road, (66-2) 282-2119, which serves the comfort food of Bangkok's Muslim minority: rich beef curries and flaky golden roti griddle breads stuffed with minced vegetables or beef. My meal of two rotis cost $1.25.
Also along Phra Athit Road are several hangouts frequented by Thai students. I had a delicious plate of Thai noodles, a salad and a lemon spritzer at Hemlock, 56 Phra Athit, (66-2) 282-7507, for around $6. After 9 P.M., Hemlock sometimes has live jazz or folk music.
Saw Sam Sai, Soi 20, Sukhumvit Road, telephone (66-2) 261-0461, which appears to be a shiny tourist-oriented eatery, serves food as hot as you can take it. Dinner with main course, rice, salad and juice cost $7.
To reach Sala Rim Naam, Chareon Nakorn Road, Klongsarn, (66-2) 236-0400, a restaurant on the banks of the Chao Phraya River, you board a free private riverboat at the Oriental Hotel dock. After making the river crossing, a maitre d'hotel leads you to a splendidly decorated room with an all-you-can-eat Thai buffet that comprises at least 15 different dishes. With tip and drinks my meal came to $16.
At the Regent Hotel, 155 Rajdamri Road, telephone (66-2) 251 6127, high tea is served from 2 P.M. on. An elegant selection of salmon and egg sandwiches, petit fours and scones with clotted cream costs around $15.
 
What to See
Admission to the Grand Palace is $4. Visitors must wear a shirt with sleeves, and shoes that cover the toes and the back of the heel.
The Wat Po temple charges 60 cents. A half-hour massage at the school costs around $3, and an hour costs $5.50. The massage telephone is (66-2) 221-2974 or (66-2) 225-4771; E-mail at watpottm@netscape.net.
 
Getting Around
For a traveler on a short visit without time to learn the city bus system, taxis are the fastest and most economical way of getting around Bangkok. The drop of the meter is $1, and even though I was often stuck in traffic, I rarely found myself paying more than $4 to $5 for a trip.
Ferry rides on the Chao Phraya Express cost from 10 to 25 cents, depending on the distance.
A modern, efficient bus runs from Bangkok International Airport to the city and costs $1.89.
Americans don't need a visa to get into Thailand, but there's a $13.50 airport departure tax. DAISANN McLANE

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
SHE'S no Sam Spade. She doesn't have the trademark cynical grin, sallow complexion or hard-boiled humor of Dashiell Hammett's famous detective.
But Anna Kisluk, director of the New York office of the Art Loss Register, and her six deputies -- well, staff members -- have played a central part in solving several crimes. There is the case of the missing Manet, a small still life of peaches stolen from a New York apartment in 1977 and recovered last year in Miami. There is the case of the decamped de Kooning, one of his "Woman" series from the early 1960's, which disappeared from a New York art gallery in 1990 and showed up in the catalogue of a major Manhattan auction house late last year. 
 And there are the cases of the lesser-known works, like a garden sculpture of a child by Bessie Potter Vonnoh, a turn-of-the-century American artist. The work was stolen by a couple who were captured in 1996 in Ray Brook, N.Y., by the state police.
The primary crime-fighting weapon of the Art Loss Register is its database, which, with more than 100,000 items, is the world's largest commercial listing of stolen and missing art and other "uniquely identifiable" items. The listing also includes rare books, jewelry, furniture and musical instruments, but 51 percent are paintings.
Not all the listed items carry weighty prices. "It's not all masterpieces by artistic geniuses," Ms. Kisluk said. "It's also the silver tea set you may have inherited from your great-grandmother, the ancestral portrait that has more sentimental value than market value."
Museums, insurance companies and auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's tap into the database, as do anxious individuals who want to do all they can to insure that their purchases are legitimate. So do police departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even though they and other law-enforcement agencies often maintain their own lists of stolen art. In the past eight years, the register says, it has been instrumental in the recovery of more than 900 items worth $75 million.
Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said the register does not replace other ways of checking the legitimacy of a work of art, like getting waranties from dealers to indemnify the museum and inquiring about the provenance of the art. Yet for the last three years, the Met has also checked with the register for all its acquisitions of $50,000 and more.
Dorit Strauss, who heads the unit for arts, culture, entertainment and fine arts for ACE-USA, an insurance company, said she had used the Art Loss Register many times and has recovered at least one piece through it.
"It's most effective for auction, or if an individual buys something from a dealer or private collector," Ms. Strauss said. "I will call if I have something that doesn't seem quite right."
Visitors arrive at the register's midtown office on the 21st floor of 666 Fifth Avenue, near 53d Street, in an elevator decorated with mirrors and marble. There is a three-room suite that looks like an accountant's office. The point is clear: despite 8-by-10-inch photographs of a Tiffany lamp, a sculpture of a torso by Archipenko, and Regency silver wine coolers, all with a "recovered" banner across them, the register staff does not roll up its collective sleeves and wrestle bad guys to the mat. They let the police do that.
The company is British, and its shareholders include Christie's, Sotheby's, art dealer groups and others. It has offices in London and Dusseldorf, but given that so many art transactions take place in New York City, the office here is among the company's busiest. The register was founded in 1988 and acquired its initial database from the International Foundation for Art Research, a nonprofit group in Manhattan, which is also a register shareholder.
Besides helping clients make sure their prospective purchases have not been stolen, the register assists theft victims, too. When a work is stolen, the owner notifies the register. Along with a $20 fee, the victim gives the company a description of the artwork and a picture, if there is one, all of which enters the database. If the work is recovered, the register receives a contingency fee of 15 percent of the value of the work, up to $75,000, and 10 percent of the value in excess of $75,000. The economic foundation of the company is subscriptions from more than 400 insurance companies, which pay, depending on their size, annual fees from $2,000 to five figures, plus contingency fees for recovered works.
Recently, the register helped to recover items lost during World War II, in some cases in the Holocaust. These works are registered free, and there is no contingency fee upon finding them.
Some stolen artworks are recovered when law-enforcement agencies find them, as in the Vonnoh case. But most of the time, said Ms. Kisluk, who left Sotheby's and joined the Art Loss Register in 1991, stolen art is spotted by a routine computer screening of exhibition and auction catalogues. When the screening turns up a match on the register's database, the information is turned over to the authorities.
"Generally, stolen art doesn't go to the top-level people for some time," said Constance Lowenthal, director of the Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Council. "Typically, it is sold at a heartbreaking fraction of its real value, and in a series of resales the price goes up exponentially." When the artwork reaches about half its worth, it is by then in one of the better auction houses, Ms. Lowenthal said. She added that while brand-name pieces get the publicity, the bread and butter of the art thief are works of lesser fame.
According to register statistics, the majority of art is stolen from people's homes, followed by galleries and museums and then churches. Also, Ms. Kisluk said, as areas of collecting become fashionable, they become targets of crime.
"In the past few years there has been a growth in the collection of garden statuary and objects," she said. "So we have seen thefts of cemetery urns and fountains and sculptures."
Also, the increasing speed of underground networks has made it harder to disseminate information about thefts quickly enough. Ms. Kisluk recalled one incident a few years ago when three 17th-century English silver sweetmeat dishes were stolen in Europe. "I was just about to put the items into my database," Ms. Kisluk said, when the dishes surfaced in New Jersey, and police officers called.
"The photographs of the items," she said, "were sitting on my lap."

HEADLINE: A Man's Place

 BODY:
When the subject is women's economic progress, it's easy to get lost in the controversies of the moment. So The New York Times Magazine convened six experts to consider how that progress has played out over a longer stretch of history. They began by examining the transformation in the lives of working women, then looked at the power of women as consumers and finally appraised how well (or poorly) the economy has adapted to women's needs and desires.
The conversation was moderated by Michael Weinstein, an economist who writes the Economic Scene column in The Times. The panelists: 
 Victoria de Grazia, professor of history at Columbia University and author of "The Sex of Things: Gender and Consumption in Historical Perspective."
Claudia Goldin, professor of economics at Harvard University and author of "Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women."
Jacqueline Jones, Truman professor of history at Brandeis University and author of "American Work: Four Centuries of Black and White Labor."
Juliet B. Schor, economics lecturer at Harvard and author of "The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need."
Marta Tienda, professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University and author of "The Hispanic Population of the United States."
William Julius Wilson, Geyser University professor at Harvard and author of "The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics," to be published this fall.
 
A Woman's Place Is in the Workplace
Michael Weinstein: How far have women come over the past century or so? How would the economic circumstances of, say, a 20-year-old woman living in the United States 100 ago be different from her counterpart's today?
Claudia Goldin: Typically, she would have spent a lot of time working alongside and learning from her mother. One of the profound changes in the 20th century was the movement of young women from being "at home" to being "at school." I'm referring to the large movement of young women first to high school and then to college. In terms of working outside the home, if you were a young woman in rural America and had gone to school beyond eighth grade, you would probably have become a teacher for a while. In cities, we would find the women described by the Progressives as the pitiable young factory women -- those of O. Henry's New York stories -- about half of whom worked for piece rates. By the 1920's, young women would be working in retail sales and in offices.
Victoria De Grazia: One of the biggest changes in women's lives is their capacity to control their fertility. Efficient contraception was almost unimaginable 100 years ago. The risk of pregnancy, not to mention the hardship of childbearing, enormously determined how women lived.
Marta Tienda: There is also the issue of how family arrangements constrained women. Even as recently as 15 or 20 years ago in the Southwest, the idea of women moving out of the parental household and living alone was unacceptable.
Goldin: But women did move out of the parental household, and their stories gave rise to the literature of Dreiser and O. Henry. They wrote about the young women who moved off the farm into the boarding houses that filled New York City and Chicago. Carroll Wright, the great early-20th-century labor statistician, studied the young women who lived alone and worked in manufacturing and who, to him, faced an increased risk of becoming prostitutes. jacqueline jones: One of the dramatic changes in the last 100 years is that most white women -- I'm uncomfortable limiting this discussion to white women -- today believe, and rightly so, that they'll probably work for wages after marriage.
William Julius Wilson: Let me shift the focus to black women. Noncollege black women had very little chance during the first half of this century to take a job other than as a domestic servant. After 1960, demand increased for clerical and service workers. Black women were able to take those positions, so much so that by 1980, only a small percentage of black women were domestic household servants. But, ironically, just as blacks and Hispanics started to move into those clerical positions, changing demand began to reduce opportunities as bank tellers, typists and so on. Now, folks who don't have college degrees face a new challenge because the areas that were opening up are starting to close. Yet it's far better then it was.
Goldin: Let's talk about occupations 100 years ago. You could hardly find an occupation in which both men and women did the same job. Many industries excluded women, perhaps because they were unionized or because they involved work in dirty and hot places like iron found-ries and steel mills, or in disgusting places like slaughterhouses. Being part of the labor force was not considered progress for much of our history. Progress was having enough money to liberate your wife from the dirty, disgusting work of the factory, so she didn't have to be at risk of sexual advances and injury. The aim was not to preserve a patriarchal system but to create a better family life, a kinder life for women.
Weinstein: Victoria, did you want to say more about family structure?
De Grazia: A century ago, the role of women's unpaid household labor in maintaining the family was simply huge. Take into account the primitive equipment. Consider the difficulties of carrying provisions from the market. Think of the time involved in cooking, which meant getting coal or hauling wood. But even with new equipment, there has still been more "work for mother," as standards of hygiene and nutrition and the quality of caring for children have been raised. That suggests the question: has there been real progress or only a change in how women work in the household?
Jones: Can I add a couple of points about changes? One is that 100 years ago, women played very small roles in labor leadership and in fact, there were very few unions composed of women. Today, obviously, women are in the forefront of union organizing because of the shift in the economy and the importance of the service sector in particular. Another point is that 100 years ago, modern jobs went only to whites. The conventional wisdom said African-Americans should not work machines.
Tienda: If you just compare white and minority women between 1960 and the early 1970's, the occupational distribution of black and white women converged. But since 1980, the trend has reversed. Asian women, with their higher college-completion rates, have benefited from the increased demand for skilled labor, but black and Hispanic women have fallen back.
Goldin: Many people think that the late 1960's, with the revival of feminism, was also the beginning of women's increase in labor-force participation. That is not the case. Among married women, labor-force participation rates rose 10 percentage points per decade for each 10-year period from 1940 to 1990. So today, the rates are over 70 percent for all women age 25 to 64, and a little over 80 percent for women who have bachelor's degrees, rates that are rapidly approaching those of men.
Juliet Schor: That's misleading. You don't want to give people the impression that 100 years ago women weren't working. They were not officially in the labor force.
Goldin: Let's go beyond labor-force participation rates and look at what has happened to earnings. The mantra in the 60's was 59 cents on the dollar -- that was the button many of us wore then, meaning that for every dollar the average man earned, a woman earned 59 cents. It stayed that way through the 1970's. Then, suddenly, it began to zoom so that now, women are earning more like 70 to 75 cents to the male dollar, even 80 to 85 cents when corrected. For young people with college degrees, there's virtual parity. Meanwhile, who's doing the work at home? Here you won't find numbers that make us feel good. In a 1968 survey, husbands claimed to work on average 125 hours a year in housework, not including various child-care tasks. That amounts to a little more than two hours a week. By 1991, husbands claimed to do more than three times that amount -- about seven hours a week. But wives in 1968 did nearly 39 hours per week and in 1991 did about 25 hours. In other words, there has been some narrowing, but only some.
The question is: Have women come a long way in the 20th century? The answer is unequivocally yes. They have enormously narrowed the gap in labor-force participation rates and in earnings. Occupational segregation has also decreased and so have hours of housework, enhancing the ability of college-graduate women, for example, to do the ultimate -- combine career with family. Of course, there are lots of qualifications. Few women actually achieve both career and family. Women now become doctors at nearly the same rate as men, but they become family physicians, not surgeons.
Tienda: The progress cited by Claudia has been uneven. Labor-force participation of Puerto Ricans has actually declined over a 20-year period. Participation of black women has not kept pace with whites.
Goldin: Yet despite the qualifications, women have come a long way. They have gained independence, dignity, respect, greater bargaining power at home, freedom, ability to socialize and have a life apart from family -- I think that's extraordinarily important -- and of course, the ability to divorce.
 
Women's Consumption: Might or Myth?
Weinstein: We've been talking exclusively about women at work or home. But how about their role as consumers?
Goldin: A role we love.
Weinstein: Is it not true that the more women earn in their own right, the more discretionary income they control, the more the economy will bend toward their needs and tastes? And is consumerism a trap or a route toward further liberation?
Schor: Much of what women used to do was buy for their family. Mrs. Consumer felt that she, in effect, brought income into the household by saving money through smart purchasing.
De Grazia: The identification of women with consumption has been, as in the 19th century, in part metaphoric. Anything fickle was identified with women, and consumption habits were fickle; therefore, women were consumers. Then, as families' disposable income rose, advertising and other media exaggerated the sexual division of roles: men were producers, women consumers. The image that consumption is natural to women has, rightly, been very much contested by feminists.
Jones: I think all this talk about women as consumers loses sight of the fact that about 14 percent of households are poor. In Boston, the self-sufficiency index for a single head of household and two kids is nearly $40,000 a year, about three times the official poverty level. Yes, she has enough money to buy cosmetics, but not enough to fit the stereotype of women who wield a great deal of economic power. She's buying the necessities for her family.
De Grazia: The question comes down to whether massively increased private consumption gives women choices, whether it empowers women in particular. That would be to say that consumption is a mainly female activity, that the more women consume, the more they make choices, the more power they have to make the economic world go round. This argument has to be unpacked. Consumption means many things. There is social consumption, meaning the significant public expenditure on goods such as Social Security, education, health care and other goods that we need to be effective private consumers. Women have not been able to play a very organized role in shaping the allocations of government budgets on these kinds of consumption. Indeed, with the recent attacks on social programs, one can speak of a lessening of women's role in shaping consumption. As for private consumption, the realm of discretionary spending of women in families is really very small. The media highlight the spending habits of the young, the beautiful and the very rich. The important point is that there is no sign, statistically, that women have significant powers when viewed against this entire range of consumption.
Jones: I find the idea of consumer as an agent of social change to be oxymoronic. The way consumption is practiced in this country is a deeply conservative force. I look at mass advertising, the engine that drives consumption, and the message that comes across is divisive and mean-spirited: You will look young, you will look pretty, you will attract a man, you will outdo your neighbor. These impulses will not lead to radical change, but in fact will keep people stuck in a past that's based on the power of physical appearance and the power of gender.
 
Detours on the Mommy Track
Weinstein: Let's move on to our third question: How has the economic system accommodated women who want to pursue a career as they rear their children?
Goldin: By my calculations, less than 20 percent of college-graduate women born between 1944 and 1954 actually achieved both career and family by their early 40's.
Schor: We are at an unusual moment in history, in which the idea of a nonpatriarchal society -- the idea of equality -- has made tremendous inroads. The idea that men and women should have egalitarian marriages and share parenting and housework is a vast departure. That we are asking these questions indicates a tremendous revolution in the last 30 years.
Weinstein: Are there groups that the revolution has skipped?
Tienda: Many immigrant groups. The Latino and Asian populations are two of the most traditional groups, where the women's movement still lags behind.
Jones: Here's a good example of the unevenness of development. Take an upper-middle-class suburban couple, where both the husband and wife have high levels of education. We find these women worked when they first got their degrees, and when the kids started to come, they decided to stay home. The husband becomes the sole breadwinner. She's taking care of the house and the kids and she's dependent on him for the money to run the household, and I think with that economic dependence comes the real vulnerability. The household might be at the vanguard in socioeconomic status, but I think in certain respects, it's very traditional.
Weinstein: Is there a barrier society needs to dismantle, or are these decisions worked out well within the family?
Schor: The major barrier is the structure of jobs. We have not been able to make good jobs compatible with child-rearing roles. The labor market is inflexible.
Tienda: Because we rely on other women to take care of our children, two women can enter the labor force for every one that takes on a new job. When women go to work, we buy child-care services, more takeout food and other services, all of which are driving economic growth in a profound way. It also means that we are fueling stratification. But there are real costs, studied by psychologists, to children who have limited exposure to their parents.
Wilson: You know, Marta, I was thinking not only about the cost to children along the lines you're pointing out, but when you look at the low-income families we are now pushing into labor markets, there's no basic support. Employers are just waiting to fire them if they don't show up for work consistently on time. We don't realize how difficult it is for mothers who do not have basic child-care support. When their child gets sick and the mother stays at home to care for the child, the next thing you know, her job is in jeopardy. This increases stress on the mothers, threatening their interaction with their kids.
De Grazia: Either our criteria for judging progress are too narrow or we are too focused on our own culture. If the convergence of male/female labor-participation rates is the standard, then we would have to recognize the achievement in the former Soviet bloc, where women were medical doctors and engineers, not to mention tractor drivers. Juliet has written amply on the lack of leisure in the U.S. If leisure is regarded as a kind of restoration, of community life and family life, rather than the opportunity to work or spend more, then we would have to look at European social-democratic experiences as models. What does it mean to society when child care is inadequate, as it is in ours? Insofar as we have decent services, they are privatized and discriminate against women in lower income classes.
Weinstein: Roll the tape forward 20 to 40 years. Can you imagine these gender differences disappearing?
Jones: You start in the home where things have not changed that much. There is still "women's work." And until that whole notion disappears, until child care and the drudge work are shared equally by men, all else is secondary. What happens in the home conditions what women do in the workplace and the constraints they face. We're not sitting around talking about whether men can combine work and family.
Goldin: The playing field is most unlevel inside the home. Let me throw this back another generation. It's the young son who should be taught to wash the dishes and to make his bed and his sister's bed. He needs to be taught to work in the home and to treat that work as respectful, dignified and communal. Until that's done, we will continue to reproduce generations of good men and women who attempt to go on the same path as equals in the labor market, yet who diverge when they enter the front door.
Wilson: It seems to me that we should try to talk about generating ongoing national dialogues. This should become a major public issue that would be discussed in the media, taken up by the President and other leaders. That way we can increase our consciousness as well as our conscience about these things. If we just lay back and hope some evolutionary process will work itself out, we could be in the 22d century before significant changes take place.
De Grazia: I am skeptical that single families have the power to socialize their offspring to do away with gender inequality in the home, much less the workplace. Too many social trends undermine them.
Schor: A big part of women's problem is they entered a male economy, a male work culture, an economy structured to meet the situations of men. Until the workplace changes to accommodate the fact that we are now a society in which men and women participate full time, we will not achieve the goal of equality.
Wilson: I fight pessimism all the time. But I'm going to be a little bit optimistic here. I have in mind a coalition: whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans who will start to demand a serious national debate on the need for social and family supports to mute or cushion the effects of economic changes. We're beginning to see some of that already with increasing talk of child care. And there's research to suggest that if you can reduce child-care costs, it can increase women's labor-force participation, improve the types of jobs they could get and could ultimately result in a reduction in gender inequality. So I'm going to put on my optimistic hat and say I think that the eventual development of this progressive coalition will have many positive effects, including reduction of gender inequality.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 13, 1999, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 16 about women's economic power misattributed a statement about the distribution of black and white women in the work force in the 60's and 70's and the success of Asian women in the work force since 1980, relative to that of black and Hispanic women. The speaker was William Julius Wilson, the writer and Harvard professor, not Marta Tienda, the writer and Princeton professor. Both were among those interviewed for the article.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Over the last 100 years, technological progress has made household labor considerably less burdensome for women. . . . But meanwhile, standards have risen, leaving women with more to do and higher expectations to live up to -- while men continue to do much less than their share of the housework.; Women's presence in the labor force has increased emphatically over the last quarter century, and so have opportunities for advancement. . . . But on average, women still earn no more than 85 percent of men's wages, and the structure of the workplace remains geared to meet the needs and expectations of men.; Women, especially college graduates,are working at rates rapidly approaching those of men. . . . And their share of private consumption has swelled -- but mainly for necessities, leaving them with little more in the way of real discretionary spending power. (Christoph Niemann)

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Omaha

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER wrote "The Heartland" volume of the Smithsonian Guides to Natural America.

 BODY:
When the first tentative green digits of daffodils poke through the wan prairie turf in Omaha, it doesn't necessarily guarantee spring, an iffy and tempestuous season on the plains. But it does mean that in a few weeks, without fail, dozens of strapping young men in baseball uniforms and their fans and families of varying girth, adornment and dishabille will descend on our city for the College World Series. We can't wait.
And 1999 should be special because it is the 50th year that the Big O, as some call it, will be host to this baseball extravaganza. The series takes place June 11 to 19, after the opening ceremony on June 9. 
 Omaha is a family town. What it may lack in hipness it makes up for in congeniality, which is one reason the city is the perfect place for baseball in its pure, uninflated form. Even its most famous citizen, the financier Warren Buffett, the second richest man in America, after Bill Gates, lives in an ordinary house on an ordinary block in a comfortable old center-city neighborhood.
The city perches on rolling bluffs along the Missouri River, its steep hills reminders that contrary to prevalent opinion, the plains are not flat. Omaha is the birthplace of Malcolm X, Gerald Ford and the TV dinner. Its economy is tied to the processing of agriculture commodities and the moving of people, goods and information.
The trails forged in the 1850's by immigrants heading West through the Platte Valley have been subsumed by Interstate 80. The Pony Express was rendered obsolete in 1861 by the transcontinental telegraph, much of which was put in place by an Omaha entrepreneur, Edward Creighton. Now, Omaha is a hub of telemarketing and credit-card processing, which in 100 years may sound as romantic as the Pony Express.
On the western fringes, in the town of Valley, Valmont Industries manufactures center pivots, the giant Tinkertoy-like irrigation devices. This apparatus is what creates the circles travelers see from 30,000 feet on clear days as they fly over the more arid parts of America. It is Nebraska's thumb print on the continent.
 
Events
The College World Series is played in Rosenblatt Stadium, 1202 Bert Murphy Drive, at Exit 454 (13th Street) of I-80. The stadium sits like a palace on one of Omaha's majestic bluffs; parking is an adventure or a nightmare, depending on your frame of mind. The opening ceremony on June 9 will include a concert by the country-western group Sawyer Brown and a fireworks show; tickets cost $15 and can be purchased through Ticketmaster, (402) 422-1212 or www.ticketmaster.com.
Advance game tickets are sold out, but a limited number of same-day tickets will be available at the stadium; reserved seats cost $10, box seats $11, and all championship-game seats $15. Tickets for unreserved outfield bleacher seats -- an all-American sardine-packed experience, but get there early -- cost $30 for a book of 10. Information and ticket books from (402) 554-4404.
The Summer Arts Festival, June 25 to 27, is an annual sidewalk bazaar of juried arts and crafts, music, food and libation in the heart of downtown, on Farnam Street between 17th and 20th Streets. There will also be children's activities. In celebration of its 25th year, the festival will include an evening of open-air dancing and tours of galleries in the nearby historic Old Market district. A popular spot is the microbrewery tent, with local beers. Admission is free; (402) 896-5976.
"Searching for Ancient Egypt," an exhibition of art and artifacts from the University of Pennsylvania, is on display at Joslyn Art Museum, 2200 Dodge Street, through July 25. A jewel in the Joslyn's permanent collection is the cache of works by the Swiss artist Karl Bodmer, whose exquisite watercolors document the landscapes and Native Americans along the Missouri in the 1830's.
The museum itself is a work of art, a shimmering pink marble Art Deco edifice; an addition designed by the architect Norman Foster, a winner of the Pritzker prize, is admirably faithful to the original. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Sunday noon to 4 P.M. General admission is $5, $2.50 ages 5 to 17, and $3 for 62 and older and college students; free on Saturday until noon. General admission plus the Egypt exhibit costs $9.50, $7.50 for seniors and students, and $5 for children; (402) 342-3300 or www.joslyn.org.
A sporting event expected to draw even bigger crowds than the College World Series is the Junior Olympics National Championships, July 27 to Aug. 1. This six-day track and field competition, for athletes 8 to 18, will be at Burke High School, 12200 Burke Boulevard. Free. Information: (800) 238-3753 or www.neusatf-youth.org.
 
Sightseeing
A trip to the Strategic Air Command Museum, off Exit 426 of I-80 in Ashland, about 30 minutes west of Omaha, is a good excuse to take a spin into rural, agrarian Nebraska. The museum, which opened in 1998, is a cavernous structure of glass and steel housing more than two dozen aircraft, including an SR-71 Blackbird (fastest plane in the world) and B-17, B-36 and B-52 bombers. On the softer side, an exhibit of quilts with aviation and patriotic themes will be on display May 28 to July 19. Open daily 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., except holidays. Admission is $6, $3 ages 5 to 12, $5 for 65 and up and active military members. Information: (800) 358-5029 or www.sacmuseum.org.
In the heart of downtown, the Old Market, roughly five square blocks bounded by Farnam and Jones Streets and 10th and 13th Streets, is the last gasp of 19th-century Omaha. The gathering of Italianate, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Louis Sullivan-like buildings once housed Skinner Macaroni, Swanson Food and Anheuser-Busch. They have now been converted to shops, restaurants, galleries and apartments.
One shop, Nouvelle Eve, 1102 Howard, has a small but select inventory of clothing, lingerie and jewelry. Among Omaha's best bakeries is Delice European Bakery and Coffee Bar, 1206 Howard. And one of the few blessedly eccentric places in Omaha -- with berets, dreadlocks and foreign accents -- is La Buvette Wine and Grocery, 511 South 11th Street, a good place for a light meal or wine and cheese.
On Saturdays through Oct. 18, a farmers' market at 11th and Jackson Streets sells local produce from 8 A.M. to 12:30 P.M., and Wednesdays from July 14 to Sept. 15, at 11th and Howard Streets from 5 to 8 P.M.
The Cathedral Neighborhood, also called the Gold Coast, is bounded by 38th and 40th Streets and Cuming and Davenport Streets. It encompasses many of the 19th-century moguls' homes, which are poised gracefully on a high terrace overlooking the Missouri Valley and downtown.
Joslyn Castle, 3902 Davenport, was the baronial estate of the entrepreneur George Joslyn and his wife, Sarah, who endowed the city's art museum. The neighborhood's namesake is the fantastic twin-spired Spanish Mission-style St. Cecilia's Cathedral, 701 North 40th Street.
The 1,300-acre Fontenelle Forest, 1111 Bellevue Boulevard North in Bellevue, is an exemplary urban nature center. A one-mile handicapped-accessible boardwalk winds through a beautiful woodland of basswood, burr oak and shagbark hickory. A trail through the flood-plain wetlands hints at what the backwaters of the Missouri were like before the river was throttled with dams. In May, Fontenelle is perhaps the best birding spot in the area. The center is open daily 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily. Admission: $3.50, $1.50 ages 3 to 11, $2 for 65 and up; (402) 731-3140.
 
Where to Stay
The Westin Aquila Hotel, 1615 Howard Street, preserves a venerable 1920's building on the National Register of Historic Places a few blocks west of the Old Market. The lobby sparkles with chandeliers, many of the 146 rooms overlook an interior marble courtyard and the nine individually decorated two-level suites have wood-burning fireplaces. Doubles are $89 to $159, suites $225 to $450; (800) 937-8461, fax (402) 342-2569.
The Doubletree Guest Suites, 7270 Cedar Street, provides easy access to I-80 off 72d Street, an important consideration for getting to and from the College World Series games. There are 187 suites, costing $79 to $114, an indoor pool and fitness room, a restaurant and a pub; (800) 222-8733; fax (402) 397-3266.
Budget: The Ak-Sar-Ben Super 8 Motel, 7111 Spring Street, is in a quiet midtown area. It is named for Omaha's longtime civic and philanthropic oligarchy (it spells Nebraska backward). It has 73 rooms, with doubles costing $55; (800) 800-8000; fax (402) 391-2063.
Luxury: Embassy Suites, 555 South 10th Street, is on the east edge of Old Market. Right behind it is a handsome red-brick building that was the first Union Depot and is now Union Pacific's national command central for its trains. The 249-room brick hotel, which opened in 1997, has standard modern features: a faux babbling stream, echo-y central atrium and glass elevators. Doubles range from $129 to $149; (800) 362-2779; fax (402) 346-4236.
One of the finest Gold Coast mansions is the 1894 Offutt House Bed and Breakfast, 140 North 39th Street, across the street from the Joslyn Castle. The seven guest rooms are appointed with four-poster beds, claw-foot tubs and other period furnishings. Doubles: $75 to $105; (402) 553-0951; fax (402) 553-0704.
 
Where to Eat
While Omaha is famous for steaks, its steakhouses can be underwhelming. But the Flatiron Cafe, 1722 St. Mary's Avenue, prepares a fabulous cooked-to-order pepper filet mignon with jumbo shrimp for those willing to pay the tariff. The restaurant is wedged into an all-glass space on the pointy end of Omaha's smaller version of New York's Flatiron Building. It is lovely (especially at night in a thunderstorm), and the food elegant. Appetizers include autumn spring rolls and tuna tartare, while entrees typically include lamb, beef, sea bass, tuna, and veal. Dinner for two with wine is about $120; reservations, recommended on weekends, at (402) 344-3040.
Pasta Amore, Rockbrook Village at 108th and West Center Road, is a small, bustling, friendly family-owned restaurant that serves hearty Italian food in Midwestern fashion -- that is, very large portions. Try the puttanesca, pasta with anchoves and black olives, and the cannelloni with spinach. Dinner for two with wine is about $40. Reservations are recommended; (402) 391-2585.
Stella's, 106 Galvin Road South, Bellevue, deserves a medal for maintaining a vanishing environment in franchised America: a plain roadhouse, with a neon beer sign and Formica tabletops, that serves great burgers and fries. A meal for two with beer costs $10 to $15. Closed Sunday; (402) 291-6088.
Omaha's Hispanic community has created a lively commercial district along 24th Street between H and Q Streets, with numerous restaurants and grocery stores. An old standby for enchiladas and chiles rellenos is El Alamo, 4917 South 24th Street, where dinner for two with beer is about $25; (402) 731-8969.
Since the College World Series is really a long picnic for many, a great place to get tailgating supplies is Wohlners Grocery, 5205 Leavenworth Street, (402) 551-6875. Wohlner's has superior cuts of beef and the carry-out deli features such items as crispy-roasted whole chickens, mashed potatoes and pinkish roast beef.

HEADLINE: First Person Female

BYLINE: By Jim Harrison; Jim Harrison is the author, most recently, of "The Road Home" and a collection of poems, "The Shape of the Journey."

 BODY:
Why did I think I might be able to write in the voice of a woman? Anyone who knows a novelist or poet very well has probably figured out that they are not dealing with a true intellectual. Intellectuals have a compulsion to be right and this urge is inimical to what John Keats called "negative capability," the capacity a poem or novel must have to keep afloat a thousand contradictory people and questions in order to create the parallel universe of art. Rationality, to borrow from Foucault, may be an inferior level of discourse. This is a very high-minded thing for me to say, keeping in view the recent moment when my wonderful mother, who is 84 and of 100 percent Swedish derivation, said, "You've made quite a living out of your fibs."
She and her four sisters grew up on a small, poor farm in northern Michigan with a rather strong and domineering father. However, all of the daughters became rather strong and domineering themselves, with not a weak sister in the lot. God pity the man, and hopefully He did, who ever tried to pull a fast one on these women. At this point I somehow remember that there is a reason I'm not supposed to call them ladies. They were not averse to having a good time and neither were their husbands who, though they all fished and hunted strenuously, would never describe these particular activities as "manly." That idea seemed to derive from writers of city origin like the tortured Hemingway, who, though a very great writer, seemed to suffer from a prolonged struggle with his manhood. Faulkner was a bit more nonchalant and colorful on the subject, what with his lifelong fascination with the "pelvic mysteries of swamps." 
 So I have often wondered about the peculiar female umbrella I grew up under and what particular effect it had on my work, what drove me to write in a female voice in most of "Dalva," all of the novella "The Woman Lit by Fireflies" and a large portion of my most recent novel, "The Road Home." I could always ask the analyst I've been visiting in New York City for more than 20 years, but I never have. That would be poking needlessly around the sacred veil of art herself. The answer is always in the entire story, not a piece of it. As the Acoma poet Simon Ortiz says, "There are no truths, only stories." And on a wretchedly therapeutic level there's the idea that my capability to write as a woman saved me from death by drugs and booze, in that manliness in our culture can paint you into a corner where the only thing left to do is eat road kill and bite the moon.
Back in the late 70's the character of Dalva came to me in a dream. This is not the sort of thing that is fashionable with literary critics, but then they have their lives and I have mine. In fact she appeared several times in dreams. At first her voice was beyond my ability to hear, as if I were indeed deaf or could hear only the rhythm of modulations, but by strong inference her dream language seemed to say, "Listen to me now, I've been waiting for you a long time." Perhaps it takes a culture as slippery and venal as our own to discount the dream life that was so vital to people for 30,000 years. Dalva appeared at a time of great emotional stress, after I had taken a very long nondirectional car trip, fixing on the particularly unknown state of Nebraska -- a place that had always fascinated me as a last locale for the collision of our own and native cultures that ended in South Dakota at Wounded Knee in 1890 but still survives in vital remnants to the extent that if you're blind to it in our past, you're liable to be blind to it in the present and future.
My grand historical scheme dissembled in the imaginary life of this woman, who herself was part Lakota, whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather had truly lived our history, and she, finally, no less than they, not as a pawn but as a particularly vivid human being.
Of course, the raw meat on the floor, the mystery, is how to manage to convincingly enter another's voice. At 19 I was a poor scholar indeed, but I owned most of the Bollingen volumes of the collected work of Carl Jung. Rather than study the text I mined it for my own purposes, though it would be a couple of decades before I had the wit to use the material. One very troubling idea was Jung's question of what we have done with our twin sisters that the culture forces us to abandon at birth. This is a reduction, but then I'm a novelist and poet, and I'm talking about fiction, not accuracy. But perhaps in my work in the voice of a woman, I was trying to revive this ghost that the culture steals from us.
An additional source was my sometimes casual but lifelong study of the roots of American Indian culture. This is scarcely an abstraction in northern Michigan, where the closest reservation is only a half-dozen miles from our farm and the mixed bloods abound. Again, this was not a scholarly impulse but a search for fuel, for answers to our behavior that seemed not to exist in white culture. A pervasive theme in many native cultures is the freedom of shape changing, where the man or woman becomes a coyote, a bear, a wolf, a bird, a flower, tree, creek, rock, wind. This is somewhat more attractive to a loony young writer than an M.B.A., much less an M.F.A., and I unwittingly traveled these dangerous waters most of my life. The merest suggestion of emotional limits drives me into a sodden funk. In "The Road Home," Dalva can say things, simply enough, that a male character can't, and in areas I can't bear to be voiceless. Talking about loutish cowboys, one of whom she errantly loved, she says: "By the first midnight in a Hardin bar it occurred to me that these people made Brooklyn Sicilians look like English gentlemen. There's a terrible illusion that the grandeur of landscape contributes to grandeur of personality." I have too many cowboy friends to say such a thing, but Dalva was up to it.
I tend to think of art as essentially androgynous and that gender is a biological rather than a philosophical system. I doubt that there is an intelligent straight man who hasn't at times envied the seeming emotional latitude of either women or gay friends. On a perhaps comic level for a novelist, once you have decided to make this emotional latitude your own, you have already committed your act of hubris. You are way up there on the high board, and now you will discover if the pool is empty or full. On an almost absurd level I thought once that since I'm blind in my left eye, I'm missing half of life -- and if I'm writing only as a man, I'm cut in half again. Being down to a scant quarter isn't enough to sustain my life.
The pool appears to have been full, but in literary matters the jury is out for a great deal longer than writers might wish. Dalva began her public life rather slowly but is still thriving 10 years later. Clare, in the novella "The Woman Lit by Fireflies," has even been included in a feminist anthology. Clare's situation was scarcely unique though not often noted. A young woman marries a liberal, high-minded young man. She retains her ideals but watches his degenerate, deliquesce, until she can no longer bear it and abruptly leaves.
Dalva's reappearance in my recent "The Road Home" did quite well, especially in France, where the novel first was published and marked my first appearance on a national best-seller list. I have no specific ideas on why my work has done this well in France. Of the hundreds of letters and reviews, there have only been two real objections to my writing in the voice of a woman. This surprises me, though I thought that many of the political-minded might think of me as beneath contempt or essentially harmless, or that possibly women might prefer stories to politics, or that a literary novel rarely raises anyone to anger unless there is unpardonable sexual mayhem.
And maybe I could describe the cages in which my heroines lived because as a male I unconsciously helped to build these cages. Dalva was free to be an inordinately strong woman partly because I have known a number of them, easily as many as the inordinately strong men I have known. You have to look more closely, because men have generally defined the terms of strength.
If you can agree with the notion of the twin sister you abandoned at birth, the almost intolerable problem is access to her mind. It is here that we deal with aspects of the creative process that appear decidedly nonrational. If many of the culture's presumptions about women are wrong, and they are, you must certainly abandon any habituation and conditioning if you want the slightest access. Oddly enough, the first presumption your mind must demolish is that women lack the latitude of individuality of men. This is not the less difficult for being so obvious. I suspect that the source of so much feminine anguish in political and social terms is the same for anyone who is purposefully misunderstood. From birth to death someone is always yelling a name in your face that is not your own.
After "Dalva," "The Woman Lit by Fireflies" and "The Road Home," I'm willing to give up the quest, but then in an interview I once said that I didn't want to write about "nifty guys at loose ends," the fodder for so much of our postmodernist fiction. Men and women alike as writers may wander lonely as a cloud, or simply scratch their tired ironical behinds, quite unmindful that the neofascists hope to make us only workers in a theme park for the convenience of the global economy.
To show how confused the unconscious well out of which a writer draws material can be, it occurred to me while writing this that whether it is Clare in "The Woman Lit by Fireflies" or Dalva herself, perhaps I am trying to revive the presence of my beloved sister, Judith, who died with my father in an auto accident when she was 19. We used to talk about Dostoyevsky and Rilke, Modigliani and Gauguin, while burning red candles and listening to Berlioz. Who knows? In fiction I try to make life live itself. Judith was an indomitable young woman, and it is very likely indeed that this still-living spirit contributes to my efforts, however short they fall. Ultimately, the perception of reality in a culture is consensual, and so it must be if its peculiar civilization is to function. You have to excuse all the question marks thrown in by the artists, whether they are poets, painters, composers, novelists or sculptors. Their calling from the beginning has been to maintain the vitality of the human spirit whether by saying no in thunder or assuming a voice not of their own sex.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Start-Up Leads Phone Cause in Battle for Internet Access

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 13

 BODY:
Michael W. Malaga, chairman of Northpoint Communications Group Inc., stood at a whiteboard in his office here and explained how his newly public company planned to change the Internet business.
Northpoint builds high-speed data networks using normal phone lines -- an approach that could render the networks of most current Internet service providers obsolete. 
 He drew a box on his improvised map of the Bay area. "So I.S.P.'s have these big modems pools in every city," Mr. Malaga said, referring to the conventional Internet service providers, "and these access points for dedicated services like T-1 lines," he continued, drawing another box. "And then they aggregate the traffic somewhere else to transport to another city," he added, drawing a third box and connecting them all with lines.
After pausing, the 34-year-old executive erased the entire schematic with three swift strokes. "In the future," he said, "they won't have to do any of this. We will allow I.S.P.'s to become sales and marketing companies."
The question is whether by "allow" he really means "force." Although it had revenue last year of only about $1 million, Northpoint, which raised $360 million in an initial public stock offering on Nasdaq on May 5, now has a stock market value of about $5 billion.
The company is perhaps the most advanced of a small cadre of aggressive new players that are building high-speed Internet networks based on a technology called digital subscriber line, or D.S.L. It is a technology that, if widely embraced by computer users, could do away with the dial-up modem access offered by the leading Internet service providers, like the network-access portion of America Online's business or Internet access provided by companies like Mindspring Enterprises.
Indeed, D.S.L. is shaping up as the telephone network's main weapon against the cable television industry's mounting campaign to offer high-speed Internet access. That is why the Baby Bell local telephone companies themselves are taking a hard look at D.S.L. But so far, the smaller and nimbler D.S.L. upstarts like Northpoint are the ones having more success turning the technical concept into commercial reality.
As it turns out, if the Internet service providers really are fated to obsolescence, they may be planting the seeds of their own destruction: for those companies are Northpoint's main customers.
Northpoint uses advanced D.S.L. technology from Copper Mountain Networks Inc., which itself went public on Thursday, raising $84 million and achieving a stock market value of $1.5 billion. The technology, which combines software and hardware, enables Northpoint to build networks that can deliver up to 1.5 million bits of information a second -- or about 30 times as much Internet data over a normal phone line as is possible with a conventional 56,000-bit-a-second modem. Rather than sell the use of those lines directly to customers, Northpoint strikes deals with Internet service providers to use its systems to resell the high-speed data service to small and medium-sized business users and residential consumers.
Until now, computer users seeking high-speed access through the telephone network have typically used a special kind of circuit called a T-1 line. T-1 can deliver 1.5 million bits of information a second, but it might cost the user $800 or more a month. A comparable system based on Northpoint's D.S.L. network might cost the user as little as $350. As a result, an Internet service provider can resell Northpoint's D.S.L. lines more economically than providing its own T-1 lines or leasing such lines from a telephone company.
But the fundamental rules of communications economics mean that the success of Northpoint and its initial D.S.L. competitors, Covad Communications Group Inc. and Rhythms Netconnections Inc., may very well spell the end of broad profitability for traditional Internet providers.
But Northpoint cannot afford to be greedily gleeful about this prospect. For if the Baby Bell local phone titans also expand into D.S.L., those same economic rules could endanger the long-term success of Northpoint and the other D.S.L. upstarts.
An essential economic characteristic of the communications industry is that communications networks cost a lot to build but, once built, relatively little to operate. While it may cost billions to build a fiber optic link from New York to Los Angeles, for instance, it costs only pennies, if that, to transmit a call using that network.
As a result, the companies that control the assets -- the optical fiber, the switches, the advanced gear for transmitting data from one point to another -- control the pricing for communications services. These companies also reap most of the profits. It is very difficult to generate long-term success in the communications business by leasing communications capacity from others.
The quest to control physical communications assets, and thus to control one's own costs and increase profitability, is the basic rationale behind many of the billion-dollar deals that have become so routine in the telecommunicatons business. And that is why Northpoint's business model may look so attractive to investors but also so potentially dangerous for Internet providers.
For everyday Internet providers, squeezed between America Online's marketing juggernaut in the consumer market and the power of international giants in the big-business segment, Northpoint offers a compelling proposition. Northpoint can build the D.S.L. network, operate it and maintain it. That frees Internet providers to concentrate on finding customers, operating E-mail and World Wide Web server computers, selling the service at a markup and answering the phone when something goes wrong.
By using Northpoint, even the smallest Internet provider gets access to a high-speed data system more advanced than just about anything America Online is using -- and competitive with the cable modems that are beginning to sprout around the nation.
But in one sense a deal with Northpoint is a Faustian bargain. The sacrifice is profit margin, because Northpoint controls the asset. An example illustrates the case: Northpoint generally sells a 160-kilobit line to an Internet provider for $75 a month. Flashcom, which is based in Westminster, Calif., and is one of Northpoint's biggest customers, sells that same line to end users for $79.95 a month.
With discounts for buying in bulk, Flashcom is probably paying less than $75 -- but not much less. Because Northpoint controls the asset, Northpoint controls most of the profits.
AT&T is pursuing much the same strategy, but using cable television systems, rather than traditional phone lines. When America Online and other Internet providers complain that AT&T will not have to offer the use of its cable systems to other Internet providers, what they really fear is the prospect that AT&T will sell access to those systems at prices that keep the bulk of the profits for itself.
For Northpoint, the potential pitfall in its business plan is that the very economic forces that could let it absorb most of the profits from traditional Internet providers could eventually undermine its own profitability. Northpoint, after all, has to lease the actual copper phone lines to its customers from the Baby Bell phone giants (though at rates that are highly regulated).
The company connects to those circuits by installing its own network equipment inside the Bell companies' central switching offices. And Northpoint buys this equipment from Copper Mountain and hires Lucent Technologies Inc. to actually install it. Moreover, Northpoint deals with the end-user customers only through its I.S.P. resellers. Given all this, what -- if anything -- is Northpoint's long-term asset?
"The asset is really in the co-location," Mr. Malaga said, referring to the deals Northpoint has struck to place equipment inside the Bells' central offices. Indeed, Northpoint has hundreds of such deals, each of which can take months to negotiate. That has given Northpoint a head start on many of its potential rivals.
But in the long run, the Bells are compelled by regulation to offer co-location to just about any company that asks for it. What that means is that Northpoint might well end up being more valuable as an acquisition target for a bigger company -- a Bell, say -- looking to make a quick D.S.L. splash.

Big Companies Fall Behind In Fixing Year 2000 Glitch
The largest companies in the nation continue to fall behind their schedules for fixing the Year 2000 problem, and most suspect that their budget estimates for the remaining work are too low, according to a survey in April that was the latest in a closely watched series that began in 1994.
About 22 percent say they do not expect to have all of their critical systems tested and ready to adjust when the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000. That is up from 16 percent in November. The number of companies that have encountered a failure stemming from Year 2000 problems jumped to 72 percent in April from 55 percent in November. Page C5.

Paul Allen Gets a Makeover
Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and owner of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team, looks a lot more dapper these days as he takes his accustomed seat courtside at Trail Blazers games. Appearing on television frequently as the Trail Blazers are having their best season in years, the 45-year-old billionaire looks much more like a high-technology investor than the guitar-playing, hacker geek, left, that many recall. Gone are the rumpled sport shirts and the beard, replaced by clean-shaven cheeks and well-cut suits. C4.
 
Internet Radio Moves Beyond Niche
Until recently, listening to the radio on the Internet was considered the domain of the 20-something set. But recent deals show the growth of a multilayered industry with players convinced that the personal computer will be the radio tuner for the next generation. C11.

HEADLINE: The Difficulty in Being Earnest;
Efforts to Reinvent The Los Angeles Times Falter

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Mark H. Willes, the chairman and chief executive of the Times Mirror Company, began a corporate meeting last September by asking dozens of his top lieutenants how they felt about the company's financial goals. As he watched the results tallied on an overhead projector, his easy smile faded.
Using a five-point scale -- five for very optimistic, one for very pessimistic -- the tally showed a lot of threes and fours. Times Mirror's executives were dubious about the company's ability to achieve its aims. A major reason, participants said, was the lackluster performance of The Los Angeles Times, the engine that generates 40 percent of corporate revenue. 
 At a later session, executives of other Times Mirror newspapers wondered out loud how the company could increase revenue 5 percent annually and profit 10 percent annually if The Times could not match that performance.
Mr. Willes, a former senior executive of General Mills who strode out of the cereal business into the newspaper industry four years ago, cutting costs, closing New York Newsday and attaching rocket boosters to Times Mirror's stock price, has always made journalists nervous. His revolutionary talk of reinventing the business raised the specter that profit motives would endanger the integrity of their work.
Those fears have largely subsided. These days, the questions focus on the business decisions Mr. Willes has made since he appointed himself publisher of The Los Angeles Times 18 months ago. Even by Mr. Willes's lights, his campaign to reinvigorate the flagship newspaper is in trouble.
Signs of that trouble abound. Circulation growth has been the prime directive of the Willes era, and daily circulation has grown by 40,000, to 1.1 million, since Mr. Willes joined Times Mirror. But in the last year circulation was flat and in April, it declined. Profits in 1998 were supposed to increase by 3.6 percent; instead, they dropped about 15 percent, to about $165 million, according to two people with access to the company's budget summaries.
His widely debated system giving each newspaper section a general manager or mini-publisher to facilitate business and editorial cooperation is in shambles. Meanwhile, two-thirds of The Times's senior executives have raced, or been pushed, out the door and most of their replacements are new to Los Angeles or new to the newspaper business.
Mr. Willes's frustration is evident, though his faith in his vision, including the audacious circulation goal of selling 500,000 more copies, for a total of more than 1.5 million, has not waned.
"What we said 18 months ago was we've got to reinvent this very large, very complicated newspaper," Mr. Willes said in an interview. "There is going to be a large amount of change and breakage in the process." But, he said, he is confident that the management team now in place will be able to move the business in the right direction. He has taken to reprising his old theme song: businesses that don't grow will die.
"All of the agony we're going through," he said, "is because we're determined to grow."
The year's events shook his faith in some subordinates, and theirs in him. Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, said: "There is no reason why things can't work, and with Mark taking over the publisher's role at The Los Angeles Times, they should work. The strategy has been fine. The execution has not."
Not that it is unusual that a radical change in business vision causes equally radical personnel shifts, which can disrupt the business. The Times also was not a problem-free institution when Mr. Willes arrived at Times Mirror in 1995; for several years its executives had groped to reconcile a variety of business strategies while struggling through harsh economic times.
"Both the city of Los Angeles and the newspaper had been undergoing a slow-motion nervous breakdown," said Steve Wasserman, the book editor of The Times. "The shattering of the defense economy, the collapse of the retail economy, the 1992 riots, these were body blows to Los Angeles's sense of itself. And the newspaper has seen that many of the things it took for granted are up for grabs. The demographics of its audience have changed enormously."
The newspaper's financial performance did improve in 1996 after several years in the doldrums; in 1997, the year Mr. Willes added the publisher's title to his business card, the newspaper's profits soared.
As publisher, Mr. Willes has made a number of visible moves. He added 11 new business journalists and gave their section 200 more pages of space a year. Competitors say the improvement is noticeable; a month ago, two Times reporters won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the entertainment industry.
Local news coverage has been reshaped to win readers. The Times cut its regional reporting staff and put its emphasis on a dozen new "Our Times" newspapers, which give local communities, from Yorba Linda in the south to Ojai in the north, everything from high school sports scores to neighborhood crime reports.
The Times also created a new health section and a separate Hispanic news desk, with 13 journalists.
Mr. Willes ticks off these initiatives with studied satisfaction. But, he adds, "If we were to find out how many additional readers we've had because of this very expensive effort with the Latino desk, I could probably count it on these fingers," as he held up both hands.
Some Times executives, dissatisfied with Mr. Willes's predecessors, welcomed his fresh approach and optimism. But some of these same managers are now gone. The pace of the exodus has quickened recently; heads around the industry turned in late February when Jaynie Studenmund, a banking executive who started work as a senior vice president on Jan. 11, left after six weeks.
All Ms. Studenmund would say was: "This was a gut-wrenching decision in large part because I do like and respect so many people at The Los Angeles Times. And I do happen to like and respect Mark Willes tremendously. But I concluded for me personally it was not a match."
Seven other of more than 15 managers who have left recently were willing to discuss their experience at The Times on condition that they not be identified. Their most common criticism was that management operated in a helter-skelter, ad hoc manner, with serial strategies that produced one exhausting experiment after another.
The most ballyhooed management change, one that sent a shiver around many newsrooms, was the creation of general managers for news and feature sections. The fear was that the general managers, dealing with both editors and advertising executives, would have a pernicious influence on journalism. Less noticed were worries in the advertising department that sections would cannibalize each other's ads.
Neither happened -- possibly because the general managers found themselves without influence, and now the ranks of the general managers are turning over as fast as those of the senior vice presidents.
"There has been a lot of turnover," acknowledged Leo C. Wolinsky, one of The Times's four managing editors. "I suppose one could argue that every organization making a radical change goes through this before settling down with the right team. But it's going on all the time. And new people are coming in who have to learn what the old people knew already. It's hard to get a head of steam up."
At its core, the issue was: What does a general manager do? As one former general manager explained, "In terms of controlling revenues, the ad department reported somewhere else, not to us. How can you be responsible for a profit-and-loss statement when you don't control any levers?"
Mr. Willes's new second-in-command, Kathryn M. Downing, 45, who had earlier run the Times Mirror legal publishing division, agrees with the criticism. "We should have spent more time up front deciding what their role was," she said of the general managers. Also, she said, the lines of authority were unclear. Now James D. Helin, a new senior vice president and chief marketing officer, will supervise them. Advertising department strategies are being developed by John C. McKeon, another new senior vice president, who worked for two decades at Newsday.
The circulation department had different problems. By one former executive's account, 1998 began with directives to grow at any cost, which were supplanted by directives to grow but cut costs ever more aggressively.
Now, Mr. Willes and Ms. Downing said, the expensive direct-marketing strategy -- telephone calling and door-knocking that pulled potential customers from their dinner tables -- is being curtailed. Subscribers who buy under those circumstances are less likely to renew. More than 90 percent of new subscribers fail to renew, forcing the sales staff to replace them just to keep circulation figures stable.
One new circulation strategy is joint distribution with immigrants' newspapers like La Opinion, which The Times partly owns, and Korea Times, the country's largest Korean-language newspaper, which started distributing The Times to some of its 20,000 Sunday readers a few weeks ago. But the net effect on overall circulation is still unclear.
Proving that the experimentation and executive churn contributed to the newspaper's 1998 disappointing financial results would be difficult, but it did not help. Still, the newspaper's operating profit margin was 15 percent -- down from 18 percent in 1997, but hardly embarrassing. The average price of Times Mirror stock was well below the industry average in 1998, according to an index of newspaper stocks developed by Bear, Stearns, but this year it is doing slightly better than the industry average. The stock price closed down 18.75 cents on Friday, to $58.875.
As high-margin help-wanted advertising leached away in 1998, ad revenues fell well behind projections, ending the year at $881 million, $20 million less than projected, according to the two people with access to budget summaries. This eventually led to cuts in news space in the newspaper. The editorial department has lost about 3 percent of the space it had in 1998, according to Michael Parks, the editor of The Times. The front section and the metropolitan news section have been among the most affected, he said.
"In some respects it's made us make better choices, but in other respects it does pinch," Mr. Parks said. "When we need the space we go and get it for major stories. Where it pinches is on daily coverage."
It did not help that the newspaper was unable to account for about 3,000 tons of newsprint, forcing the company to take a loss of about $1.8 million.
The financial disappointments came as regional competition from newspapers sprinkled around The Times's large circulation area intensified. And for the third time in a decade, The Times is trying out a new local news strategy, relying on 12 new small local "Our Times" newspapers, published by a Times subsidiary and distributed with The Times in specific communities, to win reader loyalty for their big sister.
The bet is that this hyper-local approach will attract more readers than the broader regional coverage. At the same time, the staffs at regional editions in Ventura County and the San Fernando Valley have been trimmed. These regional editions are edited as separate daily versions of The Times with particular emphasis given to news of regional interest, such as scores of area sports teams and the woes of county governments. Last fall, the Valley Edition's newsroom staff dropped from 111 full-time staffers and 7 part-timers to 84 full-time journalists. The Ventura Edition went from 32 to 29 full-time journalists.
As for the grandfather of the regional editions, the 34-year-old Orange County edition, which competes with the dominant Orange County Register for the area's wealthier readers, Mr. Willes said, "I don't honestly know what we're going to do."
He added, "What we're doing now is not working as well as it needs to."
In reshaping the local coverage, the newspaper has also created a two-tier salary system, with less experienced "Our Times" starting reporters paid $450 a week, less than half the starting salary of a Times reporter. In some areas of Orange County, like Brea and Laguna Hills, the Our Times editorial material is merged with The Times metropolitan news section.
While The Times's overall daily circulation increased by just three-tenths of a percent in the six months ended March 31, circulation in Ventura County, which has three "Our Times" sections, grew by 3 percent, according to Robert G. Magnuson, a senior vice president for the regions at The Times.
Mr. Willes is optimistic when he talks about such a harbinger of circulation success. But his tone sometimes grows grim, alluding to dire alternatives. In the Times Mirror 1998 annual report, Mr. Willes was paraphrased as saying that if expectations of growth proved unfounded, "the result would mean dismantling the company." In a recent interview, he said that the reference was just a variant of the grow-or-die theme, nothing new.
"My frustration," he said in a separate interview, "has come from not doing everything we could do to try things that have been successful in other businesses. If we've tried all these things and in four years they haven't worked, then they can say Mark Willes did some damage before he left. But we haven't tried them yet."

HEADLINE: Rubin Sees Growth Continuing in U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that he expected the economy to experience low inflation and solid growth in the coming months, but he warned that it was risky for the world to rely on the United States as the only engine of economic growth.
Mr. Rubin, in an interview with ABC, was questioned about whether the unexpectedly high jump in the Consumer Price Index for April meant the robust economy was threatened by higher inflation. 
 "As you look forward, the most likely scenario remains one of solid growth and low inflation," said Mr. Rubin, who announced his resignation last week.
Financial markets tumbled Friday after the Labor Department said its index, the main inflation gauge of the economy, had increased by seven-tenths of a percent last month, the biggest monthly rise since October 1990 just before the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: Asian Leaders Report Progress Toward the Region's Recovery

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 16

 BODY:
Pacific Rim nations expressed confidence today in Asian nations' recovery from two years of financial crisis, but said that major risks were ahead and deeper reforms were needed.
Ministers from the 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting on this Malaysian island pledged not to abandon financial and corporate changes despite expectations of new economic health. They also called for urgent action to control the threat of volatile capital flows, blamed by Malaysia for setting off the financial crisis in mid-1997. 
 A joint statement underscored progress in the economies of Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand since the ministers met in Canada last year. "The financial crisis in the region has abated, and there are signs of a return in investor confidence," it said. "As a result, the economic outlook for the region has improved. There are, however, significant risks to the outlook. Moreover, serious challenges remain, particularly in restructuring the financial and corporate sectors, and in dealing with the effects of the crisis on the poor and the vulnerable."
But in a sign of continuing disagreements, the ministers failed to agree on whether currency speculators should be reined in.
The joint statement issued at the end of the two-day meeting balanced the views of the developing economies, which are eager to see steps to prevent a recurrence of the crisis, and those of more industrialized nations, which want deeper reforms.
What the compromise lacked in concrete measures may have been made up for by a tone of congeniality.
"While there are nuances and differences of view, I do sense some increased convergence," said Secretary of the Treasury-designate Lawrence H. Summers, who attended the meeting. Mr. Summers, who has been nominated to replace Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin when Mr. Rubin steps down in July, took advantage of the diplomatic stage to quash any speculation he would diverge from a strong-dollar policy.
"As Secretary Rubin and I have both said many times, a strong dollar is very much in America's national interest," Mr. Summers said.
The Clinton Administration has begun an effort to convince markets that key economic policies will be unaffected by the change at the Treasury. But some doubt has been expressed as to whether Mr. Summers will be as vocal as Mr. Rubin in pursuing a strong dollar.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: CHINA;
Public Anger Against U.S. Still Simmers In Beijing

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 16

 BODY:
Anger continued to percolate here today over the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, even as both Chinese and American officials gave signs that the height of the crisis had passed.
On Saturday, the Chinese newspapers all carried front-page articles about President Clinton's Friday night phone call to President Jiang Zemin, who had refused to accept earlier calls from Mr. Clinton since the bombing. And today, the People's Daily featured stories about the need to strengthen China, rather than about American "imperialism." 
 Deputy Prime Minister Li Lanqing told a visiting diplomat today that China still firmly supported "reform and opening up." That is the catch phrase used to describe the pro-Western, market-oriented economic policies of the last 10 years.
In an interview today, the American Ambassador to China, James Sasser, who has worked hard at nurturing closer ties with Beijing, said the relationship between China and the United States was not lost and could be repaired over time. He noted that points of contact between the governments have greatly multiplied in recent years, from joint-venture businesses to military exchanges.
"The bridge is superficially still quite damaged, but it's structurally sound," said Mr. Sasser, who spent four days stuck inside the embassy here during the protests. "There are a lot of things that are still in place here, even though there's got to be a time to get over things, a time of healing on both sides."
Today, five days after the end of angry demonstrations that left both the American and the British Embassies windowless and defaced, the roads of the leafy embassy district were filled with the usual mix of cars, bikes and pedicabs. The police presence was still heavy, though, and several blocks around the American Embassy remained closed.
The official New China News Agency today pointedly wrote about American businessmen and tourists visiting Beijing, apparently in an attempt to emphasize that visiting Westerners would be safe. The American Embassy in Beijing will partly reopen on Monday, although many areas will remain temporarily closed -- including its busy visa section, which was damaged.
But it is hard to overstate the quiet rage directed at the American Government that still burns inside many Chinese and that found protean displays this weekend. Two quickie books on the embassy bombing, which killed three Chinese, are already out and have become instant hot sellers. Their titles, "Chinese People Cannot be Pushed Around" and "China Cannot Be Bullied," give a sense of the popular mood.
China's state-run television stations substituted old home-grown films, or even Yugoslav war epics, for the many American movies and sitcoms usually on China's airwaves. CCTV-5, the central Government's sports channel, replaced popular National Basketball Association games with Filipino basketball, noting that because of the bombings the network had pulled "certain shows."
At one university campus, about 20 percent of students scheduled to take the English proficiency exam required by Western companies and American universities did not show up on Saturday, according to the Beijing Youth Daily.
But the mood seems to have shifted away from one that mixed anger, xenophobia and a desire for revenge to a more forward-looking impulse -- a shift that has been actively promoted by China's leaders and the Government-run press in the last two days.
The news media have been urging students to convert their angry energy into hard work and study in order to build a stronger China, and several have advocated continuing the "road of opening up and reform."
On Saturday night at Beijing University, where students organized anti-American protests last week, there were still many impromptu discussions about the meaning of the bombing and how China should proceed. Students say they are angry that the Western press has not carried more about the Chinese people who died in the bombing -- newspaper and news service employees whose pictures now adorn campus bulletin boards.
Also, many students refuse to believe that the bombing was a mistake. It is inconceivable that the world's highest-tech army could commit such a blunder, they say.
Most are sure that it was an intentional act by NATO or the United States or at least some faction of the American command that wants to see China undermined.

Can Mr. Summers Extend Mr. Rubin's Streak?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Never succeed a legend.
That is good advice for college sports coaches asked to replace a man who set the standard for excellence. If the new coach manages to carry on the tradition, he gets little credit. If not, he is hounded out of town by disappointed fans. 
 All of which brings us to Larry Summers, who gets to follow Robert Rubin as Treasury Secretary. Mr. Rubin is viewed by almost everyone as having done a brilliant job while presiding over the most amazing economic growth this country has seen in many decades.
It often seemed as if Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers, as his peripatetic deputy, were running the State Department, not the Treasury Department. When Mexico collapsed, they were the people who decided what to do. Ditto for Asia. It was Mr. Rubin who played the leading role in deciding to arrange an International Monetary Fund package to help Russia last year, and who then decided, when things got much worse, not to pony up more billions.
In all the commentary that accompanied Mr. Summers's nomination last week, it was remarkable how much of it dealt with overseas events. Would he be diplomatic enough to not offend Japanese sensibilities while pushing Japan to adopt growth-oriented policies? Could he do anything to repair our relations with China? It was as though the American economy were the least of the concerns for a Treasury Secretary, circa 1999.
Mr. Summers knows better. He knows that he is walking into a situation ripe with complacency from Washington to Wall Street to Main Street. Politicians assume that the unusually favorable economic conditions that have produced budget surpluses, full employment and low inflation will last forever. The stock market is valued as if recessions and inflation had been abolished, while computer-related productivity gains were certain to boost growth for years to come. Consumers have -- at least until the past couple of months -- been spending with abandon.
"Complacency," said Mr. Summers in a recent speech, "will be self-denying prophecy if it leads to unrealistic expenditure plans, excessive capacity creation, inappropriate asset valuations, or misguided credit expansion." In fact, it is probably doing all of those things.
One part of that complacency has been Wall Street's confidence that the Federal Reserve will not dare to try to slow things down by raising interest rates. That assurance was shaken a bit by Friday's report that consumer prices rose faster than expected last month.
It should be no surprise that inflation is ticking up. The pressures that forced down prices last year -- rising unemployment and collapsing currencies in Asia -- are reversing. That does not mean prices will zoom, but it might alarm investors who have assumed inflation is dead.
Mr. Summers has also called attention to the country's trade deficit, which is rising to record levels. Without last year's chaos in world markets -- and the current crises in Europe -- the rising deficit would have caused the value of the dollar to fall, as foreigners who were being paid in dollars for their goods tried to sell the bucks. But there has been no currency that people were eager to buy. The yen is hurt by the sluggish Japanese economy, while the euro suffers from government policies that limit growth and from worries over Yugoslavia and Russia.
There is nothing on the immediate horizon to spoil this party. But the kind of excessive trade deficit now being run cannot continue indefinitely. If, or when, other currencies start to look more attractive, we could run into an old-fashioned foreign-exchange crisis, with inflation up and the Fed tightening credit to protect the currency. With interest rates rising and the economy slowing, stock market valuations might come down rapidly.
If that happens in the next 20 months, it will not be Mr. Summers's fault. But he will be blamed as people recall how good things were before he got the job. If our good fortune continues, however, he probably will not be given much of the credit. That is what happens to people who succeed a legend.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
China's Liberals Look for Silver Lining

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 16

 BODY:
In assessing the impact of last week's nationalistic, anti-American outburst on their cause, Chinese liberals and political dissidents say there may be more immediate hard-line attitudes from the country's leaders, but hope that the outburst of activism will galvanize a generation forced to keep quiet for the last 10 years.
In the near term, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the deadly attack on China's Embassy in Belgrade have caused some Chinese to question the sincerity of American ideals. 
 "Many people will feel disillusioned about Western values, and that will make it more difficult for people like myself who lean toward them," said Yu Jie, a 26-year-old author of essays of social criticism and a graduate student at Beijing University.
Perhaps because they have no choice, many democracy advocates are searching for a silver lining in the week's tumult, hoping that political passions reawakened for the first time since the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 may eventually turn their way.
"It had been said that people these days didn't care about politics," said Wang Yongqing, a 57-year-old longtime dissident. "But these events show that there is still a lot of passion about the fate of the country," he said from his home in the southern city of Hangzhou, where he and others are struggling to keep alive the banned China Democracy Party.
"Whether this turns out to be a force for good or not we'll have to wait and see," Mr. Wang said.
An anguished mix of emotions has coursed through those who promote democratic values in China, ranging from liberal scholars pushing the boundaries of tolerated discourse to the smaller core of dissidents who court prison by posing a frontal challenge to Communist Party rule.
All say they shared the general anger over the bombing of a Chinese Embassy by a supposed friend. But many also felt deep chagrin as the patriotic fury of university students, traditional harbingers of change here, was directed not at China's political shortcomings but at the evils of the American Government, the main champion of human rights.
A leading liberal scholar said that "those young faces looked the same" as those during the huge student-led demonstrations of 1989. He added: "Everything looked the same: the emotions, the clothes, the banners. Except the slogans were different."
This scholar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he hoped that Americans would not over-react to the anti-American outburst, which he regards as shallow and stoked by propaganda. "The students found a target for releasing aggression that had accumulated over 10 years," he said. Since the crackdown in 1989, he said, "students have had no place to express their voice, to speak out on their dissatisfactions with society."
A liberal editor, who was active in the 1989 movement and spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "The demonstrations have helped train the students in street politics, and the long-term repercussions for the Government are dangerous."
In conversations in recent days, liberals and open dissidents all were quick to note that the Government had skillfully manipulated public emotions through its control of the media, and that alternate voices were suppressed.
Yet many also acknowledged that the diet of inflammatory news was so effective because it tapped into genuine nationalistic anger that reflected the widely held view here that the United States aims to prevent China from taking its rightful place as a world power. This feeling could veer in unpredictable directions.
In some ways, political conditions were tightening this year even before the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade. As June 4 approached -- the 10th anniversary of the smashing of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations -- anyone known as a leader from that period, and many of today's liberal intellectuals, were warned not to speak with foreign journalists.
Last fall, the fledgling China Democracy Party was nearly extinguished as three leaders were given long prison sentences. Sporadic arrests and trials of dissidents have continued.
Yet the economic reforms of the last 20 years, allowing more private enterprise and foreign contacts, have seen Chinese gain more freedom in their personal lives. They have more access to outside information than ever before. In private seminars and in some scholarly journals there is lively, if carefully worded, debate about political alternatives. It is too soon to tell whether those limited discussions may now be curbed.
Last week, national leaders stressed that they intended to continue China's economic opening to the West, seen as vital to China's modernization.
But the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade may have strengthened hard-liners in the Communist Party and its military, who already felt that President Jiang Zemin was too cozy with the United States. If China takes a more aggressive and anti-American international stance, many liberals worry about harmful fallout for domestic freedoms.
Politics at the top remains opaque to outsiders, and no clear evidence has surfaced of a serious split in the leadership, which even before last week did not hesitate to stamp out any open challenges to Communist Party rule.
In coverage of the embassy bombing, the memorial services for the three people who were killed and other events over the last week, the official media have featured President Jiang as the resolute national leader. He may be scrambling to avoid appearing soft on the West, particularly if party leaders who are more prone to confronting America abroad and clamping down at home have been strengthened.
In any case, the Communist Party is mounting new attacks on Western ideas about human rights. Today's issue of the popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily carries an essay that reads, "Chinese will have to emancipate themselves from the modern superstition of blindly copying the West and blindly yielding to the values of the United States."

HEADLINE: Gore Seizes Education as Campaign Platform

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

DATELINE: LAMONI, Iowa, May 16

 BODY:
In what political aides described as his first policy speech of the Presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore called today for "revolutionary change" and substantial Federal investment in education. He advocated universally available preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, the creation of a teachers corps of new graduates for neglected schools, rigorous tests for new teachers, the elimination of large high schools and legal protection allowing parents to leave work to visit their children's teachers during the workday.
Speaking at a college graduation ceremony in southern Iowa a day after opening his campaign headquarters in Des Moines, Mr. Gore said education was the key to meeting the country's economic, social and moral challenges. 
 "Let us realize that education is the greatest anti-poverty program," he said, "the most powerful anti-discrimination strategy we could ever have."
He referred to international comparisons showing American high school students to be far below those of many other countries, and he asked, "How long can we stay first in making new discoveries if we stay dead last, out of all countries surveyed, in physics?"
While the Vice President's proposals reflect a growing consensus among educators and contain elements found in legislative plans at the state and Federal level, certain aspects are new in a Presidential campaign, notably the call for a universal preschool and the commitment for a teachers corps.
Though southern Iowa is not a Democratic stronghold, the Vice President was warmly received at Graceland College, a conservative Christian institution affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His comments about high-quality preschool and elevating the teaching profession drew enthusiastic applause, as did his assertion of the need for renewed focus on discipline, values and safety in schools, all signs that focusing his domestic agenda on education will meet with public approval.
While the education goals of the two major parties often seem to resemble each other -- higher standards, better teachers, improved safety -- a principal distinction between Republicans and Democrats has been the opposition of Republicans to involving the Federal Government in education. Republicans favor local control and local standards and say Federal control will create unwieldy, costly bureaucracies.
Lamar Alexander, a Republican and former Education Secretary who is hoping to gain his party's Presidential nomination, reacted to Mr. Gore's speech by saying it was the "right church, wrong pew."
From his hometown, Maryville, Tenn., where he was a giving a college graduation speech, Mr. Alexander dismissed the Vice President's proposals as "adding up to a national school board." Mr. Alexander said that instead of creating more Federal education programs, Federal dollars should be sent back to local school boards, parents and teachers to let them decide what is best for their students.
But in his speech, Mr. Gore said: "Some say there is no national role in helping communities improve their schools. I say that education is our No. 1 national priority for investing in the future. And we must take dramatic steps to help states and communities provide a quality education for their children."
Neither Mr. Gore nor his aides would put a price on his new proposals, but they said all of it would fit within a balanced budget.
Mr. Gore divided his proposal into seven recommendations: provide preschool for all children; improve teacher quality partly through creation of a federally subsidized teachers corps; renew the focus on discipline and safety; fundamentally reduce the size of high schools; turn around failing schools; improve technology for schools, and create a tax-free savings plan for parents and grandparents to pay for college.
Mr. Gore said the teachers corps graduates would have to pass a rigorous test, and he advocated the same test for all new teachers as well as five-year evaluations of teachers for license renewal.
"No teaching license should be a lifetime guarantee," Mr. Gore said. But he emphasized that teachers, a traditional support group for Democrats, deserve respect. "When I see politicians bash our teachers," he said, "I have to wonder: How long would they last in a classroom with 24 14-year-olds?"
Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, hailed the Vice President's speech, saying she supported Mr. Gore's calls for new tests and evaluations to improve the quality of teachers.
For pupils with discipline problems, Mr. Gore advocated the creation of second-chance schools where troubled youngsters and those caught with guns "can receive the strict discipline and intensive services they need." In many of the nation's biggest cities, troubled students are simply expelled.
To avoid producing many such students, Mr. Gore offered a proposal: that parents, teachers and students meet on the first day of school every year to agree on and sign a discipline code. This would increase ties between parents and schools, he said.
He added that parents must be given the legal right to take time off from work for that and for subsequent teacher meetings. Aides said that protection would come through extension of the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act.
Mr. Gore said he favored increasing the ability of parents to choose a public school for their children outside their neighborhoods but opposed the use of vouchers supported by public money to send children to private schools. Vouchers are favored by many Republican candidates as a way to expand school choice and instill competition in the system. Mr. Gore said that would siphon public school financing.
Mr. Gore ended by calling for a National Tuition Savings program bringing together disparate state plans for tax-free savings for college by parents and grandparents. He also urged that employers help employees save, tax-free, for college and job training.

HEADLINE: Guatemalans Deny Changes For Indians And the Army

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: CHIMALTENANGO, Guatemala, May 16

 BODY:
Guatemalans today appeared to have voted down constitutional changes to recognize officially for the first time the rights of the country's Mayan majority, a rejection that supporters of the measures said would set back efforts to consolidate peace after a 36-year civil war.
Electoral officials said tonight that turnout for the referendum was extremely poor, about 18 percent of Guatemala's four million registered voters, because of Guatemala's high illiteracy rate and the scarce effort to inform residents about the proposals. But preliminary results for Guatemala City, where nearly half of all eligible voters reside, indicated a vote of 77 percent to 23 percent against 50 amendments to the Guatemala Constitution. 
 In a country where the indigenous majority has faced genocide and poverty and has long been excluded from power, the reforms would have declared Guatemala "multiethnic" and for the first time granted equal status to the languages, religions and customary laws of the Mayan peoples, who account for about 60 percent of the population. The proposals would have also reined in the role of the military and overhauled the judicial system.
The vote posed what President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen had called "a decisive test" in Guatemala's willingness to build a more just society after decades of war between the Government and leftist guerrillas that killed about 200,000 people. The proposals would also have made the first tangible changes in the army and the Government called for by peace accords signed in 1996. Supporters considered the changes crucial to a lasting transformation to an inclusive, democratic state.
Opponents of the reforms, including business people, politicians and intellectuals, said they mainly objected to the decision by the Guatemalan Congress, which devised the measures, to divide a wide range of amendments among four ballots and make voters decide on blocks of changes rather than each one individually. But the opposition also underscored deep racial divisions, with many warning of the danger of "Balkanizing" the country by granting legal privileges to some ethnic groups.
"This can bring about another war," said Roberto Orozco, 50, a businessman in the department of Sacatepequez, east of here, who said he voted against all 50 changes. "We're going to turn into Kosovo, with each tribe taking up arms to go to war."
European diplomats and United Nations officials monitoring the peace process here had said a "no" vote would set back the political momentum for change.
"The vote would tell us how many people support the broad mandate of democratization," Jean Arnault, the United Nations special representative here, said during an interview a few days ago. "I can't say the referendum speaks for the people as a whole, but it represents the views of those prepared to be politically active at this stage. It will mean something."
The constitutional amendments, however, also counted on the support of the leadership of of major political parties, including the ruling National Advancement Party, known as PAN. Oscar Berger, Guatemala City's Mayor and a presidential candidate for PAN in elections in November, said in an interview that, if elected, he would find other "mechanisms" to pass the reforms required by the peace agreements, like a constitutional assembly.
The amendments would restrict the army to territorial defense and end its control of internal security, a role that has led to scores of political killings and human rights abuses. The Presidential General Staff, the military unit found to have engaged in many abuses, would be replaced by civilians. A civilian then could serve as Defense Minister.
Other important changes were intended to increase checks on the executive branch and reform the judicial system, which has allowed much crime to go unpunished.
Despite the wide range of the proposals, public debate before the vote focused almost exclusively on the handful of amendments that recognize the rights of Guatemala's indigenous peoples.
For centuries, they have been excluded from government and relegated to alarming rates of poverty and illiteracy in a country where wealth and power have been dominated by the Ladinos, the mostly white and mestizo minority.
One amendment would define this country of 11 million as "multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual," specifically acknowledging not only the Mayan majority but also minorities like the Garifunas, descendants of Caribbean blacks, and the Xinca, a nearly extinct indigenous group.
Another would grant official status to 24 indigenous languages, a change whose effect in making education, health care and other public services available in languages other than Spanish will depend largely on bringing indigenous people into civil service jobs.
The reforms would boost a Mayan movement that has become more united and organized during the last decade, bringing together hundreds of groups despite language and other differences.
"What we're beginning is a new social contract for Guatemala," said Alvaro Pop, a founding member of the Coordinator of Guatemalan Mayan Organizations, a major indigenous group, and a negotiator of the proposed reforms. "We're building the nation we never had, a nation within our own diversity."
Some opponents criticized the proposals as an imposition by international agencies and foreign countries, including the United States, which have given and lent $2.4 billion to carry out the peace accords.
Supporters of the measures charged that many of the arguments against the changes were tinged with racism and fear by the upper classes that equal conditions imply a loss of political and economic power.

HEADLINE: Its Economy Ailing, Hawaii Hangs Some Hopes on Hollywood

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: HALEIWA, Hawaii, May 13

 BODY:
The biggest economic fish caught in Hawaii this year is not a new factory or a high-tech software start-up or a planeload of Asian tourists, whose financial troubles continue to keep them away. The biggest fish is David Hasselhoff, the hunky head lifeguard of "Baywatch," which is to begin filming here in July, rechristened "Baywatch Hawaii."
To a state struggling through the seventh year of a sluggish economy, the arrival of the "Baywatch" brand name -- the syndicated show is seen in 140 countries and broadcast in three languages in China alone -- is being heralded as a return to the heady boom years when "Hawaii Five-O" and "Magnum, P.I." symbolized Hawaii's international appeal and seemingly limitless growth. 
 The State Legislature appropriated $1.7 million to help build a lifeguard station that will serve as a set in this sleepy surfing village on Oahu's North Shore, and a tank for filming underwater shots. And Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano himself negotiated concessions from the teamsters union to cut costs. The fight to win the show, which was prepared to leave Los Angeles for Australia, was front-page news for days this winter, and local television news programs kept a nightly "Baywatch watch."
But "Baywatch" is still just a drop in the deep bucket of Hawaii's enduring economic downturn, a downturn that many local experts say portends permanent structural changes in an economy that can no longer be expected to grow in the high single digits each year, and that can no longer depend on tourism as the sole engine of growth. Indeed, statewide hotel occupancy figures ticked up just slightly for the second consecutive month in March -- after a year of monthly declines -- but only because of an increase in travelers from the mainland and Europe, and discounting at hotels in Waikiki.
Still, "it's got to help," Mike Ells said of "Baywatch" as he and his young daughter, Carly, ate "shave ice," the delectable local version of a snow cone, on the back of his truck here. Mr. Ells, 49, came to Haleiwa from California 30 years ago to surf the North Shore's legendary waves, and now owns a business building small trailers for boats and surfboards and renting electric generators for construction. In 1990, he said, he had $2 million in sales and 18 employees; last year, he had sales of $1.2 million and a dozen workers.
"My generators don't rent because there's no projects to work on," said Mr. Ells, who made sure he handed a prospectus offering his services to the executive producer of "Baywatch Hawaii," Gregory J. Bonnan, at a town meeting the other night to discuss the impact of filming. "I hope I can get some business out of it, that's for sure," Mr. Ells said with a rueful chuckle.
Even Mr. Cayetano, who narrowly won re-election to a second four-year term last fall after battling the economic downturn for his entire tenure, cannot suppress a slight chuckle when the subject of "Baywatch" comes up in an interview. But for the Governor and his colleagues in government, who hope the show might generate $20 million for the local economy and produce 200 jobs, those familiar red swimsuits and bronze skin are no laughing matter.
"Film and TV production has tripled in Hawaii since I became Governor," Mr. Cayetano said, and last year the Legislature passed a bill giving tax breaks to film and television productions that come to Hawaii and use Hawaiian products or the state's name in the show title. "Hawaii has kind of overcome its image that it's not an easy place to do business" because of high costs and union featherbedding, Mr. Cayetano said. "It's a clean industry for us."
The "Baywatch" deal was particularly attractive, Mr. Cayetano said, because the show not only agreed to add "Hawaii" to its name but offered a guarantee of two years' production. The union concessions that helped make it possible included a wage cut of 12 percent to 15 percent by the International Association of Theater Stage Employees, and a similar 7 percent cut by the teamsters.
"It's a very valuable piece of advertising for us," the Governor said of the show. "We couldn't buy that kind of advertising."
Still, local economists say the state will be lucky to post 2 percent growth this year, about a third of its growth through the 1980's, and must look to diverse "niche" industries in fields from biotechnology to marine agriculture if it is to prosper.
Jack Suyderhoud, a professor of business economics and associate dean of the college of business at the University of Hawaii, said the newer industries would "never be the kind of employment engine that the visitor industry was, or that the plantations used to be," before the big sugar and pineapple industries here were supplanted by lower-cost competition from Central America and Southeast Asia. "But there are some real prospects in diversified agriculture, by genetic and seed companies that have latched onto the multiple growing season here."
A larger conundrum, Professor Suyderhoud said, is that Hawaiians have yet to reach a consensus on what kind of growth the future should hold, and that each new proposal, whether for forestry on the Big Island, new resorts, or even film and television production, brings an accompanying debate about its impact on the environment and relaxed quality of life that drew many mainlanders here in the first place.
"I think the natural inclination is for people to want the best of both worlds, which is wealth without the negative aspects of wealth, like congestion and crime and the need to lock the door," Mr. Suyderhoud said. "We as a community have had a really difficult time deciding what we want."
In its annual session, which just ended, the State Legislature was heavily embroiled in political infighting, and the consensus view of local critics was that it left the economy largely unaddressed, though it did pass an excise tax cut intended to reduce the "pyramiding" pass-along effects of that tax on wholesalers. Because of high transportation costs for consumer goods and fewer economies of scale in an island chain whose total population is just a bit over one million, the rule of thumb is that whatever costs $1 on the mainland costs $1.25 or $1.30 here.
Mr. Bonnan, the "Baywatch" producer and creator, who retains his 30-year certification as a Los Angeles County lifeguard, said that after 200 episodes shot in Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades, Calif., it was time for a change. But he said the show could never have afforded to move here without the concessions.
"Australia had made a significant proposal, and there it costs about 62 cents on the dollar," said Mr. Bonnan, who was here this week doing research and announcing the casting of three local hard-bodies -- two men and a woman -- as part of the show's new ensemble. "This is without a doubt one of the most expensive places, but the people have made such a difference."
Some locals in Haleiwa, which is no more than a wide place in the Kamehameha Highway in Oahu that curves up to the North Shore, have worried that the filming will disrupt their own surfing and patch of paradise, especially if tour buses come rumbling up the road to show off the location to Waikiki tourists.
"I hope it doesn't happen," said Mr. Ells, who has watched the value of his house in nearby Mokuleia skyrocket from $135,000 in 1980 to $900,000 six years later and then plunge back down to $450,000 now. "But I'm willing to take the chance."

HEADLINE: Crime Fell 7 Percent in '98, Continuing a 7-Year Trend

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Crime in the United States dropped sharply last year, the seventh consecutive year it has fallen, according to preliminary figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday.
The number of violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7 percent in 1998, creating the largest annual decline since crime began to decrease in 1992. 
 The biggest decrease occurred in robbery, which fell 11 percent, followed by a 10 percent decline in motor vehicle theft and an 8 percent decline in murder, the bureau said in its annual Uniform Crime Report.
The decline in robbery, by far its largest single-year decrease in the 1990's, is particularly significant, said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, because it reflects a diminished demand for crack cocaine, which had driven violent crime rates up in the 1980's. "For people who are heavy drug users, robbery is a favorite way to get drugs," Professor Blumstein said.
In addition, he said, the drop in robbery may be attributed to the vitality of the economy. The economy has become so strong that it is reaching into the inner cities and providing jobs, even if low-paying jobs, to unskilled young people who had previously turned to selling drugs because they were shut out of the job market.
Criminologists pointed to several other factors that appear to be behind the drop in crime, though they acknowledged that it was impossible to measure them precisely. These include a huge increase in the number of people behind bars, more imaginative police strategies, tighter gun control laws and widespread community programs to work with troubled young people.
Beyond these factors, said James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University, there appears to be a kind of contagion effect. "The more crime drops, the more lawfulness becomes the norm, as opposed to lawlessness," he said.
Professor Fox said the seven-year drop in crime, the longest uninterrupted decline since the 1950's, underscored an important point: that school shootings like the recent attack in Littleton, Colo., "are a statistical aberration."
"For most of our kids, school is the safest place to be," Professor Fox said. Violence in school is far lower than violence in the home, in many children's neighborhoods or in areas around schools, he said.
For criminologists, Professor Fox said, the biggest question now is how long the decline in crime can last.
The F.B.I. report measures serious crimes including the violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft and arson. The report is based on arrest data supplied by local police forces.
The report said rape and aggravated assault had both dropped 5 percent, while burglary and arson each had fallen 7 percent. Only larceny, which includes petty theft like shoplifting and pickpocketing, showed no decrease.
The declines in crime were generally highest in the nation's largest cities, apparently a reflection of more intense police efforts. Murder, for example, fell 11 percent in cities with a population over one million, but only 6 percent in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 and not at all in cities of 10,000 to 25,000. Only the suburbs had an increase, of 2 percent, in homicides.
Homicides in New York fell to 633 in 1998, from 770 in 1997, the report said, with New York dropping to second place in reported homicides for the first time in memory. Chicago surpassed New York with 694 homicides.

China Stews;A U.S. Trade Deal Falters

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 17

 BODY:
While China officially remains committed to joining the World Trade Organization, Chinese economists say that apparent divisions in the nation's leadership are likely to further stiffen Beijing's negotiating position and make agreement difficult to achieve in coming months.
With China experiencing a wave of nationalist politics after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, orthodox politicians, skeptical about the benefits of forcing open Chinese markets, as membership in the global trade group would require, seem to be gaining influence. 
 Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is widely considered China's strongest proponent of entry into the trade group, which sets the rules of global commerce. But Mr. Zhu has become vulnerable to accusations that he was giving too much away in the broad concessions he offered to American negotiators during his visit to the United States last month.
Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said today that China had not changed its basic negotiating position. But he also re-emphasized that Beijing would join the trade organization on its own terms. "China will never enter the W.T.O. at the expense of its own basic interests," Mr. Shi said at a meeting with visiting Australian officials in Beijing.
An assistant United States trade representative, Robert Cassidy, had been scheduled to return to Beijing this week to resume talks, but his visit has been indefinitely delayed.
A Beijing economist with ties to the Government said the mood surrounding the trade talks had darkened and many economic changes were likely to be delayed while the leadership was preoccupied with a campaign to promote nationalism. "No one dares do or say anything until they see a direction from the center," the economist said. "It limits everyone's ability to work."
After President Clinton turned down a deal on Chinese membership in the trade group during Mr. Zhu's visit, Chinese and American negotiators looked to early June as a deadline to reach an agreement, when China's most-favored-nation trading status expires.
Reaching a deal by then would enable the Clinton Administration to advocate a single vote in Congress to give China permanent favorable trading status, as required under trade organization rules.
Without a deal, Congress would have to vote once to renew Beijing's most-favored-nation status, and then vote again on giving China that status permanently. With so many anti-China voices in Congress, made louder by recent accusations of nuclear spying, the Administration wants to avoid giving Congress two chances to oppose an agreement.
Yet reaching a deal before June now looks increasingly unlikely. Former Prime Minister Li Peng, now the chairman of the Chinese legislature, has been leading the ranks of old-line leaders in attacking the United States for aggression in Yugoslavia, charges that have no direct connection to the trade talks but that inevitably affect the flexibility of Chinese negotiators.
Over the weekend, Mr. Li argued that the bombing had enabled the Chinese people to see "the hypocrisy of the democracy and human rights advocated by the United States."
He denounced the Western view that student demonstrations in Beijing and other cities had been orchestrated by the leadership to gain better leverage in the trade negotiations.
United States officials have said that the final areas of disagreement with Beijing are over financial services. The Americans have sought full rights for foreign banks operating in China to do business in local and foreign currencies and to serve both Chinese and foreign customers.
Too many operating restrictions on American banks, insurers and other financial companies are discouraging them from doing business in China, American negotiators have said. In response, Chinese officials maintain that changing the rules to make them even for Chinese and foreign banks could be disastrous for China.

Seeing China In 3-D

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
So I'm listening to the radio last week reporting on the stoning of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, in retaliation for NATO's bombing of China's Belgrade embassy. But I can't help chuckling at the last line of the news report. It quotes China's Minister of Tourism as saying that despite the rock-throwing, China is perfectly safe and American and other tourists shouldn't think of staying away. Translation: We burn U.S. flags, not U.S. dollars.
The anti-China crowd wants us to believe that the embassy stoning was organized entirely by the Beijing Government and shows the real, true, unchanging character of China. I beg to differ. What it shows us is the real, true, constantly evolving, multi-dimensional character of China, where government control is not what it used to be. 
 It is time we mothballed the perception, frozen since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, that China is just a big prison where everyone is making replicas of the Statue of Liberty in the basement. Wake up! What has happened since Tiananmen is that the Communist leadership in China -- for its own survival -- has struck a New Deal with the Chinese people. That deal says you can live, work and travel as you like, make as much money as you want and say whatever you want at home. Just don't do one thing: Challenge Communist Party rule.
As a result, since Tiananmen China has witnessed a flowering of pop culture, alternative life styles, tabloids and call-in radio shows, neatly detailed by Jianying Zha in the book "China Pop." At the same time, China's impressive economic development has fostered a lot of authentic national pride. And at the same time the Chinese regime has stoked this nationalism to deflect attention from its own corruption, and to reinforce its legitimacy at a time when Communist ideology is dead and the regime can't afford to bring down the iron fist on its people as easily as in the past.
This cocktail of Chinese self-confidence and nationalism emerges at a time when America is no longer China's ally against the Soviet Union but now the world's dominant power, telling China what it can and cannot do. As such, America today inspires as much envy and resentment in Chinese youths as admiration. The NATO bombing played right into that.
"When I grew up, America stood for democracy and human rights," remarked a Chinese friend who graduated from Beijing University in 1982. "But now America is seen as a high-tech economic power, with certain imperialistic tendencies. And when America refused to let China hold the Olympics, that made big headlines. People are now sobering up from their romantic view of the West." So Chinese students throw rocks at the U.S. Embassy while preparing to take the national English exams to get into a U.S. university.
The same multi-dimensional view needs to be brought to bear when analyzing Chinese politics, as Larry Diamond, the democracy specialist at the Hoover Institution, explains in his important new book "Developing Democracy."
"Democracy doesn't happen at one instant," observes Mr. Diamond. "More often, you get a softening of authoritarian rule, incremental changes in the political and civic landscape, and liberalization, prior to democratization. If we want China to fully democratize one day, we have to encourage the incremental process now under way there -- the opening up of information flows, the introduction of electoral choices, even at levels that may seem meaningless now, and the limited judicial due process beginning to take shape in the administrative arena. These changes will go on at the same time as brutal repression in Tibet and China's stealing of nuclear secrets from the U.S."
That is why U.S. policy has to remain focused on curbing one trend while constantly nurturing the other. It's not either-or, but always both. "Because the more China liberalizes and integrates into the world," says Mr. Diamond, "the more you raise the costs for bad behavior." Indeed, you could almost see China's leaders weighing how far to milk the embassy stoning -- before it threatened trade, tourism, investment and other relations. Four days was their limit.
They certainly have a subtle, multi-dimensional view of their own situation. If we don't adopt an equally subtle, multi-dimensional view we will help turn China into a one-dimensional place. And nothing -- nothing -- would destabilize the whole world more.

Notes Are Lower on Concerns About Fed's Position on Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury note prices fell yesterday, pushing 10-year yields to their highest level in a year, on concern that Federal Reserve policy makers will signal they are leaning toward a rate increase after they meet today.
"People are worried about the Fed," and that's hurting notes, among the most sensitive to expectations about Fed policy, said Patrick Retzer of Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee. "They may announce a bias change" toward raising rates from the current neutral stance, he said. 
 Yields on 10-year notes rose 1 basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.63 percent. The two-year note yield was unchanged at 5.27 percent. The 30-year bond price rose 13/32, to 91, pushing its yield down to 5.89 percent from 5.92 percent on Friday.
In the last month, bond prices have slumped and yields have climbed almost half a percentage point as reports pointing to resilience in the economy and a 56 percent rise in crude oil prices since mid-February increased concern that inflation would quicken. The 30-year bond has lost 9.1 percent this year when price declines and interest are taken into account.
At 5.63 percent, yields on 10-year notes -- a benchmark for pricing mortgages and corporate debt -- are about half a percentage point higher than they were a month ago.
Fueling fears of an eventual rate rise was Friday's report that consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months ended in April, the first time since October 1997 that prices rose more than 2 percent year over year. That puts 30-year yields at 3.36 percent after inflation, down from about 4 percent earlier in the year and about three-quarters of a point lower than the average the last five years.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.845	97.659	High Rate	4.57%	4.63%	Coupon Yield	4.47%	4.82%	Low Rate	4.45%	4.50%	Median Rate	4.55%	4.59%	Total applied for	$27,337,112	$27,516,620	Accepted	$11,592,612	$11,902,370	Noncompetitive	$1,347,662	$1,086,526	

Both issues are dated May 20, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 19, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 18, 1999.

3 On-Line Book Retailers Cut Prices on Best Sellers

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the on-line retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent yesterday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain sales.
Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No. 2 rival, Barnes & Noble Inc., which has plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks. But a company spokesman for Amazon.com in Seattle said the timing of its discounts on books from the New York Times best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence. 
 "There are three things that drive this business," said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon. "It's selection, price and convenience. And we are constantly working on all three of these things. We've added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers. And this is an opportunity to do something with price."
With a flurry of announcements yesterday, the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on the Times best-seller lists. That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week.
Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
"We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace," said Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble, who added that Amazon has "changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for itself." (Barnes & Noble has a business tie to The New York Times, selling books through links from the newspaper's Web site.)
Borders.com, a unit of Borders Group Inc., also announced a price cut. "I have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to win on in the long run," said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com. "But we're not going to let this distinguish us from the competition."
None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts. And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
Kate Delhagen, director of on-line retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm, said the outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new competitive pressures.
There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers to compare prices through Web site services. like Add All, that instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers. For example, that site compared the prices for more than 24 bookstores yesterday and prominently listed Amazon for offering the lowest price for the best-selling children's novel, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." The list price is $16.95, but with the discount and a shipping charge, Amazon was selling the title for $12.43.
"People are using these comparison tools," Ms. Delhagen said. "And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there. It's definitely a defensive strategy being deployed, but it's also part of their increasing energy to add customers to their data base."
Mr. Curry, Amazon's spokesman, declined to say whether the company would lose money on the 50 percent discounts. "We're just not talking about whether we're selling at a profit or a loss," he said. Mr. Curry said, however, that Amazon had decreased its reliance on book distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers. Those efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now passing along to its customers, he said.
He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the activities of competitors. "We don't fancy ourselves with the competition," he said. "We're focused on our customers as opposed to what the competition is doing."

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard's Profits Exceed Expectations Again

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 17

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company reported second-quarter earnings today that beat Wall Street estimates for the third consecutive quarter, although revenue growth remained sluggish. But orders grew by 10 percent, and executives said they expected double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year.
In the quarter ended April 30, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $918 million, or 88 cents a diluted share, up 34 percent compared with $685 million, or 65 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Per-share figures reflect a reduction in shares outstanding from 1.08 billion to 1.05 billion shares. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $12.4 billion from $12 billion. 
 Analysts expected Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., to earn 80 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.
Hewlett-Packard executives said the improved results reflected both better execution of the company's strategy as well as the first signs of economic recovery in Asia. The company's sales in Asia improved across all product lines.
"This is the third consecutive quarter that we've exceeded street expectations," said Lewis E. Platt, the chairman and chief executive. "We executed well and turned in an excellent bottom line, and we're encouraged by improved order growth of 10 percent. Clearly, our challenge is to convert order growth into stronger growth in revenue."
Hewlett-Packard's order rate reflected a strong turnaround from the first quarter, when total orders were down 1 percent compared with figures in the quarter a year earlier.
"It's probably the best one of these reports we've seen in some time," said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. "They're talking about strong order growth in enterprise systems; they held their own in PC's, and printers were good."
Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the market. But in anticipation of a strong quarter, the company's shares rose $4.5625, to $88.75, a new 52-week high. Analysts said the consistent earnings showed the company's ability to cut costs and operate efficiently and that the improvement in orders indicated renewed growth going forward.
Hewlett-Packard shares have been rising since March, when the company announced that it would split into two companies, one to focus on computers, printers and scanners, the other on electronic test equipment and medical technology products.
Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said that the realignment of Hewlett-Packard into two companies was insignificant for earnings in the second quarter. He added, however, that he did expect the costs associated with the creation of two companies to increase noticeably in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Court's Welfare Ruling and Rehnquist's Dissent

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today barring states from paying lower welfare benefits to newcomers than to longtime residents. The vote in Saenz v. Roe was 7 to 2. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority decision, and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the dissent. 

FROM THE DECISION
By Justice Stevens
In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. The scheme limits the amount payable to a family that has resided in the State for less than 12 months to the amount payable by the State of the family's prior residence.
The questions presented by this case are whether the 1992 statute was constitutional when it was enacted and, if not, whether an amendment to the Social Security Act enacted by Congress in 1996 affects that determination.
California is not only one of the largest, most populated, and most beautiful States in the nation; it is also one of the most generous. . . . In one year . . . Aid to Families with Dependent Children (A.F.D.C.), which was replaced in 1996 with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (T.A.N.F.), provided benefits for an average of 2,645,814 persons per month at an annual cost to the State of $2.9 billion. In California the cash benefit for a family of two -- a mother and one child -- is $456 a month, but in the neighboring state of Arizona, for example, it is only $275.
In 1992, in order to make a relatively modest reduction in its vast welfare budget, the California Legislature enacted 11450.03 of the state Welfare and Institutions Code. That section sought to change the California A.F.D.C. program by limiting new residents, for the first year they live in California, to the benefits they would have received in the state of their prior residence. . . .
On December 21, 1992, three California residents who were eligible for A.F.D.C. benefits filed an action in the Eastern District of California challenging the constitutionality of the durational residency requirement. . . .
Each plaintiff alleged that she had recently moved to California to live with relatives in order to escape abusive family circumstances. . . . Each alleged that her monthly A.F.D.C. grant for the ensuing 12 months would be substantially lower under 11450.03 than if the statute were not in effect. . . .
District Judge Levi found that the statute "produces substantial disparities in benefit levels and makes no accommodation for the different costs of living that exist in different states." Relying primarily on our decisions in Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), and Zobel v. Williams (1982), he concluded that the statute placed "a penalty on the decision of new residents to migrate to the State and be treated on an equal basis with existing residents." Green v. Anderson (1993). In his view, . . . even if the purpose was only to conserve limited funds, the state had failed to explain why the entire burden of the saving should be imposed on new residents. The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed for the reasons stated by the district judge.
We granted the state's petition for certiorari. We were, however, unable to reach the merits because the secretary's approval of 11450.03 had been invalidated in a separate proceeding. . . . We vacated the judgment and directed that the case be dismissed. Accordingly, 11450.03 remained inoperative until after Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. . . .
The new statute expressly authorizes any state that receives a block grant under T.A.N.F. to "apply to a family the rules (including benefit amounts) of the program of another state if the family has moved to the state from the other state and has resided in the state for less than 12 months." . . . The California Department of Social Services therefore issued an "All County Letter" announcing that the enforcement of 11450.03 would commence on April 1, 1997.
On April 1, 1997, the two respondents filed this action in the Eastern District of California making essentially the same claims asserted by the plaintiffs in Anderson v. Green, but also challenging the constitutionality of P.R.W.O.R.A.'s approval of the durational residency requirement. . . . Judge Levi concluded that the existence of the Federal statute did not affect the legal analysis in his prior opinion in Green.
The state did not disagree with plaintiffs' contention that 11450.03 would create significant disparities between newcomers and welfare recipients who have resided in the state for over one year.
The state relied squarely on the undisputed fact that the statute would save some $10.9 million in annual welfare costs. . . . It contended that this cost saving was an appropriate exercise of budgetary authority as long as the residency requirement did not penalize the right to travel. . . . Judge Levi concluded, however, that the relevant comparison was not between new residents of California and the residents of their former states, but rather between the new residents and longer-term residents of California. He therefore again enjoined the implementation of the statute.
Without finally deciding the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed his issuance of a preliminary injunction. We now affirm.
The word "travel" is not found in the text of the Constitution. Yet the "constitutional right to travel from one State to another" is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Indeed, as Justice Stewart reminded us in Shapiro v. Thompson, (1969), the right is so important that it is "assertable against private interference as well as governmental action a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all."
In Shapiro, we reviewed the constitutionality of three statutory provisions that denied welfare assistance to residents of Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania, who had resided within those respective jurisdictions less than one year . . . We squarely held that it was "constitutionally impermissible" for a state to enact durational residency requirements for the purpose of inhibiting the migration by needy persons into the State.
In this case California argues that 11450.03 was not enacted for the impermissible purpose of inhibiting migration by needy persons and that, unlike the legislation reviewed in Shapiro, it does not penalize the right to travel because new arrivals are not ineligible for benefits during their first year. . . .
The "right to travel" discussed in our cases embraces at least three different components. It protects the right of a citizen of one state to enter and to leave another state, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state, and, for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that state.
What is at issue in this case, then, is this third aspect of the right to travel, the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State. That right is protected not only by the new arrival's status as a state citizen, but also by her status as a citizen of the United States. That additional source of protection is plainly identified in the opening words of the 14th Amendment: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."
Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Slaughter-House Cases, (1873), it has always been common ground that this clause protects the third component of the right to travel. Writing for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges conferred by this clause "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any state of the union by a bon fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that state." . . .
Because this case involves discrimination against citizens who have completed their interstate travel, the state's argument that its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only "incidentally" is beside the point. . . . Since the right to travel embraces the citizen's right to be treated equally in her new state of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a penalty. . . .
Disavowing any desire to fence out the indigent, California has instead advanced an entirely fiscal justification for its multitiered scheme. The enforcement of 11450.03 will save the state approximately $10.9 million a year. The question is . . . whether the state may accomplish that end by the discriminatory means it has chosen. An evenhanded, across-the-board reduction of about 72 cents per month for every beneficiary would produce the same result. But our negative answer to the question . . . rests on the fact that the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment expressly equates citizenship with residence: "That clause does not provide for, and does not allow for, degrees of citizenship based on length of residence." It is equally clear that the clause does not tolerate a hierarchy of 45 subclasses of similarly situated citizens based on the location of their prior residence.
Thus 11450.03 is doubly vulnerable: Neither the duration of respondents' California residence, nor the identity of their prior States of residence, has any relevance to their need for benefits. Nor do those factors bear any relationship to the state's interest in making an equitable allocation of the funds to be distributed among its needy citizens. As in Shapiro, we reject any contributory rationale for the denial of benefits to new residents: . . . "Appellants' reasoning would logically permit the state to bar new residents from schools, parks, and libraries or deprive them of police and fire protection.". . .
The state's legitimate interest in saving money provides no justification for its decision to discriminate among equally eligible citizens.
The question that remains is whether Congressional approval of durational residency requirements in the 1996 amendment to the Social Security Act somehow resuscitates the constitutionality of 11450.03. That question is readily answered, for we have consistently held that Congress may not authorize the states to violate the 14th Amendment. . . .
Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the right to choose to be citizens "of the state wherein they reside." The states, however, do not have any right to select their citizens. The 14th Amendment, like the Constitution itself, was, as Justice Cardozo put it, "framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division." Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig Inc., (1935).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
 The Court today breathes new life into the previously dormant Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, a clause relied upon by this Court in only one other decision, Colgate v. Harvey, (1935), overruled five years later by Madden v. Kentucky, (1940). It uses this clause to strike down . . . a reasonable measure falling under the head of a "good-faith residency requirement." Because I do not think any provision of the Constitution and surely not a provision relied upon for only the second time since its enactment 130 years ago requires this result, I dissent.
I cannot see how the right to become a citizen of another state is a necessary "component" of the right to travel, or why the Court tries to marry these separate and distinct rights. A person is no longer "traveling" in any sense of the word when he finishes his journey to a state which he plans to make his home. Indeed, under the Court's logic, the protections of the Privileges or Immunities Clause recognized in this case come into play only when an individual stops traveling with the intent to remain and become a citizen of a new State. . . . Indeed, the same dicta from the Slaughter-House Cases quoted by the Court actually treats the right to become a citizen and the right to travel as separate and distinct rights under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment. At most, restrictions on an individual's right to become a citizen indirectly affect his calculus in deciding whether to exercise his right to travel in the first place, but such an attenuated and uncertain relationship is no ground for folding one right into the other.
No doubt the Court has, in the past 30 years, essentially conflated the right to travel with the right to equal state citizenship in striking down durational residence requirements similar to the one challenged here. See, Shapiro; Dunn v. Blumstein, (1972). . . .
The Court in these cases held that restricting the provision of welfare benefits, votes, or certain medical benefits to new citizens for a limited time impermissibly "penalized" them under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment for having exercised their right to travel. The Court thus settled for deciding what restrictions amounted to "deprivations of very important benefits and rights" that operated to indirectly "penalize the right to travel. . . . In other cases, the Court recognized that laws dividing new and old residents had little to do with the right to travel and merely triggered an inquiry into whether the resulting classification rationally furthered a legitimate government purpose. . . . Under its new analytical framework, a state, outside certain ill-defined circumstances, cannot classify its citizens by the length of their residence in the State without offending the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Court thus departs from Shapiro and its progeny, and . . . does little to explain how the right to travel is involved at all. Instead, as the Court's analysis clearly demonstrates, this case is only about respondents' right to immediately enjoy all the privileges of being a California citizen in relation to that State's ability to test the good-faith assertion of this right. The Court has thus come full circle by effectively disavowing the analysis of Shapiro. . . .
In unearthing from its tomb the right to become a state citizen and to be treated equally in the new state of residence, however, the Court ignores a state's need to assure that only persons who establish a bona fide residence receive the benefits provided to current residents of the state. The Slaughter-House dicta at the core of the Court's analysis specifically conditions a United States citizen's right to "become a citizen of any state of the Union" and to enjoy the "same rights as other citizens of that State" on the establishment of a "bona fide residence therein." Even when redefining the right to travel in Shapiro and its progeny, the Court has "always carefully distinguished between bona fide residence requirements, which seek to differentiate between residents and nonresidents, and residence requirements, such as durational, fixed date, and fixed point residence requirements, which treat established residents differently based on the time they migrated into the state."
If states can require individuals to reside in-state for a year before exercising the right to educational benefits, the right to terminate a marriage, or the right to vote in primary elections that all other state citizens enjoy, then states may surely do the same for welfare benefits. . . .
There is no link between the need for an education or for a divorce and the length of residence, and yet states may use length of residence as an objective yardstick to channel their benefits to those whose intent to stay is legitimate. . . .
The Court tries to distinguish education and divorce benefits by contending that the welfare payment here will be consumed in California, while a college education or a divorce produces benefits that are "portable" and can be enjoyed after individuals return to their original domicile. But this "you can't take it with you" distinction is more apparent than real, and offers little guidance to lower courts who must apply this rationale in the future. . . .
More importantly, this foray into social economics demonstrates that the line drawn by the Court borders on the metaphysical, and requires lower courts to plumb the policies animating certain benefits like welfare to define their "essence" and hence their "portability." As this Court wisely recognized almost 30 years ago, "the intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems presented by public welfare assistance programs are not the business of this Court." Dandridge.
I therefore believe that the durational residence requirement challenged here is a permissible exercise of the State's power to "assur e that services provided for its residents are enjoyed only by residents."

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: REFUGEES;
U.S. to Pay Albanians For Housing Of Kosovars

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
With the refugee population in Albania expected to exceed 900,000 this summer, the United States announced today that it would pay thousands of Albanian families to take new Kosovo refugees into their homes until a peace settlement is reached.
The Pentagon also said it had selected a site to build a second refugee camp in Albania, for another 20,000 refugees. In southern Albania the United States has already opened Camp Hope, which will eventually house 40,000. In addition the United States has offered asylum to 20,000 refugees, who have begun arriving here. 
 The three programs -- offering stipends for Albanian host families, building camps in Albania and relocating refugees outside the Balkans -- are all part of United Nations and NATO programs in Albania and Macedonia that have grown during the last month to accommodate Kosovars fleeing or being expelled by Serbian troops.
"We're at the point where we can say we can handle the refugees," said Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for International Development.
Other NATO countries, led by Germany, Italy and Britain, have built camps in Macedonia and Albania to house more than 100,000 refugees.
Pentagon officials say they now believe that Serbian forces have killed more than 5,000 Kosovo Albanians as part of the campaign of President Slobodan Milosevic to expell Albanians from the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The officials said the final death toll might be much higher.
"We fear that a significant percentage of the 100,000 draft-age men who have been reported missing will never again appear and may be dead," said Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
Both NATO and the Pentagon cited fresh reports that Serbian troops are using Kosovo Albanians as human shields around military targets to prevent NATO from hitting them. Mr. Bacon said there were also new reports that the Albanians killed last week in the NATO bombing of a Serbian military compound in southern Kosovo had been rounded up and placed there as human shields.
However, those reports came from refugees and are not conclusive evidence that Mr. Milosevic's forces purposely installed the displaced Albanians around the military posts. With the mounting civilian casualties from NATO air attacks, both European and American officials have sought to deflect criticism of the air campaign.
NATO has already admitted that civilians have been killed or wounded by bombs falling short of their targets -- for instance the attack on Nis that hit a hospital rather than an airfield. There have also been mistaken NATO targets -- like the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. But with the suggestions that Mr. Milosevic is using Albanians as shields, both NATO and the Pentagon are laying some of the blame for civilian deaths at his feet.
"It may be that as many as half or certainly a third of the people who may have been killed in NATO attacks were put there specifically by Milosevic as human shields," Mr. Bacon said.
NATO officials said today that they were tracking three large bands of displaced Albanians, with 40,000 to 70,000 in each group, trying to flee Kosovo but being held back by Serbian troops. It is from those bands of homeless that Serbs have rounded up the civilians used as shields at military compounds and other obvious NATO targets, the officials contend.
Despite the growing danger for the homeless Albanians, NATO and the United States continue to rule out the idea of sending cargo planes over Kosovo to drop food. They fear that the planes will be hit by Serbian antiaircraft fire. Mr. Atwood said today that the United States was continuing to work with private voluntary groups to figure out an airlift plan, but that the groups had yet to ask Mr. Milosevic's permission to drop the food.
A United Nations team arrived in Belgrade today to assess the needs of Serbian as well as Kosovar civilians. To date, only the International Committee of the Red Cross and a Greek, Russian and Swiss consortium have won permission from both Mr. Milosevic and NATO to truck supplies to Kosovo.
