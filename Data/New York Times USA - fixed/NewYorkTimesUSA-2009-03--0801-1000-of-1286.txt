HEADLINE: As Dollar Shrinks, Oil Rises Above $50

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision to fire up the printing presses and buy $1 trillion in debt continued to wash over world financial markets on Thursday, dragging down the value of the dollar and pushing the prices of oil and gold higher. 
 But on Wall Street, stocks slid into negative terrain, a day after they bounced higher in response to the Fed's surprise announcement that it would purchase $750 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $300 billion in Treasury debt. 
 Financial shares, which had pulled Wall Street higher on Wednesday, tugged markets in the opposite direction. Shares of Citigroup fell 15.6 percent, to $2.60, as the banking giant announced a reverse stock split. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were all lower.
 As commodity prices rebounded, shares of companies that produce basic goods like plastics, chemicals and metals moved higher, softening Wall Street's losses. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average opened higher but quickly sagged and closed down 85.78 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,400.8, its deepest decline in a week. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.31 points, or 1.3 percent, to 784.04. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index was off 0.5 percent.
 Many analysts hailed the Fed's latest plan as a bold but risky gambit to stimulate the economy and lower mortgage rates.
 ''What you've done is you've created affordability,'' said Scott Simon, head of mortgage-backed securities at the Pacific Investment Management Company. ''This will make housing bottom sooner.''
 Mortgage rates across the country dropped to 4.98 percent for the week ending Wednesday, from 5.03 percent the week earlier, according to data released Thursday by the government-controlled housing giant Freddie Mac.
 Unable to cut its target rate any more to try to jump-start the economy, the Fed is now ratcheting up other efforts, like buying securities and essentially printing money, to try to loosen credit markets. But economists said such efforts could lead to long-term inflation, and could drive down the value of the dollar. 
 ''They clearly bit the bullet,'' said James Knightley, senior economist at ING Financial Markets in London. ''There's no guarantee that this will actually work. While they are expanding the money supply, it's only going to generate economic activity if people actually borrow. You need the demand on the other side to actually get the credit growth.'' 
 As the euro, the yen and other major currencies continued to gain ground against the dollar on Thursday, the price of oil -- which is traded in dollars -- rose $3.47 to settle at $51.61 a barrel in New York, its highest point since late November. While crude oil is still cheaper than its summertime peaks of more than $145 a barrel, prices have rebounded from their lows of $33 a barrel. 
 The rise in oil prices gave a boost to some energy companies, including Chevron and Marathon Oil. 
 The price of government bonds, which rose sharply following the Fed's announcement, fell back slightly.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 19/32, to 101 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.6 percent, from 2.53 percent late Wednesday.

 BODY:
The go-go years on Wall Street and in the City of London are over -- and won't return for a long time. Even when the global economy rebounds, a tighter international regulatory noose being created for the world's banks in a blueprint for the G-20 summit meeting next month will stop finance from reaching the heights it enjoyed during the boom. This will be good for most people -- except financiers. 
 Finance officials from 20 nations appear to have achieved a preliminary consensus on a 24-point program intended to identify the growth of market bubbles and to ensure that the world's banks operate more prudently. The plan could be a significant achievement in international collaboration. 
 The consensus covers the United States, Britain, Continental Europe and the big emerging markets like China, India and Russia. Similar proposals have already appeared in a widely cited European Union report calling for coordinated oversight of European institutions, as well as a similar review conducted by Adair Turner, Britain's top financial regulator. 
 A global crisis has produced a global response. 
 The G-20 blueprint is still largely a statement of principles, and will need a final blessing when the leaders meet in April. Detailed numbers and regulatory mechanisms will then need to be worked through in the coming months. The plan doesn't yet include a consensus on how intensively to regulate hedge funds. 
 That said, the overall plan looks pretty robust. 
 First, the authorities are determined to pay proper attention to credit and asset bubbles. Second, they have assembled new tools to prick the bubbles before they get too big. Third, they want banks to have fatter capital and liquidity cushions so there's less chance of them going bust or needing bailouts when they do fall on hard times. Fourth, they want banks to manage risk much better and will force them to change the way they pay their staff in order to reduce the incentive to behave like high rollers in a casino. Finally, they want more intrusive regulation. 
 The G-20 working group, headed by Rakesh Mohan, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Tiff Macklem, a Canadian deputy finance minister, based its work on the weaknesses it saw as drivers of the current crisis, including the lack of oversight of systemic risks and of unregulated pools of capital; weak performance by credit-rating agencies; the pro-cyclical tendencies fed by regulatory and accounting frameworks; shortcomings in disclosure and resolution procedures; and the lack of transparency of various over-the-counter markets.
 On compensation, the working group recommended that G-20 leaders agree on measures to encourage financial institutions ''to ensure that their compensation frameworks are consistent with their long-term goals.'' Prudential supervisors would be asked to monitor pay while assessing risk management practices.
 The report also calls on the International Accounting Standards Board to facilitate the global convergence toward ''a single set of high-quality accounting standards.''
 But in other areas, the proposed changes fall short of a total revolution. There is, for example, no call to bring back some version of the Glass-Steagall Act, which forcibly separated commercial and investment banks in the United States during the Great Depression. 
 Still, these measures will nonetheless cause major changes in the world of finance. The requirement to hold more capital, for example, means banks will be less profitable. And it won't be so easy to play the game of borrowing cheap short-term money and stuffing it into illiquid long-term assets. Measures to crack down on excessive risk-taking will also cut profits -- at least in good times. 
 With lower profitability, finance will no longer be the money pot which sucks in talent from all across the world. Add that to restrictions meant to align compensation with long-term achievement and working on Wall Street and in the City of London will no longer be such an easy way to get rich quick. Smart graduates will be more tempted to go into industry or other professions. That will be healthy. 
 All in all, the new regulatory compact is likely to make the postcrisis world a safer but duller place. After the roller coaster of the last few years, that is no bad thing.

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Detain U.S. Reporters

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Two American journalists on a reporting trip to the border between China and North Korea have been detained by the North Korean military, a human rights activist and another source said Thursday.
 Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, and Euna Lee, a Korean-American, were believed to have been detained by North Korean border guards on Tuesday morning. Their Chinese guide, an ethnic Korean, was also detained. A third journalist, Mitch Koss, was believed to have remained in China.
 Aaron Tarver, a spokesman at the United States Embassy in Seoul, could not immediately confirm the report. 
 The journalists went to China last week to report on North Korean refugees in northeastern China, according to Chun Ki-won, a Christian clergyman in Seoul who helped arrange their trip, and Lee Hark-joon, a reporter with the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's leading daily newspaper, who met them last week in Seoul. 
 North Korea condemns the presence of foreign journalists in the border area reporting on the plight of North Koreans who have recently fled hunger and political repression at home and accuses them of acting as American spies. 
 The journalists' reported detention comes at a tense moment in American relations with North Korea. The North has announced that it will launch a communications satellite early next month and has ordered American aid groups to leave the country. 
 On Thursday, Japan threatened to tighten sanctions on the North if it proceeded with the rocket launch, which Washington and Tokyo see as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. 
 ''We will make a comprehensive decision, including the possibility of imposing tougher sanctions,'' Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan told a parliamentary committee. 
 Mr. Chun, who heads Durihana, a South Korean missionary group that assists North Korean refugees in China, said he learned of the journalists' detention from American officials. 
 Mr. Lee said journalists from the cable channel Current TV consulted with him about reporting on North Korean refugees before heading to China. Current TV is an independent media company that was founded by former Vice President Al Gore and a businessman, Joel Hyatt. 
 Mr. Chun said he last talked with the journalists at 6 a.m. Tuesday, when their Chinese guide told him that they were moving from Yanji, a Chinese town near the northeastern end of the China-North Korean border, to Dandong, near the opposite end of the border. 
 The journalists entered China on March 13 via Seoul, and during their reporting had interviewed North Korean refugees living in hiding, including orphans and women who worked for pornographic Internet chat sites in the hopes of earning enough money to travel to South Korea or the United States, Mr. Chun said.
 It was not clear where along the 300-mile border and under what circumstances they were detained. 
 ''They told me that they completed what they went to China for, and that they completed their assignment,'' Mr. Chun said. ''I warned them against getting too close to the border. I suspect that they got too ambitious.'' 
 Since the mid-1990s, famine has driven thousands of North Koreans to sneak across the Tumen and Yalu Rivers, which form the border. 
 Arrests of Americans in the area are rare. In 1999, the State Department said an American citizen visiting a North Korean economic zone near the Chinese border had been arrested. The citizen, Karen Han, 58, a Korean-American businesswoman based in Beijing, was deported after being held for a month on unspecified charges. 
 In a more widely reported case, in 1996 Bill Richardson, then a United States congressman from New Mexico, negotiated the release of the American citizen Evan C. Hunziker, who swam across the Yalu River, while drunk, on what he called a mission to spread the Gospel in the North. Mr. Hunziker was detained for three months on espionage charges. 
 Holding Japanese and South Korean citizens has long soured Pyongyang's relations with its neighbors. 
 On Thursday, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone of Japan said that his country faced ''the most serious threat'' from North Korea's planned rocket launch and that it would rally the international community to impose additional sanctions against the North.
 North Korea has informed international agencies that it will launch its rocket between April 4 and 8 along a trajectory that crosses Japan.
 If the rocket launching is successful, it will give the newly elected parliament a chance to celebrate Kim Jong-il's re-election to another five-year term as the country's leader. North Korea said Friday it will convene its parliament, known as the Supreme People's Assembly, on April 9. 
 After North Korea detonated its first nuclear device in 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution banning it from nuclear tests and all ballistic missile activities. Japan joined global sanctions banning arms and luxury goods trade with North Korea. 
 But international sanctions have little impact on the North Korean regime, which has survived decades of isolation as famine has killed thousands of its people. 
 The North showed its imperviousness to outside influence this week when it informed the United States it no longer wanted to receive food aid and told five American aid groups to leave by the end of the month. 
 No international sanctions work effectively without cooperation from China, the North's main ally and biggest trade partner, but Beijing remains wary of American moves to increase economic pressure on North Korea and favors a policy of engagement. 
 On Thursday, China's official People's Daily newspaper said that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao told his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-il, during a meeting on Wednesday in Beijing that China wanted to ''actively push forward'' deadlocked nuclear disarmament talks involving the two Koreas, China, the United States, Russia and Japan.

HEADLINE: Public Hospital System Plans Cuts to Jobs and Services

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
New York City's public hospital system announced Thursday that it was cutting 400 jobs and closing some children's mental-health programs, pharmacies and community clinics that serve more than 11,000 patients.
 Alan D. Aviles, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, blamed reductions in state Medicaid reimbursement, a sharp increase in uninsured patients and the rising cost of labor, drugs and medical supplies for the cuts.
 He warned that he would probably announce further job and service cuts in a month or two. The hospitals face a looming $316 million budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year, which begins in July, and the current plan would save $105 million. 
 ''This is only the first round; we're only dealing with one-third of the problem,'' he said. ''We do anticipate that there will be additional cost-containment measures.''
 Speaking at a subdued news conference in the hospital system's Manhattan headquarters near City Hall, Mr. Aviles said that the cuts would come at the expense of some of the city's most vulnerable patients, the poor and uninsured, who he predicted would have a harder time finding the medical care they need. He said the system had been stressed by more uninsured patients, who numbered 450,000 at the end of last year, an 8 percent rise from the previous year. The rise in the number of people without insurance is accelerating in the city and nationally as unemployment rises, he said, adding that the corporation's cost of treating the uninsured was $850 million last year.
 Speaking for the governor on Thursday, Richard F. Daines, the state health commissioner, said that the use of federal stimulus money was still being negotiated, and that the governor was pursuing initiatives like higher reimbursement rates for the care of uninsured patients and increased payments for clinic care that could benefit public hospitals.
 At the same time, in an e-mailed statement, Dr. Daines said that some cuts were necessary at a time of ''unprecedented fiscal crisis,'' but he said the corporation might be better off delaying major expansion projects and urged the public hospitals corporation to consider holding off on service cuts until the state budget had been adopted.
 The move was, perhaps, not surprising in the current recessionary climate, which has produced widespread layoffs and has left the city hospital system struggling to cover its large pension rolls.
 While the number of the jobs being eliminated is far smaller than the thousands of job cuts made at the hospitals in the 1990s, Mr. Aviles said there was less fat in the system now. He regretted having to retrench even as the public hospital system has been nationally recognized for the quality of its care, just over a decade after being so reviled that it was threatened with privatization. 
 Mr. Aviles called on Gov. David A. Paterson to direct to the public hospital system some of the nearly $10 billion that the state has received in federal stimulus money for Medicaid and health care. Public and private hospital officials have urged the governor to use the Medicaid money to offset state cuts to health care, but the governor has said he might use it in other ways. 
 ''We want him to realize our backs are against the wall at this point,'' Mr. Aviles said of Mr. Paterson. ''Further cuts will lead to the beginning of dismantling our health care system in New York City.''
 Mental health programs and community clinics will be hit especially hard, Mr. Aviles said, explaining that it does not make financial sense to cut hospital beds, which bring in revenue; clinics generally lose money. Mr. Aviles said patients would be directed to other clinics, though they might be less convenient.
 Slated for closing are mental health programs at four Brooklyn schools -- Public School 90, Public School 225, Public School 328 and Intermediate School 96 -- that serve a total of 200 students. The community clinics being shuttered are Highbridge Health Center in the Bronx; Sunnyside Medical Center and Springfield Gardens Medical Center in Queens; and Sheepshead Bay Clinic in Brooklyn. 
 Along with the programs for children, a mental health day-treatment program for 300 adults at Harlem Hospital Center and another serving 80 adolescents at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center will be closed, officials said.
 Of the 400 jobs being cut, 200 are layoffs, including about 13 doctors as well as managers, nurses, social workers and support staff. The other 200 will be absorbed through attrition by July. The system has 39,000 employees. Most of the job losses will come in the programs that are being cut.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Camcorder Has a Big Payday

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Pure Digital Technologies thought small and simple, and it paid off big time. 
 The tiny, eight-year-old start-up famed for its inexpensive and easy to use Flip video cameras has defeated a down economy. On Thursday, the 100-person company was bought by Cisco Systems, a technology infrastructure giant, for $590 million in stock. The deal caps off a bumpy and unpredictable rise for Pure Digital, which bested the Asian companies that dominate the camera industry from an office located above the Gump's department store in the heart of San Francisco. 
 ''At a time when everybody has just been hammered with stories of misery, this is a really fabulous tale of what is possible against all odds,'' said Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, which invested in Pure Digital. 
 Over the last couple of years, Cisco has expanded beyond selling networking equipment for large computing centers, making inroads into the home via set-top boxes, routers and -- most recently -- digital stereos. The company has been clear about building upon these efforts by aiming much of its nearly $34 billion in cash at future acquisitions. 
 In Pure Digital, Cisco found a local talent to complement its consumer ambitions and extend its business videoconferencing technology to mobile devices. 
 Pure Digital started selling the Flip line of products in 2007 and has since shipped more than two million units, which cost $150 to $230, depending on the model. The device's claim to fame has been its minimalism. 
 The Flip recorders have just a few buttons, weigh a few ounces and have 1.5-inch screens. In addition, they arrive without cables, relying on a built-in connector that plugs into a computer's U.S.B. port for both recharging and transferring video files. 
 Along with the device, Pure Digital offers software that helps shift videos from a personal computer to online services like YouTube and Facebook with the click of a couple of buttons. The simple software, simple design and low cost opened digital camcorders to people put off by more complex devices but still hungry to pass around their videos. 
 ''They were able to capitalize on an opportunity to reach consumers that had traditionally shied away from camcorders,'' said Ross Rubin, an analyst for NPD Group. 
 Over the last few years, the sales of digital camcorders have either stayed flat or declined, according to Mr. Rubin. Meanwhile, Pure Digital tripled its sales of the Flip products over the last year and now holds close to one-fifth of the market. Sony, the market leader, has since mimicked Pure Digital's products, as have a host of smaller competitors. 
 The no-nonsense Flip design set Pure Digital's path on a new trajectory. ''We became a profitable business from the day we launched Flip,'' said Jonathan Kaplan, the company's chief. 
 The company started off selling single-use digital still cameras at drugstores. Customers would rent the cameras and bring them to make prints. 
 The business worked, at first. But as nondisposable cameras became increasingly affordable, Pure Digital's sales tumbled. 
 ''The market demand for that product just melted away,'' Mr. Moritz said. ''We found ourselves selling disposable cameras into a market that was shrinking by the hour.''
 The company next moved to single-use digital camcorders, also distributed through drugstores, where the videos could be burned onto DVDs. 
 Despite trying various approaches, Pure Digital remained in search of a big hit. Luckily, the company's partners -- and, somewhat surprisingly, computer hackers -- helped to nudge it in the right direction. 
 For example, hackers were removing the memory chips from the single-use recorders so they could put videos onto their PCs. In addition, the drugstores asked Pure Digital to limit the accessories it shipped with its cameras, a demand that gave rise to the built-in U.S.B. connector. 
 With such prodding, Pure Digital's staff hit upon the idea of a cheap, easy-to-use digital camera that could funnel videos between the device, PCs and Web sites. Ever since, the company maintained its simple approach while working to make products more attractive via colorful designs and better-quality video. 
 Cisco's deep pockets could help Flip, financed by close to $70 million, succeed outside of the United States and Britain, according to Mr. Moritz. ''You have to scale up your inventory to satisfy demand in lots of different countries, and that is a very expensive proposition,'' he said. 
 Such a consumer play is still a curious one for Cisco. The company tends to operate in the background, providing products that companies use to link phones and computers to the Internet. But Cisco has also made large investments in videoconferencing. The more the Flip encourages consumers to videoconference, the more money the company looks to make selling the routers and switches needed to process the large video files flying off Flip devices and onto YouTube.
 Less than 5 percent of Cisco's $40 billion in annual sales comes from consumer products, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. 
 Cisco is already familiar with Pure Digital's product. The family of John T. Chambers, the chief executive at Cisco, owns eight of the Flip devices, and executives at the company often post their own videos to an internal version of YouTube. 
 In the future, it is expected that Cisco will release versions of the Flip recorders that can connect to wireless networks. There are other surprises in store as well, said Mr. Kaplan. 
 ''The Flip will find its way into some very obvious places and maybe some not-so-obvious ones,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The States of Iraq and Afghanistan

BYLINE: By JASON CAMPBELL, MICHAEL O'HANLON, JEREMY SHAPIRO and AMY UNIKEWICZ. 
Jason Campbell is a research analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Michael O'Hanlon and Jeremy Shapiro are fellows at Brookings. Amy Unikewicz is a graphic designer in South Norwalk, Conn.

 BODY:
SINCE the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, we have compiled charts on the state of the country for the Op-Ed page every three months. Now, on the sixth anniversary of the invasion, it seems appropriate to include data from the conflict in Afghanistan as well. 
 As President Obama looks to reduce the number of troops in Iraq -- and the Baghdad government has achieved 7 of the 11 ''Iraq index'' benchmarks we have laid out, which include steps like establishing provincial election laws and enacting pension and amnesty laws -- the situation in Afghanistan is increasingly cloudy. Many security indicators are clearly unfavorable, though some economic, educational and health care trends are at least heading in the right direction. 
 While the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have their own particular dynamics, there is still much to learn from the comparison. The metrics we have chosen to highlight for each conflict expose some of the key differences: Iraq has lots of oil, Afghanistan has lots of opium; the Iraq coalition includes barely any participants besides the United States and Iraq itself, whereas the Afghanistan effort involves some 30,000 non-American NATO troops. 
 Of course, some statistics that are important in one conflict are of less value in another. In Iraq from 2004 to 2006, levels of violence were extremely high and threatened to tear the country apart, suggesting that civilian fatality rates were the key metric; they may be less crucial (though still important) in Afghanistan. Today, national-level political issues like how to share oil revenue pose the chief threats to Iraqi stability, while more basic problems like security and building roads and schools demand much of policymakers' attention in Afghanistan. 
 Iraq had long been a functioning middle-income state before the American-led invasion of 2003, but Afghanistan had been extremely poor and anarchic for decades. This may explain why, overall, Afghans have had more modest expectations about the future than have Iraqis. However, after more than seven years of an American presence, polls suggest that this Afghan patience may be wearing thin.

HEADLINE: The Money Is Gone. Now What?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The losses from the worldwide financial implosion are only now being tallied up. Adjusting to the reality is proving hard.
 That difficulty is the unifying fact in much of the news these days -- as well as in the mass public outrage over Bernard Madoff, a man who stole primarily from the well-off. Much of the anger is coming from people who did not lose a dime from his Ponzi scheme but who have lost plenty in the stock and real estate markets and would dearly love to find someone to blame.
 All those who lost a lot -- and a lot is defined differently for each person -- now face similar decisions. Do they admit they are permanently poorer, and adjust both their spending and their sense of how successful they have been? Or do they seek to deny reality and hope that somehow the good old days will return? 
 That problem can be seen in the scandal du jour, the bonuses paid to executives at the American International Group. They still think they deserve to be treated as highly successful people running a large financial company. The fact that it would have collapsed if not for the government's repeated bailouts is viewed as an insignificant detail.
 And it could also be seen this week in a legislative proposal being pushed by art museum directors in New York that would bar museums in financial difficulty from selling artwork to raise money to pay other bills. Even without such a law, one museum that sold artwork is to be punished by not being allowed to borrow art from other museums.
 There was outrage earlier this year when Brandeis University announced plans to close its art museum and sell the paintings. The university's endowment was devastated by bad investments.
 What do people opposed to the sale of paintings think suddenly poor institutions should do? Close? Seek government bailouts? Should Brandeis close down a few academic departments, or cut back on scholarships, to keep its art? 
 Brandeis is hardly the only college whose endowment has contracted sharply. I suspect that when the final numbers are in -- and colleges are not exactly rushing to disclose the sad details -- it will turn out that colleges as a group did far worse than the stock market while the market was doing horribly.
 That is because colleges followed the herd. They poured money into so-called alternative investments, which had appeared to be so successful for Harvard and Yale. Alumni clamored to know why their college could not show similar returns, and some colleges that could ill afford big losses put most of their endowment into hedge funds. It turns out such funds could be extremely risky.
 Those colleges, like many other suddenly less well-off investors, now face decisions. Should they shift to less risky investments with the money that is left, thus giving up the profits that will come if the market does bounce back, as some hope it has already begun to do? Or should they hang in there and risk even bigger losses?
 In the meantime, a host of college construction projects have been suspended because the money that was to pay for them is gone. Those decisions, rational as they may be, are putting further downward pressure on the economy just as the college building binge fueled by previous stock market profits helped to stimulate the economy. 
 Colleges now fear that projects under way could drain endowments even more if donors are unable or unwilling to honor earlier pledges. Before it is all over, some trustees will no doubt be forced to resign as scapegoats for what turned out to be bad investment policies.
 State and local governments with pension plans are facing similar issues. Rather than raise taxes or hold back promised benefits, it was easier to assume generous stock market returns would continue forever.
 Faced with underfunded state pension plans, New Jersey even sold taxable bonds to raise cash to put into the funds. That would save the state money if profits from the funds' investments exceeded the interest paid on the bonds. It would cost a lot if the market plunged.
 Now New Jersey wants to find villains to blame. This week it sued former officials of Lehman Brothers, saying they lied about the firm's financial position before it collapsed. Gov. Jon Corzine, who used to run Goldman Sachs, said ''we intend to hold Lehman executives and directors accountable for the fraud and misrepresentation that caused more than $100 million in losses to New Jersey's pension funds.''
 That sounds like a desperate effort to stave off facing reality. Even assuming that the directors and executives are liable, it is hard to see why New Jersey should rank ahead of other investors. If the money is split among all investors, none are likely to collect more than a small fraction of their losses, even if all the defendants are forced into bankruptcy.
 There has been a lot of talk about how much Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, was paid, but he does not have bottomless resources. Much of his pay came in the form of stock and options that he never cashed out and that are now worthless. 
 I was never a big fan of Mr. Fuld. He is responsible for Lehman taking large risks in mortgages and financing it with excessive borrowing. He did not understand how the world had changed by early 2008. The firm passed up chances to raise billions of additional dollars in capital. Some of the money it did raise went into buying depressed assets, on the assumption they would recover quickly.
 That now seems foolish, or worse, but it is evidence that Lehman's top management did not think the firm was in danger until it was too late. If this case goes to trial, it will provide a defense.
 As a society, we are not as rich as we thought we were. The Federal Reserve now estimates that American households as a group are poorer than they were four years ago, even before adjusting for inflation. That had not happened in any four-year period since the Fed began making those estimates more than half a century ago.
 It is not an easy reality to adjust to. But simply assuming that we deserve to live as if it had not happened will only make things worse.

HEADLINE: At a Job Fair, a Mood of Desperation

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Arthur Bernstein, a recruiter at Bramson ORT College, tried to tell it like it was to the dozens of people waiting in line to talk to him at Thursday's job fair at the Radisson Hotel off Broadway. ''We're here trying to sell the school to students,'' Mr. Bernstein explained apologetically. 
 But that did not stop the job seekers from trying to sell themselves to him. A middle-aged woman wanted Mr. Bernstein to know that she had mastered Excel and several word processing programs; a young woman pulled out documents from her portfolio to show off the systems she'd set in place at her old job; a natty man in a suit described the positions he had held managing bill-collection at various businesses. 
 ''I know there are a lot of students whose payments are behind, so collections, there might be something,'' said Mr. Bernstein, a retired New York City schoolteacher, simultaneously absorbing sales pitches and offering his own. ''You know Excel?'' he'd ask. ''We can teach you what you don't know!'' 
 Mr. Bernstein's boss had told him right before the fair that he should accept resumes in addition to student applications, that, sure, there might be some teaching or administrative assistant jobs available. However long the odds, he couldn't bring himself to turn away all those labors of hope and industry and self-promotion. 
 By noon, he seemed overwhelmed by torrent of need and expectation, and at one moment lost control of the script. ''This situation,'' he said to no one in particular, ''is really sick.'' 
 More than a thousand people preregistered for the event, and a good proportion of them, plus walk-ins, were in a line snaking down West 32nd Street in the rainy cold long before the fair started at 11 a.m. Maybe the news had propelled them out of the house despite the weather: The number of people in New York State collecting unemployment benefits hit a high of 476,000 this week.
 As job fairs go, several attendees said, this one was a big disappointment: There were maybe 10 booths, most offering sales jobs that operated on commission rather than salaries and benefits. Avon was there, as well as the National Guard and Bramson ORT College. 
 The attendees were trying to sell their job skills, the commission-only sales recruiters were trying to sell those opportunities, the college was trying to sell the business classes it offers in Brooklyn and Queens -- but no one seemed much in the mood to buy. 
 ''This is a total waste,'' said one woman who formerly worked in legal services. ''I waited on line for an hour, I've been here 10 minutes, now I'm leaving.'' 
 Other job seekers waited dutifully in line to try to persuade the Avon recruiters to pass their resumes on to the information technology team or to someone in human resources who might be looking for an administrative assistant. 
 The room felt awash in supply and starved for demand, except for five fresh-faced recruiters in the corner who were seeking customer service representatives and a human-resource coordinator for their cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals products, produced by Atlantic Coast Media Group. 
 While people at the other booths were suggesting, even as they took resumes, that aspirants apply online as well -- for this you need to wait outside in the cold rain for an hour? -- Atlantic Coast was actually conducting interviews, and by 11:30 said it had hired someone.
 The lucky man was John Colon, 37, who said he had just moved up from Florida a few days ago, after searching for a customer-service job for two months. Among those recruiting him was Gabriela Pereira, who had landed the job with Atlantic Coast, as an assistant manager for customer support, a few months before at a similar job fair.
 It was nice, Ms. Pereira said, to be on the other side. (Note to job seekers: The person to whom you are grumbling about the weather at today's job fair may be the person perusing your resume at the next one.) ''I'm pumped,'' she said, with a friendly little fist wave. ''I know what they're going through and I want to help them out.'' 
 What magical potion is the Atlantic Coast Media Group selling such that it reported hiring not just Ms. Pereira but 10 other people who came to a career fair a few months back? 
 A quick brochure-browsing suggests that nutraceuticals may be the true recession-proof product everyone's been trying to pin down.
 Tired of being tired?
 Banish pain without a prescription.
 Ionic waves wash away toxins and tension!
 Trick your brain into thinking you're full.

HEADLINE: Some Good News on Jobs and Mortgages

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
New jobless claims fell more than expected last week, but continuing claims set a new record for the eighth consecutive week and few economists expect the labor market to improve soon. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that initial requests for unemployment insurance dropped 1.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted 646,000, from the previous week's revised figure of 658,000. That was better than analysts' expectations.
 But continuing claims jumped 185,000, to a seasonally adjusted 5.47 million, another record. Economists had expected that figure to reach about 5.33 million.
 Other economic news was slightly more upbeat. A private sector group's index of leading economic indicators dropped less than expected in February, although growth was not expected before next year. On the housing front, rates on 30-year mortgages plunged to the lowest level since January, and might fall further after the Federal Reserve began a new effort to prop up the flailing housing market.
 The government-controlled mortgage finance company Freddie Mac said Thursday that average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 4.98 percent this week, down from 5.03 percent last week. It was the lowest since the week of Jan. 15, when it was at 4.96 percent, the record low for Freddie Mac's survey that dates to 1971.
 Economists said the signs of life that had cropped up in other areas of the economy in the last week, like increases in retail sales and housing starts, were not yet showing up in the labor market.
 ''There is no sign of even a temporary easing in the downward pressure on employment,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at the research firm High Frequency Economics, wrote in a client note.
 Initial unemployment claims have topped 600,000 for seven weeks in a row, a level that many economists say is consistent with another huge drop in net payrolls.
 Net job losses could top 700,000 in March, Mr. Shepherdson said, which would bring total losses to above five million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.
 The Conference Board's monthly forecast of economic activity fell 0.4 percent last month, slightly better than the 0.6 percent decline economists expected. The index is designed to forecast economic activity in the next three to six months, based on 10 components that include stock prices, money supply, jobless claims and building permits.
 Despite beating expectations, the index's broad decline of the last 19 months persisted and is unlikely to end until next year, economists said.
 In a separate report Thursday, the Labor Department said unemployment rose in all but one of the 372 metropolitan areas tracked by the government in January. The only drop was in New York, which had 11,218 fewer claims as a result of fewer layoffs in the service and transportation industries. 
 As a proportion of the work force, the number of Americans receiving jobless benefits is the highest since June 1983. The 5.47 million continuing claims also were up substantially from a year ago, when only about 2.85 million people were continuing to receive unemployment checks.

HEADLINE: Perverse Cosmic Myopia

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
You'd think if some tiger were lunging at your neck, your attention would be riveted on the tiger. But that's apparently not how it works in the age of global A.D.D. As a tiger sinks its teeth into the world's neck, we focus on the dust bunnies under the bed and the floorboards that need replacing on the deck. We live in the world of Perverse Cosmic Myopia, an inability to focus attention on the most perilous matter at hand. 
 The tiger, of course, is the collapsing world financial system. Americans actually have a falsely mild view of this crisis because the economy is worse abroad. The U.N.'s International Labor Organization projects between 30 million and 50 million job losses worldwide. Central European countries are teetering; Japan's economy is horrifying; and the Chinese job creation machine is losing the race against its demographic pressures. 
 There have been riots in Greece and China as well as huge protest rallies in Dublin, Paris, London and beyond. So far, the protesters express anger without an agenda, but if the global economy continues to slide through 2010, they'll discover one. A predictable result is a series of beggar-thy-neighbor exchange-rate policies, followed by rising trade barriers and the degradation of the entire global system.
 In times like these, you'd expect prudent leaders to prepare for the worst. After all, the pessimists have recently been vindicated by events. But that's apparently too painful to think about. In normal times, leaders like to focus on the short term at the expense of the long term. But now the short term is really confusing, so leaders take refuge in projects that are years or decades away. 
 The president of the United States has decided to address this crisis while simultaneously tackling the four most complicated problems facing the nation: health care, energy, immigration and education. Why he has not also decided to spend his evenings mastering quantum mechanics and discovering the origins of consciousness is beyond me. 
 The results of this overload are evident on Capitol Hill. The banking plan is incomplete, and there is zero political will to pay for it. The president's budget is being nibbled to death. The revenue ideas are dying one by one, while the spending ideas expand. By the latest estimate, the health care approach will cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years and the national debt will at least double, while the Chinese publicly complain about picking up the tab.
 The Obama administration is at least distracted by important things. The Washington political class has spent the past week going into made-for-TV hysterics over $165 million in A.I.G. bonuses. We're in the middle of a multitrillion-dollar crisis, and our political masters -- always willing to throw themselves into any issue that is understandable on cable television -- have decided to risk destroying the entire bank-rescue plan because of bonuses that account for 0.001 percent of the annual G.D.P.
 Even this is not the most idiotic of the distractions. For that, you have to look abroad.
 This is a global crisis, and a core lesson of the Great Depression is that a global crisis calls for a global response. As such, Tim Geithner and Larry Summers are preparing for the upcoming G-20 summit with an agenda that has the merit of actually addressing the problem at hand: coordinate global stimulus, strengthen the International Monetary Fund, preserve open trade.
 But the G-20 process is heading toward global impotence because the Europeans are dismissing this approach. Instead, they want to spend this moment of peril working on a long-term architecture to regulate global finance. The world is in flames and they want directorates and multilateral symposia and vague plans for a powerless ''college of supervisors.'' This is what Marie Antoinette would be for if she were an annual Davos attendee. 
 Why are they taking this position? First, many European leaders think the answer to every problem is more global architecture. They've got Jean Monnet on the brain. Second, they prefer to free-ride on the stimulus packages that the Americans and Chinese are already paying for. Third, the fiscally responsible European countries can't commit to a policy that their debt-ridden partners can't live up to. Fourth, some reject the idea of using fiscal policy to end recessions. 
 Some of these reasons have merit, especially the last one. But one thing is for sure: The American agenda might work to ease the immediate crisis, but efforts to build a long-range global architecture certainly will not. After all the pious talk about post-Bush international cooperation, the current approach will lead to a big multilateral zero. 
 Many people used to wonder how the world's leaders could be so myopic at various points in history -- like during the Versailles Treaty or the turmoil of the 1930s. We don't have to wonder any more. We get to watch the cosmic myopia replay itself in our own times.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Mayor Wants To Raise Taxes Temporarily

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael A. Nutter on Thursday proposed temporarily raising sales and property taxes to help fill a growing shortfall in the city's budget for the 2010 fiscal year. 
 The sales tax would rise by one percentage point to 8 percent for three years, beginning July 1, pending approval by state lawmakers. Taxes on residential and commercial real estate would rise by 19 percent in the coming year, and by 14.5 percent from current levels in the 2011 fiscal year, Mr. Nutter said.
 The new tax rates, which Mr. Nutter's budget projects would raise $614 million over their planned life, would be rolled back to current levels when they expired, based on the assumption of an economic recovery. 
 Mr. Nutter also proposed cost-cutting measures that included reducing the city's 23,757-person work force by 250 positions; cutting 500 vehicles from the city's fleet of 6,000 and calling for all city employees to take one voluntary furlough day, a measure that would save $4.1 million. 
 Additional revenue in the $3.84 billion budget proposal would be raised through a variety of fees, according to the Nutter plan, including charging uninsured patients for using city health centers and introducing fees for commercial trash collection.
 ''We face really tough choices,'' the mayor, a Democrat, said in a 45-minute speech to the City Council. ''There is no easy way out.''
 But he avoided cutting the police and fire departments, and, after a public outcry, rolled back earlier plans to close 11 libraries. All libraries will now remain open, as will recreation centers, community health centers, and facilities for the homeless.
 The decision to fill the budget gap largely by raising taxes followed a citywide public consultation process in recent months that found most Philadelphians were willing to pay higher taxes to prevent cuts to what they considered to be core services. 
 Like many other cities, Philadelphia has been struggling to meet a legal requirement to balance its budget. Plunging tax receipts and higher spending, particularly on pensions, have opened a projected $170 million shortfall in the budget for the coming year and more than $1 billion over the next five years. That is in addition to an earlier $1 billion gap over five years identified in November 2008.
 The same factors are ravaging big-city budgets throughout the country. In late January, New York City officials said that the city was facing a $4 billion deficit for the 2010 fiscal year, and that revenue for the coming fiscal year was expected to be $5 billion lower than in 2009.
 If state lawmakers reject Mr. Nutter's plan to raise the sales tax, along with another proposal to reduce the city's payments into its pension fund by cutting the assumed rate of return, city officials said they would fall back on a contingency budget that would include bigger increases in the real estate tax and deeper cuts in spending.

HEADLINE: Luxe Meets The Lake In 'Real' Florida

BYLINE: By CHARLES PASSY

 BODY:
IT is the ''big water.'' 
 That's the term -- ''Okeechobee,'' in the tongue of the native Indians -- used to describe the 730-square-mile freshwater lake that occupies much of the real estate of South Florida. 
 It is quiet water, too.
 The Lake Okeechobee region is a place of unhurried, outdoorsy pursuits: bass fishing, boar hunting or simply shooting the breeze on a lazy, sunny day. 
 The major towns that surround Lake Okeechobee -- Clewiston, Belle Glade, Pahokee and Okeechobee -- don't even bother to compete with the lake. These are dot-on-the-map burgs, seemingly built to emphasize Florida's untamed beauty. There are no shopping malls, no pricey restaurants, not even so much as a movie theater in many towns.
 Instead, there are lots of wide open spaces where everything from sweet corn to wild papaya grows, and where the greatest excitement might be the sight of a hungry peregrine falcon plucking a duck from the sky.
 ''This is what I like to call the real Florida,'' said Ron Zimmerly, executive director of the tourist development council of Hendry County, one of five counties that claim a piece of Lake Okeechobee. 
 But this ''real Florida'' appears to be changing. 
 For decades, the region has supported its own kind of tourism, welcoming visitors, primarily from the Midwest, at many an unassuming RV park or fish camp. These days, despite the troubled economy and a drought that kept water levels low during much of the last two years, there are signs that Lake Okeechobee is embracing a more luxe life. Entrepreneurs are bringing in amenities more often associated with cities along the Florida coasts, with an eye on drawing more seasonal residents and vacation-home owners. 
 In Clewiston, the 73-year-old Clewiston Inn has been given a $1 million makeover, including plasma TVs in each room. In Pahokee, a partnership between the city and a marina developer has resulted in a $12 million complex, the Lake Okeechobee Outpost, where visitors can spend the night in a well-appointed lakeside cabin or fish off a sturdy concrete pier that stretches several hundred feet into the lake. The project includes plans for a conference center and a casual restaurant that will serve lunch and dinner, no small deal in a town with only about a half-dozen restaurants. 
 The most remarkable of these projects, however, is the Pine Creek Sporting Club, a 2,800-acre community in Okeechobee built around clay shooting, quail hunting and other outdoor pursuits. It is being developed by the owner of Silver Hilton Steelhead Lodge in northern British Columbia.
 Home prices start at $800,000, an almost unheard-of sum by the standards of the town, which is known primarily for cattle ranching. But it is a relative bargain for some buyers who have looked elsewhere in Florida.
 ''I couldn't buy a tenth of my house for what this costs me,'' said Erich Boehm, a retired cable executive, referring to his home in Palm Beach. An avid outdoorsman who also has a home in Chicago, Mr. Boehm is building a cabin at Pine Creek, planning to spend two to three days a week there during the seven months he resides in Florida. 
 He had kept a boat on Okeechobee and considered buying a ranch in the area, but was discouraged by the fact that such a setup wouldn't offer much in the way of amenities for his less outdoors-minded family members, especially his wife. At Pine Creek, ''she's going to have a health club and pool.''
 Not that the Lake Okeechobee of yesteryear is being lost. Drive up to the South Bay RV Campground, on the southeastern side of the lake, and you'll find an affordable retreat -- it costs less than $30 to hook up an RV for the night. 
 There's no ''scene'' there, save for three retired gentlemen making amusingly cantankerous small talk in the recreation center. When asked how their wives take to such a quiet winter getaway, one of them, Bob Ross, a retired General Motors supervisor from Saginaw, Mich., jokingly noted that they were less than pleased. 
 But Mr. Ross is seriously pleased when the fish are biting. Even when the drought kept many boaters out of the water, he and a fishing buddy, John Nau, a retired trucker from Ohio, stayed busy on the outlying waterways. 
 And so much for the bass fishing that's touted by world-class anglers like Roland Martin, who has a popular marina in Clewiston now run by his former wife, Mary Ann Martin. Men like Mr. Ross and Mr. Nau would much rather go after catfish, which they can fry up for the RV park's regular Friday night pot-luck dinners.
 ''So far, we've caught 500 this year,'' Mr. Nau said. 
 Of course, there's more to life on Lake Okeechobee than fishing. In recent years, birding groups have become particularly active, so much so that the Clewiston Inn now offers weekend birding packages with the local chapter of the National Audubon Society. (The inn, supposedly haunted by the friendly ghost of a former guest, also offers ''ghost hunt'' packages and is hosting a national convention of ghost fanatics next year.) 
 While fishing guides have long been a fixture on the lake, a new group of eco-tour guides is also starting to make its presence known. Mike Challancin, a former biology teacher who now heads Eagle Nest Airboat Tours in Belle Glade, takes groups of up to six at a time on a trip that explores the mysteries of life in the lake's shallows, from a species of bird that does a fair job approximating the call of a monkey to the alligators that spend the day sauntering on the banks. 
 Mr. Challancin, after leading a Sunday morning tour attended by visitors from fairly near (Jensen Beach, on the Atlantic Coast) and far (New Hampshire), claimed Lake Okeechobee ''was one of the last wilderness areas in this country'' to be settled, noting that a residential population didn't really establish itself until the first two decades of the 20th century. 
 And a good number of those early residents -- some 2,500 -- perished in a 1928 hurricane that caused extensive flooding in the area. That event prompted the construction of a massive earthen dike, as high as 45 feet, to keep the waters at bay. As a result, the lake is largely hidden from the view of many passersby.
 This may be the key reason that the lake has also been one of Florida's best-kept secrets. For the millions of visitors who crisscross the state en route to Florida's east or west coasts, Lake Okeechobee is never seen. 
 Now, the lake communities can no longer afford to let travelers ignore them. Even during the best of harvests, these hardscrabble farming towns have always struggled with poverty: The Edward R. Murrow 1960 documentary ''Harvest of Shame'' concerned working conditions in Belle Glade. 
 Last year, the future of farming in the area was cast into doubt when Gov. Charlie Crist announced a $1.34 billion plan to buy 180,000 acres from the agricultural giant United States Sugar so that farmland could be used in the restoration of the Everglades, to the south of Lake Okeechobee. Although the Crist plan is not finalized, local officials hope that a boost in tourism can make up for some of the threatened loss in agriculture. 
 But developers were seeing the possibility of wooing visitors -- short-term or seasonal -- long before this plan. After all, there isn't much room to build another condo on Florida's east or west coasts. And though the collapse of the housing market has brought prices down on the coasts, those still can't compare with prices in the Lake Okeechobee region: modest homes rarely cost more than $200,000, and a lakeside cabin at the new Lake Okeechobee Outpost in Pahokee can be had for as little as $1,400 a month in the high season.
 There is also the allure of proximity, since the lake communities are never more than a roughly 90-minute drive to either coast. 
 Then again, the newer, well-heeled visitors to Lake Okeechobee may find that even that's too much time to spare. Which is why the developers of the Pine Creek Sporting Club have begun to offer helicopter service from Palm Beach directly to the luxury community. 
 It's an amenity that Mr. Boehm, the retired cable executive, plans to tap when he's eager to do a little fishing on a moment's notice. ''I can be at the lake in 20 minutes,'' he said. 
 IF YOU GO
 Lake Okeechobee is less than a 90-minute drive from the airports in West Palm Beach or Fort Myers.
 Motels, fish camps and RV campgrounds can be found in most of the lake's major towns. For area information, see www.visitflorida.com/articles/lake-okeechobee-area
 On the higher end are two places in Clewiston on the south side of the lake: the Clewiston Inn (108 Royal Palm Avenue; 800-749-4466; www.clewistoninn.com) and the Roland Martin Marina (920 East Del Monte Avenue; 800-473-6766; www.rolandmartinmarina.com). Rooms start at $109 at the Clewiston Inn, and $69 at the Roland Martin Marina. 
 The inn has a popular restaurant that serves barbecue and a Southern-style Sunday buffet brunch; the marina's Tiki Bar and its restaurant have views of a waterway that connects to Lake Okeechobee.
 Another option is renting a lakeside cabin at the Lake Okeechobee Outpost in Pahokee (190 North Lake Avenue; 561-924-7832, www.lakeokeechobeeoutpost.com). Rates start at $60. 
 Visitors can hire a fishing guide at most marinas on the lake, including the Roland Martin Marina. 
 Eagle Nest Airboat Tours in Belle Glade (561-261-3655) offers two-hour eco-tours of the plants and animals of the lake for $60 a person.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Chief Urges Changes in Financial Oversight

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said Thursday that the government's strategy in the financial crisis of bailing out huge institutions deemed ''too big to fail'' must be replaced by a new model. 
 The official, Sheila C. Bair, told Congress that a new system of supervision was needed to prevent institutions from taking on excessive risk and becoming so large that their failure would threaten the financial system. Such a mechanism would be similar to what the F.D.I.C. does with federally insured banks and thrifts, she added.
 Testifying at a packed Senate Banking Committee hearing, Ms. Bair said that simply creating a so-called systemic risk regulator -- a central idea in the discussion of overhauling the government financial rules -- ''is not a panacea.''
 Ms. Bair appeared with other top regulators to discuss the high-stakes issue of modernizing oversight of the nation's financial institutions amid the crisis gripping the United States. and the global economies.
 The government's rescue of the insurance giant American International Group, its pumping of tens of billions of dollars into Citigroup and Bank of America in more than one instance, and other actions in the crisis have put a ''too big to fail'' stamp on federal policy.
 The committee's chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said that possibly the most important lesson to take from the crisis is that ''no institution should ever be 'too big to fail.' ''
 ''Replacing Citibank-sized financial institutions with Citibank-sized regulators would be a grave mistake,'' he said.
 Mr. Dodd suggested it could make more sense to give the F.D.I.C., which has the expertise in that area, authority over big failing institutions.
 But Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts., chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and other lawmakers have proposed that the Federal Reserve assume the role of systemic regulator to monitor against the kinds of risks that plunged markets worldwide into distress last year.
 Both Congress and the Obama administration are starting to devise their strategies for revamping a patchwork regulatory system that dates to the Civil War as they strive to prevent a repeat of the global crisis.

HEADLINE: Greenbrier Resort Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
It took a 21st-century recession to do what the Great Depression and the cold war could not: drive the historic Greenbrier resort, the playground of presidents and royalty, into bankruptcy. 
 The company that runs the 231-year-old resort, which is perched in the mountains of West Virginia, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court in Richmond, Va., on Thursday. 
 But the company, the Greenbrier Hotel Corporation, held out hope that the resort, famed for its lush golf greens and a once-secret bunker intended to withstand a nuclear attack, may be sold to Marriott later this year.
 The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs and owned since 1910 by the railroad operator CSX, is the latest resort business to fall victim to the recession. 
 The 721-room compound, a registered national landmark, proclaims that 26 presidents have visited and that it once had Sam Snead as its resident golf pro. 
 It even hosted a once-secret 112,000-square-foot bunker, known as Project Greek Island, to be used by Congress in case of a nuclear assault. 
 But in recent years the resort struggled to attract a younger crowd, even before the credit crisis, and it undertook ill-timed renovations and expansion in 2006 and 2007. It lost more than $90 million in the last five years, according to court documents. 
 In its statement on Thursday, the Greenbrier Hotel Corporation said it has struck an agreement to sell the resort to Marriott, pending the bankruptcy court's approval and contingent on its renegotiating labor contracts before the sale.
 The resort will remain in business while in bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. and Wall St. Confront Upsurge of Populist Fury

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Louise Story and Jonathan D. Glater contributed reporting from New York, and Helene Cooper from Burbank, Calif.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House overwhelmingly approved on Thursday a near total tax on bonuses paid this year to employees of the American International Group and other firms that have accepted large amounts of federal bailout funds, rattling Wall Street as lawmakers rushed to respond to populist anger.
 Despite questions about the legality of the retroactive 90 percent levy, Democrats and some Republicans said the tax on bonuses for traders, executives and bankers earning more than $250,000 was the quickest way to show angry Americans that Congress intended to recoup the extra dollars. Even backers of the measure noted it was an extraordinary step. 
 The House vote sent some employees into a panic about the prospect of, in effect, having to give up money they might already have spent. And it had regulators fearing it could undermine the Treasury's efforts to stabilize the financial system if banks tried to flee the bailout program or if other firms refused to participate in coming rescue operations to protect their bonuses, some executives said. 
 Vikram S. Pandit, chief executive of Citigroup, lobbied against the legislation in a meeting Thursday with the Senate majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, according to an industry official. 
 But the rush to curb the bonuses by lawmakers, many of whom have previously been torn about limiting executive compensation, reflected Congressional anxiety about heightened public dismay over the bailout. The Senate is expected to consider a similar tax on bonuses but has some differences with the House, which could slow final action.
 In a statement, President Obama suggested he was supportive of the legislation, urging Congress to deliver a ''final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated.''
 In an appearance later on ''The Tonight Show'' on NBC, Mr. Obama was measured in his reaction, saying he understood that Congress was ''responding, I think, to everybody's anger'' but that the best way to handle the situation was ''to make sure you've closed the door before the horse gets out of the barn.''
 The legislation would apply to bonuses paid to executives at companies holding at least $5 billion in bailout money and would essentially wipe out the phenomenal paydays that have been a tradition on Wall Street, at least until the firms reduce the amount they owe taxpayers to less than $5 billion. 
 According to a tally by The New York Times of bailout recipients, employees at 11 institutions -- including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase -- would face restrictions immediately.
 The current version of the Senate bill would apply to an even wider array of companies. It would tax bonuses at companies that received as little as $100 million in federal bailout assistance, though at a lower rate. 
 In response, financial institutions that have received federal bailout money mounted a broad assault Thursday on the House legislation, which was opposed by leading Republicans. But nearly half of House Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the measure, which was approved by a 328-to-93 vote.
 Its backers said the companies had forced Congress to act by inexplicably handing out generous rewards to employees after tapping taxpayer funds to survive an economic calamity brought on by irresponsible and risky executive decisions. A.I.G. gave out $165 million in bonuses, saying the payments were essential to retain employees who could help the company sort out its financial problems.
 ''Have the recipients of these checks no shame at all?'' asked Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota. Summing up his personal view of the so-far-anonymous A.I.G. executives, he said: ''You are disgraced professional losers. And by the way, give us our money back.''
 But several executives at Wall Street banks said they were being unfairly caught up in a hasty response by Washington that would ultimately deliver a sharper blow to their companies than to A.I.G., which set off the furor. One bank executive said employees were coming into his office in tears. 
 Several banks are considering refusing to participate in government financial rescue programs if the bill passes, according to a person briefed on the banks' plans. Hedge fund and private equity firms may also be hesitant to work in partnership with the government to purchase bad assets from banks -- a central component of the Treasury Department's coming financial recovery plan -- if they think the government might later add restrictions on their pay. 
 ''If this stands, you will destroy the value of institutions where the government is an owner,'' said Orin Kramer, who runs a hedge fund and helps oversee the New Jersey pension plan. 
 ''You will drive people away from being willing to do business with the government,'' said Mr. Kramer, a prominent fund-raiser for Mr. Obama.
 Members of both parties raised doubt about whether the legislation could survive a court challenge, saying it was tantamount to a retroactive ''bill of attainder,'' which is banned by the Constitution. Even backers of the bill acknowledged it amounted to an extraordinary use of tax law. 
 ''It is an extreme use of the tax code to correct an extreme and excessive wrong done to the American taxpayer,'' said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, senior Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, who backed the measure despite reservations. 
 But experts on constitutional and tax law said it was likely the House bill could pass muster. Numerous court rulings have upheld retroactive tax provisions, particularly over short periods. The House bill applies back only to Jan. 1, 2009. The measure is also strengthened by the fact that it does not apply to just one company or group of individuals, and does not take aim only at past bonuses but also bonuses to be paid in the future, experts said.
 The effort to impose the tax was led by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who just days earlier had expressed reluctance at using the tax code for this purpose. Mr. Rangel has also sought donations from A.I.G. for a public policy institute at City College in New York that will bear his name. 
 But on Thursday Mr. Rangel said that the executives were ''getting away with murder.''
 ''They are getting paid for the destruction they have caused our communities,'' he said. 
 Bank executives, who requested anonymity because they did not want to further alienate lawmakers, said their employees were on edge and many would face severe financial hardship if they were severely taxed on money already paid. 
 ''It'll impact tens of thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands of people,'' said Alan Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm in New York, noting that the tax would apply to a bonus recipient with family income of more than $250,000. ''If you're a receptionist and your husband is a doctor, your $5,000 bonus just vaporized. It's not just the C.E.O.'s.''
 Led by Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the party leader, several House Republicans assailed the legislation, calling it a diversion by Democrats eager to escape scrutiny for failing to block the bonuses. 
 They also pointed to a last-minute addition to the economic stimulus legislation approved in February that appeared to restrict the federal government's ability to block bonuses for the most senior executives if they were negotiated into contracts before Feb. 11, including some at A.I.G.
 ''This bill is nothing more than an attempt for everybody to cover their butt up here on Capitol Hill,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''It's full of loopholes. A lot of these people who are getting these bonuses likely live in London. And it's not clear how raising this tax is going to recover that money.''
 But their attacks were somewhat undermined by the fact that 85 Republicans, including Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 party leader, ended up backing the new tax, suggesting they wanted to be seen as restricting the bonuses even as others in the party were trying to hit Democrats over the issue. In all, 87 Republicans opposed the bill.
 Senator Reid said he hoped Congress could send a final tax bill to Mr. Obama by Easter.

HEADLINE: Scorn Trails A.I.G. Executives, Even in Their Own Driveways

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and RUSS BUETTNER; Reporting was contributed by Cara Buckley, Kenny Porpora, William K. Rashbaum, Nate Schweber and Joel Stonington.

 BODY:
The A.I.G. executive who was nicknamed ''Jackpot Jimmy'' by a New York tabloid walked up the driveway toward his bay-windowed house in Fairfield, Conn., on Thursday afternoon. ''How do I feel?'' said the executive, James Haas, repeating the question he had just been asked. ''I feel horrible. This has been a complete invasion of privacy.''
 Mr. Haas walked on, his pink shirt a burst of color on a slate-gray afternoon. The words came haltingly. ''You have to understand,'' he said, ''there are kids involved, there have been death threats. ...'' His voice trailed off. It looked as if he was fighting back tears.
 ''I didn't have anything to do with those credit problems,'' said Mr. Haas, 47. ''I told Mr. Liddy'' -- Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of A.I.G., the insurance giant -- ''I would rescind my retention contract.'' 
 He ended the conversation with a request: ''Leave my neighbors alone.''
 Too late. Jean Wieson, who has lived down the block for 24 years, had stopped her car in front of Mr. Haas's house before he arrived home. She was angry about the millions of dollars in bonuses paid to its executives, the credit-default swaps that brought American International Group to its knees, the $170 billion the federal government has spent to prop it up. ''It makes me absolutely sick,'' she said. ''It's despicable. It's disgusting what these people have done. They should be forced to give every cent back.''
 Those bonuses in years past helped make A.I.G. executives into prominent local citizens. They own big houses like Mr. Haas's, with its three chimneys and its views of Southport Harbor and Long Island Sound in the distance. Some are well-known contributors to arts groups and private schools in Connecticut communities not far from the office park in Wilton that is the workplace of many of the employees in A.I.G.'s Financial Products division, which is at the center of the storm over bonus payments.
 Now these executives are toxic, and those communities are rattled and divided. Private security guards have been stationed outside their houses, and sometimes the local police drive by. A.I.G. employees at the company's office tower in Lower Manhattan were told to avoid leaving the building while a demonstration was going on outside. The memo also advised them to avoid displaying company-issued ID cards when they left the office and to abandon tote bags or other items with the A.I.G. logo.
 One A.I.G. executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared the consequences of identifying himself, said many workers felt demonized and betrayed. ''It is as bad if not worse than McCarthyism,'' he said. Everyone has sacrificed the employees of A.I.G.'s financial products division, he said, ''for their own political agenda.''
 The public's anger, he said, ''is coming from bad facts as a result of someone else's agenda -- or just bad facts period.'' Instead, he said, the so-called bonuses were in fact just payments that had been promised long ago to workers, including technical and administrative assistants. 
 A.I.G. employees are not the only ones seeking protection: An executive at Merrill Lynch, where bonuses have also come under fire, said that some employees had asked whether the firm would cover the cost of private security for them.
 Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Bank of America, which bought Merrill in December, would not respond to that claim, but said in a statement, ''The safety and security of our associates is paramount, and we will always take the appropriate steps.'' 
 And there may be more protests. The Connecticut Working Families party, which has support from organized labor, is planning a bus tour of A.I.G. executives' homes on Saturday, with a stop at the company's Wilton office. 
 ''We're going to be peaceful and lawful in everything we do,'' said Jon Green, the director of Connecticut Working Families. ''I know there's a lot of anger and a lot of rage about what's happened. We're not looking to foment that unnecessarily, but what we want to do is give folks in Bridgeport and Hartford and other parts of Connecticut who are struggling and losing their homes and their jobs and their health insurance an opportunity to see what kinds of lifestyle billions of dollars in credit-default swaps can buy.'' 
 A.I.G. paid the $165 million in bonuses to 463 of its executives, but in the uproar that erupted when the payments were made public, Mr. Liddy asked the employees to return much of that money. He said that many of them have agreed to do so. 
 The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, said on Thursday that A.I.G. had handed over a list with the names of the bonus recipients. But he did not release the list. ''We are aware of the security concerns of A.I.G. employees,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement, ''and we will be sensitive to those issues by doing a risk assessment before releasing any individual's name.''
 It was unclear exactly what measures the officials at A.I.G. have taken in the name of protecting the company's executives. Officials at several police departments in Connecticut towns where A.I.G. executives live said they did not know about possible threats against the bonus recipients. ''We haven't heard of it,'' said Sgt. Carol Ogrinc of the New Canaan police. ''There have been no complaints made to our department.''
 But several security companies in New York credited the financial crisis with a noticeable increase in some areas of their business, from protecting executives to dispatching bomb-sniffing dogs to check for trouble. ''There is certainly anger among people about the economy and fear among corporate executives themselves,'' said Patrick Timlin, the president of Michael Stapleton Associates, which provides bomb-dog teams. 
 And there is concern in places like Wilton that the scandal is tarring their town. ''They're blaming us,'' said Konstantinos Papanikolaou, a manager at Orem's Diner in Wilton, about a mile from the A.I.G. office.
 Jay Fiedler of Trumbull, Conn., said his town was also a ''victim,'' initially of a brutal economic downturn that had been fueled by problems at companies like A.I.G., and then of the outrage that has coalesced around the bonuses that A.I.G. paid. 
 ''It just so happened that it happened here,'' Mr. Fiedler said. ''The community is the victim of the fact that it takes place here.''
 Others in A.I.G.'s neighborhood were clearly angry. Tamara King, an immigration specialist at a health care company whose office is adjacent to the A.I.G. quarters, said she feels disgust each time she walks past it.
 ''You don't want to associate with them because it's not a reflection on the state, it's not a reflection on us,'' she said. But she added, ''You have so many people out of a job, and these people think they can take the money and run.''
 The largest single bonus check, for $6.4 million, went to Douglas L. Poling, an executive vice president for energy and infrastructure investments. Mark Herr, an A.I.G. spokesman, said Mr. Poling had told him he was returning the bonus ''because he thought it was the correct thing to do.''
 Gerry Pasciucco, a former vice chairman of Morgan Stanley who was brought in by Mr. Liddy in November to wind down the financial products unit, said Mr. Poling had sold off roughly 80 percent of the unit's assets. Mr. Pasciucco said the money from the sales would go to the government, which has handed more than $170 billion in bailout money to A.I.G. in the last six months. 
 ''He's done an outstanding job in winding down his investment books,'' Mr. Pasciucco said. ''He did it at the right time, and we've made money. We would be losing money today if we waited to sell some of these assets.''
 Mr. Poling's father, Harold A. Poling, retired as the chief executive of Ford Motor Company in 1994. On Thursday, Cheryle Campbell answered the phone at Harold Poling's house in Bloomfield, Mich., where she said she had worked as a housekeeper for 20 years. She said she was not surprised to hear that Douglas Poling had decided to give back his bonus. ''You'd think, being in the kind of job he is, that he'd be one of those sharks,'' she said. ''But he's not at all.'' 
 Douglas Poling has lived in the same house on a dead-end street in Fairfield for 11 years. The local papers say that he and his wife have given generously to a homeless shelter, to the Westport Country Playhouse and the Fairfield Country Day School, a boys' prep school where tuition runs as high as $29,300 a year.
 But on Thursday, his house, like Mr. Haas's, was being watched by private security guards.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts Could Increase Fraud, Investigation Dept. Official Warns

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Despite a record number of arrests last year and other recent successes, New York City's Department of Investigation has been strapped by budget cuts and is unable to handle as many complaints as it used to, the agency's commissioner told a City Council committee on Thursday.
 The agency, which is finishing another round of cuts and is facing an even smaller budget for the coming fiscal year, is taking twice as long to do background checks on managers and other supervisors hired by the city, according to the commissioner, Rose Gill Hearn. 
 ''It will not be feasible for D.O.I. to tolerate further cuts without diminishing our performance record and our impact on reducing corruption,'' Ms. Gill Hearn told the City Council's Committee on Oversight and Investigations during one of several budget hearings held at City Hall this week.
 As the global economic crisis tightened its grip on the city, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ordered agencies to cut their expenses to make up shortfalls. He initially asked the agencies to reduce costs by the same proportion, but in the end, some were forced to cut more than others. The Department of Finance, for example, slashed its budget by 23 percent for the current fiscal year, but the Transportation Department made an 11 percent cut, city records show.
 A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, said that the city was asking all agencies ''to do more with less money and still carry out their core mission.'' The Department of Investigation, he said, ''has done a very good job at that, and we ask them to continue to find ways to do their job'' with diminished resources.
 The Department of Investigation saw its budget reduced by 8 percent this fiscal year and faces an additional 8 percent cut in the fiscal year that begins July 1, when the city faces a $4 billion gap.
 At the hearing, Ms. Gill Hearn highlighted her department's role in helping to uncover wrongdoings that underlined several recent tragedies. One of them was the crane collapse on East 51st Street in March 2008 that killed seven people and led to the indictment of a crane rigger and his company on manslaughter and other charges. 
 Ms. Gill Hearn said that the department had made a record 848 arrests in 2008 and recovered $22 million that had been stolen from the city. She also mentioned other recent successes: more than a dozen contractors, homeowners and business owners arrested on charges of paying bribes to building inspectors; three correction officers indicted on allegations that they allowed inmates to control parts of the Rikers Island jail complex; and a subcontractor, among others, charged for his role in the 2007 fire at the Deutsche Bank building in which two firefighters were killed. 
 Mayor Bloomberg's preliminary budget, which he released Jan. 30, allots $19.3 billion for the Department of Investigation, down from $21.2 billion. Once the most recent round of budget cuts is concluded, the agency will have 176 workers, nearly half as many as it did when Ms. Gill Hearn became commissioner in 2002, she said.
 Councilman Eric N. Gioia, the oversight committee's chairman, told Ms. Gill Hearn that ''there's a real cost to New York to underfund your agency,'' and asked her what the consequences would be if her department's investigations were delayed.
 ''Individuals who are engaged in fraudulent activities remain in place, unstopped, unchecked,'' she replied. 
 ''As history has shown,'' Ms. Gill Hearn said, ''diminished resources and hard times are often a fertile breeding ground for corruption.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Friday about a warning by the city's commissioner of investigation that budget cuts at the Department of Investigation would hamper its anticorruption work misstated the size of the agency's current budget and its size under planned reductions. The current budget is $21.2 million, not billion, and the proposed is $19.3 million, not billion.

HEADLINE: No Changing the Williams Sisters' Minds

BYLINE: By PAUL OBERJUERGE

DATELINE: INDIAN WELLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
Erma Casey and Phyliss Carelock sat in $50 seats near the top of the stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on a bright afternoon. They conceded that it seemed like a high tariff to perch a half-dozen rows from the rim of the arena. ''But it would have been 30 percent more without my senior citizen's discount,'' Casey confided. 
 Like most of the fans at the BNP Paribas Open in the desert near Palm Springs, Casey and Carelock would have preferred to see Venus or Serena Williams playing in the women's quarterfinals Thursday on the court below. But they know the drill. 
 Venus and Serena don't do Indian Wells. 
 ''I wish they were here,'' said Casey, an African-American from Los Angeles. ''But I still come because I love tennis.''
 The most famous boycott in modern tennis goes on. The Williams sisters have not returned here since a celebrated incident in 2001. Venus, citing injury, pulled out of a semifinal match against Serena four minutes before it was scheduled to begin. The crowd booed that night and booed Serena again in the final. Their father, Richard, alleged racist taunts from the crowd. Father and daughters vowed never to return.
 They have lived up to that promise, even as new WTA rules punish players who skip one of the tour's so-called mandatory events. The Williams sisters are sustaining injury to their world rankings, losing money from the bonus pool and must perform a day of tennis-related activity within 125 miles of Indian Wells -- or face a two-week suspension and a $75,000 fine.
 They remain undeterred. And Indian Wells, perhaps the most important tournament in the world that isn't a Grand Slam, goes on without them. 
 ''Something is missing,'' said Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, a 17-year-old semifinalist from Russia. ''With them, it's more of a show and there is more interest and a lot of big fights and good matches.''
 The tournament director, Steve Simon, makes certain that the Williams sisters, currently ranked Nos. 1 (Serena) and 5 (Venus) in the world, know they are welcome back at any time.
 ''We've made it clearly known, and will continue to, that we would love to have the girls back and we think the fans would love to have them back as well. In fact, we know they do,'' Simon said. ''We will continue to make sure that message is with them and, hopefully, there will be a day they decide they want to play.''
 Not that anyone holds out much hope for a rapprochement as Venus, 28, and Serena, 27, approach the twilight of their careers. Venus Williams this month told the news media in New York that she did not anticipate returning to Indian Wells.
 Indian Wells officials will not grovel, Simon said, to bring them back. ''I've never begged or pleaded for any player to be here,'' he said. ''I want people to play here because they feel good about being here.''
 Until 2001, Indian Wells and the Williams Sisters were good together. The tournament extended wild cards to the sisters when they were teenage prodigies living in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton. ''Serena won twice and Venus had some great successes here, too,'' said Simon, who has been with the tournament for two decades. ''This was a good tournament for them.''
 Seventeen of the world's top-20 ranked women played here this year, Simon said, the exceptions being the Williams sisters and the injured Maria Sharapova. ''No one player makes the difference between success and failure,'' Simon said, citing record attendance of 331,000 in 2008 and the potential for similar numbers this year, ''even in this economy.'' 
 But the women's competition has been less than scintillating. Jelena Jankovic and Elena Dementieva crashed out early. The top-seeded Dinara Safina, two victories away from supplanting Serena Williams as the world No. 1, melted down against the 19-year-old Victoria Azarenka in the quarterfinals.
 The semifinalists are the defending champion, Ana Ivanovic, and the lesser-known Vera Zvonareva, Azarenka and Pavlyuchenkova.
 But the tournament steams ahead, buoyed by keen competition on the men's side. Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martin del Potro and Andy Roddick, six of the top seven seeds, reached the final eight.

HEADLINE: If You Sell Wine, Then Let Me Sell Cheese

BYLINE: By MARCO PASANELLA. 
Marco Pasanella owns a wine store.

 BODY:
''DIO mio!'' exclaimed my father, Giovanni, over the phone. I had just informed him of Gov. David Paterson's proposal to allow New York grocery stores to sell wine. And I could practically see him reaching for the Chianti when, as the owner of a small wine shop in downtown Manhattan, I told him I thought it could actually be a good thing. 
 Thirty-five states already permit wine sales in grocery stores, and those states still have independent retailers. But the common wisdom persists that such a move will crush me, the little guy. Big-box retailers will use their superior buying muscle to force me and my fellow independents out of business. 
 This is definitely a fear, especially in a slowing economy. Much of our daily sales are moderately priced bottles, a category likely to be offered in grocery stores as well. And smaller suburban retailers may indeed have it tougher as shoppers opt for the convenience of having one fewer place to drive. 
 But I also see these proposed changes as a huge opportunity to serve our customers better while redressing outdated, irrational and inequitable laws. 
 New York's Alcoholic Beverage Control code, which has governed the sale of wine, beer and liquor since Prohibition was repealed in 1933, sometimes seems like a charmingly genteel relic of a bygone era, when buying wine for Sunday supper was regarded as the Devil's work. We still can't open before noon on the Sabbath. 
 I'm not bemoaning the loss of the Sunday breakfast crowd. But these proposals will bring increased competition, and it's only fair that there should be commensurate opportunities to expand our small businesses. If supermarkets can have multiple locations, why are we prohibited (pardon the pun) from operating more than one store? Or from keeping the same hours?
 If grocery stores can sell a Cotes du Rhone, then why shouldn't we be able to sell baguettes and cheese? How about artisan beer? Or just reusable shopping bags? (A Rochester store was recently fined a whopping $10,000 for doing this.) What goes for the grocery stores should go for us too.
 If the laws were truly fair, we independent retailers will have our own advantages. Big chains will have to buy big. And while your local supermarket pushes those same familiar bottles, independent stores will still provide substantially more selection and be better able to seek out smaller, even very limited producers, like the guy who makes just 40 cases a year of really good lambrusco. 
 Wine, after all, has always been more than just a floor-stacked commodity. A pleasure to be savored, a conduit for culture and the fastest way to bring people together that I know of, it's also hard to buy without trusted help. Come to us with a recipe for gnocchi with Gorgonzola, for example, and we will help you pair it with the perfect wine -- a nebbiolo from Italy's Langhe region, in this case. And we will know you by name. Try getting that from the teenager with the name tag and the vest.

HEADLINE: Giving and Taxes

 BODY:
Evidently, the rich still carry influence in Washington. President Obama's plan to cap itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers at a 28 percent rate flew like a lead balloon in Congress, reportedly sending the White House in search for other sources of revenue. 
 It would be a pity if the administration were to forgo that money -- some $320 billion over the next 10 years to finance a good share of its proposed health care reform. The money is needed. And the complaints that capping deductions would kill charity, decimate small business and put yet another nail in the coffin of the housing industry are wrong. 
 It is true that under the proposed changes, many affluent families would not be able to deduct as much for their mortgages, charitable contributions and the like, but that would not amount to very many people.
 The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, estimated that in 2011, when the changes would be due to take effect, only 1.8 million taxpayers -- 1.2 percent of the total -- would have their deductions reduced. Just 1.9 percent of taxpayers with income from a small business earn enough to be affected by the limits.
 The effect on housing would be small, too. According to the I.R.S., households earning more than $200,000 account for less than 8 percent of all taxpayers who claim a deduction on mortgage interest. Capping the mortgage interest deduction at 28 percent might nudge a high-income family to buy a cheaper home than it otherwise would. It is unlikely they would forgo a home. 
 And philanthropy is not facing extinction. A study by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University concluded that the combined effect of raising the marginal income tax rate, as the president proposed, and capping the deduction for charitable contributions would trim donations by about $4 billion in their first year -- 1.3 percent of the $306 billion donated in 2007. 
 Several studies point out that a large share of charitable donations is not deducted from taxes, and donors in lower tax brackets account for more than half of all contributions that are deducted. Fifty-two percent of respondents to a Bank of America poll of wealthy donors said their philanthropic donations would not change even if they could not write any of them off of their taxes. 
 For too long, American fiscal policy has been too afraid of taxation, too scared of Big Government and too prone to pursue policy objectives through gimmicky tax givebacks that tend to heavily benefit affluent taxpayers. In 2005, the panel on tax reform convened and ignored by former President George W. Bush suggested slashing the tax deduction on mortgage interest to recoup revenue and restore some equity to the tax system.
 Philanthropy is a good thing, but it is driven by the donors' tastes. It cannot replace the socially necessary investments that government needs to make. According to a study by the Center on Philanthropy, institutions of higher education took 29 percent of all donations of $1 million or more between 2000 and 20007. All other levels of education took 2 percent, about a third of the amount that was channeled to the arts.
 Mr. Obama is proposing a government that provides more security for Americans and invests in their long-term prosperity. That requires more money. Capping deductions for the 1.2 percent of Americans that are the most well-off is one good way to raise it.

HEADLINE: Auto Parts Suppliers May Get Aid

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Obama administration signaled its intent Thursday to provide broad relief to the American auto industry with the creation of a $5 billion fund to aid troubled parts suppliers.
 The financing from the Treasury Department for suppliers is the initial step by a presidential task force to stabilize the ailing industry, and could be followed by more bailout money for General Motors and Chrysler.
 One industry analyst said the program could mean members of the task force want to keep the automakers solvent and operating without the disruption of bankruptcy filings. 
 ''I am convinced they have decided that a major bankruptcy in this industry is not going to happen if they can help it,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 While attention has been focused mostly on loan requests by G.M. and Chrysler, the auto task force chose to first address the financial woes of the industry's extensive supplier network. A number of auto suppliers are on the verge of bankruptcy. Failures by those companies would shut down the flow of vital parts to automakers and almost immediately slow their production of new vehicles.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the $5 billion fund, drawn from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, would keep factories running while the industry undergoes a wider restructuring.
 ''The Supplier Support Program will help stabilize a critical component of the American auto industry during the difficult period that lies ahead,'' he said.
 More than 500,000 workers are employed by auto-supply firms in the United States. Many of those companies have been struggling to survive because of the financial problems of their biggest customers, most notably G.M. and Chrysler.
 G.M. and Chrysler have been subsisting on government loans since the beginning of the year.
 G.M. has so far received $13.4 billion in federal loans, and has requested up to $16.6 billion in additional financing. Chrysler, which has received $4 billion in loans, is asking for another $5 billion.
 The auto task force is expected to announce by March 31 whether it will extend more aid to the two Detroit companies, or possibly force them into government-managed bankruptcies. But the move by the Obama administration to assist suppliers to G.M. and Chrysler was seen as a sign that more help may be on the way for the beleaguered automakers.
 The supplier program will guarantee payments to parts firms for products already shipped to automakers. The funds will be funneled to suppliers through American auto companies that agree to take part.
 G.M. and Chrysler said Thursday that they would participate. ''This action can help reduce the risk of vehicle production disruptions,'' said Greg Martin, a G.M. spokesman.
 However, the Ford Motor Company -- which has not sought or taken government loans -- declined to join the program. ''Ford does not need to participate in the program, as we remain viable and expect no issue with continued payments to our suppliers,'' Ford said in a statement.
 The three Detroit automakers together buy about $5 billion worth of parts monthly, according to Ann Wilson, an executive with the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade group that represents hundreds of suppliers. About one-third of the group's members are in ''serious distress,'' Ms. Wilson said.
 Suppliers can qualify for aid for parts that are built in plants in the United States and sold to American automakers, in this case G.M. and Chrysler, according to administration officials who spoke on condition they not be named. The suppliers will get a government guarantee that money owed them by G.M. or Chrysler will be paid ''no matter what happens to the recipient car company,'' according to the Treasury statement.
 Participating suppliers will also be able to sell their receivables to the government for cash, which will increase their operating funds and also make it easier to borrow money on the private market. Many suppliers have been unable to get loans from private financial institutions that refuse to use receivables from G.M. and Chrysler as collateral.
 ''This is basically a lifeline that's not going to last terribly long,'' said Aaron Bragman of the auto forecasting firm HIS Global Insight. ''The biggest concern is the dramatic decline in revenues.''
 A weak economy and tight credit caused new vehicle sales in the United States to fall 18 percent in 2008. In the first two months of this year, sales plummeted 39 percent compared with the same period a year ago.
 With the supplier program in place, the auto task force is expected to soon announce its plans for G.M. and Chrysler.
 Assistance to G.M. and Chrysler may come in stages, rather than in a single aid package, administration officials said Thursday.

HEADLINE: Fragile Signs of Hope Emerging In the Gloom of Mugabe's Rule

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
On his first day as education minister in a government so broke that most schools were closed and millions of children idle, David Coltart said he got a startling invitation. 
 ''Come and get your brand-new white Mercedes,'' an official told Mr. Coltart, a veteran opposition politician, as President Robert Mugabe peered down from a portrait on the minister's office wall. 
 The offer of an E-Class Mercedes to every minister in the month-old power-sharing government was vintage Mugabe, an effort to seduce his political enemies with the lavish perks he has long bestowed on loyalists. 
 Mr. Coltart said no thanks. 
 Opposition members like Mr. Coltart who joined Mr. Mugabe in office last month have already achieved some successes, like getting teachers back to work and winning the release of some political prisoners. 
 But many of them warned in interviews that the progress would be short-lived if Western nations, meeting Friday in Washington to discuss expanding assistance, did not extend billions of dollars to rebuild Zimbabwe.
 Zimbabwe's main donors of emergency medical and food aid -- the United States, Britain and other European nations -- face a painful question posed by those pleas for more help. How do the wealthiest nations pump money into Zimbabwe's crippled economy without propping up Mr. Mugabe, feeding his patronage machine and extending his disastrous three decades in power?
 Before fully re-engaging with Zimbabwe's government, the donors have said they want to see the release of all political prisoners, the adoption of sensible economic policies, a halt to seizures of white-owned farms, and the restoration of a free press. But some diplomats here say hard-liners in Mr. Mugabe's old guard seem determined to sabotage the power-sharing deal and the infusion of Western aid that the public would credit to the newcomers, led by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change.
 The most critical test for Mr. Tsvangirai is whether he can deliver on his inaugural promise to pay the civil service in foreign currency -- particularly the police officers and soldiers who have enforced the repressive rule of Mr. Mugabe and his party, ZANU-PF, but whose pay in local currency is now worthless.
 Even some diplomats who were most skeptical about Mr. Tsvangirai's deal to govern with Mr. Mugabe, 85, now sense an opportunity to weaken ''the old man,'' as he is called here. 
 ''There's a creeping sense that we are in an endgame, that there is a new dynamic here,'' said one Western diplomat who spoke anonymously according to diplomatic protocol. ''Never before has the government been this prostrate. Never before has ZANU-PF been so weak or the opposition in office.''
 The opposition politicians say that they, too, sense an opportunity to loosen Mr. Mugabe's grip on power.
 Mr. Coltart's experience is a good example. He faces huge hurdles, not least the fact that his ministry's foul-smelling headquarters had no running water to flush toilets when he arrived. But he has coaxed most of the nation's teachers back to work with little more than a paltry $100 monthly allowance and the promise to try to give them more. 
 The sight of children in tattered uniforms walking to school has become another sign of encroaching normalcy -- along with affordable loaves of bread and well-stocked grocery shelves -- in a country ravaged by hunger, hyperinflation and cholera. 
 But the teachers' unions have warned Mr. Coltart that their members will soon stop working unless he can get them better salaries, akin to what the British, the United Nations and other donors are already paying to more than 20,000 doctors, nurses and other workers in Zimbabwe's collapsed public health system.
 ''If we don't get support for education in, literally, the next few weeks, there's a very real danger the teachers will leave in their thousands as they did last year,'' Mr. Coltart said. 
 Teachers at the Fungisai Primary School in Chitungwiza, a city south of Harare, the capital, say $100 a month does not come close to paying for the essentials: rent, clothing, food, school fees. Still, they seem hopeful.
 ''The government is broke, but it's better to have someone promising something better,'' said Mercy Manza, 38, a third-grade teacher and mother of two. ''Before, it was as if we didn't exist. They just ignored us.''
 The hyperinflation became so bad last year that the teachers' pay in Zimbabwean dollars was worth almost nothing. Many teachers emigrated to South Africa to work as maids or grape pickers. Mrs. Manza and Kudzayi Chivasa, 44, a widowed teacher, said they sold their clothes, plates and silverware to raise cash to feed their families.
 ''I went for a week in January without food,'' Mrs. Chivasa said.
 The teachers said their lives had gotten materially better this year. The Zimbabwean dollar has effectively died, and all goods are now priced in United States dollars and South African rand. With the lifting of price controls and some import restrictions, goods have flowed into the country and food staples cost less.
 The Fungisai school, a complex of single-story red brick buildings, was empty for months last year. All its 52 teachers are back, along with 2,200 neatly dressed children in royal blue uniforms.
 But the headmistress, Angela Katsuwa, doubts she can hold on to her staff unless they get a raise. ''I'm afraid they may go away,'' she said. ''They're grumbling because that $100 is not enough to take them to the end of the month.''
 The teachers are not the only ones challenged by poor pay. Every minister in the new government makes the same as a teacher -- or a janitor, for that matter. 
 Sitting in his 14th-floor office, with a sweeping view of Harare's skyline, Mr. Coltart took his crumpled pay stub out of his wallet. His earnings were 4,224 worthless Zimbabwean dollars and the voucher for $100. Mr. Coltart is a prominent human rights lawyer from Bulawayo who describes himself as ''completely self-funding at present.''
 Some new ministers, however, have devoted years to political activism in a country whose economy is crumbling. Diplomats here worry that Mr. Mugabe will exploit this vulnerability with his usual strategy of ''bait the hook.'' Many new ministers have accepted the Mercedes-Benzes that Mr. Coltart refused. 
 ''There's a very real danger our members and ministers could be sucked into the patronage system,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara, who is now driving an E280 Mercedes. ''Our members have to be vigilant and principled.''
 Eric Matinenga, one of Zimbabwe's most respected trial lawyers and the new minister of constitutional and parliamentary affairs, said he talked to others in the Movement for Democratic Change about taking a unified stand on the cars. ''I said, 'Look, how would we justify getting these luxury vehicles when there is a humanitarian crisis out there?' '' he said. ''To my disappointment, we were not able to come up with a single position.''
 Mr. Matinenga, who braved arrest and weeks in jail last year after representing victims of political violence, took a metallic green E-Class Mercedes. ''I know it's not a good excuse,'' he said, ''but will I make a difference if I turn this down?''
 Diplomats and local analysts say that despite some missteps the Movement for Democratic Change ministers, led by Mr. Tsvangirai and Mr. Mutambara, are standing up to Mr. Mugabe and demanding a say in how the country is governed.
 Finance Minister Tendai Biti is credited with taking control of economic policy from Gideon Gono, the Reserve Bank governor widely blamed for the profligate printing of money that drove inflation to astronomical levels.
 ''If Zimbabwe was a company, it would long ago have been liquidated,'' said Mr. Biti, a combative lawyer who was beaten and jailed on flimsy treason charges during his years in the political wilderness. ''If it was a human being, it would be brain dead.''
 Looming over them all is the old man. Mr. Coltart has not quite figured out what to do with the portrait of Mr. Mugabe hanging behind his desk. ''I'm thinking I'll find a more appropriate place,'' he said, ''where he's not looking over my shoulder.''

HEADLINE: Conversation About Economy Goes Into Late Night

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif. 

 BODY:
When late-night television features a sitting president, it's usually as material for a stand-up routine. But on Thursday, President Obama toppled another barrier when he tried to sell Jay Leno on his economic recovery plan.
 Mr. Obama held his own with the comedian, countering Mr. Leno's thrusts about the executive bonuses at the American International Group by saying that ''the only place where I think this might work is Hollywood.'' 
 Mr. Obama did not explicitly endorse the bill passed by the House on Thursday that would tax bonuses paid to those whose companies got large amounts of federal bailout money, saying ''the money's already gone out.''
 ''I think the best way to handle this is to make sure you've closed the door before the horse gets out of the barn,'' he said.
 When Mr. Leno asked whether someone should go to jail for the economic debacle, Mr. Obama replied, ''Most of what got us into trouble was perfectly legal.'' 
 White House officials said beforehand that Mr. Obama would not spend his whole time joking with Mr. Leno, particularly given the nation's economic woes. 
 It can be tough to be dignified though, when introduced by a stand-up comedian.
 ''A lot of people think it's amazing that the president would leave Washington and fly 3,000 miles to come out here,'' Mr. Leno said, ''but you know, that's what a lot of people do when their mother-in-law moves in with them.''
 For Mr. Obama, the appearance on ''The Tonight Show'' is something of a gamble. The president himself acknowledged earlier Thursday at a town-hall-style meeting in Los Angeles that he was getting some flack from critics who said he should be spending his time fixing the economy and not going on late-night television. 
 In his appearance with Mr. Leno, Mr. Obama walked a tightrope between projecting good humor and projecting a presidential air. For instance, he looked taken aback when Mr. Leno joked that the president had laid the problems of the banking sector at the doorstep of the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. ''I love how you say it's his problem,'' Mr. Leno said. 
 Mr. Obama stared at him for a few seconds, stone-faced. Then he broke into a laugh, as if finally getting the joke. 
 ''All of this is my responsibility,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I'm trying to break a pattern in Washington where everybody's always looking for someone to blame.''
 Mr. Obama's best line was a swipe at the Beltway crowd. ''In Washington, it's a little like 'American Idol,' except everybody is Simon Cowell,'' he said, referring to the ornery British judge on the Fox program.
 At the earlier session at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex in Los Angeles, President Obama returned to the populist theme that he has been striking all week, separating himself from Washington and Wall Street and seeking to identify his administration and its policies with struggling Americans.
 ''I know some folks in Washington and on Wall Street are saying that we should just focus on their problems,'' Mr. Obama said, before an audience of about 3,000 people that included California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. ''It would be nice if I could pick and choose what problems to focus on.''
 In a line that drew a standing ovation, Mr. Obama said, ''I did not run for president to pass these problems to the next generation. I ran for president to solve these problems for the next generation.''
 All week, Mr. Obama has been sounding the drumbeat for his $3.6 trillion budget and his economic recovery plan. The swing through California, which White House officials described as ground zero for the mortgage crisis, is meant to showcase what administration officials say are the benefits of Mr. Obama's proposals. 
 It has also been an opportunity for Mr. Obama to communicate directly with supporters, and, indeed, to get some love back, away from Washington. At each event he attended in California on Wednesday and Thursday, he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds, with thousands of people lining neighborhood streets in Pomona, Beverly Hills and downtown Los Angeles to watch his motorcade whiz by.
 This being California, the first question he got came from a woman who breathlessly asked what he planned to do about trans fats. ''If you burn that many calories asking a question, you'll be able to eat whatever you want,'' Mr. Obama joked. 
 ''No! Not trans fats!'' replied the woman, who identified herself as Patricia Zay.
 Mr. Obama assured her that he was seeking to put more money into the prevention side of health care, but ignored her question about whether he would push for a law that would ban the dumping of mercury into water.

HEADLINE: Many in Government Knew Weeks Ago About Huge A.I.G. Bonus Program

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JACKIE CALMES; Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The question was direct and prescient. Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, asked the Treasury secretary in an open hearing what could be done to stop American International Group from paying $165 million in bonuses to hundreds of employees in the very unit that had nearly destroyed the company. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, responded by saying that executive pay in the financial industry had gotten ''out of whack'' in recent years, and pledged to crack down on exorbitant pay at companies like A.I.G. that were being bailed out with billons of taxpayer dollars. 
 The exchange took place before the House Ways and Means Committee on March 3 -- one week before Mr. Geithner claims he first learned that the failed insurance company was about to pay a round of bonuses that have since caused a political uproar.
 A Treasury spokesman, Isaac Baker, said in a statement on Thursday night, ''Although Congressman Crowley raised the issue of the bonuses two weeks ago, Secretary Geithner was not aware of the timing or full extent of the contractual retention payments or the other bonus programs until his staff brought them to his attention on March 10.''
 Mr. Baker said that after Mr. Geithner had been briefed on the bonuses, he called Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of A.I.G., and ''insisted that they be renegotiated and restructured, in light of the extraordinary assistance being provided by taxpayers.''
 Mr. Baker added that Mr. Geithner ''takes full responsibility for not being aware of these programs before last week.'' 
 Interviews with senior Federal Reserve and Treasury officials, as well as members of Congress, leave little doubt that the bonus program was a disaster hiding in plain sight. Mr. Geithner is not the only one who appears not to have understood the populist fury the bonuses would set off.
 Career staff officials at the Treasury, Fed and Federal Reserve Bank of New York exchanged e-mail messages about the A.I.G. bonus program as early as late February, according to a person familiar with the matter. A.I.G. itself revealed the bonus plan in regulatory filings last September. 
 In November, when the bailout of A.I.G. was restructured, Treasury and Fed officials negotiated the terms under which A.I.G. could make the retention payments. And in December, Democratic lawmakers sought a hearing about the payments. 
 A.I.G., which incurred staggering losses through its sale of complex financial instruments tied to mortgage-backed securities, has received more than $170 billion in capital infusions, loans and credit lines from the federal government since last September, and is about to get $30 billion more. 
 A.I.G. executives have insisted that they informed the New York Fed about the bonus plan, and that they assumed the New York Fed was informing the Treasury. 
 Treasury officials have suggested that the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington failed to alert the Treasury staff until March 5. And Fed officials said that they not only alerted the Treasury staff weeks earlier, but discussed the issue with them via e-mail.
 Despite the interagency discussions in February about A.I.G.'s ill-starred bonus plan, as well as Mr. Geithner's exchange on the matter in a hearing, Mr. Geithner continued to insist on Thursday that he had not really understood the magnitude of the bonuses until one week ago.
 ''I was informed by my staff of the full scale of these specific things on Tuesday, March 10,'' Mr. Geithner said in an interview with CNN on Thursday. ''As soon as I heard about the full scale of these things, we moved very actively to explore every possible avenue -- legal avenue -- to address this problem.'' 
 As early as December, two Democratic lawmakers had vociferously and repeatedly complained about the bonuses, and one of them went so far as to demand the resignation of A.I.G.'s chief executive. 
 But both Mr. Geithner, and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, were preoccupied at the time with multiple crises. The nation's banks were reeling from as much as $2 trillion in mortgage-related losses. The recession was deepening and unemployment was soaring.
 Mr. Bernanke's team at the Fed and Mr. Geithner's team at Treasury, moreover, were reluctant to impose what they viewed as ''punitive'' and possibly self-defeating pay restrictions on companies being bailed out.
 In early February, Mr. Geithner opposed a provision in the economic stimulus bill that would have slapped a steep tax on the kind of bonuses that A.I.G. was about to pay. 
 If A.I.G.'s plan to pay out an additional $165 million in bonuses came as a surprise to Mr. Geithner, it did not come as a surprise to staff at the Treasury, the Federal Reserve in Washington or the New York Fed.
 Staff at all three agencies had been in daily communication with each other about A.I.G. ever since the Fed agreed to lend the company $85 billion in September in exchange for almost 80 percent of the company. 
 In late November, after A.I.G.'s plight became worse and the Treasury jumped in with a $40 billion capital infusion, the three agencies negotiated cuts in bonuses and salaries for many of the company's top executives. 
 Officials at the New York Fed carried out the most direct oversight of A.I.G., and they were well aware of the coming bonus payments, said a person familiar with the matter.

HEADLINE: Why Flogging A.I.G. Isn't Solving the Underlying Problem

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
Can we all just calm down a little?
Yes, the $165 million in bonuses handed out to executives in the financial products division of American International Group was infuriating. Truly, it was. As many others have noted, this is the same unit whose shenanigans came perilously close to bringing the world's financial system to its knees. When the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said recently that A.I.G.'s ''irresponsible bets'' had made him ''more angry'' than anything else about the financial crisis, he could have been speaking for most Americans.
But death threats? ''All the executives and their families should be executed with piano wire -- my greatest hope,'' wrote one person in an e-mail message to the company. Another suggested publishing a list of the ''Yankee'' bankers ''so some good old southern boys can take care of them.''
Or how about those efforts to publicize names of individual executives who received bonuses -- efforts championed by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. To what end? 
How does outing these executives fix skewed compensation incentives, which have created that unjustified sense of entitlement that pervades Wall Street? No, it's mostly about using subpoena power to satisfy the public's thirst for blood. (In light of the death threats, when Mr. Cuomo received the list of A.I.G. bonus recipients on Thursday, he promised to consider ''individual security'' and ''privacy rights'' in deciding whether to publicize the names.)
Then there was that awful Congressional hearing on Wednesday, in which A.I.G.'s newly installed chief executive, Edward Liddy, was forced to listen to one outraged member of Congress after another rail about bonuses -- and obsess about when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner learned about them -- while ignoring far more troubling problems surrounding the A.I.G. rescue.
Oh, and let's not forget the bill that was passed on Thursday by the House of Representatives. It would tax at a 90 percent rate bonus payments made to anyone who earned over $250,000 at any financial institution receiving significant bailout funds. Should it become law, it will affect tens of thousands of employees who had absolutely nothing to do with creating the crisis, and who are trying to help fix their companies.
Meanwhile, the real culprits -- like Joseph J. Cassano, the former head of A.I.G.'s financial products division-- are counting their money in ''retirement.'' Nobody on Capitol Hill seems much interested in getting that money back. (And the bill does nothing about bonuses that were paid before 2009, meaning that most of those egregious Merrill Lynch bonuses, paid at the end of last year, will not be touched.)
By week's end, I was more depressed about the financial crisis than I've been since last September. Back then, the issue was the disintegration of the financial system, as the Lehman bankruptcy set off a terrible chain reaction. Now I'm worried that the political response is making the crisis worse. The Obama administration appears to have lost its grip on Congress, while the Treasury Department always seems caught off guard by bad news.
And Congress, with its howls of rage, its chaotic, episodic reaction to the crisis, and its shameless playing to the crowds, is out of control. This week, the body politic ran off the rails.
There are times when anger is cathartic. There are other times when anger makes a bad situation worse. ''We need to stop committing economic arson,'' Bert Ely, a banking consultant, said to me this week. That is what Congress committed: economic arson.
How is the political reaction to the crisis making it worse? Let us count the ways.
IT IS DESTROYING VALUE During his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Liddy pointed out that much of the money the government turned over to A.I.G. was a loan, not a gift. The company's goal, he kept saying, was to pay that money back. But how? Mr. Liddy's plan is to sell off the healthy insurance units -- or, failing that, give them to the government to sell when they can muster a good price.
In other words, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to position A.I.G. as a company with many profitable units, worth potentially billions, and one bad unit that needs to be unwound. Which, by the way, is the truth. But as Mr. Ely puts it, ''the indiscriminate pounding that A.I.G. is taking is destroying the value of the company.'' Potential buyers are wary. Customers are going elsewhere. Employees are looking to leave. Treating all of A.I.G. like Public Enemy No. 1 is a pretty dumb way for a majority shareholder to act when he hopes to sell the company for top dollar.
IT IS, UNFORTUNATELY, BESIDE THE POINT Even on Wall Street this week, I didn't hear anyone condoning the A.I.G. bonuses. They should never have been granted, and Mr. Liddy should have been tougher about renegotiating them. (A rich irony here is that any nonfinancial company in A.I.G.'s straits would be in bankruptcy, and contracts would have to be renegotiated. The fact that the government is afraid to force A.I.G. into bankruptcy, despite its crippled state, is the main reason Mr. Liddy felt he couldn't try to redo the contracts.)
But there is a much bigger issue that has barely been touched upon by Congress: the way tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money has been funneled to A.I.G.'s counterparties -- at 100 cents on the dollar. How can it possibly make sense that Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and every other company that bought credit-default swaps from A.I.G. should be made whole by the government? Why isn't it forcing them to take a haircut?
What's worse, some of those companies are foreign banks that used credit-default swaps to exploit a regulatory loophole. Should the United States taxpayer really be responsible for ensuring the safety of European banks that were taking advantage of European regulations?
The person who has made this point most forcefully is Eliot Spitzer, of all people. In his column for Slate.com, he wrote: ''Why did Goldman have to get back 100 cents on the dollar? Didn't we already give Goldman a $25 billion cash infusion, and aren't they sitting on more than $100 billion in cash?'' Mr. Spitzer told me that while ''there is a legitimate sense of outrage over the bonuses, the larger outrage should be the use of A.I.G. funding as a second bailout for the large investment houses.'' Precisely.
IT IS DESTABILIZING How can you run a company when the rules keep changing, when you have to worry about being second-guessed by Congress? Who can do business under those circumstances?
Take, for instance, that new securitization program the government is trying to get off the ground, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility -- or TALF. Although it is backed by large government loans, it requires people in the marketplace -- Wall Street bankers! -- to participate.
This program could help revive the consumer credit market. But at this point, most Wall Street bankers would rather be attacked by wild dogs than take part. They fear that they'll do something -- make money perhaps? -- that will arouse Congressional ire. Or that the rules will change. ''The constant flip-flopping is terrible,'' said Simon Johnson, a banking expert who teaches at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Business.
A.I.G. offers another good example. Not all the employees who face the possibility of having their bonuses taxed out from under them work for the evil financial products division. Many of them work in insurance divisions. Very few of them pull down million-dollar bonuses, and none of them brought A.I.G. to its knees. (And employees who bought the company's stock are already hurting financially, having seen its value virtually wiped out.) They are the ones the company badly needs to keep if it hopes to sell those units at a healthy price. Taking away their bonuses -- after they've already put the money in their bank accounts -- hardly seems like the right way to motivate them. And demonizing them in Congressional hearings doesn't help either.
In previous columns, I have been an advocate of nationalizing big banks like Citigroup. But after watching Congress this week, I'm having second thoughts. If this is how Congress treats A.I.G., what would it do if it had a bank in its paws?
What the country really needs right now from Congress is facts instead of rhetoric. Instead of these ''raise your hand if you took a private jet to get here'' exercises of outraged populism, we need hearings that educate and illuminate. Hearings like the old Watergate hearings. Hearings in which knowledge is accumulated over time, and a record is established. Hearings that might actually help us get out of this crisis. It's happened before. In 1932, Congress established the Pecora committee, named for its chief counsel, Ferdinand Pecora. It was an intense, two-year inquiry, and its findings -- executives shorting their own company's stock, for instance -- shocked the country. It also led to the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other investor protections. One person who has been calling for a new Pecora committee is Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, a Republican and key member of the Senate Banking Committee.
''As we restructure our regulatory system, we need to be thorough,'' he told me. ''We need to understand what caused it. We shouldn't rush it.''
Meanwhile, the House Financial Services Committee has scheduled a hearing on Tuesday featuring Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner. The hearing has been called to find out only one thing: what did the two men know about the A.I.G. bonuses, and when did they know it?
Is that Nero I hear fiddling?
Correction: March 24, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption with the Talking Business column on Saturday, about public indignation over bonuses at the American International Group, misidentified the building behind a group of protesters in Manhattan on Thursday. It is the Deutsche Bank headquarters at 60 Wall Street -- not the A.I.G. headquarters. (A.I.G. has offices nearby at 160 Water Street.)

HEADLINE: A Face-Off for Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- This city has become a front line in a generational battle for jobs, as older workers increasingly compete against applicants in their 20s for positions at supermarkets, McDonald's and dozens of other places. And older workers seem to be winning.
With unemployment at a 26-year high and many older workers chasing entry-level jobs like those they held a half-century ago, 70 has become the new 20, as one economist put it.
Millions of older Americans have delayed retirement because of plummeting 401(k)s, soaring health costs, a sense that Social Security benefits alone are too little to live on or all of the above. This delay, economists say, has made it harder for millions of young workers to climb onto the first rung or two of the career ladder, especially since many employers favor hiring applicants with a track record.
''The boomers are staying in the system longer, and that's clogging the system,'' said Mason Jackson, president of Workforce One, a federally funded agency that helps Broward County's unemployed. ''Many want to retire, but they can't.'' 
He characterized the dominant attitude among employers now as: ''In with the old and out with the new.''
Along the ocean beaches and the Intracoastal Waterway here, retirees in condominiums have long coexisted with a much younger generation, but in the depressed job market, tensions have swelled as each group complains that employers improperly favor the other.
Since losing his job as a carpenter 13 months ago, Arnold Stone has applied, without success, for jobs as diverse as grocery bagger and construction worker. In his mobile home one recent morning, Mr. Stone, 69, tanned and vigorous, displayed hundreds of resumes.
''I'm sure age comes into play,'' he said. ''The problem is with seniors, nobody wants to hire them.''
That same week, Farah Titus, 25, crisscrossed Broward County in her 11-year-old Toyota on her daily job search. She pointed out a J. C. Penney store, a Macy's and a Wal-Mart where she has applied to no avail.
''It's hard to break in,'' said Ms. Titus, a part-time nursing student who said she hated asking her father for money. ''If you have experience, they put you on the top of the pile.''
The latest reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics buttress her view. The number of employed workers ages 16 to 24 has fallen by two million over the last two years, to 18.3 million, while the number of Americans 65 and over who are working has risen by 700,000, to 6 million.
''In a bad labor market, different groups perceive that they're being discriminated against when the real problem is they're being mistreated by the overall economy,'' said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School of Social Research and author of ''When I'm Sixty-Four.''
The proportion of older Americans who hold jobs has also risen strongly -- 16 percent of Americans 65 and over had jobs last month, up from 11 percent 10 years earlier. But for workers age 16 to 24 the percentage with jobs has fallen to 49 percent, from 59 percent a decade ago. As for Americans age 25 to 29, 74 percent now have jobs, down from 81 percent a decade ago.
''Younger people are taking an extreme pounding,'' said Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. ''It's worrisome because they're not developing the experience and the soft skills that they'll need and the nation's economy will need.''
The greatest employment losses, he said, are for young males with little or no college. Many found jobs when the economy was robust, but they were often laid off first in the downturn, and they are having an especially hard time landing jobs now.
''I'm applying for low-wage jobs, and anyone should be O.K. for them, but I'm not getting to first base,'' Jose Nieves, 19, said of the restaurant jobs he has applied for.
But many older workers say they suffer age discrimination, too. Mr. Stone is convinced that employers favor the young because they want to make sure their investments in training pay off for years to come.
Mr. Stone said he wishes he could retire but his retirement savings have nearly disappeared. He invested heavily in Enron before it went bankrupt, and his wife has had sizable medical bills.
''I need a job because at the end of the month, I'm lucky if we have $450 left,'' said Mr. Stone, who worked 20 years as a carpenter and once even owned a construction company.
''People say there is no work to be had,'' he added. ''But if you're over 50, you really have a problem, and if you're 70, it's especially hard.''
Eva Coffey, 60, from Springfield, Va., said that when she applied for a job as a bookkeeper and receptionist for an auto dealer, her interviewer showed no interest. The next person to be interviewed, she said, was an attractive woman in her 20s, and the interviewer was keenly interested.
''I'm not some young thing,'' Ms. Coffey said. ''When you go for an interview now, you're always trying to come across younger because they're concerned about your age. It's a hard obstacle to overcome.''
Federico Barker, 76, a former real estate developer, has applied for so many jobs unsuccessfully that his friends urged him to lie about his age and change dates on his resume. They are certain that employers favor younger workers.
Mahalia Joseph, 21, disagrees. She lost her job at a check-cashing company four months ago and has been rejected repeatedly for jobs in customer service and at hospitals.
''With the economy the way it is, they don't want to hire people they have to train,'' said Ms. Joseph, who plans to take courses to be trained as a hospital assistant. ''They want people who are hands-on right away.''
Every day, young and old job seekers swarm to Mr. Jackson's Workforce One offices, searching computer databases for jobs. Employers see strengths and weaknesses in each group, he said.
''Many businesses prefer older workers,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''They know they're dependable, reliable. They show up, and somewhere along the line, developed customer service skills. Older workers take less sick days. Most sick days have nothing to do with being sick. Many nice days people call in sick to go to the beach.''
One category where young people have an advantage is technology jobs, he said. ''If it's a technology job, young people take to it as fish to water,'' he said.
One of his assistants, Kelly Allen, chimed in that young people were used to communicating electronically -- she held up an imaginary Blackberry and maneuvered her thumbs wildly. ''Employers like that older workers are used to dealing with people face to face,'' she said.
Maria Brous, communications director for Publix, one of Florida's largest supermarket chains, said older workers had important expertise, but younger workers had technical skills and were creative problem-solvers. Publix hires both young and old employees, she said, because they complement each other.
Wendy Smith, 23, says she has seen yet another type of discrimination in applying for administrative jobs. Potential employers tell her she needs three or four years of experience.
''They don't want you to be too young, and they don't want you to be too old,'' she said. ''They want you to be just right.''

HEADLINE: While Mr. Perry and Mr. Jindal Fiddle

 BODY:
Republican governors who have been threatening to refuse federal aid rather than sensibly expand state unemployment insurance programs are putting ideology ahead of the needs of their constituents.
The two most prominent grandstanders -- Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana -- should listen to lawmakers and taxpayers in their own states who are demanding that they do what's best for their most vulnerable citizens. 
Or if that's not enough, they should look at what other sensible governors -- both Democrat and Republican -- are doing throughout the rest of the country: accepting the aid as a lifeline for pulling their states and the country out of desperation.
The unemployment portion of the federal stimulus package offers generous support to the states. To accept it, these states must make two reasonable changes in their unemployment insurance law. They must expand eligibility requirements that bar too many low-income workers from receiving compensation. And they must choose from a menu of options that include extending benefits to part-time workers and those who leave jobs because of family emergencies.
The claim by some governors that the unemployment aid would lead directly to tax increases has also been discredited. New taxes are triggered automatically when unemployment trust funds fall below specified levels. In many cases, filling their coffers with stimulus aid would actually postpone tax increases. When the stimulus money is spent, states would also be free to revert to the old unemployment insurance laws.
In Texas, Governor Perry's decision to reject the money has sown considerable anger in the State Legislature. A House committee urged the full Legislature to overturn the governor's decision. Lawmakers acted after seeing projections that the state unemployment fund was on track to run out of money in the fall, which would drive up taxes. Meanwhile, Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina now says that he won't accept $700 million in education money unless he can use it to pay down debt.
The time has clearly passed for posturing. With large numbers of people losing their jobs, Mr. Jindal and Mr. Perry need to do what is best for their states and their struggling workers.

HEADLINE: As Rodriguez's Hip Heals, a Ski Town Shrugs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
VAIL, Colo. -- It was a sleepy afternoon here when a black sport utility vehicle pulled up to a casual Italian restaurant. Alex Rodriguez, seeker of rehabilitation and rejuvenation, was one of three men who hopped out.
Without crutches or a limp, he walked inside La Bottega, a block from the Vail Valley Medical Center, where he recently had an operation on his hip.
''Hi there,'' Rodriguez greeted a person who approached him in the restaurant. 
His demeanor changed as he realized the pen and pad belonged not to an autograph-seeker but to a reporter, who identified himself and asked Rodriguez how the healing process was proceeding.
Rodriguez lifted his hands in feigned frustration and walked briskly by. He sat to eat -- chicken penne was his selection for lunch -- then left through a side exit.
Rodriguez hardly stands out in this winter resort, which draws any number of celebrities for its world-class skiing and any number of athletes seeking repair at the medical center's renowned Steadman Hawkins Clinic.
In fact, Rodriguez's stay in Vail has produced a collective shrug, at least from those who live and work here. In Vail, he is more than a mile high and nearly 2,000 miles away from the turbulence he continually creates in New York. Just this week, he raised eyebrows from Brooklyn to the Bronx with his off-the-wall, on-the-mirror photo spread for Details magazine. But in Vail, who cared?
The focus here is on the wobbly economy and its effect on an area where tourism is crucial. Nearly half of the town seems as if it is under construction, with cranes reaching higher in the sky than almost any current building. But much of the expansion was started before the economy started its downturn. What the future holds is unclear.
Meanwhile, celebrities like Rodriguez file in and out of town, impermanent parts of the landscape.
''It's not to say people don't know them,'' Mayor Dick Cleveland said. ''But celebrities are very comfortable here because they enjoy it without undue harassment.''
As such, Rodriguez is largely free to perform his rehabilitation away from the scrutiny of the news media, notwithstanding the encounter in the restaurant.
And as far as the rehabilitation goes, it is proceeding well, said Dr. Marc Philippon, the orthopedic surgeon who operated on Rodriguez's torn labrum.
''Actually, he's ahead of schedule,'' Philippon said Wednesday. ''He's a very disciplined athlete, very easy to work with. So far, we don't have any curveballs.''
Philippon said that within a half-hour of the surgery, which was performed March 9, Rodriguez was riding a stationary bike, the normal procedure for Philippon's patients in order to regain confidence and muscle memory.
For now, Rodriguez is limited to pool work and motion exercises that include hip rotations that simulate a swing. The rehabilitation is conducted in a separate part of the clinic.
''He already has better range of motion than he had before,'' Philippon said.
Rodriguez is scheduled to be here for about a month. It is expected that he will return for another surgical procedure after the season to correct underlying problems in the hip.
In his published studies, Philippon and others have written that 93 percent of professional athletes on whom he performs hip surgery return to action at their prior level of play or higher.
Philippon left the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center four years ago to set up shop at the clinic. It is on the third floor of the medical center and can double as a memorabilia trove. Inscribed jerseys, photographs and other athletic paraphernalia drape every shelf and wall, thank-yous from athletes who had their operations here.
''There are a lot of great places, but we get our fair share of people,'' said Dr. Richard Steadman, the chief medical officer for the United States ski team. He estimates that he has performed 20,000 knee procedures, including one on Kobe Bryant in 2003. It was during his stay here that Bryant had an encounter with a female hotel employee that led to the filing of a sexual assault charge against him. The charge was later dropped and a civil assault filed by the woman was settled out of court.
Steadman heads a team of nine surgeons at the clinic. Philippon's expertise is arthroscopic hip surgery. He came to the United States from Canada to attend Florida Atlantic University on a soccer scholarship. He credits the golfer Greg Norman for propelling his career by allowing his own hip procedure to be broadcast live over the Internet in 2000.
On Wednesday, Philippon apologized to a reporter and a photographer after they were left waiting in his office. He had to tend to Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner, who was in an adjacent room to have X-rays on his left hip, which had been operated on the day before to repair a torn labrum.
''In sports medicine, these hip injuries that we see, we're just starting to understand them better,'' Philippon said. ''Most of them, we're finding, have very, very predictable treatments for them now, and it helps these athletes get better and have longer careers.''
Professional athletes are not the only patients here. Cheryl Jensen, 47, had both hips operated on by Philippon in a three-month span. She skied three weeks after the second surgery.
''The fact that you could get back to some activity that quick is pretty remarkable,'' Jensen said.
Not everyone left Philippon as satisfied. Katie Sanchez, a former ballerina, sued Philippon in Florida, contending that her 1997 hip surgery went awry. A Broward County jury ruled in her favor and awarded her $2.15 million; Philippon said his liability was less than $1 million.
Philippon does not have a record of such suits. Because the Sanchez case is on appeal, he said, he could not discuss the case.
The interview ended so that Philippon could get back to work. Amid the snow and the slopes, there were more hips to fix. In Vail, Rodriguez is just part of the crowd.

HEADLINE: Financial Shares Lead the Market Down

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Stocks dropped on Friday as investors worried about the consequences of efforts on Capitol Hill to claw back bonuses from firms that received government bailouts.
Financial shares pulled down the broader markets, giving back many of their gains from earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.42 points, or 1.65 percent, to 7,278.38, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 15.5 points, or 1.98 percent, to 768.54. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 26.21 points, or 1.77 percent, to 1,457.27.
On Thursday, the House of Representatives responded to growing furor over bonuses at the American International Group by passing a bill that would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses awarded this year by companies that received $5 billion or more in bailout money. The Senate is expected to take up its version of the bill next week. 
Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp all declined. Bank of America fell 74 cents, 10.68 percent, to $6.19; JPMorgan Chase dropped $1.80, or 7.21 percent, to $23.15; while U.S. Bancorp lost 84 cents, or 5.89 percent, to $13.42.
But investors appeared to applaud a shuffle in management at Citigroup, lifting shares 2 cents, or 0.77 percent, to $2.62, after the bank named a new financial chief and put its current chief financial officer in charge of its Citi Holdings unit, a division the bank created to hold toxic assets and other businesses it plans to sell.
Shares of General Electric fell 59 cents, or 5.82 percent, to $9.54, a day after G.E. held a five-hour meeting to try to assuage concerns about its financial arm, GE Capital. As the credit crisis has deepened, the company has cut its dividend and lost its triple-A credit rating, and it is facing questions about whether it needs to raise more capital.
Even a speech by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was not able to break Wall Street out of its malaise. In recent weeks, stock indexes have surged after remarks from Mr. Bernanke.
On Friday, Mr. Bernanke told a gathering of community bankers that some of the Fed's measures to attack the financial crisis were taking hold, and called for smarter regulation of the financial system.
At the same event, Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, again warned that it would lose about $65 billion over the next five years because of bank failures, in addition to $18 billion from last year. She said the declining insurance fund was likely to fall further.
Gains earlier in the week lifted some of the major indexes from their lowest point in some 12 years. For the week, the Dow rose less than 0.8 percent, while the S.& P. 500 gained 1.6 percent, and the Nasdaq jumped 1.8 percent. The weekly gains, coupled with a surge in the S.& P. 500 last week, represented Wall Street's first two-week winning streak since the beginning of 2009.
The S.& P. 500 is down 14.91 percent for the year, while the Dow Jones industrials are off by 17.07 percent and the Nasdaq by 7.59 percent.
Corners of the financial market that reacted sharply to the Federal Reserve's plans to buy $1 trillion in securities unwound a bit on Friday. The dollar gained back some ground against the euro and the yen, and gold and oil prices fell back.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 101. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.63 percent, from 2.6 percent Thursday.

HEADLINE: Aid for Solar Firm Is First From 4-Year-Old Program

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
The Energy Department has tentatively awarded its first alternative-energy loan guarantee, breaking a four-year logjam in the federal loan program.
 The $535 million guarantee will go to Solyndra Inc., which said it would use the money to expand its production of photovoltaic panels at its facilities in Fremont, Calif. The company said the guarantee would cover about 75 percent of the project costs and would ultimately produce thousands of construction, manufacturing and installation jobs. 
 Once the panels are installed and producing power, the company said, they will generate up to 15 gigawatts of electricity and save 300 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
 The loan guarantee, which is still subject to final legal and financial approvals, comes under a slow-moving program originally authorized by Congress in 2005. The application process has been hindered by bureaucracy, including lengthy reviews of hundreds of applications for more than $40 billion in loan guarantees.
 But the newly installed energy secretary, Steven Chu, has made it a priority to begin releasing the guarantees to help meet the administration's twin goals of creating jobs and developing carbon-free sources of power.
 ''This investment is part of President Obama's aggressive strategy to put Americans back to work and reduce our dependence on foreign oil by developing clean, renewable sources of energy,'' Dr. Chu said in a statement on Friday. ''We can create millions of new, good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced. Instead of relying on imports from other countries to meet our energy needs, we'll rely on America's innovation, America's resources and America's workers.''
 The department is moving quickly to complete reviews of dozens of other projects and expects to announce financing decisions in coming weeks, officials said. The loan guarantee program is intended to provide money for advanced energy projects, nuclear fuel and power plant work, energy efficiency programs and new power transmission technologies. The program is also supposed to finance work on so-called clean coal technologies and projects to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.
 Chris Gronet, the founder and chairman of Solyndra, said the guaranteed funding ''will enable Solyndra to achieve the economies of scale needed to deliver solar electricity at prices that are competitive with utility rates.'' He added, ''This expansion is really about creating new jobs while meaningfully impacting global warming.''
 The company's photovoltaic panels are meant for installation on commercial industrial rooftops and lay flat rather than on an angle. The company has been shipping panels since last July.
 Senator Jeff Bingaman, the Energy Committee chairman, has been pressing the Energy Department since passage of the 2005 law to release the financing guarantees. ''After years of watching this program struggle to get off the ground,'' he said, ''it's encouraging to see that Secretary Chu's energetic new leadership at the department is having an effect.''

HEADLINE: A Full House For Bands And Fans At SXSW

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
Music still has fans. That's the annual affirmation at the South by Southwest Music Festival, known as SXSW, a music conference and staging ground for some 1,900 acts that brings platoons of clubgoers downtown here every spring -- some paying up to $695 for an official registration badge, others freeloading at the many unofficial parties and showcases that give bands multiple chances to perform during the festival's four most frenetic days. 
 While CD sales topple, and major and indie labels struggle, at this year's 23rd annual SXSW people have been turned away from packed clubs where they are clamoring to see bands that are far from household names: Grizzly Bear, Peter Bjorn and John, St. Vincent. Full houses chanted along to indie hip-hop and pondered broken hearts and God to the picking of Americana bands. Those musicians draw their audiences from people who chase down music in the news media, in blogs and on noncommercial radio stations -- or maybe from a friend's recommendation or a giveaway on a music downloading site. 
 Although the conference does not release attendance figures until after it's over, its managing director, Roland Swenson, has said that there are fewer paid registrations this year. 
 One factor is the general economic downturn and, in particular, the dwindling of record-company expense accounts as labels continue to cut costs and shed jobs, although recordings are only part of a music business that also involves touring, merchandising, publishing, sponsorships and licensing. 
 Any dip has been imperceptible among the throngs on East Sixth Street or Red River, the two main strips of clubs in downtown Austin. At SXSW, the music business reminds itself that people do actually care enough about music to seek it out. The clubs are crowded, partly because the festival sells passes that cover all the showcases, encouraging an all-you-can-hear approach. (Labels and publishers have resisted a similar subscription model for selling recordings, although there are online subscription services for streaming playback.) 
 Many of the fans in the clubs have most likely heard their chosen bands via free downloads, legal or illegal; there are legal ones for many of the SXSW bands at www.sxsw.com. But as the music business is coming to understand, the ancient model of the touring troubadour may turn out to be the 21st-century model for a working musician's livelihood. 
 And there are plenty of bands still ready to jump in a van, sleep on couches, set up their own equipment and play three shows a day for a chance to be noticed. They no longer expect to be handed ''the standard rich-and-famous contract,'' as one musician put it, but perhaps they'll find a booking agent, an impromptu interview or a new fan with a clever idea for a T-shirt design. 
 SXSW isn't just for unknowns and lesser-knowns. It pulls older bands out of mothballs; this year the lineup includes the Sonics, Devo, Echo and the Bunnymen, Primal Scream and the Memphis soul band the Bar-Kays. Meanwhile, with just about every media organization that covers music in town, well-known current bands are eager to use SXSW as a marketing springboard. The multimillion-selling Metallica, promoting its tie-in with the video game Guitar Hero, was due to play a not-so-secret show on Friday night at Stubb's BBQ.
 On Wednesday, the music festival's opening night, the Decemberists introduced their new album, ''The Hazards of Love'' (Capitol) -- an hourlong, uninterrupted rock opera and fable about love and murder -- by playing it from start to finish for a full house at Stubb's and an NPR Web cast, which can be downloaded free from npr.org. 
 The music segued from delicate, Celtic-folk-rooted ballads to stomping, 1970s-flavored riff-rock and back, as the Decemberists' songwriter, Colin Meloy, portrayed both the album's romantic hero and its sociopathic villain. Becky Stark from Lavender Diamond and Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond sang the female characters. Parts of the music were too delicate for the boisterous SXSW crowd, but the music held up as a coherent structure, with passages that grew stronger each time they recurred. 
 Grizzly Bear, whose album ''Veckatimest'' (Warp) is due for release on May 26, had an ideal place -- the resonant Central Presbyterian Church -- to perform its new songs on Thursday night. They are otherworldly meditations that dissolve from a handful of pensive, open-ended lyrics into wordless, rapturous vocal harmonies that floated through the hushed room. 
 Another superb New York band, Dirty Projectors, introduced songs from its next album, ''Bitte Orca'' (Domino), due in June, including the dizzying, pointillistic vocal mesh of a song called ''Remade Horizon'' that can be heard at npr.org. 
 Big Boi, half of the Atlanta hip-hop duo OutKast, was less generous with new material in his quick-rhyming, upbeat set on Thursday night. His long-delayed first solo album, ''Sir Luscious Left Foot,'' is now due for release in June or July, he announced. But he devoted most of the set to OutKast songs, only unveiling one new track, ''Backup Plan,'' and his verses of a song that also has other rappers on it, ''Royal Flush,'' which was just leaked online. 
 SXSW has positioned itself as a one-stop opportunity to make contacts across the American music business, and it has had a steadily increasing presence for bands from abroad. This year there were 594 international acts at official showcases.
 One startling British import was Micachu and the Shapes, a trio of former music school students who love bare-bones structures. Mica Levi's terse, choppy songs for the group use dissonant guitar chords, hardheaded lyrics, a swinging drumbeat, perky keyboard hooks and contrapuntal cowbells, among other things, for songs with the ebullience of a skiffle band and the hardheadedness of hip-hop.
 Other international arrivals included Blk Jks (pronounced Black Jacks), a South African band that mingles brisk, triplet-driven, African-rooted rhythms with eruptions of neo-psychedelic guitar and echoey vocals, reminiscent of American progressive rock like the Mars Volta. Oh Land, a Danish trio suggesting Bjork leading the Pointer Sisters, sang about frostbite and earthquakes with synchronized moves and odd hats.
 Not that American bands were scarce, whether they were playing revved-up, post-punk Minimalism, like Abe Vigoda, from Los Angeles, or Dylanesque Americana, like Elvis Perkins in Dearland (leaning toward rockabilly and gospel) and the Portland band Blitzen Trapper (applying new-wave concision to the sound of the Band). Groups like those can look forward, if they're lucky, to careers on the road, perhaps with an occasional windfall from placing a song in a soundtrack or a commercial. But on a beery Austin night in a packed club, that can sound like enough. 
 The South by Southwest Music Festival continues through Sunday; www.sxsw.com.

HEADLINE: New Honda Takes On The Prius

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The road is about to get a little more crowded for the Toyota Prius. Starting Tuesday, the Honda Motor Company will offer American consumers what it bills as ''the world's first affordable hybrid.'' 
 Costing just shy of $20,000, the Honda Insight promises to let drivers respond to both of the leading crises of our day: the environment and the recession. 
 If the Insight's introduction in Japan is any indication, Toyota should be worried. The car went on sale here on Feb. 6, and orders have soared, reaching 18,000 in just the first three weeks -- topping Prius's current sales. In fact, the Insight pushed Prius out of the top-10-selling cars for February.
 ''I have people asking about hybrids that I never had before,'' said Tsuguhito Tokita, a Honda dealer in Tokyo. ''With this price, it's easy to recommend to anyone.'' 
 If Honda makes inroads in the United States, the world's largest market for hybrids, it could force the market leader, the Toyota Motor Corporation, to bring down its prices. Japanese news media have reported that Toyota, which controls 70 percent of the American hybrid market, will introduce a cheaper hybrid model with a smaller engine in 2011 -- in part, reportedly, because of the Insight's success.
 Sales of hybrids have been hit hard by the global economic crisis. After several years of strong growth in Prius sales, Toyota had virtually no increase in 2008 from the previous year, as the overall auto market struggled.
 ''In the short term, it's a very difficult sell,'' said Christopher Richter, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at CLSA. ''We've entered into a very deep recession, and consumers aren't keen on buying new cars. Fuel prices have plunged, with fuel so cheap people don't care much about it.''
 But so far the Insight has been a bright spot for Honda in an otherwise dismal year of plunging sales that have led the automaker to make painful cutbacks and give up its prized Formula One racing team.
 Toyota plans to lower the sticker price of the Prius, according to Japan's largest business daily, Nikkei. The automaker has refused to confirm the report.
 ''But I can tell you we're not satisfied with the current state,'' said Paul Nolasco, a Tokyo spokesman for Toyota, which has sold one million Prius vehicles since their introduction a decade ago. ''The Insight's popularity is evidence that the public is recognizing hybrid technology.''
 The market for hybrids could be headed for a huge expansion. The development of cheaper technology, economies of scale and more government subsidies for environmentally friendly vehicles could take what was a niche technology into the mainstream.
 A bigger market for hybrids could also ensure that they stay the green vehicle of choice over full electric or hydrogen cars, which remain prohibitively expensive. A report released by J. P. Morgan in October predicted that the global market for hybrids ''will rise exponentially'' to 9.6 million in 2018 from 500,000 units in 2007-- and the current economic slump will not significantly slow that rise, the authors said.
 The Insight could bring about a big turnaround for Honda, which tried selling hybrids for a decade without much success. In fact, it discontinued a previous Insight model in 2006, believing consumers found hybrids too expensive. But when sales of Toyota's Prius rose as oil prices spiked, Honda quickly changed course.
 Behind the less expensive Insight is an aggressive cost-cutting effort, as well as technological sacrifices.
 Instead of the more complicated hybrid system used in the Prius, the Insight's main source of power is a lightweight gasoline engine that is assisted by smaller batteries. That greatly reduces manufacturing costs, but gives the Insight lower fuel efficiency than the Prius -- 43 miles per gallon on the highway compared with 45 miles per gallon for the Prius. The Insight also shares parts with other Honda models, which helps the carmaker keep costs to a minimum.
 Honda has also struck a chord with an overhaul of the car's shape. One reason its previous hybrids failed to take off, analysts say, was that they did not come in distinctive shapes. 
 ''A lot of people who drive hybrids want to make the statement, 'I am driving a hybrid,' '' Mr. Richter said. 
 But Honda's new Insight looks remarkably like -- well, Toyota's triangular Prius, which has become synonymous with hybrid technology. Analysts say that should help sales.
 The global economic slowdown could be an advantage for the Insight, at least over the Prius.
 ''Several years ago, the Prius would have won hands down,'' Mr. Richter said. ''But when you've got a raging recession, you come down to the question: Do you want the fancier car with greater fuel economy, or the one that still has pretty good economy, allows you to be seen driving hybrid, and is cheaper?''
 ''The Insight could steal a lot of Toyota's thunder,'' he said.
 Whatever the outcome of the new hybrid race, it is certain to reinforce the dominance of Japanese automakers in eco-friendly cars. Unlike their American counterparts, Japanese automakers have long made energy efficiency a priority, teaming up with Japan's electronics conglomerates to develop high-powered batteries.
 In 1996, Toyota and Matsushita, now Panasonic, formed a joint venture to produce nickel-metal hydride batteries for hybrid cars. It plans to produce a million batteries a year by 2010. The venture also plans to make more powerful lithium-ion batteries.
 Honda, which gets its batteries from Panasonic and Sanyo, has also invested heavily in battery production, setting up a company with a battery maker, GS Yuasa, to produce lithium-ion batteries. That move came partly because Honda was nervous about obtaining batteries from the same company as its archrival, Toyota. The greater capacity would allow Honda to introduce hybrid versions of its other models.
 A string of auto companies worldwide, from Ford to start-ups like Tesla Motors, have announced or introduced hybrids, plug-ins or electric cars. Others are hurrying research into fuel cells and other alternatives. A technological breakthrough could still turn the market on its head, analysts say.
 But for now, only Toyota and Honda have invested the money to mass-produce the mainstay batteries at a scale that makes economic sense. Batteries are still expensive to develop and produce, and kinks in the technology remain, as demonstrated by a string of flare-ups involving Sony-made lithium-ion laptop batteries three years ago.
 ''Other companies just don't have a mass-production setup yet,'' said Kohei Takahashi, a Tokyo-based auto analyst for J. P. Morgan. ''They might be able to come up with hybrids, but they're too expensive.''

HEADLINE: For Rangel, a Complicated Relationship With A.I.G.

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As Congress moved this week to levy a 90 percent tax on the $165 million in bonuses paid to executives of the American International Group, one of the more conspicuous expressions of outrage came from Representative Charles B. Rangel. 
 As public anger over the bonuses surged, Mr. Rangel on Wednesday introduced a bill that would seize most of the bonuses paid to A.I.G., which received billions in taxpayer bailout funds.
 ''Dreams have been shattered and homes have been lost because a small group of executives were motivated by greed rather than preserving a system that America and the world depend upon,'' said Mr. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat and chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. 
 After the measure passed the House overwhelmingly the next day, Mr. Rangel congratulated his colleagues on their bold action, saying that A.I.G. executives ''have gotten away with murder in what they've done to our communities.'' 
 But Mr. Rangel's indignation was a reversal of his position earlier in the week, when he opposed heavily taxing the bonuses and warned his colleagues to restrain themselves from allowing the public outcry to warp their judgment. 
 What is more, the congressman's relationship with A.I.G. is a complicated one; as recently as last year, he was trying to woo the company to donate $10 million to a school to be named in his honor. And while A.I.G. officials mulled the request, Mr. Rangel supported a provision in a tax bill that saved the company millions of dollars. 
 For decades, Mr. Rangel has been a close friend of Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of A.I.G. until 2005, and until recently one of the company's biggest shareholders. Mr. Greenberg has sponsored fund-raisers on Mr. Rangel's behalf, and in 2007, a foundation controlled by Mr. Greenberg gave $5 million to the school, the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. 
 City College records show that the effort by Mr. Rangel and college officials to persuade A.I.G. to donate to the school went on for two years. In a 2007 e-mail message obtained by The New York Times, City College's director of development, Rachelle Butler, wrote that Mr. Rangel suggested in early 2006 that fund-raisers concentrate on A.I.G. for a contribution. Two years later -- on April 21, 2008 -- Mr. Rangel attended a meeting at A.I.G. to ask the company to support the school, without specifically discussing a donation.
 A month later, as A.I.G. was still considering a financial contribution, the top executive who had attended the fund-raising meeting wrote a letter to Mr. Rangel, urging him to support a provision of a tax bill that would save A.I.G. millions of dollars a year. 
 Mr. Rangel dropped his opposition to the tax measure, which eventually became law. But he has said that City College's request for the $10 million, and the letter from A.I.G., played no part in his decision. A colleague in the New York delegation, Representative Joseph Crowley, said that he was responsible for persuading Mr. Rangel to support the tax change. A.I.G. has never donated to the Rangel Center.
 But with Mr. Rangel's personal finances and fund-raising for City College now the subject of an ethics investigation, some Republicans questioned whether Mr. Rangel's public protestations about the bonuses were designed to eclipse his connections to the company over the years. 
 Representative John Carter, a Republican of Texas, described Mr. Rangel, who had received $110,000 in campaign donations from A.I.G, as one of several Democrats who had ''exchanged legislative favors'' with the company. 
 Mr. Rangel's spokesman, Matthew Beck, has said that the chairman has never given A.I.G. any preferential treatment. Mr. Rangel declined to be interviewed for this article, but in a written statement, he said that he decided to support the heavy tax on A.I.G. bonuses because the company's financial missteps had caused such expensive and widespread damage to American consumers and taxpayers.
 ''When you weigh the harm that A.I.G. and other bad actors have done to the system, our economy and American families, with the concerns regarding the precedent of using the tax code, there is no question this legislation is the best decision we can make,'' he said. ''It is not enough to say, 'You can't do anything about it.' We have to do something about it.''

HEADLINE: Government Auctions Off 605 Diamonds With a Past

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
It is not so easy these days buying what the government is selling. One could argue that this holds true for low-yielding Treasury bonds and economic forecasts alike.
 Some government commodities, though, are not only simple to obtain -- they are actually priced to sell: Items seized during federal crimes, for instance, like the 605 loose diamonds that were auctioned off on Friday beneath the crystal chandeliers in the Grand Ballroom of the New Yorker Hotel.
 While crime does not always pay the criminal, it does, in circumstances such as these, pay the government, the auction house and -- if he or she can wangle a bargain from the process -- the buyer, too. 
 ''Whatever economic climate you're in, there's always opportunity,'' said Rick Levin, a Chicago auctioneer who brought the diamonds to market after they were seized in 2003 from two Manhattan jewelers in a sting operation that was devised to combat money-laundering for Colombian drug cartels. 
 His diamonds, sold on behalf of the federal Department of the Treasury and divided into more than 100 lots, -- had once belonged to Roman and Eduard Nektalov, a father-and-son team who sold gems in diamond district in Manhattan and were targets of Operation Meltdown, a federal investigation into the laundering of drug money. In 2003, the two men, members of a prominent family of Bukharian Jews, were arrested after trading the stones to an undercover agent for $500,000 cash. 
 Within months, Eduard Nektalov was shot point-blank in the back of the head as he walked up Avenue of the Americas between 47th and 48th Streets. Roman Nektalov, his father, was convicted in the money laundering case months later.
 The noir-ish story, though, with all its gruesome details, was scarcely mentioned as dozens of buyers -- many of them Hasidic and Bukharian Jews who work in the diamond trade -- filtered into the ballroom of the New Yorker, at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue. The auction itself began at 10:15 a.m. when Rob Nord, a professor of bid calling at the Missouri Auction School (''The Harvard of Auctioneering''), started with Lot 1: four diamonds varying in weight from 1.1 to 1.4 carats.
 ''I brought my plastic,'' said Mandy Ellis, who had flown in from Dallas, where, she said, she ''dealt in a little real estate.'' Ms. Ellis had come to spend money -- ''Whatever Saks didn't get from me yesterday,'' she said. 
 Terrence Byrne, a retired city bus driver, had driven in from Queens, because, as he put it, ''I dropped a bundle in the market and I need a good investment.'' Next to him was his wife, Julia, who reminded him they had also come to buy a diamond for her 25th wedding anniversary gift. (Mr. Byrne bought Lot 8, a 2.6-carat diamond, for $5,500.)
 The Kodak brothers, Brad and Creighton, own a chain of three jewelry stores in northern New Jersey and had come in search of a deal. ''We're here for real value,'' Creighton Kodak said. (They left when Lot 6 was on the block, deciding that the prices were, in general, too steep.)
 Since most of the money flows back into government coffers to investigate further criminal schemes, Mr. Levin -- a quick-talking salesman type -- suggested there were patriotic, as well as financial, aspects to the sales.
 Mr. Levin, who, on average, takes a 10 percent cut from his auctions, has been very busy of late. In the last few years alone, he has sold for the government smuggled horses in Arizona, stolen cab medallions in Boston, 54,000 pounds of smoked Chinese scallops, a shipping container of blue jeans, illegally marketed Freon and a million packs of untaxed cigarettes. 
 Tapping what could be a growing market, Mr. Levin recently secured a contract with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to auction furniture, fixtures and equipment seized from failed banks around the country.
 As Mr. Nord droned on in his Gatling gun baritone, four tuxedoed ''ringmen'' prowled the ballroom whooping loudly when they spotted a bid. By the end of the day, the auction brought in nearly $750,000. Mr. Levin turned philosophical -- and somewhat self-promotional. 
 He was saying that with so many inscrutable toxic assets on the market these days the opportunity to purchase hard items, in an open setting, was refreshing.
 ''Auctions are the best way known to mankind to buy and sell things,'' he insisted. ''There's a real-time ability to actually know what something's worth.''

HEADLINE: Layoff Survivor's Duty To the Less Fortunate

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
One of the signature emotions of this particular recession, besides the populist rage that boiled over this week, is a bit of survivor's guilt.
 After all, if you still have the same job or salary that you had a year ago, you're among the lucky ones. With a different career move or two, you might have wound up among those whose household income has suffered a huge hit. You probably have friends and former colleagues in this unfortunate spot.
 So what can you do to help them? Plenty, it turns out.
 The impulse is to open your Rolodex, suggest a few names and leave it at that. But there is so much more that you can do, including helping out with baby-sitting or getting their home in shape for sale, that will provide a lift without making people feel like a charity case. 
 Here are a bunch of ideas, organized by seven categories. There is also call for additional ideas from you, which I'll explain more fully at the end, about the tricky subject of when, if ever, you actually open your checkbook to offer financial assistance.
 TWEETS There are still plenty of people who don't have an online profile who could benefit from one, especially if they are now looking for work. If you can help them create a personal Web site or a more professional Facebook page, that's a true gift. You can also teach them how to use LinkedIn (and let them connect with anyone from your contact list that they'd like to meet) or other online networking tools like Plaxoor Doostang. Jeremy Epstein runs Never Stop Marketing, a consulting firm that helps clients like Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson with what he calls ''community driven marketing.'' He's also helping unemployed and underemployed friends and acquaintances understand the power and the challenge behind the concept. 
 ''Right now, everyone has a channel, like Facebook or Twitter,'' he said. ''But they don't realize that they need a compelling storyline to their channel. What are you going to inform me about? Why would I come to you?'' He suggests considering the three things you're most passionate about and then building your comments or the links that you post on your social networking profiles around those, so others come to see you as an expert or a witty commentator on the topics. 
 Justin Pruszynski Bacon, a software solutions specialist in Minneapolis whose last work contract ended in October, has taken Mr. Epstein's advice and intends to use Twitter, as well as comments and guest posts on the blogs of others, to try to establish a following. One mistake, Mr. Epstein told him, might be to jump in too quickly with his own blog in an attempt to establish his personal brand. 
 ''Jeremy talks about the blog graveyard. So many people start and then bail, and that wasn't the way I wanted to present myself online,'' he said. 
 DESKS For friends who no longer have an office, simply inviting them in to use your fancy copier or offering to run off resumes for them can be a kind gesture (as long as it won't get you into any trouble). 
 Kate Hartnick Elliott, who runs a marketing, communications and executive search firm in New York City, lets people she knows use a spare desk, the Internet access and the printer in her office. She said it's nice for people to have a place, other than Starbucks, to take a break between meetings. 
 LINKS Most people wouldn't hesitate to make an introduction or two to anyone in need. But Amy Baker, who works in technology marketing in San Francisco, says that if you've ever been out of work yourself, you have almost a moral obligation to throw the rope back for others. 
 ''One of the best pieces of advice I got was that you have to be talking to someone who's been through it,'' said Ms. Baker, who was unemployed for part of 2008. ''As someone who's been there, I have to reach out to people who are there now. I know how hard it is, and I know it will work out.'' 
 Her list of ways she tries to help contains many good ideas, like signing up for unemployment before doing anything else and devoting part of each day to something you couldn't do while working, like taking a nap or seeing a matinee. I've posted it in its entirety and linked to it from the version of this article at nytimes.com/yourmoney. 
 You can also help by taking a friend or former colleague to an industry gathering that they might not know of. Religious congregations are also ready-made communities that are predisposed toward service and good works. If you're still employed, take the lead and start a networking group for those who aren't. Or, you could reach out via the organization's mailing list to solicit volunteers, say a local appraiser who can offer free appraisals to members in need who are trying to refinance their mortgages. 
 PATRONAGE Given the shortage of full-time positions, many people are setting up consulting practices or starting small businesses while continuing their job search. One way you can help is by becoming a customer.
 This is what David Blackburn, who lives in Montclair, N.J., did for his friend and neighbor Josh Crandall. Mr. Crandall lost his information technology job at Morgan Stanley in November. At the time, he had a Web business on the side called The Clever Commute, which helps people who commute to New York City from the suburbs communicate with one another by e-mail about delays on buses and trains. 
 Mr. Crandall quickly decided to try to turn the site into a business that could earn real money through advertising and the sale of traffic and transit information to local media. ''Dave consistently pings me with ideas, about which messages he thinks are good, about the advertising placements and the frequency,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''He also introduced me to a networking group that's all about the nexus of advertising and technology.''
 The Clever Commute is now up to 5,500 participants. 
 PLAYDATES Mr. Blackburn lends a hand in other ways as well. He and his wife sometimes look after the children of friends for a few hours. For Mr. Blackburn's family it means a playdate, but for their friends it's an opportunity to search for their next job. 
 The help is probably most useful on a weekday, since that's the best time to make calls and attend meetings. Nights and weekends help too, though, since it can give weary parents the opportunity to decompress at the movies or brainstorm at a cafe. 
 MAC AND CHEESE (HOMEMADE) Friends who are struggling financially almost always appreciate dinner invitations, but it's probably wise to save the wild Alaskan salmon and your best bottle of wine for another night. 
 ''A lavish dinner feels like a celebration -- and what exactly are we celebrating?,'' Nancy Vineberg, a marketing and strategy consultant in Boston whose start-up business has been hard hit by the economic turmoil, wrote in an e-mail message. ''It may make a person feel even more depressed about not being able to shop at Whole Foods. But a nice home-cooked meal just makes someone feel included, taken care of and grateful to have nice food and companionship without the cost of a dinner out.''
 REMODELING Some of the people you know may need to sell some valuables to raise some quick cash. If you're an experienced eBay user or seller, you might be able to help them get the best price.
 If things get truly desperate, or they need to move to improve their career prospects, they'll need to put their home up for sale as quickly as possible and position it to sell fast, too. Can you move some of their clutter into your basement so their home shows better? Can you help them stage the house in other ways, by lending furniture or bedding or offering to pitch in on painting or other touchups?
 FINANCIAL AID The trickiest part of helping those who have seen their incomes fall is figuring out when, or whether, to help with a loan or a gift of money. Is this something you'd do only for family? Or never for family but anonymously for a neighbor who has fallen on hard times?
 And if you're thinking of giving money to friends, would you wound their pride by even suggesting it? Would it be easier if the offer came from a group and not an individual? Or should you simply wait for them to ask?
 The answers to these questions deserve their own column, which I'll put together soon. If you've been in this situation yourself, on either side, I'd be grateful if you could post a comment to the version of this article at nytimes.com/yourmoney. 
 Please send a copy of your comment to rlieber@nytimes.com as well. I'll feature some of the most thoughtful ideas here in the next couple of weeks.

HEADLINE: Anger Mismanagement

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The recent unpleasantness of our economic unraveling has caused me headaches. Not so much because I was losing my shirt, but because I thought I was losing my mind. Credit-default swaps, derivative products, securitized mortgages. Say what? It feels as though I've stumbled into a Mensa meeting. 
 All the tumult is couched in a jumble of jargon that is confusing and infuriating. In laymen's terms, the financial industry gambled and lost. This damaged the economy. And if we don't save Wall Street, the world will implode. 
 Meanwhile, the worlds of many Americans are already imploding. People are being forced to seek modifications for their underwater mortgages, watch retirement savings whither and choose between medicine and meals. It's a mess.
 Still, we have to give multibillion-dollar bailouts in return for multitrillion-dollar deficits. Argh!
 Then came the opprobrium of the A.I.G. bonus imbroglio. Employees in the division of the American International Group that caused much of the problem were paid $165 million in bonuses. This I fully understand. And me no likey. 
 The very idea of these bonuses has an acerbic affect on my American psyche. It is an insult to the basic rule of fairness. So my simmering anger finally has a target. I'm unapologetically, deliriously, cathartically belligerent about it.
 I know that there are bigger, more pressing concerns. I know that these bonuses are a mere pittance relative to the bailouts that A.I.G. has received. In fact, if A.I.G.'s bailouts totaled $100, these bonuses would amount to less than a dime. I know all this, yet I don't care. I want that dime back to restore my faith in fair play.
 I'm not alone. According to a Gallup poll released on Wednesday, 59 percent of Americans said that they were outraged over the bonuses (26 percent more said that they were bothered), and 76 percent said that they believed that the government should try to block or recover the bonuses.
 And, could we please forgo the cacophonous symphony of political recriminations? Everyone's complicit: Republicans have never liked limiting executive pay. The Obama administration stepped in to strip a provision from the stimulus bill that would have blocked these bonuses. And the Democratic Congress passed it.
 Just fix it.
 Congress is now seeking to ''claw back'' the bonuses by taxing them into oblivion. Nice try. I don't know if it'll work or hold up in court, but anything involving clawing sounds good.
 Keep working on a solution, but stop trying to manage and manipulate our anger. Stop trying to squelch, mollify and exploit it. Just let it run its course. America needs this moment.
 We don't expect you to understand Main Street anger, but we do need to register it. After all, we know that there's no Main Street in Washington.

HEADLINE: Sugar Is Back on Food Labels, This Time as a Selling Point

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
Sugar, the nutritional pariah that dentists and dietitians have long reviled, is enjoying a second act, dressed up as a natural, healthful ingredient.
 From the tomato sauce on a Pizza Hut pie called ''The Natural,'' to the just-released soda Pepsi Natural, some of the biggest players in the American food business have started, in the last few months, replacing high-fructose corn syrup with old-fashioned sugar. 
 ConAgra uses only sugar or honey in its new Healthy Choice All Natural frozen entrees. Kraft Foods recently removed the corn sweetener from its salad dressings, and is working on its Lunchables line of portable meals and snacks. 
 The turnaround comes after three decades during which high-fructose corn syrup had been gaining on sugar in the American diet. Consumption of the two finally drew even in 2003, according to the Department of Agriculture. Recently, though, the trend has reversed. Per capita, American adults ate about 44 pounds of sugar in 2007, compared with about 40 pounds of high-fructose corn syrup. 
 ''Sugar was the old devil, and high-fructose corn syrup is the new devil,'' said Marcia Mogelonsky, a senior analyst at Mintel International, a market-research company. 
 With sugar sales up, the Sugar Association last year ended its Sweet by Nature campaign, which pointed out that sugar is found in fruits and vegetables, said Andy Briscoe, president of the association. ''Obviously, demand is moving in the right direction so we are taking a break,'' Mr. Briscoe said.
 Blamed for hyperactivity in children and studied as an addictive substance, sugar has had its share of image problems. But the widespread criticism of high-fructose corn syrup -- the first lady, Michelle Obama, has said she will not give her children products made with it -- has made sugar look good by comparison. 
 Most scientists do not share the perception. Though research is still under way, many nutrition and obesity experts say sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are equally bad in excess. But, as is often the case with competing food claims, the battle is as much about marketing as it is about science.
 Some shoppers prefer cane or beet sugar because it is less processed. High-fructose corn syrup is produced by a complex series of chemical reactions that includes the use of three enzymes and caustic soda. 
 Others see the pervasiveness of the inexpensive sweetener as a symbol of the ill effects of government subsidies given to large agribusiness interests like corn growers.
 But the most common argument has to do with the rapid rise of obesity in the United States, which began in the 1980s, not long after industrial-grade high-fructose corn syrup was invented. As the amount of the sweetener in the American diet has expanded, so have Americans.
 Although the price differential has since dropped by about half, high-fructose corn syrup came on the market as much as 20 percent cheaper than sugar. And it was easier to transport. As a result, the sweetener soon turned up in all kinds of products, including soda, bread, yogurt, frozen foods and spaghetti sauce. 
 But with sugar newly ascendant, the makers of corn syrup are fighting back. Last fall, the Corn Refiners Association mounted a multimillion-dollar defense, making sure that an advertisement linking to the association's Web site, sweetsurprise.com, pops up when someone types ''sugar'' or ''high-fructose corn syrup'' into some search engines.
 In one television advertisement, a mother pours fruit punch into a cup while another scolds her because the punch contains high-fructose corn syrup. When pressed to explain why it is so bad, the complaining mother is portrayed as a speechless fool.
 Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association, said consumers were being duped.
 ''When they discover they are being misled into thinking these new products are healthier, that's the interesting angle,'' Ms. Erickson said in an interview.
 Although researchers are looking into the effects of fructose on liver function, insulin production and other possible contributors to excess weight gain, no major studies have made a definitive link between high-fructose corn syrup and poor health. The American Medical Association says that when it comes to obesity, there is no difference between the syrup and sugar.
 And, Ms. Erickson added, the Food and Drug Administration considers both sweeteners natural. 
 Dr. Robert H. Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco Children's Hospital, said: ''The argument about which is better for you, sucrose or HFCS, is garbage. Both are equally bad for your health.'' 
 Both sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are made from glucose and fructose. The level of fructose is about 5 percent higher in the corn sweetener. 
 Dr. Lustig studies the health effects of fructose, particularly on the liver, where it is metabolized. Part of his research shows that too much fructose -- no matter the source -- affects the liver in the same way too much alcohol does. 
 But all of that is irrelevant to some food manufacturers, who are switching to sugar as a result of extensive taste testing and consumer surveys.
 ''For consumers, their perception is reality,'' said Jim Sieple, a senior vice president for Log Cabin syrup, a 120-year-old brand in the Pinnacle Foods Group that this month announced it had stopped using high-fructose corn syrup. 
 Sugar's comeback is not entirely a backlash against the corn sweetener. Market researchers say that with the economy so unsettled, people want to control what they can. Choosing organic, less processed or so-called natural foods is a relatively inexpensive way to do that.
 ''Rightly or wrongly, that means consumers are more attracted to sugar,'' said Kevin Higar, senior manager at Technomics, a market research company.
 Chefs and connoisseurs have also driven sugar's rehabilitation. Although even a sugar expert would be hard pressed to tell the difference between the taste of cane and beet sugar, some enthusiasts have elevated cane sugar to near cult status. 
 The Coke that is made from sugar for Jews who avoid corn during Passover has become so popular among cane-sugar fans that some stores have taken to rationing it.
 At Jason's, a chain of delis with 200 restaurants in 27 states, cane sugar has replaced high-fructose corn syrup in everything except a few carbonated beverages. ''Part of this is a huge rebellion against HFCS,'' said Daniel Helfman, a spokesman for the chain, ''but part of it is taste.''
 To researchers and nutritionists who study obesity and the effects of sugar on the body, the resurrection of sugar is maddening. 
 Pat Crawford of the Center for Weight and Health at the University of California, Berkeley, remembers when sugar was such a loaded word that cereal makers changed the name of products like Sugar Pops to Corn Pops. 
 Even though overall consumption of caloric sweeteners is starting to drop, Dr. Crawford says an empty calorie is still an empty calorie. And it does not matter whether people think sugar is somehow ''retro,'' a word used to promote new, sugar-based versions of Pepsi and Mountain Dew called Throwback. 
 ''If people really want to go back to where we were, that means not putting sugar in everything,'' she said. ''It means keeping it to desserts.''

HEADLINE: Washington Chorus Will Shut Down

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The Master Chorale of Washington, a 42-year-old group that performed at the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1971, will shut down in May, The Washington Post reported. Virginia Austin Schubert, the chairwoman of the chorus's board, said in a statement that the group, which has recently been unable to cover its operating costs through ticket sales and donations, had lost a significant part of its investments in the economic downturn. The chorus is scheduled to perform Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' at its final concert on May 17. ... The Children's Theater Company in Minneapolis, one of the country's leading children's theater groups, said it would have to resort to a combination of salary cuts, wage freezes and job reductions for its 2010 fiscal year, The Star Tribune reported. This year the troupe's artistic director and managing director have already taken salary cuts of 3 percent, and the group has eliminated four jobs and reduced four full-time positions to part-time.

HEADLINE: Stronger Euro Threatens Weak Economy in Europe

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After a brief respite, the euro is again gaining strongly against the currencies of its main trading partners, further threatening the Continent's wilting economy. That is adding to pressure on the European Central Bank for radical steps similar to those that are weakening the dollar, pound and Swiss franc. 
 A rising currency typically damps demand for exports, an important component of growth. That in turn slows production in factories, with collateral effects on related industries and on jobs. 
 Since the start of the month, the euro has gained by 7.8 percent against the dollar, 4.7 percent against the pound and 3.1 percent against the franc. 
 Despite falling a touch on Friday, the euro still posted its biggest weekly gain of the year against the dollar, trading at $1.3582 late in New York.
 Jean-Michel Six, chief European economist at Standard & Poor's, forecasts that the euro will push through $1.60 by the end of September and pass the parity level against the pound about the same time. 
 ''If the euro keeps rising, it will be really grim news for the euro economy, which is already in very bad shape,'' said Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.
 Even before the recent rally, exports from the 16-country euro area had been decimated. During 2008, the region recorded a trade deficit of 32.1 billion euros in contrast to a surplus of 15.8 billion euros in 2007. 
 The value of exports from Germany, the world leader in manufactured goods, fell more than 20 percent in January, the sharpest drop in 16 years. Industrial production in the zone has fallen for five consecutive months.
 The main reason for the currency's rise, analysts said, is that central banks in the United States, Britain and Switzerland are taking radical steps to increase the amount of dollars, francs and pounds in circulation to try to revive lending. But their actions, known as ''quantitative easing,'' also carry inflationary risks. 
 The European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, has chosen not to follow this path for now.
 ''All eyes are on Frankfurt,'' said Jim O'Neill, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in London. ''Foreign exchange markets are sensing that there's a new game unless they do something more to facilitate a weaker euro.''
 There are now some signs of discontent from policy makers, who fear that the European economy is bearing a disproportionate burden in the global adjustment that is under way.
 One euro-area finance ministry official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the falling pound could soon start to cause distortions in Europe's own internal market, if cheap British goods started winning market share in the euro-zone and in outside markets.
 ''It could become a substantial problem,'' he said.
 The European Central Bank has room still to lower its benchmark interest rate, which at 1.5 percent is the highest among the Group of 7 industrialized nations. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have lowered their key rates to close to zero and the Bank of England's is at 0.5 percent. 
 But the other central banks, and the Swiss, have also said that they will purchase government bonds in an effort to reduce long-term interest rates and revive economic growth. With higher rates, and less prospect of an inflationary expansion of money supply, investors have chosen to shift into euro-area assets, especially rock-solid German government bonds.
 As long as the E.C.B. does not follow the actions of the others, ''it's beggar thy neighbor for the euro,'' Mr. de Grauwe said. ''When your house is on fire, you don't just stand back and watch.''

HEADLINE: Post Office Acting to Reduce Losses

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Battered by economic woes, the United States Postal Service is offering early retirement to 150,000 workers, cutting management positions and closing offices, the agency said Friday. 
 The service lost $2.8 billion last year and is facing even larger losses this year, despite a rate increase -- to 44 cents for first-class mail -- scheduled to take effect May 11.
 The agency said it would reduce management staff nationwide by 15 percent, with more than 1,400 processing, supervisor and management posts at 400 facilities being eliminated.
 Another 150,000 postal workers will be offered early retirement.
 The agency also made early retirement offers last year, but unions discouraged their members from accepting them, and they were not widely used. The post office did not say if the new proposal would include financial incentives.
 The American Postal Workers Union issued a statement Friday saying, ''Retirement is a personal matter, and the union defers to the decisions of employees who meet the qualifications.''
 But the union said it continued to challenge the Postal Service's authority to offer voluntary early retirement without including severance pay.
 The post office's 80 districts across the country will be reduced by six, with the closings in Edison, N.J.; Lake Mary, Fla.; North Reading, Mass.; Manchester, N.H.; Erie, Pa.; and Spokane, Wash.
 District offices handle administrative functions, and officials said the closing should not affect local mail delivery. The closings were expected to take about five months.
 The first quarter of the fiscal year -- October through December -- is usually the post office's busiest, but it still posted a loss of $384 million for the period.

HEADLINE: An Overreaction to A.I.G. Bonuses?

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
 Re ''House Approves 90% Tax on Bonuses After Bailouts'' (front page, March 20) and ''At A.I.G.'s Helm, Facing the Storm'' (front page, March 19):
 Having watched coverage of Edward M. Liddy's testimony, I am having a hard time understanding how our representatives in Congress can get any real work done. They seem to want to micromanage the chief executive put in place at the American International Group. 
 Our elected leaders need to stop falling over one another to declare their outrage and instead start focusing on passing programs that will help get our economy back on track. Nothing productive can be accomplished if this sideshow continues. 
 Is it unpleasant to see these bonuses paid? Sure. Is it reason to stop working on real issues facing our country? Certainly not.
 Hilda Blair New York, March 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The grandstanding members of Congress who questioned Edward M. Liddy on Wednesday ignored the substance of his testimony. He told the subcommittee that the bailout of A.I.G. is going well (the company's exposure to its calamitous bad bets has been reduced from $2.7 trillion to $1.6 trillion). He made a management decision that reneging on A.I.G.'s contractual commitments to the people who are trying to work A.I.G. out of this disaster -- made long before he got there -- would be detrimental to the effort.
 Mr. Liddy has more experience running businesses than all the politicians in the room put together. He came out of retirement to help save our nation and the world from the disaster that would be A.I.G.'s collapse. He is working for a dollar a year. His judgment was entitled to thoughtful study, if not the benefit of the doubt. Instead, he got vitriolic abuse from Republicans and Democrats alike.
 Mr. Liddy is a hero who deserved better treatment from our representatives.
 Bill Mullin Minneapolis, March 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The bill to tax A.I.G. employees is indicative of the venom and frustration felt by many Americans. But A.I.G. entered into legally enforceable contracts with individuals who have not been convicted, or even charged, with wrongdoing. Years from now, history will view this extraordinary act as similar to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and the Salem witch trials, an embarrassment to our great nation. Many of us support today's government-led mob. But who among us will be tomorrow's witch?
 Eric Brooks Bryn Mawr, Pa., March 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 ''The Grievance Committee,'' by Gail Collins (column, March 19), and ''Scorn Trails A.I.G. Executives, Even in Their Own Driveways'' (front page, March 20) should be required reading for everyone within range of an A.I.G. employee -- and for every member of Congress (already too late).
 People, get a grip! My colleague's husband -- an unassuming, middle-class family man and a middle manager in a profitable division of A.I.G. -- escorted his 13-year-old daughter to a Philadelphia hospital on Wednesday. A receptionist loudly announced his hapless affiliation to her equally rude colleagues. The next day, Congress passed knee-jerk legislation to tax the bonuses, which is sure to engender the law of unintended consequences. 
 Can we calm down? Pointing fingers, embarrassing teenagers and hunting witches will not remotely get us out of this mess -- or even make us feel better.
 Robin Lawson Byfield, Mass., March 20, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Re ''A.I.G. Seeking Return of Half of Its Bonuses'' (front page, March 19):
 As the anger of average Americans at the greed of the Wall Street elite boils over, President Obama calmly says that his goal is to ''channel our anger in a constructive way.'' 
 He might, however, learn from President Franklin D. Roosevelt how to exploit and mobilize that anger rather than simply react to it.
 ''Government by organized money,'' Roosevelt exclaimed to a roaring Madison Square Garden crowd in the fall of 1936, ''is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.'' The reckless bankers and financiers, he continued, ''are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred!'' 
 F.D.R. summoned and shaped the nation's outrage against the ''economic royalists'' to advance his agenda of a highly progressive tax code, a steep tax on vast inheritances, fair labor standards, security for the elderly and help for the unemployed. 
 President Obama has an extraordinary opportunity to voice Americans' outrage, not only about A.I.G. bonuses but also about the depth of inequality in the nation. Less cool and more passion might help him realize his goals of affordable health care, better education and wider prosperity for all Americans.
 Susan Dunn Williamstown, Mass., March 20, 2009
 The writer teaches leadership studies at Williams College and is co-author, with James MacGregor Burns, of ''The Three Roosevelts.''
 To the Editor: 
 One solution to the A.I.G. bonus furor suggests a look into the past. 
 Three days after my book on student unrest, ''The Battle for Morningside Heights,'' was published in 1970 -- including a glowing foreword from Senator Eugene McCarthy -- my home phone rang at 7:30 a.m. ''Mr. Steindler of the I.R.S.'' wanted every deposit and withdrawal slip for any bank accounts over the last three years. 
 This was the beginning of what Senator McCarthy characterized as ''a punitive audit.'' Subsequently, I was battered and a few tax lawyers were richer. To quote Chief Justice John Marshall, ''The power to tax involves the power to destroy.'' 
 Nixon may not make Mount Rushmore, but he had some interesting ideas. 
 Punitive audits today directed toward the folk at A.I.G. would bring significant money back to taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas, Suddenly Abundant, Is Cheaper

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
The decline in crude oil prices gets all the headlines, but the first globalized natural gas glut in history is driving an even more drastic collapse in the cost of gas that cooks food, heats homes and runs factories in the United States and many other countries.
 Six giant plants capable of cooling and liquefying gas for export are due to come on line this year just as the economies of the Asian and European countries that import the most gas to run their industries are slowing. 
 Energy experts and company executives say that means loads of gas from Qatar, Egypt, Nigeria and Algeria that otherwise would be going to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Spain are beginning to arrive in supertankers in the United States, even though there is a gas glut here, too.
 With industrial and utility use of natural gas declining, gas prices in the United States have already declined by two-thirds since the summer. Prices are not likely to go down much more, experts say, but an increase in imports is likely to keep them low until the global economy recovers and drives demand back up.
 That is good news for American consumers and many businesses, since gas provides about a fifth of the power generated by electric utilities and is a vital component for fertilizers, plastics and other industrial products. But it is bad news for proponents of energy independence, who cheered the boom in domestic gas drilling and production over the last four years.
 Gas industry executives expect that liquefied gas imports into the United States will at least triple in the second half of this year. That comes as domestic producers have lowered their rig count in natural gas fields around the country by 50 percent in the last several months because of the fall in prices, leading to an expected drop in production by the end of the year.
 Normally a decline in production would result in a rising gas price, leading to an eventual recovery in drilling. But energy executives say that increasing imports will probably delay a recovery in production, which until now depended almost entirely on national market forces.
 ''The United States used to have gas bubbles all by itself; now the world can have a gas bubble,'' said Donald Hertzmark, a consultant who advises energy companies on international gas projects. ''Over the next few years, a globalized gas market will exert a moderating influence on gas prices here in the United States.''
 For Mr. Hertzmark the decline in natural gas prices will mean a major stimulus for the domestic and world economies. American oil executives see it another way.
 Rodney Waller, a senior vice president at the oil and gas company Range Resources, called the expected surge in liquefied natural gas imports part of a ''pile on'' of problems including plummeting demand, prices and credit besetting companies that stretched their exploration and production budgets in recent years to meet expanding demand.
 ''Any time you push the price down, you push down the ability of U.S. independents to add reserves and production domestically,'' he said. He warned that some small and midsize oil and gas companies ''with debt that are in trouble now will simply get pushed over the brink.'' 
 Natural gas is becoming a world commodity like oil. It is still loosely connected to world oil benchmark prices and its price, usually set by longer-term contracts everywhere except for the United States and Britain, can diverge widely from one continent to another. Until the last few years, liquefied natural gas was a high-priced necessity for countries that did not produce their own gas supplies or have access to piped reserves; but it now has become a cheap economic driver for countries like Japan with few energy resources.
 But as more terminals have been built, the amount of gas that is shipped from one continent to another in giant tankers has climbed. And now the emergence of the global market in gas is about to take a giant leap.
 The global capacity for liquefied natural gas exports of 200 million tons a year will increase by 25 percent with the completion of six new plants in Qatar, Russia, Indonesia and Yemen, totaling $48 billion in investments, and the upgrading of a seventh plant in Malaysia. National energy companies in those countries, assisted by ExxonMobil, Total, BP and Shell, rushed construction of those projects in recent years to satisfy the mushrooming appetite for energy around the world. More large plants are due on line in 2010 and 2011. 
 ''We had many years of ever increasing demand so the world geared up for that, but what the world did not prepare for was an economic recession that is global in scope and in impact,'' said Darcel L. Hulse, president and chief executive officer of Sempra LNG, a division of Sempra Energy that operates an import terminal in Mexico and is completing construction on a facility in Louisiana. ''That is what has exacerbated the imbalance of supply and demand to such an excess.''
 Some analysts say companies may slow completion of a few of the new export terminal projects. ''The companies will want to bring them on line because they want to recoup their investments made over four to five years and pay off their loans,'' said Nikos Tsafos, an analyst at PFC Energy, a firm that advises governments and energy companies. 
 The international gas glut and expected surge in gas imports represent a reversal from trends of less than a year ago when the world suffered a shortage of liquefied gas and prices spiked in the United States and elsewhere. 
 Natural gas in the United States costs a little over $4 per thousand cubic feet, down from a peak of more than $13 last year. Oil now costs a bit more than $51 a barrel, down from a peak of more than $145 in July. On average, world spot prices for liquefied natural gas cargoes have come down by more than two-thirds since last summer.

HEADLINE: No. 16 Seed Delights Crowd But Can't Derail Pittsburgh

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio 

 BODY:
The excited whispers started midway through the first half, moving through the stands here and throughout offices and in-boxes across the country. Did you hear? Little East Tennessee State was standing strong against mighty Pittsburgh, a team with championship aspirations.
 Instead of making history, though, East Tennessee State continued a trend as old as the N.C.A.A. tournament itself. Pittsburgh won, 72-62, on Friday in the first round of the East Region, but for the way E.T.S.U. had played, fans stood and applauded at game's conclusion. 
 This was one of the better, more competitive games between a No. 16 and a No. 1. Those who follow East Tennessee State said it did not play particularly well, shooting an abysmal 30.7 percent, and making only 4 of 22 3-point attempts. 
 Other than the Panthers fans who traveled here to University of Dayton Arena, spectators quickly adopted East Tennessee State and its bearded and blue mascot, Bucky the Buccaneer.
 That affection reached its apex near the end of the second half, when East Tennessee State players snagged two offensive rebounds and guard Courtney Pigram drilled a 3-pointer from the right wing to cut the deficit to 59-57. The Buccaneers immediately forced another turnover with their press. And the crowd erupted.
 The aftermath sent East Tennessee State (23-11) from elation to deflation. Pittsburgh forward DeJuan Blair converted a 3-point play, which point guard Levance Fields followed with a driving layup for a 64-59 advantage. When Ashton Gibbs made a 3-pointer from beyond the top of the key a few minutes later, Pittsburgh led comfortably, 67-59.
 ''We're really disappointed, because we felt we could win,'' East Tennessee State Coach Murry Bartow said. ''We came here to win. We didn't come here to play a close game.''
 Pittsburgh will play Oklahoma State, an athletic, up-tempo team that could pose problems for the Panthers, on Sunday. Pittsburgh (29-4) has the second-highest win total in team history. In 2004 it won 31 games and advanced to the Round of 16, where it was ousted by Oklahoma State. 
 It was Blair who rescued the Panthers, muscling inside for buckets, playing with the abandon his tight teammates seemed to lack. He finished with 27 points and 16 rebounds. 
 ''This is one of those I watched and said, 'There's no way this team is a 16 seed,' '' Pittsburgh Coach Jamie Dixon said.
 Sam Young, who scored 14 points and had 13 rebounds, said: ''We were a little careless. We came out just a little sluggish, just not taking care of the ball, mostly.'' East Tennessee State forced 18 turnovers.
 No men's team seeded 16th has ever beaten a No. 1 seed. A couple of teams have come close. Princeton lost by a point to Georgetown in 1989 and Murray State lost to Michigan State in overtime in 1990.
 This season marked the 20th anniversary of the East Tennessee State team that nearly knocked off top-seeded Oklahoma. The Buccaneers took Mookie Blaylock, Stacey King and company to the buzzer, losing, 72-71. 
 In the first half, even as East Tennessee State shot poorly (1 of 13 from 3-point range), it clung to Pittsburgh like a swarm of gnats. Television cameras captured Dixon slapping his forehead as he called another timeout.
 By then, college basketball followers across the country had taken notice.

HEADLINE: With Eyes Bigger Than Their Wallets, Homebuyers Are Forced to Revisit Old Rules

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
At the height of the housing boom, many borrowers had to stretch to afford a house, in some cases agreeing to spend half their monthly earnings on their home. We all know how that turned out.
 Now, President Obama's housing plan will help many borrowers reduce those monthly payments to 31 percent. 
 But is that a reasonable goal? And where did that number come from?
 Its roots may go back more than a century to company towns, where employers would collect a week's wages for a month's rent. In the 1920s, as homeownership became an option for more middle-class families, lenders adopted a similar standard: spend a quarter of a month's income on housing. And during the New Deal, governmental housing agencies also adopted that as a reasonable amount to spend on a mortgage. Though the number has inched up through the years, that general rule of thumb has stuck. 
 But does it still work? 
 Several financial planners agree that a figure around 30 percent is not a bad place to start. That usually leaves enough to pay for life's many other costs. 
 Given that the current economic crisis has turned a lot of financial assumptions on their head, it is probably wise to rethink how much of your income should go toward servicing the large debt that is truly homeownership. 
 There is not a one-size-fits-all answer.
 ''It's different for everybody, but there are some norms,'' said Joseph R. Birkofer, a financial planner and principal of Legacy Asset Management in Houston.
 Several financial advisers recommend reverting to an old standard known as the 28/36 rule. Using that rule, households should spend no more than 28 percent of their gross income on housing costs -- including mortgage payments, property taxes and insurance -- and less than 36 percent on all debt. The total includes obligations like car payments, student loans, credit cards and medical debt. 
 There is some debate about whether you should base your calculations on gross income or take-home pay. While some advisers said using gross income was reasonable enough, Mr. Birkofer said he told his clients to apply it to net pay. 
 ''I want people to have more than a house, I want them to have a life, too,'' Mr. Birkofer said. ''The application of the 28/36 rule can be an eye opener and a 'go slow' or 'reform now' sign.'' The original maxim of a week's pay for a month's rent was also based on take-home pay, given that it predates the federal income tax system, which formally started in 1913, said Danilo Pelletiere, research director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
 Many people are spending much more than that. According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey in 2007, the latest available, 38 percent of homeowners with mortgages spend more than 30 percent of their monthly gross income on all housing costs.
 And a swath of homeowners was even more thinly stretched. In 2007, nearly 9.17 million homeowners, or about 12 percent of all owners, spent more than half of their gross income on housing costs, according to tabulations of Census data by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
 That left little room for food, gas, transportation, utilities, child care and other expenses like medical bills or insurance, not to mention saving for college and retirement. And it helps explain why so many families are losing their homes to foreclosure.
 Some of the advice that follows may seem elementary. But given how far many people have strayed from the basics, now is the right time to revisit some of the lessons our parents and grandparents learned long ago. 
 HOW MUCH CAN I AFFORD? Your housing budget depends on your situation and priorities. Two-income households with strong earnings potential can probably spend a little bit more than one-income households -- as your income rises over the years, your housing costs are likely to become a smaller piece of your expenses. (Of course, that is not necessarily the case if you later buy a bigger house.) The same goes for individuals who have saved extra money or people who may earn less, like teachers, but who are unlikely to lose their jobs. Just be sure you stick with a plain-vanilla 30-year fixed mortgage because payments will remain steady.
 Financial advisers use different methods to ascertain what their clients can comfortably afford. Jennifer Hartman, a financial planner in Los Angeles, has her clients write down all of their expenses. She then breaks those down into expenses that are fixed (utilities, groceries, auto expenses, insurance, etc.) and variable (everything else). ''The idea is that the variable costs could be reallocated toward housing if the client is willing to give it up,'' Ms. Hartman said.
 Steve Podnos, a financial planner in Merritt Island, Fla., likes to start by establishing savings goals, and then working backward. He recommends setting aside 10 to 15 percent of your salary, preferably in tax-deferred accounts, and then work with what's left over for living expenses and housing costs.
 DO THE MATH Before you start hitting open houses, sketch out a rough budget based on the 28 percent rule of thumb, using a simple mortgage calculator. For instance, a family that earns $10,000 a month -- or about $7,000 after taxes -- should keep their total monthly housing costs, including mortgage, taxes and insurance, to about $2,800 a month. In one example, the family may be able to spend $440,000 on a home, or about 3.6 times their annual income, as long as they can come up with a 20 percent down payment (and closing costs). If they finance the remaining $352,000 with a 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 5.5 percent, that would translate into a monthly payment of about $2,000, leaving $800 to pay real estate taxes and insurance. That leaves $4,200 of their monthly after-tax income to pay for everything else, giving them some breathing room. 
 DOWN PAYMENT Currently, many consumers have no choice but to make a sizable down payment. If you do not, or cannot, it will cost you dearly in the form of a higher interest rate or fees. The ability to put down at least 20 percent is often emblematic of your financial discipline and ability to afford the monthly payment.
 ''If you can't afford to save 20 percent, you can't afford to buy a home,'' said Francine Duke, owner of Aqua Financial Planning in Vernon Hills, Ill.
 TAXES Consider the tax savings associated with buying a home, but do not use it as an excuse to buy more than you can afford. Property taxes and mortgage interest are generally tax-deductible, but only if you itemize your deductions. Itemizing makes sense when your individual deductions exceed the standard deduction, which is $11,400 for married people filing jointly in 2009. For many taxpayers in the 28 percent tax bracket who itemize, a $350,000 mortgage may reduce their tax bill by as much as $5,357 in the first year of the mortgage. Since you pay more in interest in the loan's early years, your tax savings will decline over time.
 RESERVES Ideally, homeowners should have six months of net pay in the bank. But if you halve that figure and save three months of your take-home pay, that generally translates into eight months of payments. That does not account for food and other necessities, but it does provide some cushion. Two-income households can get away with just a few months of savings put aside, but single-breadwinner households should have at least six months.
 You also need to account for unforeseen costs. ''If you can't afford a new roof or a water heater, then you can't afford the house,'' Ms. Hartman said.

HEADLINE: Pope Urges Angolans to Help the Poor, Respect Rights and Embrace Democracy

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola 

 BODY:
Pope Benedict XVI, midway through his first trip to Africa, arrived in oil-rich Angola on Friday and admonished those enjoying the nation's newfound wealth not to ignore the justifiable demands of the poor.
 ''The multitude of Angolans who live below the threshold of absolute poverty will not be forgotten,'' he said in a speech moments after getting off his airplane. ''Do not disappoint their expectations!''
 In a second address, this one delivered hours later at the residence of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, he challenged Angola and other African countries to free their people ''from the scourges of greed, violence and unrest'' through ''modern civic democracy.'' 
 He defined this civic liberation as one respectful of human rights with transparent governance, an independent judiciary, a free press, properly functioning schools and hospitals, ''and -- most pressing -- a determination born from the conversion of hearts to excise corruption.''
 These antidotes to kleptocratic government are commonly prescribed for Africa in general and this nation in particular. But if the message was difficult to swallow, President dos Santos showed no signs of discomfort as he stood only feet away from Benedict. The pope is a prestigious visitor for a man who has held power for 29 years while running for election only once.
 ''If I were the president and I heard what the pope said, I would conclude that he thought the real issue in my country was my own leadership,'' said Fernando Macedo, a professor of constitutional law here in Luanda, the capital, and a frequent critic of Mr. dos Santos. 
 But in companion speeches, Mr. dos Santos seemed to agree with the pope's every exhortation. ''Yes, there is a necessity to help those in need,'' he said, ruing a national unemployment rate he put at 48 percent and the lack of water and electricity in 60 percent of all homes. He said Angola was devoting billions of dollars to solving its substantial problems.
 Angola, which is about twice the size of Texas, may be a nation with a vaguely familiar ring to many Americans. Seven years ago, it emerged from a civil war that dated back nearly three decades to some of the most chilling times of the cold war, when conflict here was thought vital to the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba and apartheid-era South Africa.
 The fighting laid waste to most of the infrastructure that dated back to the days of Portuguese colonizers, and left the land so seeded with explosives that the accumulation of land mines roughly equaled the number of people. 
 But peace finally allowed the government to exploit Angola's natural wealth of diamonds and petroleum. This soon seemed a nation poised to lift much of its population -- variously estimated at 14 million to 20 million -- from penury.
 And yet so far, revenues have mostly supported the ostentatious consumption of a free-spending elite. Two-thirds of the country's people still live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.
 Angolans, if lacking in purse, are rich in faith. ''This is a very religious country, and though not all of it is Catholic, almost all is religious,'' said the Rev. Mauricio Camuto, the director of Radio Ecclesia, a Catholic radio station and one of the few independent voices in the Angolan news media. ''Go anywhere in the provinces, even among 20 huts, you will find a church.''
 Pope Benedict's predecessor, John Paul II, made 42 visits to Africa during his nearly 27-year papacy. There are an estimated 158 million Catholics on the continent, and the huge growth of the church in Africa during the past century is widely seen as one of its greatest missionary feats -- as well as its likely future, with church attendance in deep decline in Europe.
 Some 70 percent of Angola is Catholic, President dos Santos said Friday. Other estimates put the number at 55 to 65 percent.
 Cameroon was the first stop in Africa for Benedict. He spent three days there, and his trip to Angola will end Monday morning.
 For the government, the pope's visit is a geopolitical coming of age. ''The Angolans see themselves as a continental power, and the pope's visit is a further reaffirmation of that,'' said the United States ambassador, Dan Mozena.
 For the masses, the papal visit is an unprecedented thrill. Friday was declared a national holiday, and in the morning, the main street from the airport -- Revolucao de Outubro -- was well lined with thousands of people hours before the pope arrived.
 Churches had bused in the faithful, most of them already wearing T-shirts that commemorated the occasion. ''I want to be reborn in heaven,'' some chanted in Kimbundu, one of the local languages. Others sang in Portuguese, ''Pope, our friend, Angola is with you!'' Small paper banners carried Benedict's face on one side and the Angolan flag on the other. 
 In the plane en route from Rome to Africa, the pope had renewed the church's objection to the use of condoms as a prevention against AIDS, going so far as to say this precaution actually ''increases the problem'' of H.I.V. infection. Africa is the continent hardest hit by the AIDS pandemic, and many activists, medical researchers and politicians quickly took issue with the pope's statement, calling it unscientific and dangerous.
 Most people in the anticipating crowd were aware of the controversy. ''The only people who use condoms are those with no faith,'' said Simba Teresa, a 45-year-old street vendor, trying to wave away the heat with a continuing flap of her hand. She said three of her five children had died as infants, a common story in a country with one of the worst child mortality rates in the world. ''Faith is everything,'' she said. ''You put your life in God's hands.''

HEADLINE: Obama Outlines Plan to Help Prevent Waste in Economic Stimulus Package

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama issued a directive on Friday requiring that lobbyists put in writing their requests about the projects they believe should be awarded from the $787 billion economic stimulus package, saying the plan ''will not be an excuse for waste and abuse.'' 
 In a speech to a group of state lawmakers meeting in the capital, Mr. Obama outlined what he called ''unprecedented restrictions'' to increase the transparency of how the government spends money on projects intended to lift the economy and create jobs. The discussions between lobbyists and his administration, he said, will be disclosed on the Internet.
 ''Whenever a project comes up for review, we're going to ask a simple question,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Does it advance the core mission of the Recovery Act? Does it jump-start job creation? Does it lay the foundation for lasting prosperity?''
 Mr. Obama renewed his pledge to prevent waste from creeping into projects that are paid for through the economic plan. He said he had rejected a proposal to use stimulus money for modernizing the electrical and heating systems in the East Wing of the White House because the project ''will not create many jobs or advance our recovery.''
 The president provided few details about the disclosure requirements. He said all requests for projects must be made in writing, so their value could be assessed.
 ''Decisions about how recovery money will be spent will be based on the merits,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 The president announced the accountability plan at the end of a week in which his administration has come under intense criticism for allowing bonuses to be paid to executives at companies that have been given a financial lifeline from the government. Even as he took a tough posture on the spending, he conceded that some projects might not be as worthy as others.
 ''No plan is perfect,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And I can't stand here and promise you that not one single dollar will slip through the cracks, but what I can promise you is that we will do everything in our power to prevent that from happening.''

HEADLINE: As the Public Simmers, Obama Lets Off Steam

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To win the White House, Barack Obama grew adept at navigating obstacles. But few of those challenges tested his communications and political skills as much as this week's outbreak of populism, in which he sought to contain, control and, finally, channel the searing outrage over bonuses paid by companies being kept afloat by the government. 
 By week's end, after making a dozen public appearances in settings from the East Room in the White House to the stage of ''The Tonight Show,'' Mr. Obama had run the gamut from saying he inherited the problems to accepting the blame. And he tried to keep his options open as he waited to see if the fury subsided, pointedly not promising to sign a measure making its way through Congress that seeks to get back the bonuses by imposing a new tax on them. 
 Along the way, he turned to anger, an emotion rarely used in his presidential race.
 ''I don't want to quell anger. I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry,'' Mr. Obama said, his voice reaching a peak seven days after learning of the bonuses given to employees of the American International Group. ''What I want to do, though, is channel our anger in a constructive way.''
 While Mr. Obama never explicitly said how he believed that anger should be channeled, he essentially suggested that Americans should follow his lead: let off a little steam and move on. He wants to prevent the disgust over the A.I.G. bonuses from derailing his agenda and the broader concerns about the economy.
 The tornado of populism that swept through Washington this week presented the kind of challenge that forced him to improvise as he worked to catch up with public opinion. As administration officials struggled to reconcile precisely when they learned about the bonuses, Mr. Obama sought to stop the finger-pointing by declaring, ''The buck stops with me.''
 It is not clear whether the spasm of anger set off by news of the bonuses paid to A.I.G. executives was a one-week affair or a sign of a larger political shift driven by a sense that American-style capitalism in the last several decades has become fundamentally unfair.
 Either way, the White House initially underestimated the controversy that the bonuses would create, advisers said, which is why the president waited to address it directly. It was a pattern that became familiar during his presidential campaign: detecting trouble on the horizon, failing to act swiftly before finally moving to reclaim control of the message.
 ''Washington can get stuck on one thing,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president. ''The most important thing that we've learned is to keep your eye on the ball and not get so bogged down in the frenzy of the moment that you lose sight of your objectives.'' 
 In the Oval Office on Friday evening, Mr. Obama recorded an interview with ''60 Minutes,'' the final piece of business in a frenzied week of television interviews and public events in Washington and California. Even if support for some of his policies has waned, Mr. Obama remains popular, so his schedule is purposefully packed so he can be seen as the face of the administration.
 But the frequent appearances by the president also helped showcase a day-by-day -- or hour-by-hour -- shift in how Mr. Obama responded to the outrage at the A.I.G. bonuses.
 ''Part of the president's job is communicating to the American people through a difficult period of time,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff. ''We understand their frustration, but we're not going to govern out of anger.''
 As Mr. Obama grappled with a response to the A.I.G. bonuses, there was not a consensus among his advisers about what he should say. By Wednesday afternoon, he was borrowing a line from President Harry S. Truman -- ''The buck stops with me'' -- in answering a reporter's question.
 Some of his aides said that the phrase took them by surprise, but it was those words that were repeated on the television news.
 ''Presidents have never gotten in trouble when they say, 'The buck stops with me' or 'I wish we could have done that better,' '' said Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist. ''I'm perfectly willing to be critical of him on some things, but I think he handled this about as well as he could have.''
 While the early analysis suggested that Mr. Obama was suffering a near cataclysmic week, at least politically speaking, his advisers argued that the long-term view would be far less dire. Like his presidential campaign, which is often seen as an exercise in political perfection when viewed through the rearview mirror, the real-time evolution was often perceived as a much bumpier road.
 ''It's a hell of a difficult time to be president, that's for damned sure,'' said Bill Carrick, who has advised Democratic candidates for decades. ''There are a lot of moving parts here. I don't think it's going to be easy to apply the rules of campaign discipline to this.''
 On Saturday night, when many commentators who criticized his performance this week will be attending the annual white-tie Gridiron dinner in Washington, Mr. Obama will not be seated at the head table as most of his predecessors have been. He will be at Camp David watching the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and preparing for another week that begins on Monday morning in the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: Just a Couple of Average Joes Having a Fireside Chat

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
President Obama didn't look burdened by his office on ''The Tonight Show'' on Thursday; he seemed detached. 
 As he described the problems of the American International Group and the credit crisis to Jay Leno, Mr. Obama behaved less like a beleaguered president than like the head of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia reporting back to the main office: concerned and engaged, but intent on maintaining his professional distance and neutrality.
 At times he might have seemed a little too removed. When he described the plight of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner (''He understands that he's on the hot seat, but I actually think that he is taking the right steps''), Mr. Leno jumped in and said teasingly, ''Now, see, I love that it's all his problem.'' Mr. Obama tensed up and tried to correct himself, and it took him several beats to surrender to the joke and laugh along with the audience. 
 But over all Mr. Obama, the first sitting president to be a guest on ''The Tonight Show,'' delivered a familiarly smooth, winning performance in an unfamiliar setting -- a fireside chat for the flat-screen age. 
 Presidents have tested the dignity of their office on television in the past, of course, but rarely so early in their tenure. George W. Bush made a brief appearance on a prime-time game show last April, near the end of his second term and before the economy collapsed. (''I'm thrilled to be on 'Deal or No Deal' with you tonight,'' Mr. Bush said from a giant screen in a taped cameo. ''Come to think of it, I'm thrilled to be anywhere with high ratings these days.'')
 Like his predecessors, Mr. Obama has traveled out of the nation's capital and held town hall meetings around the country. He chose to align himself with a late-night comedian to signal as vividly as possible that a little more than midway through his first 100 days he is still an outsider, in Washington but not of Washington, not a combatant but an envoy sent there by voters to cease hostilities and clean up the mess.
 Town hall meetings and West Wing news conferences do not convey the notion that the president is one of us. Making jokes on a talk show and drawing simple analogies for complicated issues -- which he did with great skill as a candidate -- were a way to reassure and befriend viewers. The White House tapped Mr. Leno because he is viewed as the voice of the average Joe. At times Mr. Obama managed to out-everyman Mr. Leno. 
 ''I do think in Washington it's a little bit like 'American Idol,' '' Mr. Obama said with a grin. ''Except everybody is Simon Cowell.''
 That desire to bond with ordinary viewers explains why Mr. Obama went on the show with so little fanfare or presidential ceremony. The president didn't pre-empt Mr. Leno's customary opening monologue and routine about wacky oddities. (On Thursday Mr. Leno did a show-and-tell of silly things found at a 99-cent store; one was a crucifix, made in China, with the words ''Betty Boop'' inscribed on the back.) 
 And Mr. Leno didn't deviate from his usual entrance each night, in which members of the audience are herded to the edge of the stage so the host can pat heads and grab hands, quite like a politician at a campaign rally. The band played ''Hail to the Chief'' as Mr. Obama walked out, but like any other guest, he shook hands with the bandleader, Kevin Eubanks (who wore a suit for the occasion), then shook hands with and half-hugged Mr. Leno. 
 He wore a tie, in contrast to the days when he was a candidate and wore a dark suit and a white shirt with the collar open. But he spoke informally, joking about the strange restrictions imposed by the Secret Service and noting that on Marine One, the presidential helicopter, his daughters were most awed by the dish of Starburst candies.
 He had one impolitic moment when trying to make a self-deprecating joke about his bowling score of 129, saying, ''That was like the Special Olympics or something.'' (After the taping Mr. Obama issued an apology for the remark.)
 Mostly, however, he stayed benign and folksy even while discussing the need to undo bonuses, fix banks and regulate credit card rates.
 And inevitably he talked about the long-promised family dog, joking that he might not get one after all. ''This is Washington,'' he said with a sly smile. ''That was a campaign promise.''

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Calls for Scrutiny of Executive Pay Policies

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Amid public outrage over employee bonuses at troubled firms like Merrill Lynch and the American International Group, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, called on Friday for executive pay policies created with a company's long-term health in mind. 
 ''Poorly designed compensation policies can create perverse incentives that can ultimately jeopardize the health of the banking organization,'' Mr. Bernanke said during a speech in Phoenix to the Independent Community Bankers of America. ''Management compensation policies should be aligned with the long-term prudential interests of the institution.''
 His speech came as lawmakers in Washington tried to claw back some $165 million in bonuses paid to employees at A.I.G., which has received $170 billion in government aid. The furor over bonus payments at the government-controlled insurance giant prompted the House to pass a bill on Thursday that would tax at a 90 percent rate bonuses paid this year by firms that have received bailout funds.
 In his speech, Mr. Bernanke also called for smarter regulation of the financial system that would address the problem of companies deemed ''too big to fail.'' Huge and interconnected institutions like Citigroup and A.I.G. have received billions in government aid to keep their troubles from pulling down other companies.
 Mr. Bernanke said that regulators needed to better monitor the financial stability and compensation policies of such companies, and that the government should develop procedures for ''safely winding down a systemically important firm rather than keeping it operating.''
 He also said regulators might need to modify accounting rules and regulations that set standards for how much capital banks must keep on hand, to ensure those rules did not amplify the natural rise and fall of financial markets. 
 In a speech 10 days ago to the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Bernanke flicked at the idea of reviewing accounting standards that regulate how companies value their assets, known as mark-to-market rules. But he said he did not support suspending those rules, a move that some investors support.
 Mr. Bernanke also said he had seen some signs that the Fed's response to the credit crisis had begun to bear fruit. The Fed's Open Market Committee has chopped target interest rates to a record low, near zero percent, and it has set up a range of programs to buy securities backed by mortgages, student loans, commercial loans and other assets.
 This week, the Fed said it would buy some $750 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $300 billion in longer-term Treasury debt, a move aimed at lowering mortgage rates and easing the constricted credit markets. 
 ''So far, we have generally been encouraged by the market responses, including the decline in mortgage interest rates,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''In addition, our commercial paper facility has helped American businesses finance their payrolls and other operational obligations by significantly lowering rates on the paper and opening access to financing at terms longer than a few days.''

HEADLINE: Smaller Though It May Be, It's Time to Look at the Estate

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
For all the upheaval that has attended Barack Obama's presidency so far, at least one initiative has caused little commotion: a proposal to extend the estate tax at the current level. 
 Despite the political sparks that the tax set off during the Bush administration, it actually affects a mere 2 percent of estates, according to the Internal Revenue Service. It now affects estates over $3.5 million, or $7 million for married couples, with a top tax rate of 45 percent. (Without Congressional action, the tax was to disappear in 2010, then revert in 2011 to the lower exemption levels and higher taxes that prevailed a decade earlier.)
 But estate planning is not primarily about avoiding a tax that few have been subject to since it was instituted in 1916. The primary goal has always been how to bequeath what you have to the heirs you picked. And if handled wrongly, wills can become a vehicle that destroys families. 
 ''As the economy gets worse, children will be looking at that inheritance,'' said Les Kotzer, an attorney and author of ''Where There's an Inheritance: Stories From the World of Two Wills Lawyers'' (Continental Atlantic Publications). ''They might start looking at the house as their entitlement. I have kids calling me and asking me, 'When do I get my inheritance?' ''
 The biggest issue, given both the recession and the flux in federal estate tax laws, is whether wills already drawn up still fulfill their intent. 
 ''I don't think most people have focused on it,'' said Holly Isdale, managing director at Bessemer Trust. ''They have been so shell-shocked. Their net worth has gone from $10 million to $5 million. The stock options have gone. Those are all things clients are still grappling with.''
 On this issue, Ms. Isdale speaks professionally and personally. Until this fall, she was the head of wealth advisory services at Lehman Brothers, where senior employees were heavily compensated in stock that is now worthless.
 Slowly, though, very wealthy people are getting up the nerve to peek at their estate plans. ''Clients who may not have had the appetite to make some significant structuring decisions because of the cost involved are now willing to hear you out,'' said Mary Duke, head of global wealth solutions for the Americas at HSBC Private Bank.
 While estate-planning advice for the wealthy is more complicated, this is a time when all Americans can stand to re-emphasize the basics. 
 Spelling Counts. Whether you have $50,000 or $50 million, you need to be specific about the distribution of your estate. In his book, Mr. Kotzer recounts horror stories from well-meaning people who left their wills too vague. 
 In one, a favored sibling begged her mother not to cut her sister out of the will entirely. The mother gave in and left the other daughter 10 percent of the estate. That act dogged the favored daughter for years as her sister disputed every value in the estate to get her full 10 percent. A lump sum payment would have eliminated this.
 In another story, two siblings stopped talking over the definition of their father's ''personal stuff.'' The brother thought it meant everything their father had when he died; the sister thought it should exclude belongings that had originated with her mother, which should be left as mementos for her. 
 One of the most cautionary tales, though, involved a woman who died and left her child in the care of her sister and brother-in-law through a joint-guardianship agreement. When that couple later divorced, the husband fought to be the sole guardian of his niece. The moral here: pick only one person to care for your child, even if it means hurt feelings.
 ''In the last big recession, I saw fights grow exponentially,'' Mr. Kotzer said. ''It doesn't take much for a family to be ripped apart. Once it starts it's a slippery slope.''
 Flexibility for Bad Times. Irrevocable trusts are a popular way to organize an estate to shield money from taxes. But such trusts essentially take title to the individual's assets and do not allow you to reclaim them if your financial situation worsens. With the stock market gyrating, putting some assets in a revocable trust -- which lacks the same tax protection -- gives an executor of an estate more flexibility to manage the assets.
 The actual reading of that will -- when the estate is divided up and parceled out -- could take months. Given how quickly stocks have gone down recently, securities placed in a revocable trust could be sold to keep them from depreciating in that time. 
 ''It's good in a volatile market,'' said Gail Cohen, general trust counsel and head of global wealth management at Fiduciary Trust Company. ''Even if you don't have an estate tax problem, you need to do planning for other things.'' 
 Rebalance Your Will. Just as you should periodically rebalance your portfolio, you need to rebalance your will. To take full advantage of the $7 million exemption for couples, each spouse needs to have $3.5 million of assets in his or her name. Given the across-the-board drop in asset values, spouses may want to rethink who owns what, at least on paper.
 ''You have to understand how assets are titled from a will perspective, and now that the economy has changed, you have to readjust the value,'' Ms. Isdale said. (This does not apply in the nine community property states, California being the biggest one.)
 For simplicity, many people added clauses to wills that put whatever the exemption amount was in a trust for their children and left the rest to the surviving spouse, who is not subject to the estate tax. That tax-free level kept rising, from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million this year. But if your estate was worth $6 million in 2001 but is now worth $4 million, allowing the new limit to go automatically into a trust would leave your spouse without enough money. 
 Make Gifts, if You Can. Even before the economy crumbled, people were doing less giving while alive. The political debate over the estate tax played a role.
 ''Since 2001, with the elimination of the estate tax looming out there, there has been a decline in gifting,'' Ms. Cohen said. A person can now give $13,000 per year to any individual, to a lifetime total of $1 million, without incurring taxes. But even with a gift tax of 45 percent, it makes more sense for people with taxable estates to give a large sum now than leave it to an heir. (The caveat is that you need to live three years after the gift or it gets pulled back into the estate.)
 The reason is how the taxes are applied. To give a child $1 million while you're alive (if the exemption is gone), it would cost you $1,450,000. But if you wanted to will $1 million to an heir, you would have to give $1,820,000. Gift tax is added to a gift, while estate tax, also at 45 percent, is deducted from a bequest after your death. 
 Charles Kuralt, the CBS correspondent who died in 1997, has become famous in estate planning circles for having not been advised on the distinction. His wife survived him, so there would not have been any estate taxes -- if he had not left a 90-acre ranch in Montana to his mistress. ''The wife paid the tax on the property and ended up getting nothing,'' Ms. Cohen said. 
 That's no way to sign off.

HEADLINE: Rage Redux: Changing Channels

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Let's discuss the George W. Bush presidential library.
 I am doing this as a public service. Our howling about government bailouts has sent Congress into a panic attack that's getting out of hand. The White House economic team may not be all we hoped for, but let them work in peace for a few days without having to worry that some legislator in search of outrage creds is going to crash through the window and bite Tim Geithner on the ankle.
 President Obama has asked us to direct our anger into constructive channels, and his loyal supporters are planning to get together over the weekend to collect signatures on petitions asking Congress to pass his budget. That certainly sounds like fun, but not really what I envision when I think of a rage channel. 
 A change of topic is required. We have tried to divert you with the story about the former ''Project Runway'' contestant who was arrested for assaulting her ex-boyfriend with a cat and Michelle Obama's plan to plant rutabagas on the White House lawn. The president is even playing the dog card again. But nothing seems to work.
 So let's contemplate that library, which is more properly called the George W. Bush Presidential Center. A nonprofit foundation is trying to raise $300 million in tax-deductible donations for a huge complex on 25 acres at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this fall.
 Feeling a little irked? Excellent.
 The center has several different functions, one of which is to showcase a collection of presidential memorabilia. Texas already has a museum for Lyndon Johnson and one for George H.W. Bush. You do have to wonder how many replicas of the Oval Office any one state needs. 
 The original Bush Presidential Library and Museum is at Texas A&M University, where visitors can see a ''stunning replica of Barbara's wedding gown,'' a restored 1947 Studebaker, samples from the museum's collection of more than 1,200 elephants and the family speedboat, Fidelity. Why can't George W. just stick his knickknacks in there, too? They wouldn't even have to change the name.
 True, it might be tough to make room for the foundation's planned ''interactive decision theater,'' where visitors ''will have the opportunity to make their own presidential decisions.'' Do you think we could uninvade Iraq?
 The George W. Bush Presidential Center is, of course, planning to have a library. That's a given for these kinds of monuments to ex-presidents, even if the one in question has done more than any chief executive in modern history to keep public records out of the hands of the public. 
 This is the guy who told federal agencies that whenever a citizen asked to see a document, the government should presume it was secret unless the petitioner could prove otherwise. Really, the best thing you could do for the Bush administration papers would be to put them someplace where George W. cannot get within 10 miles of them.
 The final part of the center is going to be a think tank that was originally called the Freedom Institute. However, the Bush White House did such a thorough job in ruining the word ''freedom'' that the organizers seem to be rethinking that.
 Its mission is to ''further the domestic and international goals of the Bush administration.'' 
 As James Traub wrote in The Times Magazine, the institute will be somewhat unique in that, while part of the university, it has no obligation whatsoever to report to the S.M.U. president or provost. It will instead report to the president of the Bush foundation, a former hotel executive who Bush once made ambassador to Costa Rica. 
 Thanks to that tax deduction, money donated to this enterprise is money that will not be going to help balance the federal budget.
 Anger channeled yet?
 It's hard to believe that there are rich people, even in Dallas, who think the George W. Bush Presidential Center is the best possible use for excess cash at this particular point in history. We're going to devote the next couple of months to torturing any employee of a bailed-out financial company who took a bonus. There ought to be a few minutes to spare for people who weigh all the nation's competing needs, then decide that what the world needs most is a really good repository for W.'s White House treadmill.
 Why does the Bush center need donations anyway? His administration believed the profit motive makes everything efficient -- derivatives markets, health care, invasions. If he wants a monument, let him build an amusement park. Kids could compete in brush-clearing contests or slam-dunk at the George Tenet Basketball Court.
 And rides. There would, of course, be lots of rides. After all, he took us for one.

HEADLINE: A Governor Says No to Money, and Reaps Boos

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: CARSON CITY, Nev. 

 BODY:
Throughout the halls of the State Legislature here, lawmakers are turning an age-old Freudian question into a daily fiscal riddle: ''What does Jim Gibbons want?''
 Jim Gibbons, the governor of this state -- which has the unfortunate bragging rights of having unemployment and foreclosure rates that are among the highest in the nation -- is one of several Republican governors who have said they are not interested in taking federal stimulus money that would help pay unemployment benefits. 
 But unlike the governor in South Carolina, Mark Sanford, whose criticism of the money has turned him into a sort of spokesman for fiscal conservatives, Mr. Gibbons has alienated his own party, run counter to his state's conservative business groups and helped inspire two Republicans -- for now -- to make the unusual move of announcing they will challenge him next year in his bid for a second term. 
 ''It has been very difficult because in the past I have been a supporter and a friend of Jim Gibbons,'' said one challenger, Michael Montandon, the mayor of North Las Vegas. ''It is highly likely'' that the state would be better off with the unemployment money, Mr. Montandon said. 
 Mr. Gibbons, rather than being an early critic of the stimulus bill, wrote in December to his state's Congressional delegation and President-elect Obama requesting the unemployment money, but then later denounced it as a threat to his state's sovereignty. Like other opponents, he said he feared that the extension of unemployment benefits could saddle the state with extended obligations long after the federal money was gone.
 In the rough-and-tumble world of Nevada's legislative sessions -- lawmakers meet every other year for 120 generally contentious and extremely harried days -- the fight over the unemployment component of the federal stimulus plan has stood out this session. 
 The brouhaha stems from a few notable facts that, in other political circumstances, might suggest that a governor should accept the federal money -- not to mention that no two intelligent people seem to have the same interpretation of the federal bill's language as it applies to state unemployment money.
 While many states would have to change their laws to receive the cash -- the federal government's offer of $7 billion is contingent on states' expanding the eligibility for the benefits -- Nevada already meets the criteria, according to the State Department of Unemployment, Training and Rehabilitation, since it gives benefits to some part-time workers and those who quit their jobs under certain conditions.
 Further, some governors have rejected the unemployment piece of the package because their unemployment levels are below the national average. With a 10.1 percent unemployment rate, according to the latest data released Friday, Nevada's rate is above the national average and rising, and the state's fund will be broke by the end of the year. That will trigger federal borrowing to replenish the fund, which Nevada has not had to do since 1974.
 And while other governors have run afoul of their legislatures and Congressional delegations in criticizing the package, none have had to confront a delegation headed by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. Mr. Gibbons has taken his fight directly to Mr. Reid, with whom he has been engaged in an all-out press-release war.
 ''What makes this particular situation most extreme is the terrible situation the state is in,'' said Jon Summers, a spokesman for Mr. Reid. ''I mean, how do you look at someone in your state that has lost their job and tell them, 'No, we're not taking this money'? ''
 This week, at a joint finance committee session in the Nevada Legislature, state officials were asked about the stimulus money and found themselves in the uncomfortable position of laying out to lawmakers the benefits of receiving it. 
 The contrast with the governor's position was not lost on the lawmakers, who questioned the state officials about it. ''We're neutral,'' explained Larry Mosley, director of the state unemployment department. 
 The State Assembly is set to vote Monday on a bill that would allow the state -- ostensibly without Mr. Gibbons's blessing -- to accept the money. 
 ''In terms of our governor, I am really not sure what his concern is,'' said Barbara Buckley, a Democrat from Las Vegas and the Assembly speaker, who called Mr. Gibbons's position ''incoherent.'' In terms of the threat to the state's sovereignty, Ms. Buckley said the state had been receiving federal unemployment money since the Great Depression.
 Mr. Gibbons has work to do in shoring up support within his own party, too. The State Senate minority leader, Bill Raggio, Republican of Reno, said in an interview after this week's finance committee hearing: ''I'm not against this; I just want to know what we're doing. I am going to do what I think is right for the state. I am very mindful of the economic impact of this downturn.''
 When asked how the state's other United States senator, John Ensign, a Republican, felt about the governor's position, Tory Mazzola, a spokesman for Mr. Ensign, said, ''I'll call you back if we have anything on that.'' 
 The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, a conservative pro-business group, supports taking the money. ''We looked at it and decided the good outweighs the bad,'' said Cara Roberts, a spokeswoman for the chamber.
 Mr. Gibbons has said he opposes taking the money because he fears that once the stimulus bill expires, states will be forced to reduce benefits to prestimulus levels or raise taxes to continue them.
 ''We are not waiting for the Legislature to make its move; it can do anything it wants,'' said Daniel Burns, Mr. Gibbons's spokesman.
 ''Of course, there is a need for unemployment insurance; it would be stupid to suggest otherwise,'' Mr. Burns added, but accepting the federal government's offer ''would force the state of Nevada to change its definition laws and regulations regarding who is eligible for unemployment and how long they receive it.''

HEADLINE: New Forecast of Higher Deficits Casts Shadow on Obama Agenda

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office placed a new hurdle in front of President Obama's agenda on Friday, calculating that the White House's tax and spending plans would create deficits totaling $2.3 trillion more than the president's budget projected for the next decade.
 The difference largely reflects the administration's more optimistic forecasts of economic growth through 2019. 
 The budget office figures, which will guide Congress as it takes up Mr. Obama's proposals in earnest next week, were worse than Democratic leaders expected and further complicated their job of achieving the president's priorities on health care, energy policy and much more.
 Moderate Democrats from competitive districts and states have already expressed nervousness about some of Mr. Obama's plans, especially as Republicans have grown increasingly emboldened to stay on the attack. 
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said the new report ''confirms that under the president's plan, our debt will increase to shocking levels that are simply unsustainable and will devastate future economic opportunities for our children and grandchildren.''
 The president, anticipating the report, referred to ''the massive deficit we inherited and the cost of this financial crisis'' in a speech to state legislators meeting in the capital. While he restated his vow to cut the deficit in half by the end of his term, Mr. Obama gave no ground on trimming his domestic agenda.
 ''What we will not cut are investments that will lead to real growth and real prosperity,'' he said, citing his budget's spending commitments for health care, energy alternatives to foreign oil, and education.
 While long-term budget projections are notoriously unreliable, they help set the terms of the debate and provide political ammunition to both parties. In this case, the Congressional figures could make moderate Republicans and fiscally conservative Democrats less open to supporting Mr. Obama's agenda because of concern about the nation's long-term fiscal health.
 Mr. Obama's budget predicted total deficits for the next decade of nearly $7 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of his plan put the figure at nearly $9.3 trillion, or a third higher.
 The House and Senate Budget Committees are planning to draft their versions of a budget next week, and both chambers expect to vote the following week before leaving for an Easter and Passover recess. 
 Congress's budget resolutions do not require the president's signature and do not have the force of law. But the blueprint that the House and Senate ultimately agree to will go far in determining the odds for success of Mr. Obama's domestic program for this year and beyond.
 To the extent that the nonpartisan budget office report made the administration's sales job harder, it added to the determination of some Congressional Democrats -- with White House coaxing -- to use the budget process to authorize a controversial parliamentary maneuver to help the White House win passage of one of the president's top priorities, health care legislation. 
 The maneuver, known as ''reconciliation,'' would allow the Senate to adopt a health care bill this year with 51 votes instead of the 60 that would normally be necessary. It takes 60 votes to shut off debate, but under reconciliation rules the Republicans would be unable to use the threat of filibuster to block the legislation. 
 That procedural question, as much as any issue of huge dollar figures and weighty policy proposals, is one that divides both chambers and parties as the budget debate gets under way. Senate Republicans, unwilling to lose their best leverage to shape or stop a health care bill, have served notice that they would consider the reconciliation tactic a breach of Mr. Obama's promised spirit of bipartisanship.
 Partly to avoid alienating potential Republican allies in the Senate, some influential Senate Democrats oppose using the reconciliation maneuver. Those opponents include the chairmen of the Budget and Finance Committees, Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Max Baucus of Montana. 
 The tactic is ''not the best way to write major substantive legislation'' that should have bipartisan buy-in, Mr. Conrad said in an interview. 
 But House Democratic leaders argue that presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush have employed the reconciliation process to achieve their major campaign promises; Mr. Obama, they said, should be no different. 
 Democrats in both chambers say the House is likely to approve a budget resolution that authorizes the tactic for health care legislation, the Senate most likely will not, and the issue will have to be settled in negotiations between the chambers -- with the result hinging on how hard the president wants to lean on Democratic senators to go along.
 After initial soundings, Congressional Democrats and the White House decided not to seek the tactic for Mr. Obama's equally controversial energy and climate change proposals because of opposition from within the party, especially among Democrats from manufacturing and coal-producing states. 
 Mr. Conrad said the budget office's grim analysis merely ''confirms what I've been saying for days, that we're going to have to make adjustments in the president's proposal,'' especially to restrain spending.
 ''No one ever had an expectation that they would just take our budget, Xerox it and vote on it,'' said Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
 The economy's expected recovery after this year is projected to help bring in enough additional tax revenue to reduce future annual deficits. Mr. Obama's budget shows a $533 billion deficit by fiscal 2013, the last of his term, which would mean more than a two-thirds reduction--more than meeting his pledge to shave the annual deficits in half. 
 Mr. Conrad predicted that Congress's budget would project a similar two-thirds cut. The budget office analysis of Mr. Obama's budget put the deficit in 2013 at $672 billion. The annual deficits for much of the next decade would range from more than 4 percent to more than 5 percent of the gross domestic product, a level that Mr. Orszag acknowledged would be unsustainable.

HEADLINE: States Look At Tobacco To Balance The Budget

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Mississippi's tax on cigarettes, at 18 cents a pack the nation's third-lowest, has not been raised since 1985. Gov. Haley Barbour, a former tobacco lobbyist, has long opposed an increase.
 But this year, state lawmakers have gone from giving little thought to a tobacco tax increase to arguing over how much the tax should go up and where the money should go. 
 And they are not alone. Budget shortfalls are pushing more than 20 states to look to tobacco for revenue, even those that have long been loath to touch cigarette taxes. 
 In the South, where such taxes have been lower than in the rest of the country, Arkansas has nearly doubled its tax, to $1.15 a pack, and Kentucky's will double, to 60 cents, on April 1. 
 Increases are also under consideration in other tobacco-growing states like North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. With estimated state budget shortfalls nearing $50 billion, opponents of smoking see an opportunity to make headway with the most reluctant lawmakers.
 ''Everything lined up for us this year,'' said Jennifer Cofer, the executive director of the American Lung Association in Mississippi. ''Our state needed money; we've made a great case for it for almost seven years in a row; we have health care expenditures in astronomical proportions. It's kind of like, why not now?''
 But Ms. Cofer and other lobbyists have abandoned hope of seeing part of the money go to helping smokers quit or to pay for their health care. The Mississippi House and Senate have passed bills that differ on the amount of the tax and whether it should all go to the state's general fund, or also be used to pay promised subsidies to local governments and to help people quit smoking, two proposals that Mr. Barbour opposes. The differences were being hammered out this week.
 ''Our position is to just increase the tax,'' Ms. Cofer said. ''We're not proposing or pushing any earmarks.''
 A 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces consumption by 3 percent to 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and deters young people from picking up the smoking habit. 
 Tobacco industry representatives have argued that tobacco taxes unfairly burden smokers, who are mostly working class or poor, and jeopardizes jobs at retailers like convenience stores, where more than 30 percent of total sales can come from cigarettes. 
 ''Many of these states are asking the very definition of Main Street to bail out state capitals,'' said Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American, which makes Camel and other major brands. ''It's just another bailout.''
 States whose cigarette taxes are already high are also considering increases. In Oregon, now at $1.18 a pack, Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski has proposed a 60-cent increase. In New Jersey, Gov. Jon Corzine is asking the Legislature for a 12.5-cent increase over the current $2.58. New York has the highest state tax on cigarettes, $2.75 a pack.
 In Mississippi, cigarette tax increases in surrounding states have helped dampen fears that people would cross state lines to buy cigarettes. After a tax study commission appointed by Governor Barbour recommended an increase, he reversed his opposition but warned that the tax should be viewed as a matter of health policy, not a generator of revenue.
 Bill Phelps, a spokesman for the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris, argued that states often overestimated revenues from cigarette tax increases. From 2003 to 2007, there were 57 state tax increases, Mr. Phelps said, and in 41 cases they fell short of projections. 
 ''We don't think it makes a lot of sense to fund what are often important government programs with a revenue source that is in decline,'' he said. ''Just in the last 10 years, sales have declined an average 3 percent a year.''
 But Frank J. Chaloupka, an economist and director of the Health Policy Center at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said cigarette taxes had not reached the threshold of diminishing returns. ''We haven't yet seen a case where if you raise taxes you don't raise revenues,'' Mr. Chaloupka said.
 New Jersey did see a decline in revenue after its last tax increase, he said, but other factors, like a comprehensive smoke-free-air law that went into effect before the increase, drove down consumption.
 Tobacco lobbyists have also argued that a 62-cent increase in the federal cigarette tax that will go into effect in April overburdens smokers and will drive down state collections. But the federal increase does not seem to have derailed state efforts, in part because smokers cannot avoid it by crossing state lines. 
 ''It's going to be an additional decline in revenues, but not all that dramatic,'' said Richard Weiss, the director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. 
 Federal stimulus money has taken the wind out of the tax-increase proposals' sails in some states. In Georgia, for example, a proposal to go to $1.37 from 37 cents a pack has remained in a legislative committee. 
 Peter Fisher, the vice president for state issues at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said he hoped Georgia would consider the increase. 
 ''For a lot of these states,'' Mr. Fisher said, ''it will come down to the last day of the session, when they realize they have to get the budgets down and they need X dollars.''

HEADLINE: Obama Uneasy About Tax on Bonuses

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Graham Bowley, Michael J. de la Merced and Louise Story contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House stopped short on Friday of endorsing legislation to severely tax bonuses paid to executives of companies that accepted taxpayer bailout funds. 
 Administration officials said instead that President Obama would assess the potential effect of the bill that emerged from Congress on efforts to stabilize the financial system. 
 At the same time, as Wall Street executives anxiously pondered the ramifications of the measure quickly passed by the House this week, some Senate Republicans began to voice opposition to the legislation, saying it was hasty and abusive. 
 The House overwhelmingly adopted on Thursday a bill that would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid since Jan. 1 by companies that owe the government at least $5 billion in bailout funds. That tax would apply to employees with family income of $250,000 or more, and would have an impact on businesses like Citigroup and Bank of America. 
 The Senate has proposed its own bill that would apply to all employees at companies owing $100 million in bailout money. The Senate measure would impose a 35 percent tax on the bonus recipient and on the company, which would apply to any amount above $50,000 for a merit bonus and to the full amount of any bonus paid solely to retain the worker. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, introduced another bill on Friday to curb bonuses. His measure would bar bonuses not based on merit for as long as a company owed bailout money to the government. 
 Wall Street firms reacted angrily to the tax proposals, with several saying they would explore ways to end their participation in the bailout program. 
 The chief executive of Citigroup, Vikram S. Pandit, sent employees a memorandum Friday saying, ''The work we have all done to try to stabilize the financial system and to get this economy moving again would be significantly set back if we lose our talented people because Congress imposes a special tax on financial services employees. It would affect countless number of people who will find it difficult, if not impossible, to pay back the bonuses that they earned.''
 Other companies said they would probably refuse to participate in other Federal Reserve programs aimed at stabilizing the financial sector. 
 For private investment firms, the prospect that the rules can be changed at the whim of Congress introduced a powerful element of doubt in their calculations.
 ''When you don't have the goal posts, you don't know where to run and how far,'' said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the chief executive of Colony Capital, a $38 billion private equity firm.
 Mr. Obama, who initially said he welcomed the effort by Congress to tax bonuses, is now taking a more measured approach. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said the administration would have to consider the impact of the legislation on its wider efforts to prop up banks and increase the flow of consumer credit to families and small businesses.
 ''The president shares the outrage and the frustration that everybody has,'' Mr. Gibbs said at his daily press briefing Friday, referring to $165 million in bonuses paid by the American International Group. Mr. Gibbs also acknowledged the larger goals. ''All of that will be evaluated throughout the process when a bill gets to his desk,'' he said. 
 The White House has called on A.I.G. employees to return the bonus money and reimburse the federal government, while the company's chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, has asked workers to give back at least half of their bonuses. Some officials said action on the tax proposals could depend on whether A.I.G. made good on the refunds. 
 Business leaders struggled to digest the terms of the House bill, which would clearly hit some companies and employees sooner than others. The tax would apply retroactively to bonuses paid since Jan. 1 or paid in the future. But it would not apply to bonuses paid in 2008. For example, one of the most controversial payouts on Wall Street involved the $3.6 billion bonus pool at Merrill Lynch; the firm paid out $2.5 billion of that amount in December, earlier than usual, before its merger with Bank of America. 
 The effect of the House measure on stock options and other benefits was not fully clear. 
 Nearly half of House Republicans joined most Democrats in favor of the tax on bonuses, which was approved by a vote of 328 to 93. But it was far from certain that there would be such bipartisan support in the Senate, where some Republicans began to voice objections. 
 ''It is wrong for members of the United States Congress and the president to propose to use the taxing authority of the government in a manner that is arbitrary, punitive and targeted on a single group of people,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, and the party's senior member of the budget committee. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has not yet expressed a position on the tax proposal, but has said that Americans deserve an explanation of how the bonuses at A.I.G. were allowed, even though the government now owns nearly 80 percent of the insurance conglomerate. 
 ''Taxpayers are still looking for an answer to the question of how this happened, so we can make sure their hard-earned pay isn't wasted in the future,'' Mr. McConnell said Thursday on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Vermont Senate Panel Approves Same-Sex Marriage Bill

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
The Judiciary Committee of the Vermont Senate approved a bill on Friday to allow same-sex marriage, and the full Senate is to take up the measure next week. 
 The committee's unanimous support added momentum to a bill that Democratic leaders, who control both chambers of the legislature, have described as a priority. But even if it clears the legislature, Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican, could veto the measure. And it is too early to know whether supporters could gather enough votes for an override.
 The committee vote came at the end of a week of hearings on the measure, including an intense public hearing on Wednesday that packed the State House in Montpelier. Vermont was the first state to allow civil unions for gay couples, in 2000, and with the new measure, it would be the third to allow same-sex marriage. 
 Massachusetts and Connecticut are now the only states to permit such marriages, but in both states the policy came about as a result of court rulings, not legislative action. A court decision last year briefly allowed same-sex marriage in California, but a voter initiative in November banned it. 
 Mr. Douglas has said that Vermont's civil-union law provides sufficient rights and that, given the economic crisis, lawmakers should be focused instead on issues like job creation.
 ''Governor Douglas believes that this legislation is a distraction from the important work the legislature should be doing to get our economy back on track,'' Dennise Casey, his spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message.
 Senator Kevin J. Mullin, a Republican on the Judiciary Committee, pushed for an amendment to allow a nonbinding state referendum on the marriage question next year. But the committee rejected it, and Mr. Mullin embraced the bill.
 At Wednesday's public hearing, many opponents said the bill violated their belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and that children should have a male and a female parent. 
 Some, too, questioned why the state needed a same-sex marriage law when it allows civil unions, which give gay couples virtually all of the state rights and benefits of married couples.
 But supporters, including several same-sex couples and their children, said they saw marriage as a civil right.
 ''I am tired of being made to feel like a less-than,'' Brad Peacock, a resident of Shaftsbury, said at the hearing. 
 The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives will hear testimony on the bill next week. 
 Steve Cable, president of Vermont Renewal and spokesman for the Vermont Marriage Advisory Council, which oppose the measure, said that Friday's vote was shameful and that he would spend next week lobbying the House committee. ''If they don't deal with this bill appropriately,'' Mr. Cable said, ''there will be a political price to pay.''

HEADLINE: The Fed Does Battle, Again

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's recent moves to revive the economy are aggressive and, given the deteriorating economy, warranted. But the risks involved must be acknowledged. And more must be done. 
 This crisis is unlikely to turn around until President Obama and his aides come up with a plan for failing banks that does not arbitrarily reject the idea of nationalization. They must also follow through on their housing plan to reverse the tide of unnecessary foreclosures. 
 Last year, when a cut to near-zero in the benchmark interest rate failed to spark economic activity, the Fed began to buy up mortgage-backed securities as a way to pump dollars into the economy. On Wednesday, it announced that it would buy hundreds of billions of dollars more and as much as $300 billion of Treasury bonds. 
 Together with other Fed programs, the aim is to lower borrowing costs for consumers, businesses and the government. More borrowing and spending, in turn, would bolster the impact of the fiscal stimulus package passed in February.
 Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that this will work. With unemployment rising, debt loads high and household wealth falling, consumers may be reluctant to resume spending anytime soon, no matter how low rates and prices go. And even if consumers and businesses want to borrow, banks -- stung by their own losses -- may not be willing to lend. 
 If the economy continues to contract, the Fed might have to ramp up its purchases, and Congress might have to approve another round of fiscal stimulus. That could lead to other problems. 
 To buy up securities, the Fed creates money. To provide fiscal stimulus, Congress borrows money. The more money that is created and borrowed, the greater the risk of future inflation and higher interest rates. 
 Rising prices are not an issue right now. Even concern about distant inflation would be misplaced if it led to paralysis in the face of the current crisis.
 But a forthright acknowledgment of the risks is necessary to keep policy makers from venturing too far into dangerous territory. It should also persuade the White House to move on other important policies that have been mismanaged or delayed. 
 It has been nearly six weeks since Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced the outline of a plan to stabilize the banks. Details are expected soon, but the delay has fed uncertainty about the banking system and the administration's ability to right it. Delay has also proved to be politically costly.
 The growing public fury over bailouts and bonuses will likely make it more difficult to win Congressional support for the bank plan. Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner must reassert control by explaining the full depth of the problems with American banks and delivering a workable strategy to address them. 
 Mr. Obama's antiforeclosure plan -- offering banks incentives and guidelines to rework troubled loans -- is reportedly off to a slow start, too. A month after it was announced, the banks are still updating their systems to process applications for the relief and awaiting clarification on a few points of the plan. Are those really unavoidable delays, or are they signs of yet more resistance from the mortgage industry to modifying bad loans? 
 When he unveiled the plan, Mr. Obama said that he would support legislation to let bankrupt homeowners have their mortgages modified under court protection. The legislation would essentially tell lenders that unless they do the right thing and voluntarily rework loans, the process will be turned over to a bankruptcy judge. 
 That stick is still missing. A bill to amend the bankruptcy law has passed the House, but it is stalled in the Senate. Mr. Obama should be pounding the table for its passage. The Fed is putting up a fight. The administration needs to do more.

HEADLINE: Seeking Everyman, Obama Does Leno

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
President Obama didn't look burdened by his office on ''The Tonight Show'' on Thursday; he seemed detached. 
 As he described the problems of American International Group and the credit crisis to Jay Leno, Mr. Obama behaved less like a beleaguered president than the head of a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia reporting back to the main office -- concerned and engaged, but intent on maintaining his professional distance and neutrality.
 At times, he may have seem a little too removed. When he described the plight of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner ( ''He understands that he's on the hot seat, but I actually think that he is taking the right steps'') Mr. Leno jumped in and said teasingly, ''Now, see, I love that it's all his problem.'' Mr. Obama tensed up and tried to correct himself, and it took him several beats to surrender to the joke and laugh along with the audience. 
 But overall Mr. Obama, the first sitting president to be a guest on ''The Tonight Show,'' delivered a familiarly smooth, winning performance in an unfamiliar setting a fireside chat for the flat screen age. 
 Presidents have tested the dignity of their office on television in the past, of course, but rarely so early in their tenure. Former President George W. Bush made a brief appearance on a primetime game show last April near the end of his second term and before the economy collapsed. ( ''I'm thrilled to be on 'Deal or No Deal' with you tonight,'' Mr. Bush said from a giant screen in a pre-taped cameo. ''Come to think of it, I'm thrilled to be anywhere with high ratings these days.'' )
 Like his predecessors, Mr. Obama has traveled out of the nation's capital and held town hall meetings around the country. He chose to align himself with a late night comedian to signal as vividly as possible that a little more than midway through his first 100 days, he is still an outsider, in Washington, but not of Washington, not a combatant but an envoy sent there by voters to cease hostilities and clean up the mess.
 Town hall meetings and West Wing news conferences do not convey the notion that the president is one of us. Making jokes on a talk show and drawing simple analogies for complicated issues -- which he did with great skill as a candidate were a way to reassure and befriend viewers. The White House tapped Mr. Leno because he is viewed as the voice of the average Joe. At times, Mr. Obama managed to out-everyman Mr. Leno. ''I do think in Washington it's a little bit like 'American Idol,'' Mr. Obama said with a grin. ''Except everybody is Simon Cowell.''
 And that desire to bond with ordinary viewers explains why Mr. Obama went on the show with so little fanfare or presidential ceremony. The President didn't pre-empt Mr. Leno's customary opening monologue and routine about wacky oddities (on Thursday, Mr. Leno did a show-and-tell of silly things found at a 99 cents store; one was a crucifix, made in China, with the words ''Betty Boop'' inscribed on the back.) And Mr. Leno didn't deviate from his usual entrance each night, in which members of the audience are herded to the edge of the stage so the star can ruffle heads and grab hands, quite like a politician at a campaign rally. The band played ''Hail to the Chief'' as Mr. Obama walked out, but like any other guest, he shook hands with the band leader, Kevin Eubanks (who wore a suit for the occasion), then shook hands and half-hugged Mr. Leno. 
 He wore a tie, unlike the days when he was a candidate, and wore a dark suit and a white shirt with the collar opened, but he spoke informally, joking about the strange restrictions imposed by the Secret Service and noting that on Marine One, the presidential helicopter, his daughters were most awed by the dish of Starburst candies.
 He had one impolitic moment when trying to make a self-deprecating joke about his bowling score of 129, saying, ''That was like the Special Olympics or something.'' (After the taping, Mr. Obama apologized for the remark.)
 Mostly, however, he stayed benign and folksy even while discussing the need to undo bonuses, fix banks and regulate credit card rates.
 And inevitably, he talked about the long-promised family dog, joking that he might not get one after all. ''This is Washington,'' he said with a sly smile. ''That was a campaign promise.''

HEADLINE: Toxic Asset Plan Foresees Big Subsidies for Investors

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, ERIC DASH and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article is by Edmund L. Andrews, Eric Dash and Graham Bowley.
 The Treasury Department is expected to unveil early next week its long-delayed plan to buy as much as $1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from financial institutions, according to people close to the talks. 
 The plan is likely to offer generous subsidies, in the form of low-interest loans, to coax investors to form partnerships with the government to buy toxic assets from banks. 
 To help protect taxpayers, who would pay for the bulk of the purchases, the plan calls for auctioning assets to the highest bidders. 
 The uproar over the American International Group's bonuses has not stopped the Obama administration from plowing ahead. The plan is not expected to impose restrictions on the executive pay of private investors or fund managers who participate.
 The three-pronged approach is perhaps the most central component of President Obama's plan to rescue the nation's banking system from the money-losing assets weighing down bank balance sheets, crippling their ability to make new loans and deepening the recession.
 Industry analysts estimate that the nation's banks are holding at least $2 trillion in troubled assets, mostly residential and commercial mortgages.
 The plan to be announced next week involves three separate approaches. In one, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will set up special-purpose investment partnerships and lend about 85 percent of the money that those partnerships will need to buy up troubled assets that banks want to sell. 
 In the second, the Treasury will hire four or five investment management firms, matching the private money that each of the firms puts up on a dollar-for-dollar basis with government money. 
 In the third piece, the Treasury plans to expand lending through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, a joint venture with the Federal Reserve.
 The goal of the plan is to leverage the dwindling resources of the Treasury Department's bailout program with money from private investors to buy up as many of those toxic assets as possible and free the banks to resume more normal lending.
 But the details have been treacherously difficult, politically and financially, and some of the big decisions are the same as those that bedeviled the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush last year.
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, provoked scathing criticism from investors in February by announcing the broad outlines of the plan without addressing the tough questions, like how the government planned to share the risk with investors or arrive at a fair price for the assets that would neither cheat taxpayers nor harm the banks.
 Although the details of the F.D.I.C. part were still being completed on Friday, it is expected that the government will provide the overwhelming bulk of the money -- possibly more than 95 percent -- through loans or direct investments of taxpayer money.
 The hope is that such a generous taxpayer subsidy will attract private investors into the market and accelerate the recovery of the country's banks. 
 The key protection for taxpayers, according to people briefed on the plan, is that the private investors will bid in auctions against each other for the assets. As a result, administration officials contend, the government will be buying the troubled loans of the banks at a deep discount to their original face value. 
 Because the government can hold those mortgages as long as it wants, officials are betting the government will be repaid and that taxpayers may even earn a profit if the market value of the loans climbs in the years to come.
 To entice private investors like hedge funds and private equity firms to take part, the F.D.I.C. will provide nonrecourse loans -- that is, loans that are secured only by the value of the mortgage assets being bought -- worth up to 85 percent of the value of a portfolio of troubled assets.
 The remaining 15 percent will come from the government and the private investors. The Treasury would put up as much as 80 percent of that, while private investors would put up as little as 20 percent of the money, according to industry officials. Private investors, then, would be contributing as little as 3 percent of the equity, and the government as much as 97 percent. 
 The government would receive interest payments on the money it lent to a partnership and it would share profits and losses on the equity portion of the investment with the private investors.
 Ever since last fall, industry analysts and policy makers in Washington have argued that the banking system's biggest problem was the huge pile of troubled mortgages and other loans on bank balance sheets.
 Risk-taking institutional investors, like hedge funds and private equity funds, have refused to pay more than about 30 cents on the dollar for many bundles of mortgages, even if most of the borrowers are still current. But banks holding those mortgages, not wanting to book huge losses on their holdings, have often refused to sell for less than 60 cents on the dollar. 
 The result has been a paralyzing impasse. Banks, unwilling to sell their loans at fire-sale prices, have had less capital available to make new loans. Mortgage investors, unable to leverage their investments with borrowed money, have been unwilling to pay more than fire-sale prices.
 To break that impasse, the government's crucial subsidy is meant to provide investors with the kind of low-cost financing that has been utterly unavailable in today's credit markets.
 Administration officials refused to comment on the details of the plan, and refused to say what kind of interest rates the government would be charging investors. But government officials have long maintained that they could charge slightly more than the Treasury's own cost of money and still offer rates far less than the private markets would demand.
 To start the program, Treasury will ask banks, like Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase, to identify pools of residential and commercial real estate loans that they will be willing to sell through an auction. Private investors will bid against each other, setting a market price. No bank will be required to participate.
 Analysts worry whether the prices investors offer will be high enough to induce the banks to sell assets. The hope is that high valuations at the auctions will increase the price of assets that remain on the books of banks, bolstering confidence in the sector. 
 Still, the Treasury Department's biggest obstacle may be the current political environment in Washington, where Democratic lawmakers are furious about the pay packages and bonuses received by executives at companies being rescued by taxpayers.
 Many investment executives said they were worried that participating in any bailout program would expose them to political wrath and potentially steep new restrictions on their own pay.
 Treasury and Fed officials have remained firmly against imposing any restrictions on pay for companies investing money in the rescue effort rather than receiving money from it.
 The plan comes as financial institutions continue to fail. Federal regulators Friday seized control of the two largest wholesale credit unions -- U.S. Central Federal Credit Union and Western Corporate Federal Credit Union -- which together had $57 billion in assets. They provide financing, check-clearing and other tasks for retail credit unions.

HEADLINE: A Slippery Place in the U.S. Work Force

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
MORRISTOWN, Tenn. -- The faithful stand and hold their hands high, raising a crescendo of prayer for abundance and grace. In the evangelical church where they are gathered, the folding chairs are filled with immigrants from Latin America.
Balbino Lopez Hernandez, who came here illegally from Mexico, closes his eyes to join the hallelujahs. But after the service Mr. Lopez, 28, a factory worker who has been unemployed since June, shares his worries about jobs and immigration raids with other worshipers.
Like many places across the United States, this factory town in eastern Tennessee has been transformed in the last decade by the arrival of Hispanic immigrants, many of whom are in this country illegally. Thousands of workers like Mr. Lopez settled in Morristown, taking the lowest-paying elbow-grease jobs, some hazardous, in chicken plants and furniture factories.
Now, with the economy spiraling downward and a crackdown continuing on illegal immigrants, many of them are learning how uncertain their foothold is in the work force in the United States. 
The economic troubles are widening the gap between illegal immigrants and Americans as they navigate the job market. Many Americans who lost jobs are turning for help to the government's unemployment safety net, with job assistance and unemployment insurance. But immigrants without legal status, by law, do not have access to it. Instead, as the recession deepens, illegal immigrants who have settled into American towns are receding from community life. They are clinging to low-wage jobs, often working more hours for less money, and taking whatever work they can find, no matter the conditions.
Despite the mounting pressures, many of the illegal immigrants are resisting leaving the country. After years of working here, they say, they have homes and education for their children, while many no longer have a stake to return to in their home countries.
''Most of the things I got are right here,'' Mr. Lopez said in English, which he taught himself to speak. ''I got my family, my wife, my kids. Everything is here.''
Americans who are struggling for jobs move in a different world. Here, it revolves around the federally financed, fluorescent-lighted career center on Andrew Johnson Highway, a one-stop market for unemployment insurance and job retraining.
One worker who frequents the center is Joe D. Goodson Jr., 46, who was laid off more than a year ago from his job at a nearby auto parts plant. Born and raised in Morristown, Mr. Goodson said his savings had run low but his spirits were holding up, so far.
Through the career center, Mr. Goodson enrolled in retraining at a technology college. He believes that the government aid system, though inefficient and overwhelmed, will give him just enough support to survive the economic storm.
''I just try to look on the positive side always,'' Mr. Goodson said. ''Work hard. Things get bad? Work harder.''
What help there is for illegal immigrants in Morristown comes mainly from churches, like Centro Cristiano Betel Internacional, where Mr. Lopez connects with a word-of-mouth network to find odd jobs.
Nationwide, Hispanic immigrants, both legal and illegal, saw greater job loss in 2008 than did Hispanics born in the United States or black workers, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Nearly half of foreign-born Hispanics are illegal immigrants, according to the center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
Some illegal immigrants who lost jobs here, mostly workers with families back home, have left the country. Most are determined to stay. Employers, wary of immigration agents, now insist workers have valid Social Security numbers. Mr. Lopez, who does not have one, said, ''Without the number, you are nothing in this country.''
Gaining a Foothold
In a paradox of globalization, immigrant workers moved from Mexico to Morristown just as many jobs were migrating from here to Mexico.
The influx here came as Hispanic immigrants were spreading across the United States, moving beyond traditional destinations in California and the Southwest to take jobs in the Northern Plains and deep into the South.
As recently as 2006 and 2007, more than 300,000 Hispanic immigrants, legal and illegal, were joining the United States labor force each year, drawn by jobs in meatpacking, construction and agriculture. They now make up nearly 8 percent of the work force.
In Morristown, a manufacturing city set among Appalachian farmland, the loss of jobs to Mexico and other countries with lower wages depressed local factory pay long before the immigrants appeared. But while the poorest American factory workers watched jobs leave, Americans with skills found new jobs in plants making auto parts, plastics and printing supplies.
The 1960 census did not record a single immigrant in Hamblen County, of which Morristown is the seat. By 2007, Hispanic immigrants and their families made up almost 10 percent of the county population of 61,829, having nearly doubled their numbers since 2000, census data show.
The immigrants started in tomato fields nearby, but by the late 1990s labor contractors were bringing migrant crews into town, to fill jobs in construction and at factories like two poultry plants belonging to Koch Foods, a company based in Illinois.
The result was a two-tier blue-collar work force. Hispanic immigrants -- many hired through temporary staffing agencies that offered no vacation pay or health coverage -- were on the bottom, in jobs where they faced little competition from Americans.
Prof. Chris Baker, a sociologist at Walters State Community College in Morristown, said many factories in the region had been able to hang on because of the immigrant workers. ''The employers hire Latinos, and after that, they leave,'' he said. ''It goes from white to black to Latino to -- gone.''
Some residents did not take kindly to the immigrants, especially the illegal ones. But their ire was not about jobs; it was mainly directed at the school board, for devoting tax money to an international center to help Spanish-speaking students learn English.
In the summer of 2006, one member of the Hamblen County Commission, Thomas E. Lowe, organized a demonstration against illegal immigrants in front of City Hall. It fizzled after the police, fearing disorder, turned out in a show of force.
Then the friction abated. The United Food and Commercial Workers won an organizing drive at Koch Foods by gaining the support of immigrants.
Mr. Lowe did not win re-election. The city chose a mayor, Barbara C. Barile, who describes herself as ''an inclusive kind of person.'' She created a diversity task force and proposed an annual immigrant fiesta. In December, she sent police officers to accompany a midnight procession through downtown honoring the Virgin of Guadalupe, the Mexican patroness.
But an immigration crackdown by state and federal authorities stirred the waters again.
A few years ago, even illegal immigrants in Tennessee could obtain driver's licenses, buy cars, open bank accounts and take out mortgages. In 2006, the state canceled a program that authorized immigrants who were not legal residents to drive.
Cooperation increased between state and local police and federal immigration agents. For illegal immigrants, minor traffic stops could escalate and end in deportation. After immigration raids in the region, employers and temporary agencies started to give closer scrutiny to identity documents.
An Immigrant's Life
One immigrant whose Morristown welcome ended abruptly was Balbino Lopez Hernandez.
After sneaking across the Arizona border at 17, he joined a brother who lived in Morristown. In 2004 he landed a job at Berkline, a furniture company known for reclining chairs whose headquarters are in town.
Mr. Lopez earned a minimum of $8.85 an hour assembling heavy metal frames for chairs and sofas. But, like other immigrants here, he measured the job against pushing a plow in Mexico. By that standard, he said, it was a ''blessing.''
At Berkline, seasoned American employees tended to avoid the physically demanding position in which Mr. Lopez was placed, at the head of an assembly line. Mr. Lopez loved the job, and before long he was one of the more productive workers on the floor. The high productivity of new immigrant workers was one reason employers like those in Morristown were glad to hire them, economists said.
Mr. Lopez's task was to swing metal bars into place, then use a noisy drill, over and over, to secure dozens of screws, nuts and washers. The bars had sharp edges, and his arms are covered with scars. Still, he was content because he set his own pace.
''Always,'' he said, ''I go to work and do my job and come home, to make myself happy and make them happy too.''
Though he is not a legal resident, Mr. Lopez allowed his name and photograph to be published because his status is known to immigration authorities.
The assembly floor operated on an incentive system: the more frames Mr. Lopez made, the more he earned. But his energy put pressure on others on the line, including some Americans who were not interested in doing more work without a raise.
Mr. Lopez, shy and soft-spoken, did well at work but poorly in love. One girlfriend, an American, three weeks after giving birth to his son, Jacob, left Mr. Lopez to raise the boy alone. Another took to drugs and was frequently in trouble with the police.
His luck changed when he met Brittany Martin, 18, a tall blonde with a level head. Last January, he decided to spruce up his cottage in preparation for marriage, so he picked up his speed at Berkline.
''I would get my sandwich and just eat there, eat and work,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''I never stopped for nothing.'' Soon he was producing three times his weekly quota of chair frames, sometimes making more than $1,000 a week, pay stubs show. Some Americans started to taunt him, calling him ''money man.''
''Why does that Mexican make so much money?'' Mr. Lopez said one worker asked within earshot.
Not long after, on June 11, a senior manager summoned Mr. Lopez, saying Berkline had been alerted that he might be an illegal immigrant. He confessed and was fired.
Mr. Lopez believes that someone, perhaps a co-worker, turned him in. Two days later, the Morristown police, citing the false Social Security number he had presented at Berkline, arrested him on charges of criminal impersonation. Although those charges were soon dismissed for lack of evidence, the police reported Mr. Lopez to federal immigration agents.
Dennis Carper, senior vice president for human resources at Berkline, confirmed that Mr. Lopez had been terminated because of his invalid Social Security number. He said Berkline did not report Mr. Lopez to the police.
Mr. Lopez is now fighting deportation. He and Ms. Martin married in July and are expecting a child in May. He was released from detention to care for his wife and son, but since he was ordered deported before the wedding, it is not certain he will be able to stay.
While his immigration case proceeds, he remains unauthorized to apply for a job. He is scrounging for bits of work, fixing cars and patching roofs, and praying at Centro Betel. It is bad, he said, but Mexico would be worse. ''In my country,'' he said, ''I'm just going to feed my family salt and tortillas.''
The Shadows
In some ways, since Mr. Lopez no longer has to hide, he has advantages over many immigrants in Morristown.
Enrique C., 48, and his wife, Rita, 38, both illegal immigrants from Mexico, learned how vulnerable their livelihood here was when both of them lost their jobs in recent months. The couple, neither of whom speaks English, asked that their full names and photographs not be published because they feared detection by immigration authorities.
During the long nights of winter, after their sons, 12 and 13, finished their homework, they turned off all the lights in the cottage they own except one bulb and gathered around a space heater. On some nights cockroaches emerged, seeking the heat.
Rita had held night-shift jobs in sweltering factories and on the chilly deboning line in a Koch chicken plant. Since she worked mainly through temporary agencies, when the crunch came she was one of the first to go.
Her husband worked from 2001 until last August at Hardwoods of Morristown, a wood-floor maker, earning $8.75 an hour splitting planks with a whirring saw. For years Enrique liked his job, and his bosses praised him, he said, for doing the work of two men.
But over time he had run-ins with supervisors, starting when they disagreed over the treatment of a wrist injury.
He complained that splinters tore his gloves. Bathrooms were filthy, he said, and the plant posted a rule limiting when workers could use them. He took photographs of clogged toilets and collected bagfuls of ragged gloves.
After seven years, Enrique, who admits he can be ornery, lost his temper one day and insulted the plant manager. The official separation notice states that he was fired for insubordination. Tim Elliott, a top executive at Hardwoods, wrote in an e-mail message that a worker who ''refuses to do a task assigned to him'' would disrupt the teamwork the company requires.
''They fired me because I started to make demands,'' Enrique said.
Once defiant, Enrique now lives looking over his shoulder and avoiding confrontation. Although his driver's license has expired, he drives a carpool with three other workers for an hour twice a day to a job he found through a temporary agency in a furniture factory for $7 an hour.
It is a job he cannot lose. He has a mortgage to pay, and he is determined to see his sons go to college. ''We're going to go along very quietly,'' Enrique said. ''We don't want to be deported.''
The Americans
At the Five Rivers Regional Career Center, the cubicles of computers with free Internet are filled every day with anxious job seekers. For several weeks in January, phones the state set up to receive applications for unemployment insurance were inundated, often giving callers only busy signals. Career center staff members did their best to help, but more than one of them said they had taken a ''cussing '' from a desperate worker.
For Joe Goodson, however, the recession is old news. He was laid off in December 2007, along with 67 other workers, after 17 years at the Morristown plant of the Lear Corporation, which makes auto seats.
One day at the career center, Mr. Goodson, a welder and United Automobile Workers member, spoke with pride of his skills. He started out as a manual welder, but through retraining he learned how to operate the metal stamping press he was running, for $17.80 an hour, when the layoffs came.
Mr. Goodson said he watched the Lear work force shrink over the years, as the company installed robots and sent manual welding work to a plant in Mexico. These days, he said, managers are only ''thinking about self.''
''It's gone away from the team thing,'' he said.
Four months after being laid off, he took an offer for retraining at the Tennessee Technology Center in Morristown, where he is studying coils and coolants to become an air-conditioning technician.
Through the career center, he collects unemployment insurance and a gas allowance, and his tuition is paid by federal Trade Adjustment Assistance funds, which support workers laid off when jobs move overseas. He squeaks by on odd jobs he does for his parents, both retired.
''I've never seen a car that didn't have a seat,'' said Mr. Goodson, who still believes that Lear will one day call him back. If not, he is ready to put his new skills to use in another career.
Because of the government support and retraining, Mr. Goodson is not considering the low-paying manufacturing jobs that Morristown's immigrants hold.
''I'm not too good to do any job that another man would do,'' Mr. Goodson said. ''But I've got many other skills.''
Other Americans in tougher spots who visited the career center said those jobs were their last resort. Donnie Parker, 45, was laid off in September from his $14-an-hour job as a skilled machine mechanic at a Koch poultry plant.
Because of a bureaucratic snag, Mr. Parker has not been able to collect unemployment insurance. After paying a mortgage for 13 years, he missed three payments and lost his house in December. He and his teenage son moved in with his 72-year-old mother. He borrowed from his sister to buy gas to make the trip to the career center. He traded his new truck for an older one, then the old truck's transmission gave out.
His only defense against the calamity is a wry laugh.
Like Mr. Goodson, Mr. Parker sees a narrow path opening before him through the unemployment system: he recently received a retraining grant. With food stamps and his income tax refund, he might just make it.
While he is waiting for school to begin, Mr. Parker is adopting a new strategy. He decided last week to apply for a few minimum-wage factory jobs that were advertised at the center, after having avoided them until now.
''I didn't know it would get this bad and last this long,'' Mr. Parker said. ''Seven dollars is better than no dollars.''
Even in the recession, he said, it would not make financial sense for him to stay for long in that kind of job. ''With my kid, I can't live on a minimum-wage job,'' Mr. Parker said. ''There is no goal to reach. You're pretty much stuck.''
Although Koch has hired more Americans this year for its poultry production lines, Mr. Parker is not thinking of going back there in a low-end job. ''It's nasty and cold,'' he said.
Hanging On
As the recession worsens here -- unemployment in this region was 11.2 percent in January, compared with 8.5 percent nationwide -- Americans and immigrants are struggling, separately, to hold on to their gains. To date, tensions over jobs have not surfaced.
Melissa B. Reynolds, the coordinator for the career center, said Americans worried about receiving their benefits and getting help finding new jobs, not about competition from immigrants.
''We don't have anyone that has any beefs with the Latino population that I've seen come and go through here,'' Ms. Reynolds said.
If the slump is long, unemployment benefits run out and the safety net wears thin, that could change. Across the country, in an industry like construction with large numbers of Hispanic immigrants where job losses have been especially steep, the fight for jobs could produce conflict.
Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research center, said that if Americans were forced to take jobs below their expectations for too long, competition -- and animus -- could increase.
''American people who are hurting economically for a long while may start to identify immigrants as the cause of that pain,'' Mr. Papademetriou said.
Mr. Parker, though he is hurting, said he did not look to place blame. ''It's not Hispanics I'm competing with,'' he said. ''It's everybody. I'm not angry at no one who's trying to find a job and work. They're doing the same thing I'm doing.''

RECESSION'S TOLL ON HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS: The recession has hit Hispanic immigrants especially hard. They have suffered more job losses than most other workers, and their earnings remain lower than those of other groups. Among foreign-born Hispanics, an estimated 47 percent are illegal immigrants. Although some of those immigrants have been pushed by the economic slump to leave the United States, most have stayed and are struggling to hold on to jobs. (Note: The unemployment rate and job loss numbers are for the fourth quarters.)

HEADLINE: Seeking a Monaco On Biscayne Bay

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
ALL across Miami, images of the real estate bust are on display -- in the empty condominium towers, the for-sale signs and the posted foreclosure notices. But on Watson Island, a diamond-shaped piece of land between downtown Miami and South Beach, there are big plans in the works.
Since November, workers have been dredging the waters and building a sea wall to prepare for a deepwater marina that will be the focal point of Island Gardens, a $640 million mixed-use project being developed by the Flagstone Property Group. The development will include two luxury hotels, private residences, a botanical garden and dozens of restaurants and boutiques. 
The ambitious project is the rare exception these days in Miami, where rampant building and speculation combined to make the city a vivid example of the real estate crisis. While the downturn has stymied many developments, the Island Gardens project seems to hark back to a sunnier time with its promise of luxury living.
Island Gardens, with Eric K. Kuhne as the architect, will cover 11 acres. The 50-slip marina, called Super-Yacht Harbour, will accommodate yachts up to 450 feet long, one of the few places around to do so.
A Shangri-La hotel will have 150 guest rooms and suites designed by Piero Lissoni. The hotel will have a pool, a 14,500-square-foot spa and views of downtown Miami. On top of the hotel will be the Residences, 98 units of one- to four-bedrooms that will be sold on a fractional basis. The price, $225,000 to $1 million for a one-eighth share consisting of 45 days a year, includes access to a small fleet of yachts. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts will manage the Residences. Another hotel is planned for the site, although the operator has not yet been announced. There will also be a series of narrow streets lined with designer boutiques and restaurants that lead to the waterfront.
City officials say they hope that the development will establish Miami as an international yachting destination -- a Monaco on Biscayne Bay -- and create hundreds of jobs to help the moribund local economy. ''I'm an absolute fan of the idea,'' said Marc D. Sarnoff, a Miami city commissioner.
For Mehmet Bayraktar, the chief executive of Flagstone Property, a little-known company based in Miami that was awarded the project by the city, it is a bold bid to make a name for the company in the United States.
''This is a rare opportunity,'' said Mr. Bayraktar, who has developed similar mixed-use projects in his native Turkey.
But there are great risks, especially in an uncertain economy. Citing the glut of condos and hotels in Miami, Lewis M. Goodkin, the president of Goodkin Consulting, a real estate and financial advisory firm in Miami, said, ''the problem is likely to worsen rather than improve.''
Half a dozen luxury hotels have opened in the Miami area in the last two years, representing more than 870 rooms. And existing luxury hotels have been refurbished recently, like the 1,500-room Fontainebleau, which underwent $1 billion in renovations.
''There are more rooms in this town than are needed,'' said Greg Masin, a senior director of retail services for Cushman & Wakefield.
Mr. Bayraktar dismisses any naysayers. Citing its desirable location and luxury yachting lifestyle, he said Island Gardens ''stands apart because it is one of a kind.'' He concedes that the downturn has slowed his financing, but says it has allowed him to save at least 10 percent on construction costs.
So far, Mr. Bayraktar said, about 20 percent of the fractional shares have already been sold at the Residences. That is in keeping with his plans, which he said from the beginning assumed slow and steady sales over four and a half years. ''We never planned that we would be sold out in two weeks,'' Mr. Bayraktar said.
In addition, he said, Flagstone is in rent discussions for about 40 percent of the 221,000 square feet of retail space.
Still, Mr. Bayraktar has already experienced some delays. He has spent eight years conducting impact studies and applying for various city permits. To date, the company has made presentations at more than 40 public hearings. There has also been a lawsuit brought by residents of a nearby island challenging the development. The suit was resolved in favor of the city and the developer.
All of that pushed back the expected completion date by more than a year, to 2012.
When the plans were drawn up eight years ago, few people would have predicted the dire state of the economy today.
In 2001, the city of Miami invited developers to submit proposals for developing Watson Island, a well-situated but underused island created in the 1920s during government-sponsored dredging to create a shipping channel for Miami. Aside from a children's museum and a wildlife park called Jungle Island -- and years ago, a base for the Goodyear blimp -- it has been largely undeveloped. Many Floridians' contact with the island has been limited to driving on the MacArthur Causeway that runs through it and connects Miami to South Beach.
The city was drawn to Flagstone's plans for various public amenities, including a palm tree-lined promenade facing downtown Miami, lush gardens to be created by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, a public arts program, and a maritime museum developed in partnership with the Historical Museum of Southern Florida.
UNDER terms of the deal, Flagstone pays the city $1 million a year in rent during construction, and will pay $2 million a year after completion.
The Island Gardens project is financed with 35 percent equity, put up by Flagstone and its partner ING Clarion Partners, a real estate investment advisory firm, that signed on in late 2007. Mr. Bayraktar says he has already spent $49 million of his own money. He says he has closed on a loan to cover the marina construction, which he will announce later this spring, and is lining up financing for the retail and hotel components.
''It takes ambition, patience and vision to move something forward like this,'' Mr. Bayraktar said.

HEADLINE: Americans Hold On to Their Cars

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
LIKE wearing sensible shoes and installing double-pane windows, hanging on to reliable, fuel-efficient cars, while nothing special during boom times, is smart during downturns.
Americans, it turns out, are keeping their cars in record numbers, depressing sales not just of new cars, but of many models of used cars, too.
The median age of cars in operation hit a record 9.4 years in 2008, up from 9.2 in 2007, while the percentage of cars taken out of circulation fell to 5.1 percent, from 5.5 percent in 2007, according to figures released on March 3 by the research firm R. L. Polk & Company. 
''People are hunkering down,'' said Dave Goebel, a consultant with R. L. Polk. ''There is great uncertainty about what the future holds, so people are going to avoid anything out of pocket.''
So many drivers are holding on to their cars and trucks that franchise dealers in 2008 for the first time secured more of their vehicles through auctions than any other means, according to Manheim Consulting, a unit of Manheim, the auto auction company.
If times were better, Ryan Moore of Los Angeles might have traded in her vehicle to get a new one. But instead she is hanging on to her reliable vehicle because of concerns about the economy.
A few months ago, Ms. Moore worried that the cost of maintaining her 2004 BMW X3 would rise because the warranty had expired. She looked at trading it in and buying a new Infiniti EX35. But the money she was offered for the X3 was well below what she had hoped. So she held on to her BMW, which has 25,000 miles on it.
''Basically, my story is just one of excess versus caution,'' Ms. Moore said. ''I don't need a new car. I've decided to wait out the storm, not get into any debt and hope I still have a job in a month.''
A separate survey of 713 vehicle owners by R. L. Polk found that 64 percent of them were ''very likely'' or ''extremely likely'' to keep their vehicles longer and 81 percent said they were going to take better care of their vehicles so they would last longer.
''Consumers are feeling right now that their car does what it is supposed to do,'' said Howard Polirer, director of industry relations at Autotrader.com, an online automotive classified listing service. ''Everyone's tightening their belts and looking at what they're spending, and that's creating this shortage.''
Even those in the market are increasingly looking to used cars rather than new. According to a survey released last week by cars.com, 32 percent of consumers thinking of buying a new car had begun looking at used vehicles instead, 5 percentage points higher than last October.
To be sure, there are tentative signs that the worst declines in used car sales have abated and that the market may have stabilized, according to some industry analysts.
But many of the cars that consumers want most in a recession -- fuel-sipping models that need little maintenance -- are still hard to find. In the fourth quarter of 2008, for instance, the 2004 Hyundai Elantra, 2003 Toyota Corolla and 2007 Honda Fit spent less than 30 days on average on used-car lots, according to a J. D. Power & Associates survey.
The Ford Fusion and Ford Escape were also in relatively short supply.
''There aren't a lot of Fusions at the auction for that reason, and those that come through are high,'' said Jack Straub of Straub Lincoln Mercury in Keyport, N.J.
The industrywide average of how long a vehicle stays on the lot before it is sold is 57 days, though many unpopular models, particularly trucks, are spending 100 days or more on used-car lots.

HEADLINE: The Costs of Owning a Car

BYLINE: By JIM MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
HOW much does it cost to own a car? Wheels readers debated that issue after I posted an article about how the recession has helped to decrease driving. I have since found that the cost of car ownership is probably a whole lot more than you think. If your estimates are based on what you paid for your vehicle, plus the cost of gas, oil and repairs, you're forgetting about insurance, depreciation, parking fees, tolls and registration, among other things. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, American ''consumer units'' (similar to a household) spent an average of $8,758 on all forms of transportation in 2007 (up 2.9 percent from 2006). We're a car-owning country, so only $537.81 of our average spending went to public transit, including taxis and air travel. The latter expenses would appear to skew the statistics because the lowest-income fifth of the population spent an average of $171.30 annually on transit and the richest fifth $1,406.45.
In 2007, a statistically average household, with an annual pretax family income of $63,091 and 1.9 vehicles, spent more on transportation than it did on clothing, health care and entertainment combined ($7,432). The average outlay for new cars and trucks was $1,571.80, but Steve Henderson, a bureau spokesman, said he expected to see that number decline because of the recession.
Owning bicycles is a comparative bargain, said Paul Steely White, executive director of the New York-based Transportation Alternatives, whose mission is to ''reclaim New York City's streets from the automobile.'' Mr. White estimated that the annual cost of owning a bicycle is $390. The average ''consumer unit'' contains 2.5 people, so family bike ownership runs $975.
The $390 annual cost, Mr. White estimated in an e-mail message, includes $200 for maintenance, $60 for replacement and upkeep of helmets and other accessories, $60 for the bike itself (a tenth of the cost of a $600 commuter bike with an estimated 10-year life span) and $70 for theft and replacement of seats, wheels and other core components, ''since this is New York.''

HEADLINE: Allonzo Trier Is in the Game

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE. 
Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent book is ''Warrior Girls: Protecting Our Daughters Against the Injury Epidemic in Women's Sports.''

 BODY:
After school on a recent afternoon, Allonzo Trier, a sixth grader in Federal Way, outside Seattle, came home and quickly changed into his workout gear -- Nike high-tops, baggy basketball shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt that hung loosely on his 5-foot-5, 110-pound frame. Inside a small gymnasium near the entrance of his apartment complex, he got right to his practice routine, one he has maintained for the last four years, seven days a week. He began by dribbling a basketball around the perimeter of the court, weaving it around his back and through his legs. After a few minutes, he took a second basketball out of a mesh bag and dribbled both balls, crisscrossing them through his legs. It looked like showboating, Harlem Globetrotters kind of stuff, but the drills, which Trier discovered on the Internet, were based on the childhood workouts of Pete Maravich and have helped nurture his exquisite control of the ball in game settings -- and, by extension, his burgeoning national reputation. 
 One of the Web sites that tracks young basketball prospects reports that Trier plays with ''style and punch'' and ''handles the pill'' -- the ball -- ''like a yo-yo.'' He is a darling of the so-called grass-roots basketball scene and a star on the A.A.U. circuit -- which stands for Amateur Athletic Union but whose practices mock traditional definitions of amateurism.
 All youth sports now operate on fast-forward. Just about any kid with some ability takes road trips with his or her team by the age of 12, flying on planes and staying in hotels. That used to happen, if at all, only after an athlete was skilled enough to play in college. Now it occurs in just about any sport organized enough to form into a league. But basketball operates at a level beyond other sports, and in recent years, the attention, benefits and temptations that fall on top high-school players have settled on an ever-younger group.
 Trier has his own line of clothing emblazoned with his signature and personal motto: ''When the lights come on, it's time to perform.'' His basketball socks, which also come gratis, are marked with either his nickname, Zo, or his area code, 206. He's expecting a shipment of Under Armour gear soon, thanks to Brandon Jennings, last year's top high-school point guard and now a highly paid pro in Italy. He is flown around the country by A.A.U. teams that want him to play for them in tournaments -- and by basketball promoters who use him to add luster to their events. A lawyer in Seattle arranged for Trier's private-school tuition and academic tutoring to be paid for by the charitable foundation of an N.B.A. player, and the lawyer also procured free dental care for Trier.
 Many of the top competitors in this month's N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, and most of the young N.B.A. players, have emerged from the culture that Trier inhabits. They made their reputations at all-star camps, where team play is hardly encouraged. To have any hope of establishing winning squads, college coaches must try to deprogram their young stars -- but only after first flattering them and granting them scholarships.
 Marcie Trier is a single mother who makes a modest salary as a social worker at a shelter for victims of domestic violence. The two-bedroom apartment she shares with her son is Section 8, federally subsidized housing. What accrues to Allonzo because of his basketball exploits leaves Marcie feeling dazzled, bewildered, seduced and wary. ''They're doing nice things for my son, things that he needs and I can't afford,'' she told me. ''So how can I say no?'' But she knows the reason for the largesse. ''If his game falls off, they will kick him to the curb. That's what makes me nervous, and I don't want it to happen.''
 Marcie, who is 33, said she has ''obsessive tendencies, and I think Allonzo's sort of the same way.'' To ensure that his basketball skills will keep evolving and he won't be cast aside, Trier practices obsessively. After about 10 minutes of ballhandling at the gym, he moved on to what makes up the bulk of his daily workout -- shooting. He must make (not just try) 450 shots a day from various spots on the floor, beginning with short- and midrange attempts, then on to shots from beyond the three-point line. His mother, who works an early shift so she can get home for these sessions, does the rebounding and keeps the tally of made shots. When he misses two in a row, which rarely happens, she subtracts one from his total. Shots that bounce off or roll around the rim before going in are not counted, which was Allonzo's idea a couple of years ago in response to his mother's belief that he should strive to ''control his own destiny.'' He figured he should train to be a dead-eye shooter rather than one who hopes for some kind of luck.
 As Allonzo practiced, Marcie, who was a gymnast and ballet dancer through her teens, wore a pink warm-up suit and flip flops, which clattered against the gym floor when one of his shots missed so badly that she had to chase it down. Mostly she just caught the ball after it came through the net and then quickly passed it back to him. The sound in the otherwise-quiet gym was rhythmic and mesmerizing -- the repeated swish of the ball as it rippled through the net, followed by a smack when the return passes hit Allonzo's hands. I could have closed my eyes and tallied the made shots just by listening.
 At one point, after Allonzo uncharacteristically missed three of four, Marcie said, ''Put more arc on it.'' He made the correction and hit the next 11 in a row. Mother and son appear to be in almost perfect sync. She never has to push him to practice, and he does not have to convince her why basketball should be at the center of their lives. They rarely disagree or argue, but a continuing point of contention is that Allonzo wants to take instruction only from his coaches. ''They know the game,'' Marcie said, ''but I see him shoot 3,000 shots a week, so I think I know his shot better than they do.''
 Putting up so many shots is a hard workout, especially since Trier releases many of them on the move, after a couple of dribbles and a juke -- as if he were trying to elude a defender. He stopped several times for short breaks and a few gulps of a sports drink. Each time, his mother rubbed an herbal ointment on his knees, which, not surprisingly, were aching.
 But this was only the beginning of his basketball day. After he made his quota of shots, which took about 90 minutes, Marcie drove Allonzo to another gym nearby, where a local high-school coach who moonlights as a private basketball tutor put him through an hourlong workout that included more ballhandling and shooting, followed by a vigorous session of one-on-one play. (These workouts occur twice weekly.) From there, they drove about 20 minutes into downtown Seattle, where he practiced for another two hours with his A.A.U. team.
 As that session was coming to an end, at about 9:30 p.m., and after he had been practicing or traveling between practices for nearly seven hours, a player pulled Trier down with an arm across the neck as he drove toward the basket. In football parlance, he was ''clotheslined.'' In the N.B.A., such a foul would be considered flagrant and the offender ejected from the game and fined. Trier picked himself up and kept playing. Marcie, watching the practice with other parents, explained to me that her son's fame makes him a marked man, even among some teammates. She felt that the perpetrator in this case was not a friend to her son and might have acted with malice.
 When Trier came over for a water break a few minutes later, he said: ''He didn't even tell me he was sorry. Don't you think he should have apologized?'' He had tears in his eyes and said his neck hurt, but mostly he just seemed like an exhausted little boy who needed to go home to bed.
 Elite basketball stands apart for two main reasons. First, prodigies do exist, and the game's cognoscenti like to believe they can identify them. If a kid is lavishly skilled, athletic and looks as if he'll grow tall enough -- and seems to possess the artistry and imagination that are the components of true basketball genius -- he may be anointed by the wise men of hoops. And some of the time, they will even be right. (Scouts are less tempted to project greatness in football and baseball, where it is often just the biggest, fastest or most coordinated kids who excel early.)
 The other reason for basketball's difference has to do with economics and incentives. Many of the best players come from poor neighborhoods and single-parent homes. The shoe companies, Nike and Adidas most prominently, along with apparel makers like Under Armour, pour money into the system, hoping to win the loyalty of kids who might become the next LeBron James. They finance the best A.A.U. teams and find ways to funnel gear to the most promising players. It's a relatively small investment for these companies, even if they make bets on hundreds of kids, but to the families it can seem like a lot -- not just the material goods but also what the attention and gifts seem to foreshadow. Think of it this way: Youth soccer may seem out of control, and here in the U.S. there's no big pot of money at the end of the rainbow, and few suburban families believe their kid's talent is going to get them to a better class of subdivision.
 Basketball has a different DNA. It's a city game, an intimate sport dense with colorful characters, some of whom invariably turn out to be nefarious. Going back to the 1940s, and as recently as the mid-1990s, college basketball has survived periodic point-shaving, or gambling, scandals orchestrated by insiders with connections to top players. Last year, an N.B.A. referee began serving a 15-month prison term for criminal charges related to gambling on games.
 Nor do college coaches as a group distinguish themselves through their ethics. Technically, they are not allowed to talk with prospective high-school recruits until June of a player's sophomore year. But in the last two years, coaches at major schools have offered scholarships to highly regarded eighth graders, which has put an even greater focus on players in Trier's age group. Tim Floyd, head coach at U.S.C., made two such offers in the last two years, and he hired the father of one recruit to be on his staff. (''College Basketball Coaches Are Now One Step Away From Recruiting Embryos,'' the Web site FanIQ headlined an article after the Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie offered a scholarship to another eighth grader last spring.)
 In January, the N.C.A.A. expanded its recruiting rules to more explicitly cover seventh and eighth graders, putting them largely off-limits to college coaches. Jim Haney, the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, explained to me why coaches were aggressively dipping into the lower grades. ''You can talk all you want about 'coaching players up,' '' he said, using the phrase for improving players through intense instruction. ''But you can only get so far with that.'' To qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament, and certainly to advance through the regionals and into the Final Four, he said, requires ''the top talent, and you go out and find it where you can. It's a competitive business.''
 N.C.A.A. recruiting rules tend to be arcane, with mystifying exceptions. For example, college coaches cannot make calls or write personal letters to players before the end of their sophomore year of high school. But they can signal their interest by sending ''questionnaires,'' without personal letters, to players of any age. When I was with Trier in Seattle, he was excited to have just received a questionnaire from Memphis, one of the premier college teams, which conformed to the rules because it did not include a personal letter. It's possible that Trier could have been a recipient of a random mass mailing, but considering his reputation, he was probably right to assume that the school's head coach, John Calipari, or someone on his staff, knew something about him. (Marcie Trier told me that she receives regular text messages from a coach with another college team, which would be an N.C.A.A. violation.)
 The recent agreements with young players lead to the question of how you offer a scholarship to a kid, and have it accepted, when you're not really allowed to communicate with him. The answer: While college coaches and their assistants cannot mix with under-age recruits at all-star camps, they can host players of any age at their own on-campus summer camps. If one of the really heralded players shows up, coach and player -- even, in theory, a second grader -- can make a deal (though it has to happen after the camp is over).
 Trier has already attended a couple of camps where he was sought out by on-campus coaches and asked if he was considering the school. At one, he told me, a coach took him aside for a private, behind-the-scenes tour of the team's locker room and then upstairs to a pavilion above the court that contained trophies and other memorabilia. ''It caused some resentment,'' according to his mother, ''because other campers saw it. Parents got upset.''
 None of this was necessarily against the rules, because these were coaches' private camps. Floyd, the U.S.C. coach, explained in an interview posted on a college-sports Web site two years ago how such innocent-seeming encounters can quickly lead from Point A to Point B and all the way to ''S'' -- a scholarship offer to a kid who has not yet begun high school. ''I think that we all recognize that young people can have great talents, and if those players have dreamed about going to your school, they tend to ask you if they're being offered a scholarship by your school,'' he said. ''And if you don't tell them that you are, then you offend them. If you tell them you've offered, sometimes you have to be prepared for them to accept it.''
 The scholarship offers are not binding on either party because they cannot be put in writing until a player's senior year. But Haney, of the coaches' association, and others say they are unwise because they bring the hurly-burly and distractions of recruiting to kids too young to handle them, and they bind parties to each other, at least verbally, well before either can know if it's a good match. The early recruiting also brings what Haney calls the ''nonscholastic influences'' to children -- shoe-company representatives and others who have a commercial interest in befriending young talent.
 I asked Haney if the rule against recruiting middle-schoolers, which he termed a ''new line of demarcation,'' will be respected. ''In this business,'' he said, ''you have people who follow the rules, you have those who want to follow them but struggle sometimes and you have a third group that sees every rule as a little speed bump. They slow down and then navigate over it.''
 In the upper tiers of elite youth basketball, it is common for fathers, if they are present, to be highly involved. They pester coaches, camp directors and scouting services for greater exposure for their sons, and they videotape games and splice together the best moments for display on YouTube. (No player on YouTube has ever missed a shot.) Those with absent fathers tend to accumulate father figures along the way -- men who may genuinely want to help, along with others who may hope to broker scholarships, share in endorsement deals or just remain part of the entourage if a player strikes N.B.A. gold.
 Steve Goldstein, general counsel in the U.S. for Tokio Marine, the Japanese insurance company, is a former small-college basketball player who spends much of his free time coaching youth basketball in New York and leading a foundation called Beyond Basketball. It offers academic assistance to players who excel at their sport but without help might fall short of the classroom standards needed to qualify for a college scholarship. Goldstein first met Trier at a basketball camp last summer in Chantilly, Va. ''I saw him play and noticed his swagger,'' says Goldstein, who has become an adviser to Marcie Trier (one of many). ''There's just something about the way he carries himself on the court. But the way I got to know him was that one morning in the hotel, he came up to me and said, 'Excuse me, sir, can I have a ride to camp?' And I just took him every morning after that.''
 Trier has never met his father, who Marcie says was her first boyfriend. She has lost touch with him. All Trier knows is that he was African-American and about 6-foot-3. Right now, Trier is 5-foot-5, slightly above average for his age, but short for a youngster with elite-basketball ambitions. ''I guess I'll be at least 6-3,'' he told me, ''but I'm hoping for maybe 6-5.'' (His mother is about 5-foot-4. She was born in the Pacific Islands but does not know much more than that because she and her twin sister were in foster care before being adopted by a family in the Midwest. She has no other children, and her only close family nearby is her sister.)
 Marcie herself has become immersed in grass-roots-basketball culture. She worries that her son does not encounter sufficient challenges close to home, expresses her opinions to his coaches and is open to opportunities for him beyond Seattle. In recent years, several players who have come through Trier's A.A.U. program, Seattle Rotary Style, have gone on to the N.B.A. But Daryll Hennings, the senior athletic director at the Rotary Boys and Girls Club, which sponsors the team, told me that Trier is flying at a higher altitude -- traveling more, competing for a greater number of teams, mixing with more out-of-town coaches and promoters, creating more buzz. ''Every year, everything gets bigger, the whole scene, and he's caught up in it,'' Hennings said.
 In just three months last summer, Trier flew on four separate occasions to the East Coast to play in events in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- in addition to making shorter excursions to Los Angeles and San Diego. When I was with him in January, his mother took a call from a coach in Southern California who wanted to fly him down for a tournament the following weekend. (She declined; he was already committed to play in Texas one week after that.) She showed me a text from an A.A.U. parent who wanted Trier's e-mail address for his son. ''I would like my son to branch out and build relationships with some of the top guards out there,'' he wrote.
 The father of a top player in New York, Jerron Love, had also been in touch and was hoping to lure Trier to a new team, one that would not practice together but rendezvous in various cities for big tournaments. I had met Jerry Love, Jerron's father, who is well known in New York basketball circles for his zealous advocacy on behalf of his son. He posts Jerron's highlights on YouTube, sends out a promotional DVD (''Just 10: Jerron Love, a k a the Golden Child'') and communicates in e-mail blizzards.
 We sat together one evening at the bar at Londel's, a soul-food restaurant in Harlem, as he scrolled through a BlackBerry on which he had seemingly downloaded the entirety of known basketball knowledge, which he was doling out to his son in their private training sessions. ''You see this right here,'' he said, showing me one of the entries. ''It tells you the three options you have on a secondary fast break -- pull up for a jump shot, find a player spotted up for a three-pointer or hit the trailer for a layup. Jerron knows this stuff, but other kids his age, they're not there yet. I put this stuff into him like a computer chip.''
 When Love got to a page describing how a defender should squeeze between a player setting a screen and the ballhandler, he became animated as he demonstrated proper positioning, bumping my shoulder and nearly toppling me from my bar stool. Others patrons were talking quietly over after-work drinks; I noticed a couple of them glance our way with looks of mild alarm.
 Marcie Trier told me she had participated in conference calls with Jerry Love, other parents and a coach about this proposed new team, but it didn't look as if it was going to come together. In my conversations with her, she occasionally relayed information that, at first, seemed beyond belief. For example, she told me she had heard that her son might be recruited to play for an A.A.U. team in Texas that travels by private jet and stays in luxury hotels. A team of sixth graders? I checked up on it: the Texas Titans, backed by Kenny Troutt, the billionaire founder of Excel Communications (and father of a team member), have traveled by private jet. At a tournament in Las Vegas, they stayed at Caesars Palace.
 Hennings told me he assumes that Trier at some point will be lured away from the Seattle Rotary program. ''I swear,'' he said, ''every time his mom takes him on a road trip, I'm waiting for that call that he's not coming back, that he's going to play for this team or that team that's gonna fly him around and all that. I wish him the best. He's a hard worker. I want him around for the duration, but I don't see it happening.''
 I met Allonzo Trier for the first time last summer, at the Adidas Junior Phenom Camp in San Diego, the premier annual gathering for pre-high-school talent. I already knew that he was considered a star among stars, and I watched a couple of his games before seeking him out. When we shook hands, he held on to mine for what seemed like 10 or 15 seconds as we began to talk, only letting go after the father of another camper tapped him on the shoulder and asked if he would pose for a picture with his son. ''Thank you,'' he said to Trier after snapping the photo. ''You're a role model, brother.''
 The Junior Phenom Camp was grass-roots basketball in distilled form -- a caldron of ambition, networking, gossip and backbiting. The players had been identified and invited to San Diego after attending regional camps. Most of the 360 campers were being charged $450 to participate. All kinds of merchandise was available for purchase, including a camp program for $25 that listed the participants and their heights, hobbies, hometowns and nicknames, which made for interesting reading. There was a G-Money, a K-Money, a Cash-Money and one young man who simply called himself Money. Two campers went by Sir, while others -- Da Truth, Superstar, Big Dog, the Chosen One -- selected handles that seemed to demand respect. (Trier's listed nickname was Zo, which is what just about everyone but his mother calls him.)
 There were plenty of middle-class kids at the camp whose families paid their way. Other players raised money to attend from individuals or businesses in their communities. Seven of the campers came from an A.A.U. program called Houston Select, coached and bankrolled by Steve Trauber, a managing director and head of global energy investment banking for UBS. ''I've got a great job,'' Trauber told me, ''so I'm lucky enough to be able to sponsor the whole team.''
 Trauber's sixth-grade team traveled to tournaments two weekends a month and played 118 games in 2008 -- 36 more than an N.B.A. team does in the regular season. He estimated that he spent more than $200,000 on travel and other expenses. The star among his sixth graders was Jesse Pistokache (White Chocolate), a six-footer who lives all the way down in the Rio Grande Valley and travels most weekends to Houston to practice with his teammates -- or join them on another flight to a tournament. ''This is our life,'' his mother, Teri Mata-Pistokache, a college professor, told me. ''You've just got to give in to it. If he wants to meet his goals in basketball, this is what we've come to understand is necessary.''
 Nearly everyone in the camp was there either to defend a high national ranking -- as was Trier, who for two years has been the top-ranked player in his class -- or to improve a ranking. The idea is to ''be on the radar,'' as one parent put it, in order to be among the players whom college coaches will want to scout. The level of cynicism among parents and even some of the kids was extreme. I heard talk that the biggest stars among the high-school players attend these kinds of camps only if they are paid -- that is, they demanded cash in addition to free travel and camp tuition. Trier himself named a New York-area high-school star who is rumored to play that game. ''He doesn't go anywhere unless he gets a minimum of $15,000,'' he said. I don't know if that's true, but it says a lot about this whole business that people believe it is and talk so openly about it.
 The campers were put on teams that played twice a day, on one of six full courts, in a cavernous gymnasium at Alliant International University that looked as if it had been an airplane hangar. Presiding over everything was Joe Keller, a former A.A.U. coach in Southern California and the president of the company that runs this camp -- as well as, he said, 277 regional camps for different age groups, for both boys and girls, in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, Japan and China.
 Keller is an imposing man, broad-shouldered and barrel-chested. Baseball was his sport as a kid, but with his big frame and goatee, he looked more like an N.F.L. middle linebacker. Keller and his staff consistently tell the kids that they are at the beginning of a long journey and should just focus on learning to play proper basketball because, after all, no one at their age can really be projected as a pro or even as a college prospect. In private, everyone lapses.
 ''Have you seen No. 109?'' Keller asked me, referring to Pistokache. ''He's a monster, isn't he?'' At a different point, he said, ''And 106?'' He was referring to another sixth grader, a skilled, smaller player but one who everyone seemed to know had a 6-foot-11 father. ''Going to be a pro,'' Keller said. ''You mark my word.''
 As I was talking with Keller just inside the gym's front door, an angry-looking man, the coordinator of referees at the camp, came rushing his way, and they quickly got into a loud, profane argument. Apparently, some officials had not shown up for their assigned games, and Keller wanted to fire the coordinator. Their dispute escalated, and Keller shouted: ''You want to take this outside? C'mon, let's go, I'll kick your [expletive]! I'll beat the [expletive] out of you.'' They marched out to the parking lot, where the other man took off his shirt and wristwatch and laid them on the hood of a car, but before they could brawl, one of Keller's other employees grabbed his arm and led him back toward the gym.
 When Keller got back inside, he muttered to me: ''You won't see him again'' and described him with a vulgarity. Then he resumed telling me about his business. ''This camp in particular is branded nationally,'' he said. ''It sells out six months in advance. We've got 900 kids on the waiting list.''
 When I asked how much money he made from his basketball endeavors, he replied: ''Not much. Not as much as you might think.'' Then he added that to the extent he does turn a profit, he pours most of it back into a charity he says he is affiliated with that benefits abused children. ''It's not about money to me,'' he went on. ''I just try to create an avenue so the kids can learn things and be something in life. It's about character, integrity, hard work, knowing the difference between right versus wrong. If they get that down, they'll have a good life.''
 The Junior Phenom event is categorized as an ''exposure camp'' to distinguish it from camps whose primary mission is teaching. But the sixth, seventh and eighth graders who attend are really performing for an audience of one: Clark Francis, the editor of Hoop Scoop, an online tout sheet, many of whose subscribers are either college coaches or parents who want to see how their kids measure up.
 Without the presence of Francis, the camp would lose much of its edge and a chunk of its paying clientele. ''They all know that Clark Francis is going to be here,'' Keller explained. ''They know coming in: you're going to get evaluated, you're going to get ranked. That's part of the branding. Without it, we wouldn't get players. But we get the best players, and they get what they pay for.''
 The Hoop Scoop editor is a man of strong opinions and snap judgments. ''It's not P.C. what I do, ranking young kids,'' Francis told me. ''I know that. Some people like it, some people don't. But if you're playing at an event and I'm not scouting it, nobody knows and nobody cares.''
 Francis, who is a short and plump 49-year-old, never played the game at even the high-school level, but he has managed to turn his passion into a vocation. He has attended 36 consecutive Final Fours, and he told me that his apartment in Louisville contains so much college-basketball memorabilia that visitors get lost in it for hours, as if it were a museum exhibit. He speaks in a torrent of words that consist almost entirely of basketball references. ''Did you hear about the Long Island Lightning?'' he asked me as we sat having lunch at an In-N-Out Burger near the gym in San Diego. I thought he was alerting me to a weather event, perhaps some unlucky weekenders struck down on a beach in Southampton. But he meant an A.A.U. team from Long Island that had just won an important tournament in Orlando.
 I walked from court to court with him at the camp as he made notes on a clipboard. His method was to see each of the dozens of teams and rank each player against his teammates, from best to worst, before working up campwide rankings. The frenetic nature of play made it difficult for me to discern quality, but Francis exuded the confidence of a handicapper who makes his bets after casting his eye on the Thoroughbreds in the paddock. ''The more times you have to keep going back and looking at a kid, the less likely it is he can play,'' he said. ''I can usually pick them out in warm-ups. Just how they carry themselves. Does the guy pass the look test? That's the first thing.''
 I asked what attributes he looks for. ''Size, athleticism, outside shooting,'' he answered. ''Bottom line is, if you don't have one of those things, forget it. Go play soccer. Have a nice life.''
 In Major League Baseball, players from the Dominican Republic, many of them raised in poverty, have a reputation as free swingers who will chase almost any pitch rather than work a base on balls. When the former Atlanta Braves shortstop Rafael Ramirez was asked during the 1986 season about why he had gone some 40 games without drawing a walk, seemingly an impossibility, he famously replied, ''A walk won't get you off the island.''
 A similar line of thinking prevailed at the Junior Phenom camp. The young players may not have known Francis's precise methods, but they seemed to have a sense that they had better do something pretty spectacular, and quickly. One morning, I watched a game involving Billy Clark III, a quick and slippery 12-year-old guard from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn who had the speed and moves to evade his defender and get off a shot at any time. Which he did -- just about every time he touched the ball. In a 32-minute game, of which he played just a little more than half, he put up 34 shots by my count.
 His father, Billy Jr., sat in the bleachers and exhorted him on. He explained to me, ''What I told him is, in this setting, you've got to establish your dominance.''
 Billy's shooting, while certainly excessive, was pretty much emblematic of how most of the young players approached their mission. They passed only as a last resort. They played indifferent defense, or none at all. To watch this up close was to gain an understanding of the roots of the decline of team play in American basketball.
 I talked to Billy Clark III after his game. He had an oddly adult way of speaking. I didn't really need to ask questions; he had things he wanted me know, as if he had been expecting to be interviewed and rehearsed his lines. ''I just want to stay humble,'' he said. ''If my head gets too swollen, I'm not going to be that good anymore.''
 He told me that he was thankful to his father, who had risked his job at an events-planning company to accompany him to this camp. His father asked him, ''What are we striving for?'' and Billy replied, ''Free education!'' Billy then added a thought that sounded like a fragment of dialogue from a 1970s after-school special: ''I'm just trying to get my family out of the ghetto,'' he said.
 One afternoon, after Francis grew irritated at having to observe too much middling talent, he said, ''C'mon, let's go watch Allonzo Trier.'' Much of his job is a chore, but Francis really enjoys watching Trier, whom he always refers to by his first and last names. ''Allonzo Trier is going to make it no matter what,'' he told me. ''And that's what makes Allonzo Trier fun to watch. He just does things right.''
 A certain kind of sports aficionado likes to feel in the know -- that he has seen, or even just heard of, some up-and-coming player before the rest of the world has caught on. A whole industry has grown up around so-called N.F.L. ''draftniks'' -- men (well, 99.9 percent of them are men) who keep track of, say, the offensive lineman from West Texas A&M who might be selected in a late round of the spring draft.
 In basketball, the real discoveries must be found among those still in middle school. LeBron James's first high-school game, in ninth grade, was eagerly anticipated by insiders, and the televising of high-school games took off during the four years he was prepping for the N.B.A. at St. Vincent-St. Mary high school in Akron, Ohio. ''The explosion in grass-roots basketball is directly related to LeBron James,'' Francis said. ''People were on him early, so everything moves back a couple of years.''
 On the court in front us, Trier was playing for a team designated ''Michigan State'' with teammates who ranged from 4-foot-8 to 6-foot-1. At first, I didn't really get all the hubbub. He was clearly a good shooter and deft passer, but the chaos of these games, with everyone desperately trying to make an impression, didn't really cast glory on anyone. The quality of play was appalling, a crime against basketball.
 But on the final day of camp, watching Trier participate in the all-star game, involving those deemed the camp's best players, I finally did start to see. The game was more organized. His teammates could anticipate his passes and move to the right spots to receive them. At one point, he sped up the court with the ball, lost a defender at half-court with a crossover dribble, reached the foul line and, without picking up his dribble, shoveled a pass with his left hand to a cutting teammate. The whole sequence, and especially the method of delivery -- off-hand, off the dribble -- was highly sophisticated.
 ''That'' said Francis, ''is classic Allonzo Trier.''
 A smallish basketball player at the pro or major-college level -- say, 6-foot-2 or shorter -- has to be extraordinarily fast to become a star. Someone like the N.B.A.'s Allen Iverson, or the budding superstar Chris Paul, may have never encountered anyone as quick as they were until they reached the pros, and even then they will meet just a handful of similarly supercharged little men. Trier looked fast to me, but there were a few others who seemed just as quick. His superiority lay more in the realm of his ballhandling, shooting ability and feel for the game, what coaches call ''basketball I.Q.''
 Clark Francis did not express any doubts about Trier's gifts. He referred several times to ''the Allonzo Trier phenomenon,'' as if it existed apart from him. At the close of the camp, he ranked Trier No. 1 in his class, just as he had in 2007.
 Francis posts rankings for players all the way through high school, and he was an enthusiastic advocate of Brandon Jennings, who opted last year to play in Italy rather than in college; Jennings is expected to be a coveted N.B.A. prospect whenever he chooses to return. Francis often likens Trier to Jennings. ''You know what Brandon Jennings's potential is, right?'' he asked me. I didn't, actually. ''Top 5 point guard ever to play the game. Does that put it in perspective for you, what I'm saying about Allonzo Trier?''
 Late in January, not long after I visited him in Seattle, Trier attended the U.S. Superior Skills Camp in Fort Worth, where, according to Hoop Scoop, he excelled again. Francis's account gushed about ''the continued dominance'' of Allonzo Trier. ''If you will recall, Trier is the jet-quick point guard that reminds us in so many ways of 6-2 Brandon Jennings, who was the consensus No. 1-ranked high-school player in the nation a year ago and is currently averaging 8.2 ppg in 10 games for Lottomatica Virtus Roma in the Euroleague and . . . just like Jennings, Trier has a flair for the spectacular. . . .''
 Comical as the overheated rhetoric may be, it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't lead a basketball-loving child to believe he is on a straight course to the N.B.A. Trier and his mother consider Francis an authority, and he praises her as ''a smart lady, not your typical nettlesome parent.''
 In San Diego, Francis counseled Marcie about the challenge Allonzo faces in living up to a top Hoop Scoop ranking. ''Brandon had to be the best player all the way through, just like LeBron James, Kevin Garnett and Sebastian Telfair,'' he said, referring to Jennings and three high-school phenoms who went straight to the N.B.A. ''That's the challenge. How do you stay up there?''
 I often hear from parents of young athletes that their kids ''started late,'' even if they joined an organized team at age 7. That's a defining element of the modern youth-sports culture, the feeling that there is always someone who has a head start or is doing more, and that there is ground to be made up. This drives the professionalism that permeates childhood sport: paid coaches leading teams that were once coached by volunteers; expensive sports tutoring; all the travel; even genetic testing to determine a child's ideal sport. The culture demands lodestars, young sports luminaries like Allonzo Trier, to show what is possible with early attention, extreme effort and money.
 The hype over Trier makes him a much-anticipated prospect in the far-off basketball future. But it also certifies him as someone due concrete benefits right now -- for example, the free, personally branded clothing he receives from the label NYICE, a Seattle-area startup. As he travels the A.A.U. and camp circuit, Trier serves as a billboard for the company. It is a form of viral marketing, the hope being that he will attract paying customers.
 Seattle has in recent years been a hotbed for young basketball talent. Several highly ranked high-schoolers, including a girl, are also wearing NYICE gear. Gerald Wright, a Bronx native who played college basketball in Seattle, owns the company. ''It's a win-win for the kids and my brand,'' he told me. ''We want other people to say, 'If Zo's wearing it, I want to wear it.' Meanwhile, he's got something unique. I don't think LeBron had a logo in middle school. I don't think Kobe did. To the young man, it's a way of saying, you've worked hard, so good things will come to you. I don't see it as exploitative or taking advantage, and the moment I did, I would get out of it.''
 (Active N.C.A.A. athletes cannot accept gear and other items, but athletes who are in high school or younger can take just about anything but cash without endangering their college eligibility. Steve Mallonee, the N.C.A.A.'s managing director for academic and membership affairs, said even if his organization wanted to, it couldn't enforce rules at below the college level because it would have a hard time disseminating its guidelines.)
 The more important benefits flowing to Trier concern his academics. Over the summer, tests revealed why he had been reading at well below grade level: he is dyslexic. In A.A.U. ball, he competes as a seventh grader, but academically, he's in sixth grade because he was held back a year. (Francis includes him in the class of 2014, the age group in which he plays, but he's really the class of 2015, the year he should graduate from high school.)
 Rich Padden, the Seattle lawyer and investor who arranged for Trier's schooling, said he set about addressing his educational needs after hearing from Steve Goldstein and another coach in New York who had taken an interest in Trier's basketball and academic progress and had flown him in to play tournaments. Padden arranged for Trier's testing, private tutoring and tuition to be paid for by the charitable foundation established by Brandon Roy, a star with the Portland Trail Blazers. Padden served as a mentor to Roy in high school, as well as to another N.B.A. player from the Seattle area, Martell Webster. (Padden is also an investor in one of the major manufacturers of basketballs, so Trier, who goes through a lot of balls, has a reliable source for more.)
 ''Allonzo is the first beneficiary of the Brandon Roy Foundation, hopefully the first of hundreds or thousands,'' Padden said. ''He fit our criteria. We would have supported him even if he were not a basketball player.''
 Trier's tutor wants to work with him three days a week, but so far Trier has been able to fit in only two sessions a week because of his busy basketball schedule and his limited enthusiasm for them. When his mother asked what would motivate him to be more excited about the tutoring, he answered: more basketball instruction. Private coaches were hired to teach him to play ''lockdown defense'' and to further refine his shooting. He made 95 of 100 foul shots for his new shooting coach, who identified flaws in his form and said that if they were fixed, Trier could consistently make 98 out of 100.
 When I asked Trier about school, he said, ''It's hard for me because I'm not the smartest kid.'' But that was not my impression of him at all. Whenever we talked, he displayed a lively curiosity. He had an ease in dealing with people, adults as well as kids. But basketball is clearly easier for him than school.
 Marcie Trier, in her travels through the male-dominated world of youth basketball, gets a lot of unsolicited advice. People have told her to take her son out of the Pacific Northwest and go to New York or Texas, where he'll get better competition and more exposure -- which seems to be particularly poor counsel since he's already the most heralded player in the history of sixth-grade basketball, and Brandon Roy and others have already proved that being from Seattle is no barrier to becoming an N.B.A. multimillionaire.
 Others suggest that she should pull Trier away from the spotlight and pare back his basketball schedule. Trier is already being circled by men whose motivations must be constantly assessed. In the coming years, dozens more will come around, and Marcie and Allonzo will have to make some keen character assessments.
 ''I worry about him,'' says Hennings, the athletic director at the Rotary Boys and Girls Club in Seattle. ''I worry about injuries. I worry about his knees. I worry about all the people around him. I tell his mom all the time, 'No one does something for nothing.' I'm sorry, but some of these people are going to want something down the line. Some of this stuff could come back to bite him. I'm trying to stay in Allonzo's life and give him the team thing, but I've said to them, if you want to explore all that stuff, you're on your own.''
 How much is too much is an unanswerable question in sports. The childhood training routine maintained by Michael Phelps would have driven nearly any other promising swimmer back to dry land. The laserlike focus of the young Tiger Woods was a singular gift, and his practice routine with his father may be replicable, if at all, once in a generation.
 It could be that for Trier, taking 450 shots a day, seven days a week, along with the rest of his arduous schedule, is a terrific undertaking that will pay dividends in basketball success and happiness. His joints and spirit will hold up, and he'll attain his dreams. It is just as likely that he would be as good and have as bright a future by taking 200 shots a day, with Sundays off.
 His current lofty status does not confer future success -- or protect against the consequences of being a great player at 13 who, by 19, is perceived as having failed to live up to expectations. If becoming a coveted college prospect and signing with a big-time N.C.A.A. program is an endpoint of sorts, Trier has a long time to maintain his standing. By the time he starts playing college basketball, a second Obama administration could be winding down.
 Marcie Trier is correct in thinking that his game must not fall off. Her son might not be ''kicked to the curb,'' but the smart basketball set would move on and find other objects of affection. He has to grow taller. And he has to avoid being swallowed up within the netherworld of grass-roots basketball.
 Trier, steely in competition, otherwise exudes a sweetness and a concern for others that is rare among top-level teenage athletes. As I watched him one day going through his workout in the gym at his apartment complex, he caught sight of a younger child in an adjacent room who was swinging dangerously from a piece of weight-training equipment. ''Mom!'' he yelled as he abruptly let the basketball fall to the floor. ''You've gotta go over there and make her get off of that.'' She went over and told the little girl to climb down.
 For the rest of his practice, Trier kept glancing in the direction of the weight room, worried that the girl would climb back up and lose her grip.

HEADLINE: A Pillar Falls, a Plaque Remains

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
EVERYONE entering the Center for Jewish History, on 16th Street west of Union Square, passes through a metal detector. And everyone who arrived at the center on Monday night wearing a coat was required to check it, a procedure that stirred some grumbling. 
 If any members of the capacity crowd arriving for the night's literary reading happened, between the metal detector and the coat check, to glance to the left, they saw a wall covered with the names of donors, hundreds of them, under the heading ''Guardians.'' In the bottom right corner was an inscription that, lately, has a discordant ring: ''The Bernard L. and Ruth Madoff Foundation.'' 
 A few people spotted it at the beginning and the end of the night, and their winces and groans brought to mind an old lament: With guardians like these, who needs predators?
 The center is a nonprofit consortium that relies on donors for its survival, but its director of special projects, Judith Siegel, said the center was not directly hurt by the fall of Mr. Madoff, the disgraced financier. Many other Jewish organizations that had invested with Mr. Madoff or taken his donations were hurt, though, and that, combined with the generally dismal economy, has fostered worries about the future.
 ''Trying to raise funds in the Jewish community now is like trying to pick fruit after a hurricane,'' said Alan Adelson, founder and executive director of the Jewish Heritage Project, a sponsor, with the center and the American Jewish Historical Society, of Monday's reading. ''The trees are stripped bare, and if they're not, the fact that the storm has occurred gives people a very ready reason to decline.''
 Still, Mr. Adelson said, there remain some Jewish philanthropists who are rising to the occasion. That narrative -- weathering adversity, holding together and enduring -- would not have been out of place in the reading, whose title was equally in sync with the times. The three-event series was called ''The Lifecycles of New York Jews,'' and Monday's topic was ''Love and Loss.''
 The passages that were read, some by their authors and all with the help of actors who voiced the lines of certain characters, were from disparate parts of the New York -- and the Jewish -- experience. Selections included a meditation on bird-watching in Central Park, a memoir of a marriage transformed by memory loss, a love story set against the backdrop of the Holocaust and two bracingly prickly family conversations.
 ''We sifted through an incredibly rich vein of literature,'' Mr. Adelson said. ''We knew that New York Jewish culture has produced a marvelous culture of literature, but we didn't realize how broad and deep that literary vein went.''
 What the organizers did, added Michele Zackheim, a writer who helped with the selection process, ''is we fought for three months over which ones we were going to use.''
 There was uneasiness, Mr. Adelson said, about presenting some of the more delicate issues for public consumption, such as Jewish attitudes toward money or the hard, bitter humor that can pepper interactions between relatives.
 ''Can we engage that kind of stuff without offense?'' Mr. Adelson said. ''Can we put it forward honestly and entertainingly and let everyone experience openly what it is? Are these sort of family secrets that we're airing?''
 As it happened, the program was staged four days after Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 felony charges, amid harsh words from investors who said he had betrayed clients, friends and the New York Jewish community, of which he was once a prominent part. Mr. Madoff was in jail awaiting sentencing as attendees walked past his name on Monday. 
 The characters given voice in the reading, from authors including Joseph Heller, Nicole Krauss and Alix Kates Shulman, may be fatalistic, even caustic, but they are survivors. Their determined resilience, Mr. Adelson said, is a part of the community's ethos that comes through in literature and in life.
 ''When I grew up, I always heard stories about how my grandmother boiled the same soup bone day after day to feed eight children,'' he said. ''That kind of heroic resilience is what the New York Jew is being called upon now to summon, to deal with this financial challenge.'' 
 Mr. Adelson was talking about event scheduling but could have been speaking much more broadly when he added: ''It's tough going. But we endure.''

HEADLINE: When 'Deficit' Isn't a Dirty Word

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell, is a visiting faculty member at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 BODY:
ARE you confused about whether large federal budget deficits matter? 
 No wonder, when disagreement about deficits is popping up everywhere. Even among Republicans, there is no unity on this basic issue. Defending his recent proposal to freeze government spending, Representative John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, said, ''We simply cannot afford to mortgage our children and grandchildren's future to pay for this big government spending spree.'' But Martin Feldstein, the Harvard economist, disagrees. An adviser to the past three Republican presidents, Professor Feldstein warns that failure to run large deficits would prolong the current economic downturn.
 Because important policy decisions hinge on whether deficits matter, this is an opportune moment to take stock of what we know. The good news is that there is little disagreement among economists who have studied the issue. The consensus is that short-run deficits help end recessions, and that whether long-run deficits matter depends entirely on how government spends the borrowed money. If failure to borrow meant forgoing productive investments, bigger long-run deficits would actually be better than smaller ones. 
 In 1929, President Herbert Hoover thought that the best response to a collapsing economy was to balance the federal budget. With incomes and tax receipts falling sharply, that meant cutting federal spending. But as almost all economists now recognize, President Hoover was profoundly mistaken.
 When a downturn throws people out of work, they spend less, causing still others to be thrown out of work, and so on, in a downward spiral. Failure to use short-run deficits to stimulate spending amplifies that spiral, causing further declines in tax receipts and even bigger deficits. That this path makes no sense is a settled issue. 
 But what about long-run deficits? To think more clearly about them, we must recognize that carrying debt is costly. The government can pay just the interest on its debt each year, or it can pay interest plus some additional amount to reduce the principal. The yearly payment is clearly greater in the second case, just as a homeowner's monthly payment is larger with a 10-year mortgage than with a 30-year one. But the total burden of the various repayment options (in technical terms, their ''present value'') is exactly the same. It's a simple trade-off between intensity of burden and duration of burden.
 No matter which option we choose, money spent to service debt can't be spent for other things we value. But that doesn't mean we should always borrow less. The main issue is what we do with the borrowed money. 
 If we simply use the money to buy bigger houses and cars, deficits make us unambiguously worse off in the long run. That's why the explosive increase in the national debt during the Bush administration was a grave misstep.
 Trillions of dollars, many of them borrowed from China, financed tax cuts for the wealthy, who spent much of their added wealth on things like bigger mansions. But beyond a certain point, when everyone builds bigger, the primary effect is merely to raise the bar that defines the size of home that people feel they need. Much of the interest we'll pay on debt incurred during the Bush years is thus money down the drain.
 In contrast, borrowing for well-chosen investments doesn't make us poorer. Road maintenance is a case in point. Failure to repair roads in a timely way could mean eventually spending two to four times as much for the work. Even ignoring the fact that timely repairs would reduce the substantial vehicle damage from potholes, it would be much cheaper to borrow the money and do maintenance on schedule.
 It's also useful to put the nation's debt burden into perspective. Over the last eight years, Bush administration deficits raised the national debt by almost $5 trillion. Given the current crisis, it's easy to imagine a similar increase during the next four years. At recent interest rates, servicing $10 trillion of extra debt costs about $400 billion annually -- a big amount, to be sure, but less than 3 percent of the economy's full-employment output. We'll still be the richest country on the planet even after paying all that interest.
 Once the downturn ends, there should be no need to incur additional debt. Indeed, there are many ways to pay down debt without requiring painful sacrifices. A $2 tax on each gallon of gasoline, for example, would generate more than $100 billion in additional revenue a year. Europeans, who pay more than $2 a gallon in gasoline taxes, have adapted by choosing more efficient cars -- and they appear no less satisfied with them. 
 We could also levy a progressive consumption surtax, which would not only generate additional revenue to pay down debt or finance additional public investment, but would also stimulate private savings by diverting money from those over-the-top coming-of-age parties that the wealthy stage for their children.
 Notwithstanding the neo-Hooverite talk from stimulus-program opponents, the current deficit isn't too large. If anything, it may need to be even larger to revive the economy. In the long run, new sources of tax revenue could keep deficits from growing and could even pay down existing debt. But if the political system cannot figure out how to pay for productive investments with tax revenue, we'd still end up richer, on balance, by making those investments with borrowed money.

FAMILY PROPERTIES
 Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America
 By Beryl Satter
 Illustrated. 495 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $30
 Historians who write about close friends or relatives do so at their peril. Personal engagement, so essential to the memoir, can confound historical judgment and scholarly detachment, especially when family honor hangs in the balance. Beryl Satter, the chairwoman of the history department at Rutgers University in Newark and the proud daughter of one of the central characters in ''Family Properties,'' has taken the hard road to glory in her study of race and housing discrimination in Chicago during the 1950s and '60s. Yet somehow she has managed to stay on course, using her considerable investigative skills and unwavering sense of fairness to write a revealing and instructive book. 
 She begins with the complicated story of her father, Mark Satter, a Jewish lawyer and landlord who represented ''scores of African-Americans who had been grossly overcharged for the houses they had bought.'' His legal and real estate interests centered in Lawndale, a traditionally Jewish neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago that became overwhelmingly black by the late '50s. Lawndale, like many other urban black enclaves, was the scene of widespread and systemic economic exploitation, exacerbated by the Federal Housing Administration's practice of redlining predominantly black neighborhoods, which effectively eliminated mortgage insurance within their boundaries. 
 In cities like Chicago, redlining forced a vast majority of black homeowners and tenants into the vulnerable world of ''contract selling,'' in which unscrupulous speculators dictated onerous terms that often led to default and social pathology, simultaneously reinforcing black stereotypes and white racism. The ''lack of equal access to credit,'' the author explains, had profound ramifications: ''fabulous enrichment for speculative contract sellers and their investors, debt peonage or impoverishment for many black contract buyers and an almost guaranteed decay of the communities in which such sales were concentrated.'' Once we recognize the full impact of contract selling, she insists, it becomes clear that ''the reason for the decline of so many black urban neighborhoods into slums was not the absence of resources but rather the riches that could be drawn from the seemingly poor vein of aged and decrepit housing and hard-pressed but hard-working and ambitious African-Americans.'' 
 ''Family Properties'' is a tale of race and class, but it is not a simple story of white power and black victimization. Irony and ambiguity abounded in a system that often pitted blacks against blacks and sometimes drove men like Satter's father into moral confusion and financial peril. Indeed, much of the book documents the rising resistance to an unjust system rooted in racial segregation and poverty. Beginning with her father's truncated legal efforts -- he died of a heart attack at the age of 49 in 1965 -- Satter traces the community-organizing campaigns of a host of activists, from Saul Alinsky and Martin Luther King Jr. to a series of lesser-known but no less committed individuals. At times, the characters and organizational abbreviations are dished out in mind-numbing proportions, and the specific story lines are not always easy to follow. But no one can accuse the author of glossing over the messy details of life on the ground in Chicago. Neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, slumlord by slumlord, she takes us through the complex realities of racial division, economic exploitation and local politics.
 The final chapters focus on the widening reform efforts of the late '60s and early '70s, especially the protests organized by the Lawndale-based Contract Buyers League, a grass-roots organization that helped to expose the F.H.A.'s instrumental role in redlining. The league initiated two landmark federal lawsuits, and in 1972 the formation of a broad coalition of housing activists known as National People's Action set the stage for meaningful reform at the national level. In 1975, Congress passed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and two years later it followed up with the Community Reinvestment Act. Together these laws eliminated some redlining and made life more difficult for predatory speculators, though, as Satter points out, neither measure offered a definitive solution to the problem of racially discriminatory credit practices. 
 As the continuing subprime mortgage crisis demonstrates all too well, the long-term effects of what happened in Lawndale and other black communities a half-century ago are still very much with us. Today we have too many mortgages rather than too few. But the underlying realities of a nation plagued by chronic debt and persistent racial inequality remain the same. A cautionary tale of governmental complicity, ''Family Properties'' follows the social historian's dictum of ''asking big questions in small places.'' It reminds us that history and memory are essential tools for anyone pondering our current predicament.

HEADLINE: Harley, You're Not Getting Any Younger

BYLINE: By SUSANNA HAMNER

 BODY:
SPUCK BENNETT'S dealership just outside Ocean City, Md., is cluttered with 65 shiny Harley-Davidson motorcycles, including the chrome Sportster and the sleek V-Rod. Last year, Mr. Bennett, 79, sold 200 bikes, down from 280 the year before. This year, sales have slowed to a crawl.
 ''I haven't seen anything like this in the 33 years I've owned a dealership,'' he says. ''We're just trying to survive.'' He has cut expenses by trimming hours and overtime, and laid off 7 of his 49 employees.
 After riding high for two decades, the company that makes the hulky bikes that devoted riders affectionately call Hogs is sputtering. Harley's core customers are graying baby boomers, whose savings, in many cases, have gone up in smoke in the market downturn. Few are in the mood to shell out up to $20,000 or more for something that is basically a big toy, and the company, in turn, has not captured much of the younger market. 
 And though Harley's woes pale in comparison to what the automakers face -- Harley's revenue dipped 2 percent last year while Detroit was crashing -- overproduction and loose lending practices have burdened the company's finances.
 In a pattern similar to that of the housing bust, Harley goosed sales by luring many buyers with no-money-down loans. A subsidiary created about 15 years ago, Harley-Davidson Financial Services, made those loans and packaged them into securities to sell to investors. As the credit market skidded, so did this subsidiary.
 As much as one-fourth of the $2.8 billion in loans issued by Harley-Davidson Financial Services last year were subprime, with interest rates as high as 18 percent. As the downturn took hold, some borrowers started defaulting on loans and investors stopped buying the securities, forcing Harley to write down $80 million of debt last year, analysts said. Although it recently tightened lending standards, the company is still chasing buyers by offering credit.
 ''It's an unsustainable strategy to continue financing this way,'' says Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS. ''In the last few months, they've been running into a liquidity wall.''
 Tom Bergmann, Harley-Davidson's chief financial officer, defends the company's lending practices. ''It's not easy in this environment,'' he said. ''We have to give loans to customers, but only to those worthy, and we've been disciplined and prudent in granting credit to our customers.''
 In large part because of loan problems, though, profits at Harley fell 30 percent last year, to $654.7 million on revenue of $5.6 billion. Operating income of the financial subsidiary fell 61 percent, to $83 million. 
 CONCERNS about Harley's future grew after the departures of its two top executives were announced. In December, Jim Ziemer, 59, said he planned to retire as C.E.O. this year. In early January, the company announced that Saiyid Naqvi, the head of the finance unit, was resigning after less than two years at Harley. Since September, Harley's stock has plunged 70 percent, to under $13, compared with a 36 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500. 
 Like many cash-tight companies, Harley, based in Milwaukee, is finding that borrowing is difficult -- and expensive. In early February, Harley announced that Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's company, would buy $300 million of its unsecured debt. (Harley reported total debt of $3.9 billion last year, more than double what it held in 2007.) In exchange for his good name and millions, Mr. Buffett demanded 15 percent interest from Harley on his investment (similar to deals he received from Goldman Sachs and General Electric when he invested in those companies last fall).
 Harley's largest investor, Davis Selected Advisers, matched Mr. Buffett's deal, pumping $300 million more into the company, also at 15 percent interest.
 But even $600 million isn't enough to enable the financial arm to continue making loans through year-end. Company executives announced that the finance unit needed a total of $1 billion for loans. While that's one-third lower than last year, the executives are bracing for plummeting sales and continued frozen securities markets. 
 Congress included the motorcycle industry in a Treasury Department program intended to unclog financial markets by lending to investors buying securities backed by mortgages and other types of loans. It was uncertain, however, how much Harley would receive -- and when -- making this an unreliable source of capital. And while Mr. Bergmann said he had met with several banks since doing the Berkshire and Davis deals, he had not yet announced any new loans.
 Harley's road has perhaps never looked so hazardous. 
 If the company can't obtain new sources of money to offer loans to customers, they will have to try to borrow elsewhere. But in this credit crisis, qualifying for a loan isn't easy. A lack of credit would probably depress bike sales even further, which in turn would make it harder for Harley to repay Berkshire and Davis. 
 ''If the securities market continues like it is, then Harley faces very serious issues,'' says James Hardiman, senior research analyst at FTN Midwest, a brokerage firm in Cleveland. ''Harley has been able to find different sources of funds, but the securities market is the only way they can unload the debt from their books.''
 Mr. Ziemer, Harley's chief, says: ''We have a strong business that's anchored by an iconic brand. But as we look at 2009, it'll be a challenging year for the business.''
 HARLEY has lived through troubled times before. The company is 106 years old, after surviving the Great Depression and a major blow in the 1970s when sales grew sharply for cheaper bikes from Japanese makers like Honda and Kawasaki. The company even flirted with bankruptcy in 1985 as its foreign rivals soared.
 But Harley persevered by capitalizing on its revered brand, made famous in movies like ''Easy Rider,'' and more recently by appealing to boomers' desire to recapture their youth.
 When customers buy a Harley, they're instantly a member of a family of zealous fans -- guys with tattoos and unruly hair as well as lawyers and doctors. (The average household income of today's rider is about $87,000.)
 The company's Harley Owners Group program, founded in 1983, has more than one million members who come together for rallies and rides, swapping their favorite touring stories and chatting about new product lines.
 ''Harley brings together all walks of life,'' says Mark-Hans Richer, Harley's chief marketing officer. ''You'll find a neurosurgeon talking and riding with a janitor. It's a family.''
 By building such a powerful brand with offbeat, behind-the-scenes efforts -- little advertising, lots of accessories and minor visible changes to bikes over the decades -- Harley has become a case study for academics, marketing gurus and other corporations. But Harley's longtime strategy of marketing to the boomers, which was a blazing success, is now backfiring.
 Its core customers have grayed, and they are buying new bikes less often. The average age of a Harley rider is 49, up from 42 five years ago. But company executives don't seem outwardly worried by the lackluster growth among those 35 and younger, even as it takes steps to turn them into Harley owners.
 They say they're confident that the baby-boom generation has 15 more years of riding life. ''They're not about to stop riding because they're getting older,'' Mr. Richer says. ''It would be dumb to walk away from our core customer, the most lucrative customer.''
 As Harley keeps most of its focus on its aging consumers, rivals like BMW, Honda and Yamaha are attracting younger customers who seem less interested in cruising on what their old man rides. United States sales of light sport bikes, intended for the younger crowd, have increased more than 50 percent in the last five years, and the Japanese makers have popular cruisers of their own. Harley has roughly 30 percent of the overall United States motorcycle market, but it accounts for half of the heavyweight bikes sold in America.
 To attract new customers, Harley created the Rider's Edge program in 2000, offering training for inexperienced riders through more than 160 dealers in 42 states. Last year, about 35,000 people took the course.
 In an effort to make inroads with bikers in their 20s and 30s, Harley poured money into developing the V-Rod, a high-powered cruiser that starts at about $15,000. The company says the V-Rod is successful, but even so, the sport market represents only 12 percent of Harley's sales, analysts say.
 ''Harley understands the baby-boomer consumer incredibly well, in a holistic sense,'' says Gregory Carpenter, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. ''But to grow and thrive, they must create a deep emotional connection with younger consumers.''
 A DECADE ago, Harley executives made a decision that, along with the loan push, now appears to be a major contributor to its current problems. Determined to appease consumers who were stuck on two-year waiting lists, the company ramped up production. Last year, Harley built more than 303,000 bikes, up from 159,000 in 2000.
 Some dealers also took advantage of heightened demand for Harleys to charge more, a move that may have done long-lasting harm. ''Dealers were charging more than the suggested manufacturer price and it made Harley look greedy and jeopardized our brand that we spent a long time building,'' Mr. Ziemer said. 
 Now, with so many Hogs in the marketplace, Harley has an issue involving its brand.
 ''Traditionally, Harley-Davidson had a very loyal consumer,'' says Anthony Gikas, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. ''But those riders lost interest in the brand because everyone has a Harley bike. It's not a club anymore.''
 To offset weakening sales, Harley is paring production this year, to about 270,000 bikes, and is shuttering two plants. In addition, the company will cut 1,100 of 9,000 jobs over the next two years.
 To curb additional loan defaults, Harley adopted stricter credit standards in November, requiring buyers to put down 20 percent.
 Motorcycle consultants and analysts argue that Harley should take more drastic steps, including beefing up efforts to court younger riders. 
 Making major changes isn't easy, especially for a brand with an image so deeply ingrained in pop culture. Harley executives say they are committed to regaining their momentum. 
 ''We're encouraging our designers to think out of the box,'' Mr. Ziemer said. ''We have to be quicker, more responsive to what our customers want. And we will.''

HEADLINE: Appraising The Appraiser

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
SHOULD you care about how much money your appraiser makes?
 That question is at the heart of a dispute in the mortgage industry, pitting independent appraisers against established banks, which in recent years have built vast networks of affiliated appraisers, through appraisal management companies. 
 Appraisers who work on behalf of these companies typically receive less pay than those who do not. Some appraisers say the lower fees mean consumers are less likely to get a high-quality appraisal, which could jeopardize their loans. 
 It is a claim with which banks strenuously disagree. ''Obviously, it's in a lender's best interest to have the most accurate appraisal possible,'' said Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Bank of America, ''and it's in the homeowner's best interest, too.''
 Borrowers, though, pay the same amount no matter who orders or conducts an appraisal. In the New York region, for example, an appraisal of a single-family home will cost around $300 to $500. But independent appraisers say that when a big bank orders an appraisal, it typically pays the appraiser about $200 of that fee and pockets the rest.
 Mr. Francisco of Bank of America would not disclose the compensation of the bank's affiliated appraisers. The bank employs 700 staff appraisers and relies on another 10,000 independent appraisers to do work on its behalf. All of the appraisers, Mr. Francisco said, are licensed and certified, and their work is inspected to ensure they comply with professional standards.
 But that may not be a sufficient proxy for local market knowledge, said David Adamo, the chief executive of Luxury Mortgage in Stamford, Conn. Over the last several months, he said, he has seen appraisal management companies offer the work to low bidders and hire appraisers ''from two counties away from the subject property.''
 ''They're in a county they're not familiar with, so they'll use comparable sales from inferior or superior markets than the one the subject property is located in, just because it's in the same town limit,'' he said.
 In some cases, he said, a home's true market value might be underestimated. ''And that prevents homeowners from refinancing, and saving money in today's low interest rate environment,'' Mr. Adamo said.
 Zachary Kimmel, an owner of William Paul Appraisals in Tarrytown, N.Y., performs appraisals for big banks and smaller lenders and brokers who do not use appraisal management companies. He would not disclose how much he is paid, but he said appraisal management companies generally pay $200 per assignment. ''Most of the mortgage work now goes through the big banks and appraisal management companies,'' he said, ''so now the lion's share of our work is this cut-rate kind of thing.''
 But appraisals have become more complex, Mr. Kimmel said, given the declining housing market and new requirements from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government agencies that buy mortgages from lenders. He said the increased work and the decreasing compensation could eventually affect the quality of appraisals industrywide.
 Broad efforts, meanwhile, are being made to protect homeowners during the appraisal process.
 As a result of an agreement last year involving Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, lenders selling loans to Fannie and Freddie must follow stricter guidelines starting in May to ensure that people involved in processing loans do not also choose appraisers. A lender's in-house appraisal company may still do the work, but only if that appraiser is chosen by someone not helping to evaluate or underwrite the loan. 
 In the meantime, Mr. Adamo of Luxury Mortgage, said borrowers should ask prospective lenders pointed questions about how they select appraisers. 
 ''Find out if they'll use an appraiser who is located in your immediate market area,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Sale to Benefit Charity And Thrifty Brides-to-Be

BYLINE: By ARIANA GREEN

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Kellie-Jeanne Smith, a bride-to-be from Roslindale, made a big decision Friday.
 ''With the economic situation, we decided to change our wedding date and downsize the whole thing,'' said Ms. Smith, 31, an office manager for an online media company who said she was trying to cut her wedding budget by half because of uncertainty over her financial future. ''It was a stressful afternoon.'' 
 But that night, she said, a neighbor gave her a shopping tip about a two-day bridal gown sale at a Goodwill in the Roxbury section of Boston. About 1,200 designer dresses donated by a local retailer and valued at as much as $7,000 for a single dress would be sold for $80 to $250. 
 Ms. Smith, who will marry in September, was at the store Saturday morning with her fiance. She was second to last in line at 7:57 a.m. but was first to check out, at 8:25 a.m., with a gown designed by Emerald for $250. From her research online, she estimated that the dress was worth more than $1,000.
 Even in good economic times, brides are often looking for bargains. 
 Boston is the original site of the best-known and first blowout bridal sale at Filene's Basement, which started in 1947. The sale is called the Running of the Brides because the event, which features designer dresses starting at about $250, inspires tugs of war for dresses and leaves frenetic brides-to-be with no time for dressing rooms stripping down in the aisles. 
 Now the economic downturn is pushing many brides to do more with less.
 With the deep discounts, Goodwill was prepared for a Filene's-type horde. It hired two Boston police officers and four security guards to help the 20 employees and volunteers overseeing more than 25 racks of dresses in the store's large auditorium.
 But perhaps because of the chilly 30-degree weather, the crowd numbered only about 50 people when the doors opened at 8 a.m. All were well behaved as they filed inside to be greeted by balloons and clapping staff members. By 9 a.m., 200 people had arrived, and by noon, 350, with more steadily streaming in. 
 The store sold about 110 dresses for roughly $17,000 by the end of the sale, at 3 p.m., said James Harder, a Goodwill spokesman. About 500 people had visited, Mr. Harder said.
 Some buyers had also anticipated a large crowd, so they arrived in the wee hours and camped out in the parking lot. Aleksandra Ivanovoska, 23, a student from Maine, and her fiance, Rob Roberson, 25, a painter, who are to marry in July, arrived by 3:30 a.m. but stayed in their car until around 7, when they lined up behind about 15 people. 
 First in line was Sarah Burdulis, 25, a kindergarten teacher from Somerville, who brought what she described as a ''crazy, pokey hat'' to wear so that her entourage -- her parents and her younger brother -- could find her if it turned into a zoo inside.
 ''Dad carries, Mom finds the right size and my brother does what he's told,'' said Ms. Burdulis, who is planning a wedding in May 2010. 
 But the family left empty-handed at 9:30 a.m.
 Others had more success. After trying on about 20 dresses in two hours, Susan Brown, 31, an assistant attorney general from Somerville, bought a dress for $80. She brought a friend who offered diplomatic feedback like, ''That looks nice, but I don't know if it's what you're looking for.''
 ''I want to find something that doesn't look like a craft box threw up on it,'' said Ms. Brown, whose wedding is set for September. ''I don't go for the tight mermaid thing.''
 Ms. Brown managed to find a simple dress with a sash and lace on the top. ''My dress looks just like the couture dresses I tried on in expensive shops,'' she said.
 One couple from Brazil bought 11 dresses to sell there, and another couple bought 7 dresses to sell in Africa, Mr. Harder said. 
 Shoppers learned about the Goodwill sale mostly from radio and newspaper advertisements and at Shecky's Girls Night Out events, evenings of fashion and beauty product sales that offer to ''cure your recession depression.''
 Mr. Harder said all proceeds from the bridal sale would go toward Goodwill's job training and other programs. 
 Joanne Hilferty, the chief executive of nine Goodwill stores in Massachusetts, said a goal was to bring in about $50,000 from the sale, which continues on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Plan Raises Public Housing Hopes

BYLINE: By JEFFERY C. MAYS

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
 MESSIAH KNOTT misses having neighbors at the 34-unit public housing development near Route 78 that he shares with his mother and brother.
 Next door to his brick town house on Chadwick Avenue, in one of the roughest neighborhoods here, is an identical town house whose windows are covered with plywood. Nineteen of the town houses in the development have been boarded up for at least three years. 
 ''It's nice to have people around to look out for one another, like if my little brother comes home from school and no one is home he can go to the neighbor's house,'' said Mr. Knott, 21, as he headed to work one recent afternoon.
 The chief administrative officer for the Newark Housing Authority, Tory Gunsolley, said that many of the town houses are damaged by fire or need so many repairs that they are uninhabitable without a gut renovation. The agency has undergone so many years of federal funding cuts that there was little money to make the repairs, he said. 
 All of that changed recently when the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that at least $4 billion from President Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus plan would be headed to housing agencies in the form of capital improvement funding. The money is part of a $13.6 billion package to help stem the tide of foreclosures, provide jobs, make public housing more energy efficient and help development projects stalled by the credit crisis.
 With a rush of money headed their way, area housing agencies are fine-tuning their projects and hoping that the money will help reverse the negative effects of years of funding cuts. 
 In this severe economic downturn, the affordable housing provided by the federal government is more of a safety net than ever to low-paid and laid-off workers, agency directors say.
 ''For those of us who have been trying to keep this affordable housing resource in a time of increasing demand, to have a reinvestment strategy is critical,'' said Sunia Zaterman, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities in Washington. ''We see this money as a down payment for that.'' 
 New Jersey's 80 public housing agencies will receive at least $104 million in capital grants. The Newark Housing Authority, the largest in the state, with 23,000 people in 8,000 units, will receive $27 million. State housing agencies nationwide will also share at least $2.25 billion in federal money designated for tax credit bonds to complete low-income housing projects in impoverished areas with high rates of foreclosures or unemployment. 
 New Jersey is to get $61 million from that fund. Paterson will receive $4.8 million in capital funds. Trenton will get $4.6 million and Camden is getting $4.2 million.
 Newark expects to spend the largest single chunk -- about $6.3. million -- to repair vacant town houses like the ones on Chadwick Avenue.
 Because many housing authorities are often the largest providers of affordable housing in their cities, improving existing properties can save energy and stimulate the economy through the purchase of supplies and labor.
 ''For every dollar spent in capital funds, it generates over $2 in direct and indirect spending in those communities,'' said Ms. Zaterman, citing a study the group commissioned by the Econsult Corporation of Philadelphia. 
 Mr. Gunsolley said the investment would put between 600 and 1,000 vacant units back on the market and would create jobs for local workers and sales for area businesses.
 ''We have contracts with Home Depot and Lowe's, but some of the smaller, local vendors know what we have and they carry it. A lot of this work is going to involve us going down to the union hall and saying, 'We need guys who can gut this apartment,' '' Mr. Gunsolley said. ''It's a triple win of putting people to work, buying a lot of different goods and creating a place to live for a family.''
 Long before President Obama signed the economic recovery bill into law, Maria Maio, executive director of the Jersey City Housing Authority, began compiling what she calls ''the list.''
 It was a catalog of all the projects that could meet the goals spelled out in the federal stimulus plan. The list of projects includes replacing boilers, installing new windows, even adding solar panels. Ms. Maio also wants to replace a dilapidated 300-unit development with brand-new housing -- a project that is stalled because of the credit crisis.
 ''I don't know anybody that doesn't have a list. The larger housing authorities have been preparing for this day for a long time,'' said Ms. Maio, whose agency provides housing for 8,000 people and is to receive $7.9 million in capital funding. ''I'm more optimistic than I've been in the last eight years.''
 Public housing has been underfunded for some years. From 2000 to 2006, public housing agencies received $6.7 billion less in federal funding than they needed to operate, according to federal government estimates. 
 The capital needs backlog has been estimated at a minimum of $32 billion. 
 Despite the lack of funding, public housing remains valuable. The Econsult study put the replacement value of the nation's 1.2 million units of public housing, including the land, at $162 billion. Low-paid workers in industries like food service and retail also depend heavily on the rent subsidies provided by the federal government.
 Utility costs have become one of the New Brunswick Housing Authority's biggest expenses. Because the agency is prohibited from charging people more than 30 percent of their income for rent, repairs and improvements have been postponed in the wake of a 30 percent budget cut.
 ''We desperately need this money to do capital improvement projects because our housing stock, some of which dates to the 1950s, is aging,'' said John Clarke, executive director of the New Brunswick authority. The agency is to receive $1.28 million in capital funding.
 Mr. Clarke said he was cautiously optimistic that some of the stimulus money could help plans to replace a 10-story, 60-unit building for the elderly on Neilson Street in downtown New Brunswick that was built in 1960. The building is convenient for people who like the proximity to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, public transportation and shopping, but it has reached the end of its lifespan.
 ''The elevator breaks down every other day,'' Mr. Clarke said.
 The agency has drawn up plans to replace the building with up to 120 units of public housing and mixed-income units, but ''no one can do the deal,'' said Mr. Clarke.
 The tax credits that the authority is offering are not enough to make the project financially feasible, he said.
 ''We have no reserves, and the cities don't have the money, either,'' Mr. Clarke said. 
 Here in Newark, a 120-unit building sits vacant at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Spruce Street. The housing authority purchased it while it was in foreclosure in 2007. 
 Just up the block is a vacant lot that was once the site of Brick Towers, the public housing project where Mayor Cory A. Booker once lived. Plans are progressing to turn it into ''the Towers.'' ''Restoring the grandeur of High Street,'' reads a banner posted at the location, invoking the former name of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
 New town houses with names like City View Landing and Cottage Place sit just a block away, but authority officials believe a $16 million renovation of the vacant Spruce Street building is the key to development of the entire corridor. 
 ''It is a foreclosed property standing on one of the most prominent streets in town. It's not helping anyone in its current state,'' Mr. Gunsolley said. ''We are ready to spend.''

HEADLINE: Neo-Neo Realism

BYLINE: By A.O. SCOTT. 
A.O. Scott, a chief film critic at The Times, last wrote for the magazine about the impact of the small screen on the movies.

 BODY:
IT IS NOW ALMOST A YEAR SINCE ''Wendy and Lucy'' played in Cannes -- not a watershed moment in the history of cinema, perhaps, but a quiet harbinger. Kelly Reichardt's third feature, about the struggles of a young woman and her dog stranded in an Oregon town en route to Alaska, was certainly among the more admired films in a strong festival, where it showed out of competition. But by the time it opened in New York last December, the movie, a modest, quiet, 80-minute study in loneliness and desperation, seemed like something more -- not so much a premonition of hard times ahead as a confirmation that they had arrived. 
 ''Wendy and Lucy,'' with Michelle Williams in one title role (the other belonged to Reichardt's dog), had a successful art-house run and found its way onto many critics' year-end best-of lists (including mine). There was some talk of an Oscar nomination for Williams, who was so believably ordinary in her look and so rigorously un-actressy in her manner that you could easily forget her celebrity. But ''Wendy and Lucy,'' released by Oscilloscope Laboratories, a small and ambitious new distributor started by Adam Yauch, a member of the Beastie Boys, would have looked a little awkward alongside the other Academy Award nominees. It's true that the big winner, ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' concerns itself with poverty and disenfranchisement, but it also celebrates, both in its story and in its exuberant, sentimental spirit, the magical power of popular culture to conquer misery, to make dreams come true. And the major function of Oscar night is to affirm that gauzy, enchanting notion.
 The world of ''Wendy and Lucy'' offers little in the way of enchantment but rather a different, more austere kind of beauty. And while Wendy, at the end of the film, is poignantly, even devastatingly alone, the film itself now seems to be in good company. This spring, as the blockbuster machinery shifts gears from ''Watchmen'' to ''Wolverine,'' a handful of small movies from relatively young directors are setting out to expand, modestly but with notable seriousness, the scope of American filmmaking. 
 ''Goodbye Solo'' is the third feature directed by Ramin Bahrani, a New York-based filmmaker whose previous movies, ''Man Push Cart'' and ''Chop Shop,'' explored corners of the city rarely acknowledged by Hollywood. In the weeks following its debut at the end of this month, Bahrani's movie will be joined by -- and, given the beleaguered state of distribution for noncommercial movies these days, may have to compete with -- Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden's ''Sugar'' and So Yong Kim's ''Treeless Mountain,'' each a second feature. All of these films -- like ''Wendy and Lucy'' and Lance Hammer's ''Ballast,'' which came out last fall -- were highlights of the 2008 film-festival calendar, showing up at Cannes, Sundance, Toronto and elsewhere. 
 The lives they illuminate, of fictional characters most often played by nonactors from similar backgrounds, are not commonly depicted on screen: the Senegalese cabdriver in Winston-Salem, N.C., whose friendship with a customer is at the center of ''Goodbye Solo''; the aspiring baseball player in ''Sugar'' who is transplanted from the Dominican Republic to rural Iowa; the African-American shopkeeper in a sparsely populated stretch of the Mississippi Delta whose grief is the dominant mood of ''Ballast''; the two very young Korean girls abandoned by their mother in an unfamiliar provincial town in ''Treeless Mountain.'' But these people and their situations are nonetheless recognizable, familiar on a basic human level even if their particular predicaments are not. And if the kind of movie they inhabit is not entirely new -- the common ancestor that established their species identity is a well-known Italian bicycle thief -- their unassuming arrival on a few screens nonetheless seems vital, urgent and timely.
 WHAT KIND OF MOVIES do we need now? It's a question that seems to arise almost automatically in times of crisis. It was repeatedly posed in the swirl of post-9/11 anxiety and confusion, and the consensus answer, at least among studio executives and the entertainment journalists who transcribe their insights, was that, in the wake of such unimaginable horror, we needed fantasy, comedy, heroism. In practice, the response turned out to be a little more complicated -- some angry political documentaries and earnest wartime melodramas made it into movie theaters during the Bush years, and a lot of commercial spectacles arrived somber in mood and heavy with subtext-- but such exceptions did little to dent the conventional wisdom. 
 And as a new set of worries and fears has crystallized in recent months -- lost jobs and homes, corroded values and vanished credit -- the dominant cultural oracles have come to pretty much the same conclusions. Remember the '30s, when we danced through the Depression with Fred Astaire and Busby Berkeley and giggled amid the gloom with Lubitsch and the Marx Brothers? (Not many of us do, of course, which makes this kind of selective memory easier to promote.) Then as now, what we wanted most was to forget our troubles. In recession, as in war -- and also, conveniently, in times of peace or prosperity -- the movies we evidently need are the ones that offer us the possibility, however fanciful or temporary, of escape.
 Maybe so. But what if, at least some of the time, we feel an urge to escape from escapism? For most of the past decade, magical thinking has been elevated from a diversion to an ideological principle. The benign faith that dreams will come true can be hard to distinguish from the more sinister seduction of believing in lies. To counter the tyranny of fantasy entrenched on Wall Street and in Washington as well as in Hollywood, it seems possible that engagement with the world as it is might reassert itself as an aesthetic strategy. Perhaps it would be worth considering that what we need from movies, in the face of a dismaying and confusing real world, is realism. 
 In 1940, Otis Ferguson, the plain-spoken film critic of The New Republic, saw unbounded democratic potential in this still-young art form's connection to the everyday. ''Like the novel,'' he wrote, ''the fiction film is wide open to anyone who can use it to advantage. Unlike the novel . . . it has taken all of actual life to be its province.'' By ''all of actual life,'' Ferguson meant the ordinary modes of existence idealized in the political idioms of the time as belonging to the common man. The faithful representation of ''the majority of people'' was the very substance of what Ferguson grandly called ''the promise of the movie in America.''
 But in the decades that followed, American movies had other, gaudier promises to keep. Which is not to say that realism was altogether forsaken as a practice or an ideal -- it strutted its hour on the Broadway stage with Arthur Miller and Elia Kazan in the '40s and '50s, and some of its theatrical cachet migrated briefly from there to Hollywood. But more radical and innovative cinematic explorations of ''actual life'' occurred elsewhere, most notably in Italy, where filmmakers during and after the Second World War, driven by a mixture of necessity and inspiration, invented Neorealism. 
 Their methods included the casting of nonprofessional actors, often portraying characters close to their real selves; the use of unadorned, specific locations and an absorption in the ordinary details of work, school and domesticity. Some of the first Neorealist masterpieces -- Roberto Rossellini's ''Open City'' and ''Paisan,'' for example -- were stories of war staged in the immediate aftermath of the fighting. But it was in the late '40s, a moment of economic crisis and political turmoil, that the movement achieved its characteristic form in movies like Luchino Visconti's ''Terra Trema'' (1948) and Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief'' (1948), an international sensation at the time and still perhaps the single best known Neorealist work. 
 These movies, made by directors closely (if not always comfortably) aligned with the Italian Communist Party, concerned themselves with the plight of the poor, in Visconti's case a family of Sicilian fishermen, in De Sica's a Roman man fighting to keep himself, his wife and their young son from destitution. Neither ''La Terra Trema'' nor ''The Bicycle Thief'' is exactly subtle in its politics: they paint a somber picture of a society ruled by exploitation, mistrust and an imperious bureaucratic state. But if they were merely didactic -- simple indictments of the system or hymns to the nobility of the proletariat -- the postwar films of Visconti and De Sica would now most likely be regarded as historical curiosities rather than as artistic touchstones. Their art lies not in their messages but in their discovery of a mysterious, volatile alloy of documentary and theatrical elements. Simple, fablelike tales unfold to the beat of quotidian rhythms -- the morning bustle and noontime stillness of Roman streets; the implacable movement of the tides on a primordial stretch of coastline -- and the faces of characters show not only emotion but also the natural reserve of people whose dignity is at stake. The ''star'' of ''The Bicycle Thief,'' a steelworker named Lamberto Maggiorani, is hesitant and inarticulate in ways that capture, with a gravity few professionals could approximate, the character's struggle to maintain some control over his circumstances.
 That character, Antonio Ricci, wants to work and finds a job pasting movie posters to empty stretches of roadside wall. He gets the job because he owns a bicycle, and when it is stolen, everything else starts to unravel -- Antonio's status as a father and a husband, his confidence in the efficacy of the law and the decency of other people, his ethical grounding. Antonio's dream of autonomy, humble as it may be, is cruelly untenable -- a fate he shares with the fishermen of ''La Terra Trema,'' whose attempts to own and operate their boats founder in the face of social injustice, poor planning and plain bad luck. Though these stories end in disappointment, they are somehow the opposite of depressing. Neorealism rests equally on the acknowledgment that life is hard and the recognition that life goes on, that there is something in human nature that will persist in the face of defeat. 
 In the '50s and after, Visconti and De Sica -- and Italian cinema generally -- moved on, to bigger stories and more elaborate productions. The Neorealist impulse, however, proved remarkably mobile and adaptable. It might be thought of less as a style or genre than as an ethic that finds expression in various places at critical times -- touching down in Bengal in the '50s and early '60s and infusing the work of Satyajit Ray; migrating through Brazil in the '60s, Senegal in the '70s and '80s and Iran in the '90s; surfacing in the recent waves of post-Soviet cinema from Romania to Kazakhstan. But in the United States, Neorealism has sent up only fragile shoots, popping up at the edges even of what is habitually and somewhat misleadingly known as independent film. Historians will point to outliers like ''The Exiles,'' Kent MacKenzie's 1961 drama about Native Americans living in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles, or Charles Burnett's ''Killer of Sheep'' (1977), a small masterpiece steeped in the details of black working-class life in Watts. These films, and a handful of others like them -- David Gordon Green's ''George Washington'' (2000) and Jim McKay's ''Our Song'' (2001) serve as more recent examples -- offer not only bracing, poetic views of real life but also tantalizing glimpses of a cinematic tradition that might have been. Their local, intimate narratives remind you that, in spite of the abundance of American movies, there is an awful lot of American life that remains off screen.
 ''The Exiles'' and ''Killer of Sheep,'' long known more by reputation than firsthand, were recently revived in theaters. Burnett's film is finally on DVD, and MacKenzie's will be later this year. The timing of their availability -- and the appreciative attention they received from critics and cinephiles -- hardly seems coincidental. American film is having its Neorealist moment, and not a moment too soon.
 ''WHY SHOOT THIS WAY?'' That was the question Ramin Bahrani, the 34-year-old director of ''Man Push Cart,'' ''Chop Shop'' and ''Goodbye Solo,'' asked when I sat down with him in the back corner of a West Village cafe on a frigid afternoon not long ago. It was our third meeting. Two weeks earlier, we ate lunch together at a noisy Dominican restaurant in a workaday, relatively unhipsterized corner of Williamsburg not far from his apartment, and more recently I spent most of a day following Bahrani from a classroom at Columbia University, where he was teaching a graduate course on directing, to a downtown screening room, where he was checking the color on new prints of ''Goodbye Solo.'' On those occasions, our conversations had ranged far and wide. We had discussed Dostoyevsky and Persian poetry, the logistics of location shooting and the mysteries of effective casting, the shortcomings of ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and the virtues of ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.''
 But it seems we had not quite gotten to the heart of the matter, and Bahrani, politely reversing the usual protocols of journalist-subject relations, e-mailed me to request a further interview. Tall, thin and stoop-shouldered, with a calm voice and gracious demeanor that only partly disguise an almost-feverish intellectual intensity, Bahrani greeted me with the question I had been asking myself somewhat obsessively over the past few years, inspired by the appearance of movies like ''Chop Shop'' and ''Man Push Cart'' at festivals and on art-house screens. ''Why realism?''
 When ''Man Push Cart'' surfaced in 2006, those who saw it had the experience of discovering something that they couldn't quite believe hadn't been done before. The film follows a Pakistani immigrant named Ahmad -- played by Ahmad Razvi, whom Bahrani discovered in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, home to many South Asian cabdrivers and pushcart vendors -- through the dramas and routines that define his working life. Ahmad, who operates a coffee cart, is hardly an unusual figure on the streets of New York but rather the kind of guy nearly everyone who works in a Midtown office building has encountered many times. He is also a dreamer, a lover, a hustler, a former pop singer and, not incidentally, a Muslim man making his way through a city still gripped by post-9/11 anxiety. 
 But if ''Man Push Cart'' can fairly be described as an immigrant's story, a home-front tale from the War on Terror, it is none of these things in the usual way. It is not, in other words, a parable of the melting pot or a lesson in tolerance. And even though Bahrani's subsequent films are also about immigrants working their way toward some version of the American dream -- a Dominican doing odd jobs amid the low-rent mechanics and auto-body repair technicians of Willets Point, Queens, in ''Chop Shop''; an African man ferrying passengers through the North Carolina night in ''Goodbye Solo'' -- their multiculturalism is not a theme but a fact.
 Bahrani describes these characters as outsiders, but in a sense that designation is as much existential -- the image conjured by the title ''Man Push Cart'' was inspired by Albert Camus's ''Myth of Sisyphus'' -- as sociological. Bahrani, whose parents emigrated from Iran before he was born, grew up in Winston-Salem, with only a few other Persian families in the area. In 1998, Bahrani went to Tehran, planning a six-week stay in his parents' homeland, which he had never visited, and ended up living there for almost three years. He was, he says now, amazed by the complexity and energy of the city, the way it scrambled all different types of people together and forced them to deal with one another. ''This is the part of New York that reminds me of Tehran,'' he said to me one windy afternoon as we walked east under the train tracks in Williamsburg. He did not mean the demographic particulars -- a smattering of arty establishments among the bodegas, chop shops and dollar discount stores, with blue-collar Latino blocks flanking one side of the avenue and Hasidic enclaves on the other -- so much as the hectic, patchwork ambience of work and idleness, affluence and hardship. 
 In Tehran -- whose metropolitan area has almost double the population of New York -- this atmosphere was overwhelming, he said, and he tried to make his first feature there. It was going to be an urban romance, ''something like what Wong Kar-wai did in 'Fallen Angels.' Not like an Iranian movie at all.'' After Sept. 11, it proved impossible to secure financing for such a movie. Bahrani came back to America and, as he put it, instead of making ''a Taiwanese-style movie in Tehran,'' set about shooting ''an Iranian-style movie here in New York.''
 ''Man Push Cart'' is just that, which is to say that it shows the influence of Iranian filmmakers like Abbas Kiarostami and Amir Naderi, who refined the old Neorealist spirit through the 1990s and into the next decade. Most of the scenes in the film take place outdoors, and while there is a clear, poignant story, it takes shape not through expository dialogue but through gestures, actions and details that the camera absorbs in long, patient shots. 
 ''Chop Shop,'' released last winter, is, if anything, even more deeply Iranian in mood and method, in part because its protagonist is a child -- something of a hallmark of Kiarostami's mid-'90s work in particular -- and also because it seems at once utterly naturalistic and meticulously composed. The main characters are Ale (short for Alejandro), an energetic 12-year-old, and his older sister, Izzy (short for Isamar), who comes to stay with him in his makeshift quarters above the car-repair shop where he does odd jobs. There is no back story -- no flashbacks or conversations about how they arrived at this state of virtual orphanhood in the shadow of Shea Stadium -- and, at first, only the whisper of a plot. 
 A conventional way to explain what this movie feels like is to say that it's like a documentary, but this is misleading. To some degree, the sense of uninflected realness comes from the authenticity of the setting. Bahrani and his cast and crew spent months in the area of Willets Point, known as the Iron Triangle, and some of the workers and business owners in the neighborhood appear in the film. But Bahrani also spent a long time rehearsing with Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales, the amateur actors who play Ale and Izzy, and when it came time to shoot, he pushed them through 20 or 30 takes of each scene. Every camera movement, nearly every bit of incidental business -- a plastic bag blowing along a dark, empty street like a tumbleweed; a pigeon fluttering into the frame -- was blocked out, controlled, adjusted, repeated. 
 All of this, he explained, was in the interest of clarity -- the necessity of communicating, at any given point in the story, what the characters are doing and why. It was a notion Bahrani impressed rigorously, perhaps even ruthlessly, on his students at Columbia, whose three- or four-minute scenes (drawn from longer scripts they had written) he took apart shot by shot, word by word. His insistence on the tiniest details of camera movement, expression and composition was a reminder to them -- and also to me -- that transparency, immediacy and a sense of immersion in life are not the automatic results of turning on a camera but rather effects achieved through the painstaking application of craft. 
 And movies, even as they take their audiences on virtual journeys into hidden pockets or unexplored reaches of experience, are also frequently responses to other movies. ''Goodbye Solo,'' for instance, is in part an answer to, or a variation on, some of the themes and problems suggested by Kiarostami's ''Taste of Cherry.'' That film, which shared the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1997, explores the uneasy bond between a driver and passenger, one of whom turns out to want the other's help in committing suicide.
 A similar relationship is at the center of ''Goodbye Solo,'' in which Solo begins to suspect that a regular customer, a crusty old Southerner named William, is preparing for his own death. But the link between ''Solo'' and its precursor is not one of quotation or allusion -- the viewer who has not seen Kiarostami's movie does not miss anything essential in Bahrani's; nor is the moviegoer who spots the connection rewarded with the self-admiring frisson that comes, say, when you decode a King Hu or Godard reference embedded in a Quentin Tarantino film. 
 ''In Persian culture there's something called tazmin,'' Bahrani told me, ''which is a longstanding tradition of poets taking one line or one beat or one idea from an earlier poem, picking it up and putting it in their own poem and going on from there.'' His own borrowings are not acts of imitation or homage but rather attempts to absorb and extend what other filmmakers have done. And you can see a similar process of appropriation and modification going on in ''Wendy and Lucy,'' for instance, which seems to pick up an idea from De Sica's ''Umberto D'' -- a lost dog as symbol and symptom of an increasingly heartless society -- and follow it from the bustle of Rome into the silence of the Pacific Northwest. And Reichardt's film, based on a story by her frequent collaborator Jonathan Raymond, also shows some affinities with ''Rosetta,'' Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne's groundbreaking and relentless 1999 film about a young working-class Belgian in a state of stubborn, futile revolt against her circumstances.
 ''Rosetta,'' whose heroine is unforgettably vivid and not entirely sympathetic, was the movie that inspired ''In Between Days,'' So Yong Kim's debut feature, an almost painfully intimate immersion in the life of a Korean girl drifting through adolescence in a wintry North American city. Kim, who started out as an experimental filmmaker, was drawn into narrative filmmaking partly through the example of her husband, Bradley Rust Gray, also a director. To make her second film, ''Treeless Mountain,'' Kim, who came to the United States when she was 12, returned to her family's hometown in Korea. The story -- two sisters must learn to cope with life as unwelcome wards of their moody, alcoholic aunt -- had been on her mind for some time, but it was ''Nobody Knows,'' a 2004 film by the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, that persuaded her to try to bring the story to the screen. ''Nobody Knows'' is also about abandoned children -- four kids left by their mother to fend for themselves in a small Tokyo apartment -- but the inspiration Kim drew from it was as much practical as thematic. That Kore-eda managed to draw such delicate, authentic performances from very young children encouraged Kim to try something similar. 
 ''I was in Toronto, with 'In Between Days,' '' Kim said in an interview, ''and I saw Kore-eda, and I went up to him and asked him: 'How did you do it? How did you work with those kids?' '' The language barrier prevented her from getting the answer she wanted -- ''he was giving all these long answers, and the translator turned around and said, 'Kore-eda san says, ''Everything is good with Super 16,'' ' and that was it!'' -- but further research helped her figure out what to do once she found the right children. The girls who play the sisters, 5 and 7 when shooting started, did not know anything about the story they were enacting. ''We set up rules, like a game or something,'' Kim explained. ''There were four or five rules: You can't look at me, you can't look at the camera, you can't leave the set until I say 'cut' and you have to repeat whatever I say, with all the other rules still applying.''
 From this simple, mechanical process, a luminous, poignant story takes shape. And the accessibility of the story, the vividness of the emotions within it, is an important feature of the kind of realism that Kim and her peers practice. ''Treeless Mountain'' is not a difficult or an obscure movie. Nor, for all its lyricism, is ''Ballast,'' in which Lance Hammer uses the reticence of his actors and the strangeness of the Delta landscape to lay bare complex, primal feelings of loss, loyalty and fear. And ''Sugar,'' Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden's new movie, is in some respects a classic sports picture, its narrative engine the familiar, quintessentially American drive to make it in the big leagues. You will recognize a lot of what you see, if you take the time to look.
 AN INTEREST IN MOVIES from other countries is too often, even among people who should know better, taken as a sign of snobbery, an overrefined devotion to the esoteric and the difficult. There may be some commercial benefit as well as creative satisfaction in aspiring to be the next Tarantino or Scorsese -- or even the next Spike Lee, Kevin Smith or Wes Anderson. But to set out to be the next Dardenne Brothers, the next Kore-eda or the next Kiarostami is to court stares of incomprehension from your peers and polite demurrals from financial backers. American filmmakers who decline to follow the standard career path, in which a low-budget, independent debut leads to festival exposure and, eventually, work for hire in Hollywood, are themselves outsiders of a kind, subsisting on the edges of the entertainment marketplace. This marginality is a challenge for filmmakers -- some of them, like poets and novelists, support themselves between projects by teaching, as Bahrani and Reichardt do. But it is also, more important, a loss for the moviegoing public, which finds itself at once glutted with choices and starved for meaning. There are so many movies. How do we know which ones matter? 
 Nearly every movie, good or bad, commercial or independent, asks a version of that question: What matters? It's a big question sometimes most effectively addressed on a small scale. ''Goodbye Solo'' is a film that, in its final moments, contemplates death, nature and the fragility of human identity in an indifferent universe. But it is also the story of a man striving to improve his lot, to move up, quite literally, from taxi-driving to a career as a flight attendant. This ambition is not just a matter of better working conditions or more money; work is never only about those things. Solo's upward striving is an expression of his optimism, which in turn is crucial to his sense of himself as a man, a husband and stepfather, a friend and, though he would never put it so bluntly, an American. 
 Similarly, the main narrative of Lance Hammer's ''Ballast,'' like that of ''Goodbye Solo,'' is not directly concerned with money or work. It dwells on the stricken reaction of Lawrence, a stolid bear of a man (played with heartbreaking stoicism by Micheal J. Smith, another remarkable nonprofessional) to the suicide of his twin brother and his subsequent rapprochement with the brother's son and former wife. But at the center of this family drama is the store Lawrence and his brother owned, a small commercial enterprise whose continued existence becomes a tangible metaphor for enigmatic, ungraspable questions of life and death.
 Money is never just money; a job is always more than a job. In ''Chop Shop,'' young Ale is saving to buy an old van that he plans to convert into a food-vending truck, in effect an expanded version of Ahmad's coffee cart in ''Man Push Cart.'' Once this happens, everything will fall into place; Ale and his sister will have the comfort and security that is so evidently lacking in their lives. Wendy in ''Wendy and Lucy'' is, like Ale, almost entirely preoccupied with money. The notebooks where you might expect to find a young woman's spiritual reflections or earnest love poems are instead filled with numbers. Wendy is budgeting her supply of cash, calculating how much will go for food and gas. Once she reaches Alaska, Wendy hopes to find work in a fish-canning factory. After that, everything will be fine. 
 The young Dominican pitcher in ''Sugar'' may seem, at first, to harbor a loftier, more glittery dream -- he is working for a shot at the major leagues -- but it is based in some pretty earthbound desires. He wants to help his mother finish a small addition to her low-ceilinged, cinder-block house, and to give her a new table. He might also want fame, glory, money and women -- he is 19, after all -- but these are expressions of that basic impulse to get ahead. 
 I don't want to spoil any plots, but if you have read this far, it will hardly surprise you to learn that, in these movies, dreams generally do not come true. Antonio Ricci never did recover his bicycle. 
 ''They all of them, in a way, can be connected to the myth of Sisyphus,'' Rahmin Bahrani said to me, as our conversation ranged from his own films to those of his peers and precursors. ''Because it's like, that's it: you will push the stone up to the top, and it will come back down again.'' In contrast, Bahrani said, Hollywood wish-fulfillment tales -- or the faux-independent dramas of adversity followed by third-act redemption -- did not strike him as hopeful at all. ''They just don't make any sense,'' he said. ''They create massive confusion.'' To which his own films (and films like ''Ballast,'' ''Wendy and Lucy,'' ''Sugar'' and ''Treeless Mountain'') might serve, in their very different ways, as an antidote. Not because they offer grim counsels of despair or paint lurid tableaux of desperation but rather because they take what has always seemed seductively easy about moviemaking -- the camera can show us the world -- and make it look hard. Their characters undergo a painful process of disillusionment, and then keep going. The disappointment they encounter -- the grit with which they face it, the grace with which it is conveyed -- becomes, for the audience, a kind of exhilaration. What happens at the end of a dream? You wake up.

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
The board of our 273-unit co-op wants to replace our union cleaning service with a nonunion service to save $35,000 a year, although the board acknowledges that our present service performs admirably. Facing rising costs, the board stresses its duty to stay within its budget and hold down monthly fees. Is the board acting ethically? What can residents do if they disagree with it? JOAN GREENFIELD, BOSTON
 The board's proposal is a dubious first step. It should instead begin by negotiating with the current service, seeking to preserve good union jobs without busting your building's budget. In tough times like today's, some unions have agreed to renegotiate their contracts. (See Detroit.) Dissenting tenants should express their willingness to pay a bit more rather than squeeze the cleaning crew. It would cost each unit only $10.68 a month to make up that $35,000 -- about 36 cents a day -- less than the cost of a daily candy bar (and it can't be healthful to eat all that candy). 
 Here's another way to phrase the issue: Should sacrifices be made only by the poorest-paid employees, or should they be shared by their (presumably) wealthier employers? I'm going to go with . . . shared. To dump union workers often means saving money by denying their replacements health insurance, vacation and pension benefits, not to mention decent pay. New employees are not more productive; they can just be induced to work for less -- economic desperation has a way of doing that. While the board has financial obligations to the co-op owners, it also should treat its employees fairly rather than force them into a race to the bottom.
 update: The board replaced its unionized service with nonunion workers. The union company found jobs in other buildings for the original crew, but not full-time work.
 I am a member of a nonprofit benevolent organization. I am considering proposing that we give the homeless cardboard boxes -- big enough for a person to sleep in, heavily waxed and hence weatherproof. For the cost of helping 100 people with our traditional programs, we could help 1,000 with these boxes. Is this an ethical project? TOM HOPKINS, VAIL, COLO.
 Your proposal is disturbing in that it vividly evokes, abets and thus, in a sense, endorses homeless people sleeping in cardboard boxes, albeit boxes of superior design. But your project is not unethical. Indeed, to the extent that it would relieve human misery, it is estimable.
 Much charitable work responds only to current suffering, and even then does only a little to alleviate it. Here in New York, some folks distribute gloves to street people; some collect leftover food from restaurants; some volunteer in soup kitchens. None of these endeavors profoundly alter anyone's circumstances, but none are discreditable.
 Immediate needs must be met, of course, and it is better to do a little than to do nothing, but those are not your only alternatives. Your organization might more effectively devote its money and time not just to mitigating present hardship but also to addressing its causes. Otherwise, you will be handing out weatherproof boxes into the infinite future -- perhaps some sort of carbon-fiber, antigravity, fusion-powered box on the lunar surface.
 Update: Hopkins's idea didn't get anywhere. ''There was not a lot of excitement'' about it, he said.

 BODY:
HYUNDAI ASSURANCE
 Earlier this year, the American subsidiary of the South Korean carmaker Hyundai began promoting a program it called Hyundai Assurance: buy one of our vehicles, the ads explained, and ''if in the next year you lose your income, we'll let you return it.'' One of these decidedly unfestive spots ran during the Super Bowl. And while that sounds like a horrible idea -- the big game is one of the few moments when we can get together and not think about being canned -- Hyundai can point to results. Its sales for the year are up about 4.9 percent over the same period in 2008. That compared with about a 40 percent drop for car sales overall. 
 Assurance came about very quickly after Hyundai marketers conducted a series of focus groups in October 2008. At that point, Lehman Brothers had collapsed, but the Dow Jones industrial average started the month above 10,000, and official word that we had been in a recession for a year had not yet come. So it was not quite clear why the usual tent-sale and financing deals that have prodded car buyers in past economic slumps simply weren't working. A big theme in the focus groups was fear of job loss. In retrospect, this seems obvious. But at the time, ''the elephant in the room,'' according to Joel Ewanick, Hyundai vice president of marketing, was how many people feared losing their jobs in 2009. ''It was interesting how many people at our company -- we felt the same way, we just hadn't talked about it,'' Ewanick says.
 This led to the notion of offering something like mortgage-protection insurance, but for car loans. Hyundai's U.S. financing division worked out a deal with a company called Walkaway U.S.A., a subsidiary of the auto-retail-services firm EFG Companies, which was trying to market just such a product. ''It's designed to give the consumer peace of mind,'' says Jeff Beaver, senior vice president, marketing and product management for EFG Companies. 
 As of early March, no Hyundai buyer had yet returned a vehicle bought under the Assurance umbrella. This raises the intriguing point about what sort of consumer is being reassured. Probably anybody who is really afraid of losing a job simply isn't going to buy a car right now. But somebody whose insecurity is more abstract, who perhaps simply needs a rationale for a big-ticket purchase at a moment when the headlines are full of doom -- that's different. 
 Around the time Hyundai was conducting its consumer research, the consulting firm Olson Zaltman Associates was doing something similar (but not for Hyundai). Olson Zaltman's lengthy process includes having people choose pictures that represent their thoughts and personal stories, which are analyzed for ''metaphors'' meant to reveal deeper ideas than you might otherwise articulate. ''What surprised me was the depth of the negativity,'' Gerald Zaltman, a founder, says. In more recent interviews, he continues, a new element has emerged: a bit less isolation among subjects, more of ''a sense that they have company,'' Zaltman says. ''Maybe what Hyundai has done is to say: 'We're in this with you.' '' 
 That's certainly what the company is trying to do. One Assurance ad actually includes the line ''We're all in this together, and we'll all get through it together.'' There may be other, less-feel-good factors at work, too. Zaltman's studies found a lot of inchoate anger at large entities, and it may be that the Assurance offering is a better fit for a company like Hyundai, which is a comparatively small player in the U.S. market. The program also projects financial strength, a form of reassurance potential car buyers might find less credible coming from an auto company that's borrowing government money to avoid bankruptcy. 
 That said, Assurance's apparent resonance raises the possibility that, like cash rebates and zero-percent financing, the program might become a regular feature of the car market. ''I hope not,'' says Ewanick of Hyundai. He would rather see an economic rebound that eliminated the need. But Beaver, the Walkaway executive, says his firm has been getting interest in a variety of categories -- boats, furniture, prefab housing. And he points out that JetBlue has recently been promoting a deal that offers business travelers a refund if a trip is canceled by a lost job. ''This is definitely a concept,'' Beaver says, ''whose time has come.''

 BODY:
This couple showed up from Omaha around 11 the other night,'' Betty Crow told me over the phone. ''We didn't know what to do with them, so we put 'em downstairs, let 'em watch TV.'' She continued. ''We open at 12, band starts at 1, they play till 5, and I'm here until 6.'' 
 Crow's organization, the Mutual Musicians Foundation, is housed in a nondescript two-story building in the heart of the old 18th and Vine district of Kansas City, Mo. The area has gone through the classic iterations, from thumping vice district during the Jazz Age to ghetto divided from its white neighbors by the grim euphemism ''urban renewal.'' In the past decade it has undergone a renewal again, this time more hopefully, with the American Jazz Museum and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. But the curatorial spirit hasn't quite stretched to Highland Avenue, to the Foundation, as it's known locally -- and if Crow has her way, it never will. 
 Crow met me at the Foundation's doorstep just before midnight. She is in her late 70s, with tufting red hair, eyeglasses and a murmurous voice about nine parts molten brass. ''It's a pretty nifty place,'' she said. ''It's young people, old people, people from around the world, black, white, Chinese. Everybody comes. That's why we like it.'' The Foundation started life as Musicians Protective Union Local No. 627, established in 1917. Local 627 was a serious organization, taking the musicians' side in professional disputes, but it was also a locus for new sound in the evolution of jazz. The Kansas City style was harder, bluesier, more raucous. It gave the world Mary Lou Williams, Jay McShann, Count Basie, Big Joe Turner, Lester Young and Charlie Parker, all of whom made their way through Local 627. By 1930, the union had more than 300 members, its own home and a tradition of all-night jams. 
 ''It's 3 o'clock when things really start to jump,'' Crow warned, looking me over dubiously. If it's her mission to preserve something of jazz's original essence -- as gutbucket bordello music, an accompaniment to the crossroads of sex and criminality -- I can say she has done a bang-up job. The Foundation is both a place people come to from all over the world and a place to which many people will not go; it is, in other words, both a temple and a Godforsaken dump. The first floor is a dreary melange of wood paneling, Formica counters, linoleum floors. (I kept waiting for Piper Laurie to hobble in and murmur, ''Light me, stranger.'') The only evidence of veneration are the photos of old union members lining the walls. ''We still only know who about 40 percent of them are,'' said Ray, Crow's ''entry control'' man, a low-key African-American with a tight salt-and-pepper beard. ''There's Bird,'' he said, pointing at a young Charlie Parker. ''They laughed at him in K.C. They didn't think he could play. He showed 'em. He showed 'em.''
 The point of the Foundation is not to sit in mummified reverence of a Great American Art Form. The point is to get bombed, listen to loud music and dance. ''Up until two or three years ago, we operated as a speakeasy,'' said Crow. ''We didn't have a liquor license, but we were selling alcohol, having a good time.'' When the city's vice squad finally cracked down, outcries arose from all over the globe. The state legislature passed an exemption, and now the Foundation is ''the only place you can get a drink between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the state of Missouri.'' Every Saturday, a house band plays upstairs, across from the bar. It's made up of baby-faced kids, many from nearby farm country, who come to study at the university's music conservatory. As the clubs close down, musicians wander over and sit in with the band. 
 Crow was right. By 3 a.m., the place was jumping, filled, as one elder statesman put it, with ''every species of American.''(By my own lazy taxonomy, I saw equal parts Jersey Shore, ''The O.C.,'' ''Family Ties'' and ''Straight Outta Compton.'') Upstairs the band was smoking through ''Jordu.'' 
 The real action, however, was downstairs, the boozy-woozy way station between the entrance, the stairs and the suspiciously well-trafficked bathrooms. A bottle blonde in a too-tight denim skirt stabbed furiously at her cellphone. The elder statesman, in a red satin shirt and a derby, sat in judgment of the playing above. (''College thang,'' he said, shaking his head. ''When I came here, it wasn't college. If they didn't feel you were right, they sent you back. 'You ain't ready yet.' Now you just come in here and play.'') The blonde had transferred her digital fury to the downstairs piano, a white lacquer job on a tiny stage, upon which she set about marauding ''Heart and Soul.'' (''What key you in, honey?'' asked the elder statesman. The blonde only cackled maniacally.) At 4 a.m., with the cathouse atmosphere fully ascendant, a young trombonist from Sioux Falls looked around the room and mumbled wistfully to no one in particular, ''It's too bad you didn't see this place before they cleaned it up.''

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Revenge Is All the Rage, But It Isn't Healthy

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
YOU are not a lawbreaker. You obey the speed limit, are honest on your tax return and clean up after your dog. But suddenly, when it comes to certain Wall Street executives, you find yourself experiencing a new emotion: you are having elaborate revenge fantasies. 
 Ever since it came out that executives at the American International Group received millions of dollars in bonuses following the government's bailout of their tanking firm, some people, including some public officials, have been taking their anger to what may be a new extreme -- advocating physical violence against those who reaped the windfall. 
 Edward M. Liddy, chief executive of A.I.G., read letters to Congress on Wednesday in which company employees were threatened with death by piano wire. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, suggested bonus recipients commit suicide (later explaining his remark was ''rhetoric''). 
 Reader mail sent to The New York Times in response to articles about these executives' formerly high-flying lives repeatedly mentioned the guillotine and suggested it was time to ''bring back the tumbrel,'' a crude two-wheeled cart that was used to publicly carry aristocrats toward public execution during the French Revolution.
 There is something a little scary about all this rage -- and not just to those who are on the receiving end, some of whom have hired security. 
 Maybe it's time to take a deep calming breath. Some people already have, no matter how deep their economic suffering. They are finding constructive ways to channel the anger they've been feeling -- outlets that quell the instinct to throw a rock through the window of somebody's mansion. 
 Joe Maysonet, the fitness manager at the Printing House Fitness and Squash Club in Manhattan, said there has been a rush of new attendees at boxing classes. Punching a human-shaped rubber dummy is especially popular. 
 While fists fly, trainers yell inspiration like, ''You're punching your money back into your pockets!'' he said. ''You're punching that portfolio you used to have!''
 The dummy, Mr. Maysonet said, will not press charges. ''He's withstood it all,'' he said. ''Just like our country.''
 Another outlet is more spiritual. ''We need to all collectively repent,'' said Rabbi Levi Brackman, a co-author of ''Jewish Wisdom for Business Success: Lessons from the Torah and other Ancient Texts.'' ''Whether that means going to a synagogue or church for some spiritual inspiration, whether that means realizing one's self worth needs to be separated from one's net worth, there are more important things in life, connection with family, with friends, with God.''
 Standing on your head can also help, said Carlos Menjivar, a teacher at the Jivamukti Yoga School, where attendance is up 30 percent since November. ''When we are in headstand, we are turning the world upside down,'' he said. ''Guess what's happened with this crisis? It's turning the world upside down. The yogis are used to this and they don't get frazzled.''
 Indulging in rage anchors you in the past, said John Osborne, an instructor of the Apex course, a corporate seminar in stress management and creativity.
 ''The only time we can take creative action is in the present,'' he said.Not that all anger should be stifled, experts say. Swallowing it completely can be bad for your health, said Dr. Sheila Jowsey, a staff psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
 ''We should be angry if there's an injustice, but it has to be channeled and dealt with in an appropriate way,'' said Dr. Jowsey, who suggested starting grass-roots advocacy groups and avoiding drugs and alcohol. ''Typically, I'll see people get into a sort of circular thinking where they get into a rut and it can lead to depression.''
 If the guillotine fantasy still entices, it might cool if you consider that the satisfaction of the blade is brief, said Jeremy Mercer, author of ''When the Guillotine Fell: The Bloody Beginning and Horrifying End to France's River of Blood, 1791-1977.'' 
 ''Public executions temporarily sate the public outrage at the criminal,'' Mr. Mercer said by telephone from Marseille, France. ''But they lead to spirals of violence in society, an unending demand for more public executions, and an ugly escalation in the ways the criminal is shamed or tortured before the execution.''
 Far better might be a day at the Guillotine Salon and Spa in Westfield, N.J., where calls are answered, ''It's a great day at the guillotine,'' and facials cost $76.
 Customers have lately been confiding their financial stresses to their stylists, said Barbara Posyton, salon coordinator. ''What we do here is make people feel good on the inside and the outside,'' she said. 
 The first owners picked the name in the '70s, inspired by the avant-garde stylings of the hairstylist Vidal Sassoon, Ms. Posyton said. Hair-cutting stations were shaped like guillotines. ''If you could picture a guillotine without the blades,'' she said, ''that's what the stations looked like.''
 The stations are gone, and the attitude has changed. Now, Ms. Posyton said, ''This place is all T.L.C.''

HEADLINE: New Data Track Evolution of a Landscape

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: HADDAM 

 BODY:
 THE marriage of satellite imagery and digital mapping has produced a 21st-century bird's-eye view of how Connecticut's landscape has changed over the last two decades.
 The newly updated study, by the University of Connecticut's Center for Land Use Education and Research here, shows not only steady growth of development and loss of forest and agricultural land, but also exactly how, where and why. Using multicolored, town-by-town, web-based interactive mapping, this land cover project is believed to be the most sophisticated of any state in the country.
 Many state officials, special interest groups and planners are finding the information, which is free, invaluable, and a number are using it as ammunition for their causes. Yet many communities are unaware that it exists (the Web address for the information is http://clear.uconn.edu/projects/landscape/statewide.htm). 
 ''Fascinating website,'' e-mailed Herman Schuler, economic development director in Oxford, which posted the largest percentage increase in development from 1985 to 2006, the years covered by the data. While Mr. Schuler said he wasn't surprised his town topped the list with a 62 percent increase (Manchester posted the most acres developed at 1,731), he said he was unaware the land cover mapping existed.
 ''What we wanted to do as educators and researchers is we wanted to be able to try to inform the debate,'' said John Rozum, a certified planner who helped develop the data and who is director of the Connecticut Non Point Education for Municipal Officials, which helps communities with planning. ''Before this type of study was out, we really didn't have any way of saying how much was happening.''
 The data were originally compiled in 2004 using satellite snapshots from 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2002, which were converted into color-coded 100-foot squares. The 2006 data, released earlier this year, shows that since 1985, Connecticut added 145 square miles of development and 73 square miles of the kind of turf and grass that typically surround development. 
 In that time, it also lost about 185 square miles of forest and 62 square miles of agricultural land. At 14.7 percent, the percentage of farmland loss was the highest of any land classification. South Windsor had the greatest farmland loss at 1,216 acres. Newtown had the most forest loss at 1,750 acres.
 ''I find it useful,'' said Jennifer Martin, the Connecticut state director of the American Farmland Trust. ''It will help us work more closely with the forest land advocates to try to make the case together.''
 Stamford has the most developed land at more than 11,000 acres and Bridgeport has the highest percentage of developed land at 82 percent, according to the data. But the areas experiencing the greatest growth, like Oxford and the surrounding Naugatuck Valley region, the new mall areas in Manchester, and the casino region in eastern Connecticut, were at once surprising and expected.
 ''It was a revelation,'' said Chester Arnold, CLEAR's director. ''We didn't know. We just didn't know.''
 At the Council of Governments' Central Naugatuck Valley office, Assistant Executive Director Virginia Mason said her group worried that the heavy development in her area -- which includes Oxford -- is resulting in more impervious surfaces that can cause flooding and prevent water from replenishing aquifers. Using CLEAR's data, the group prepared studies so towns could see the development trends.
 The Litchfield Hills Council of Elected Officials' planning director, Richard Lynn, also used CLEAR data for his region, but what struck him was how much more farmland had been lost than he thought. ''In a region that prides itself on its agricultural heritage,'' he said, ''to see that much of its ag land going out of production is of concern.'' 
 David LeVasseur, the undersecretary of intergovernmental policy in the Office of Policy and Management, runs the Office of Responsible Growth, created by Gov. M. Jodi Rell in 2006 to coordinate the state's conservation responsibilities. He said the mapping would help the state and communities analyze growth from a more regional, holistic perspective.
 ''Something that happens in Ledyard can have massive repercussions in southeastern Connecticut from a transportation standpoint, a public safety standpoint,'' he said, as an example. 
 Representative Brendan Sharkey, a Democrat from Hamden, is co-chairman of the Planning and Development Committee in the legislature, and founder of the ad hoc Smart Growth Working Group whose goal is to develop legislation for the current General Assembly session that promotes regional smart growth policies. 
 ''I think those who saw CLEAR's presentation and saw the growth patterns over the last 10, 20 years are shocked by the growth and the loss of open space and the speed with which it's happening,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Port Authority May Help Financing of Tower

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering giving the developer Larry A. Silverstein financial backing to help pay for one of three office towers that he is required to build at the World Trade Center site, people with knowledge of the negotiations said on Saturday. 
 The move is a reflection of the flailing economy and the clenching of the credit markets that has made it difficult for builders to obtain financing. But it may not be enough to satisfy Mr. Silverstein, who wants help with at least two of the three towers, the people said. 
 The authority, which owns the 16-acre ground zero site, has balked at that request. But hoping to push forward a project long stalled by delays and bureaucratic conflicts, it is willing to use its revenue streams essentially as a guarantee to satisfy potential lenders, easing the way for Mr. Silverstein to finance the construction of one of the towers, a government official familiar with the negotiations said. The Wall Street Journal reported on the negotiations on Saturday. 
 The authority is reluctant to provide assistance for more than one tower in a period when it is facing declining revenue and widening budget gaps, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing. Any help it offers Mr. Silverstein would mean that much less borrowing capacity for its own capital projects, including a new Hudson River rail tunnel. 
 Complicating matters is the interwoven nature of the trade center reconstruction project, parts of which cannot proceed until Mr. Silverstein's towers are built to at least street level. The project includes a $3.2 billion transit center, an underground vehicle screening center, an 8-acre memorial plaza and museum and the $3.1 billion Freedom Tower, being built by the Port Authority. Mr. Silverstein's towers are estimated to cost about $2 billion apiece. 
 Bud Perone, a spokesman for Silverstein Properties, declined on Saturday to discuss the negotiations. But in a sharply worded statement, he criticized the authority for delays in preparing sites for construction. The authority has incurred about $86 million in penalties, payable to Mr. Silverstein under a 2006 agreement, for missed deadlines in turning over sites that are fully excavated and ready to build on. 
 ''New Yorkers have been patient enough already,'' he said, ''and tens of thousands of New Yorkers are counting on jobs that the rebuilding will produce.'' 
 Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said in an e-mail message that the agency was making progress in the development of the site, and he added that the agency would continue discussing with Mr. Silverstein how to go forward in a changing market while looking out for the public's interest. 
 With the economic crisis sharply reducing demand for office space in Lower Manhattan, questions have surrounded Mr. Silverstein's ability to finance the three towers and find tenants. 
 The city and the Port Authority have committed to leasing a million square feet in one of the towers. But Mr. Silverstein has had difficulty attracting commercial tenants for the other two.

HEADLINE: As Detroit Struggles, Foundations Adjust

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Two years ago, a charity called Women Arise went to the Hudson-Webber Foundation with a plea for help. 
 Hudson-Webber, a fixture in Detroit philanthropy, was a longtime supporter of the organization's programs to help women rejoin society after being imprisoned. The foundation, however, did not typically get involved in the kind of messy personnel and financial problems that threatened Women Arise.
 Worried about losing what the charity brought to the community, Hudson-Webber agreed to pay off its liabilities and settle the personnel issues -- but only by merging it into Matrix Human Services, which offers an array of social services to low-income families.
 The long economic decline of Detroit has prompted Hudson-Webber and other foundations in the region to change how they operate. Faced with sharply declining resources and exploding need, they are being forced to pick winners and losers, engaging in what Larry M. Gant, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan, calls ''triage.'' 
 ''Insolvent organizations need to be dissolved, weak ones need to be merged and acquired, and only the strongest should receive the stimulus they need to become more financially sound,'' Dr. Gant said. ''It's simple in theory but hard in practice.''
 Thus, the Hudson-Webber chief executive, David O. Egner, is asking himself whether Detroit needs both a world-class symphony and its Michigan Opera Theatre, and, if so, whether they could share an orchestra. 
 ''These are the kinds of questions we need to be asking,'' Mr. Egner said. 
 At the Skillman Foundation, one local charity after another warns that without an infusion of cash, it will have to reduce services or shut down. 
 The Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, for example, approached in December to say that one of its three facilities would need to be closed unless it received help from Skillman -- even though the foundation had never given it money.
 ''They're coming to us because they have nowhere else to go,'' said Carol Goss, the chief executive of Skillman.
 Foundations like Skillman and Hudson-Webber that are embedded in their communities have a harder time turning away local charities than do large national foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. 
 ''As a local funder, you don't get to pick the best programs to work with or the problems you work on,'' said Tonya Allen, vice president for programs at Skillman. ''You have to deal with what you have in your own backyard.''
 The decline of the auto industry, which has long been the bedrock of philanthropy here, is increasing the demand for help, even as assets at the local foundations have fallen.
 The Ford Motor Company, financially the strongest of Detroit's Big Three automakers, expects its giving to fall by about 40 percent from last year's roughly $35 million, about $12 million of which went to organizations here. ''We're not making any long-term commitments at this time, nothing for capital campaigns, no new exhibitions with cultural partners,'' said James G. Vella, president of the Ford Motor Company Fund.
 The disappearance of donations from car makers, their suppliers and dealers have dealt a particularly hard hit to Detroit's arts organizations, which Douglas Bitonti Stewart, the executive director of the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Foundation, called ''the venerable and the vulnerable.'' The opera canceled one show, and question marks hang over performances and exhibits at other organizations.
 And they, too, are turning to foundations to make up the difference. The McGregor Fund, for instance, increased its annual gift to the opera to $150,000, from $125,000. With the General Motors Foundation pulling out, ''I knew they were facing some serious challenges,'' said the fund's president, C. David Campbell.
 At the same time, Mr. Campbell and others are pressing cultural organizations to overhaul their operations. 
 ''One of them,'' Mr. Stewart said, ''has been running an operating deficit of $20 million for two years, which suggests the problem goes beyond the crisis in fund-raising.''
 ''People won't come back to Detroit without these organizations, so we have to support them,'' Mr. Stewart added. ''But they also have to make some hard choices to make our support worthwhile.''
 Detroit's foundations are also supporting each other more than they have in the past and are working to attract national philanthropic money. The Kresge Foundation, in suburban Troy, is considered a national foundation, but it recently gave a $300,000 grant to Matrix Human Services for emergency repairs to its boiler, windows and a parking lot.
 Recently, more than a dozen local foundations gathered to discuss whether to pool their money into an emergency fund for struggling charities and to share ideas about how to use resources limited by the stock market's plunge. A year ago, 10 of them pledged a total of $100 million over eight years to help restructure Detroit's economy to attract skilled workers and fill its empty houses and storefronts. 
 That effort attracted money from three national foundations with headquarters in Michigan -- W.K. Kellogg, Kresge and Charles Stewart Mott -- as well as the Ford Foundation, which is based in New York but came under pressure last year from the Michigan attorney general to spend some of its money in the state where its founder made his fortune. (The Ford Foundation is not affiliated with the Ford Motor Company.)
 Detroit's foundations are also prodding the nonprofit groups they support to share resources. ''Strategic pooling of resources by foundations and nonprofits is what is going to get us through this crisis,'' said Edsel B. Ford II, a Skillman board member. ''Living in silos is a thing of the past.''
 YouthVille Detroit, a youth development organization, recently struck an agreement with the Detroit Science Center to create a science program, ''Think Squad,'' for local public television. The science center is providing money and scientific expertise, and YouthVille is contributing its production facilities and the production expertise of its teenage clients.
 ''The collaboration doesn't benefit us financially,'' said Judith D. Jackson, the chief executive of YouthVille. ''But it does benefit our kids, and it brought us a lot of publicity, too.''
 Under the same pressure from foundations to work together to obtain money, the Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation has joined with Southwest Detroit Weed and Seed, a crime prevention program that involves the Detroit Police Department and local businesses and residents. By participating in the program, the Hispanic development organization got federal money to train police officers and school staff members in gang awareness and to run gang-prevention sessions in middle schools. 
 Angela G. Reyes, the group's founder and executive director, said her organization would not have received any money for those efforts without the collaboration. 
 ''It has helped us work better together and make better use of resources,'' Ms. Reyes said.

HEADLINE: Train Ridership Down in Recession

 BODY:
If it feels like there's a bit more elbow room on the train into work these days, you're not imagining it. Job losses from the recession appear to be rippling through the public transport system. New Jersey Transit says ridership dipped in January and February for the first time after five years of record growth. 
 The growth trend began to shift in the last three months of last year, when ridership was still growing but at the slowest rate since 2004, according to Dan Stessel, the director of media relations for New Jersey Transit, who cautioned that the data was very preliminary.
 Mr. Stessel said that while no plans for a reduction in service have been announced, New Jersey Transit adjusts its timetable every six months. ''But that's not tied to the economic crisis,'' he said.

HEADLINE: THE MANY STORIES OF CARLOS FERNANDO CHAMORRO

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG. 
Tina Rosenberg, a contributing writer for the magazine, has written extensively about Latin America.

 BODY:
 The billboards in Managua this winter advertised 2009 as 'Year 30 of the Revolution.'
 The Christmas trees in the traffic roundabouts sported a ''30'' on top where the angel would normally sit, and TV ads advising Nicaraguans to celebrate Year 30 were ubiquitous. The Sandinista National Liberation Front (F.S.L.N.) again governed the country after 16 years out of power, and Daniel Ortega, one of the original nine comandantes of the 1979 revolution, was again president, still making speeches denouncing Yankee imperialism. 
 But this was not revolution; the rhetoric and slogans were employed in the service of something quite different. Whatever ideals Ortega may once have stood for, he now stands for only himself. He was first elected president of Nicaragua in 1984 and, after losing power in 1990, regained the presidency in 2006, this time not as a Marxist-Leninist, not even really as a leftist. His government now embraces business and the Catholic Church warmly. Although he won the presidency with only 38 percent of the popular vote, he has abused the powers of his office to win near-total dominance of Nicaragua. For instance: in January, the Supreme Court, which Ortega controls, overturned the corruption conviction of a former president, Arnoldo Aleman, the dominant force of Nicaragua's right-wing party; the same day, Aleman's party gave the F.S.L.N. the votes it needed to control the National Assembly.
 Late last year, the European Union and the United States announced they were cutting off Nicaragua's aid because of credible evidence that the F.S.L.N. stole the municipal elections held in November. In addition, Ortega is trying to amend the Constitution to eliminate term limits so he can run again in 2011. He has become an old-fashioned Latin caudillo. His ideology is no longer Marxism but simply Danielism. 
 One thing, however, has remained constant in Nicaraguan life: for more than 50 years, the principal voice for democracy in the country has been that of a member of the Chamorro family. Before the revolution, during the 33-year dictatorship of the Somoza family, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, editor of La Prensa, the only independent newspaper in the country, was the Somozas' most important and principled opponent. His newspaper was closed several times and went through long periods of censorship. His assassination on Jan. 10, 1978 -- by agents still unknown -- turned even much of Nicaragua's oligarchy into supporters of the Sandinista revolution. After Chamorro's death, his wife, Violeta, continued his mission, first as the publisher of La Prensa during the Sandinista era and then as a politician, defeating Ortega in 1990 to become president of the country. Today, the family legacy has fallen to their youngest son. 
 If you are an independent journalist in a country in which independent journalism is seen as a danger to those in power, you sometimes cross a line from reporting the news to being the news. That is what is happening to Carlos Fernando Chamorro. 
 On a hot, dry Monday in January, Chamorro drove to the studios of Channel 8 to tape the day's episode of ''Esta Noche'' (''Tonight''), a half-hour talk show of his that runs every weeknight at 10. ''The owner says this is the Rolls-Royce of Nicaraguan television,'' he said, smiling, as we walked into a studio that rather more called to mind a dented-up 1983 Plymouth. There was one room, with three cameras surrounded by three different sets of chairs and tables. He sat down, and a young woman brushed powder on his forehead. 
 Chamorro also runs a weekly newsletter, Confidencial, and the top-rated ''Esta Semana'' (''This Week''), a ''60 Minutes''-style investigative magazine program that runs every Sunday night. ''Esta Semana'' regularly generates controversy with investigations of government corruption or cronyism and analyses of electoral fraud or the travails of Nicaraguan migrants in Costa Rica. It does this on a total budget, including all salaries, of $23,000 a month. 
 Chamorro is 53. He and his wife, Desiree Elizondo, have three children and a grandson. He has been bald since he was a young man and wears glasses and hearing aids, and his daily uniform is a button-down long-sleeve shirt and chinos. He is relentlessly unglamorous. On and off camera he comes across as serious but warm, with a youthful energy. 
 On that evening's episode of ''Esta Noche,'' Chamorro talked about press freedom with visitors from the Inter American Press Association: Enrique Santos, the editor of El Tiempo in Colombia, and Robert Rivard, editor of The San Antonio Express-News. They talked about how drug cartels are silencing or killing journalists in Mexico and about Hugo Chavez's refusal in Venezuela to renew the license of an opposition TV station. But mainly they discussed the escalation of attacks on the press in Nicaragua, a country that the Committee to Protect Journalists calls Latin America's ''ground zero'' for the use of government institutions to silence critical reporting. Santos and Rivard noted that the Nicaraguan government recently released from jail two men convicted of killing journalists and also pressured two different TV stations to drop a talk show run by a fierce government critic. They also discussed other cases of intimidation they had heard about from Nicaraguans they interviewed -- among them Chamorro himself, whom they had spoken with that morning. Now he was interviewing them.
 The next day on ''Esta Noche,'' another set of Chamorro's guests continued the discussion. The subject that evening was the government's recent attack on Cinco, the Center for Communication Research, a small social-research and journalism organization run by Chamorro himself. In October a team of prosecutors, backed by 40 police officers, raided the Cinco office and over the next 13 hours took the files, computers and books. They announced they were looking for evidence of fraud and money laundering against Cinco and its leaders, Chamorro and Sofia Montenegro. (The basis for the charges, absurdly, was Cinco's work with a feminist group that lacked official legal status.) Montenegro, a colleague of Chamorro's for 30 years, is a journalist and Nicaragua's most outspoken feminist. On Chamorro's show that night, she and two other guests talked about a rare victory -- the charges had been dropped, and the day of the TV show prosecutors began to hand back the contents of Cinco's office. But the government was publicly threatening to continue to go after Cinco by other means. 
 It was an unusual week; normally, Chamorro's shows are not about his own cause. And at least on the surface, there was something incongruous in discussing repression of the press on a highly rated national TV show. After all, in some countries, TV programs simply vanish when they begin to offend the powerful -- or their journalists do. But the game of intimidation that Ortega plays with Chamorro is more subtle than the Somoza family's crude aggression against Chamorro's father. Nicaragua, despite its recent wars, is one of the least violent places in Latin America, and assassination is not common. The Ortega government, in addition to not having majority support at home, is heavily dependent on international donations -- not only from Chavez, Ortega's own personal Soviet Union, but also from governments that care about democratic freedoms. So it must tread carefully.
 At the same time, Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, continue to carry out personal vendettas and stifle critics by drawing on the nonviolent mechanisms of the state: subservient courts and prosecutors; large budgets for advertising in newspapers and television that can disappear overnight if the government is displeased; control of the price of newsprint, broadcast licenses and legal permissions.
 At stake is more than just press freedom. Nicaragua is a country in which the parts of the state that are supposed to check the president's power -- courts, prosecutors, Congress, supposedly impartial agencies like the election commission -- are controlled by the president. The function of government watchdog has fallen to journalists and members of civil society. Chamorro is walking point for both. He is resisting being silenced with every tool at his disposal: his airtime, his famous name, his credibility and his reputation for impartiality (after the Cinco raid, writers from all over the world, including such icons of the left as Eduardo Galeano of Uruguay and Ariel Dorfman of Chile, signed a public letter of support for him). If he loses his fight, the defense of democratic liberties will be left to people with much more limited weaponry. 
 Chamorro makes a particularly inviting target for a reason that goes beyond the values that he stands for today. Ortega and Murillo direct special fury at their former allies and intimates. And during the comandantes' time in power, the editor of the newspaper Barricada, the official voice of the Sandinistas, was the committed revolutionary Carlos Fernando Chamorro.
 Pedro Joaquin and Violeta Chamorro raised their four children ''eating breakfast, lunch and dinner with talk of the news,'' Cristiana, one of Carlos's two sisters, told me recently. ''Journalism was not imposed on us; my father left it for us to decide. But it was in some way in our blood.''
 Carlos had not wanted to go into journalism. ''I admired my father, and he was the most important person in my life, but I didn't want to live in his shadow,'' he said. After graduating from high school, Carlos left Nicaragua to study economics at McGill University in Montreal. In 1977, he returned to Nicaragua with the intention of acquiring a master's degree and then helping Nicaragua's poor. But for a young Nicaraguan concerned about social justice, a more direct route to change quickly presented itself: joining the armed guerrillas of the F.S.L.N., which was promising a dignified life and wage for the common man -- shoes on his feet and beans on his table. In secret, Carlos did small-arms training, studied Marxism-Leninism and went to work in the F.S.L.N.'s propaganda department. 
 When his father was assassinated in 1978, however, Carlos embraced journalism. ''My world changed when my father was killed,'' he said. ''I didn't have time for personal grief. That was the moment to dedicate yourself to getting rid of Somoza. You get on the train, or it passes you by.'' For him, that meant going where he could do the most to further Somoza's overthrow: La Prensa, his father's paper. He became a reporter, editorial writer and columnist. 
 On July 19, 1979, Managua fell to the Sandinistas. Taken in by the Sandinistas' professions that there was room in the revolution for all, Violeta, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro's widow, agreed to serve on the junta. She stayed nine months before she became disenchanted and left. Alongside her children Pedro Joaquin and Cristiana, who were also disillusioned early, she steered La Prensa back to its accustomed posture, firmly in opposition to the government. Pedro Joaquin, in fact, would leave Nicaragua in 1984 to join the armed opposition -- the contras, who were trained, financed and essentially run by the Reagan administration.
 Most of the La Prensa staff, however, did not share Dona Violeta's views, creating a rift in the newsroom. Xavier Chamorro, her brother-in-law, who was an editor at La Prensa, sold his shares and with the money took most of the staff and started a pro-Sandinista newspaper, El Nuevo Diario. And Violeta's two other children sided with the government -- Carlos's sister Claudia, who became ambassador to Costa Rica, and Carlos himself, who became editor in chief of Barricada.
 Every newspaper in Nicaragua was now run by a Chamorro. 
 Salman Rushdie, in his 1987 Nicaragua travelogue, ''The Jaguar Smile,'' wrote that Barricada was the most boring newspaper he ever saw. He clearly had not read Pravda or Granma, the organ of Cuba's Communist Party. I lived in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s and was a regular reader of Barricada. The paper was less mortifyingly submissive to the party than Granma. Sandinista Nicaragua was then an ongoing improvisation by the standards of socialist states, and Barricada was a much more laid-back mouthpiece. It had a world-class political cartoonist (who even made fun of Barricada's own eagerness to be spoon-fed news), and it featured vivid, if one-sided war reporting. It had some beautiful writing, often by Chamorro and Montenegro, and a decent sports section, in which, because of Nicaragua's obsession with baseball, you could occasionally read the startling headline ''Yankees Victorious!'' 
 What Barricada didn't have was news. It covered an alternate reality. Day after day in the pages of Barricada, the heroic people of Nicaragua and their revolutionary vanguard celebrated victory after victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. To a lesser extent, the same editorial mission -- serve the cause -- was shared both by Carlos's pro-Sandinista uncle, Xavier, at El Nuevo Diaria and his anti-Sandinista mother, brother and sister at La Prensa. Barricada, at least, did not pretend to be independent. Its slogan was ''The Official Organ of the Frente Sandinista.''
 Inside the F.S.L.N., Chamorro had his battles. He had to respond to the strictures of a political commissar and to lobbying from nine comandantes to put each one's activities on the front page. When I met with him earlier this year, I asked Chamorro for an example of conflict with the F.S.L.N. He said that on the day Pope John Paul II was shot, his F.S.L.N. handlers insisted, over his objections, that the paper run as its top article a report of a meeting between the Sandinista and Honduran armies. 
 But this is a dispute over placement, not censorship, of an article. Was there no fight to run an article that might displease the F.S.L.N., I asked? There was not, he said. ''The war impeded any profound debate,'' he explained. ''We had a sense of loyalty to the revolution, of self-protection.'' Via the contras, the revolution was under attack from the United States, the most powerful country in the world. It did not occur to Chamorro to contribute to that siege. ''We practiced self-censorship,'' he went on. ''If we discovered evidence of corruption that would damage the image of the government, my first instinct was to do an internal investigation and not publish it.'' 
 Chamorro saw no contradiction between censorship and his ideals. What he valued as a Nicaraguan and as a Sandinista was social change, not democratic freedoms. ''Nicaragua didn't have a democratic culture,'' he said. ''We didn't have respect for elections and rule of law. My father never voted in his life -- he was in jail or in exile or there was no one to vote for. The concept of democracy didn't have much legitimacy.'' 
 Shortly after the revolutionary victory, the F.S.L.N. closed the small Maoist publication El Pueblo on charges of inciting labor unrest. La Prensa was closed by the F.S.L.N. for the first time in 1981 and then several more times over the course of the 1980s, including for more than a year beginning in October 1986. As of 1982, La Prensa and Nuevo Diario had to submit each day's edition to a censor before publishing. Barricada did not. (At the same time in military-controlled El Salvador, there was no need for censoring left-wing journalists, as death squads had taken care of the problem.) ''I rationalized the decision to censor even though the people who were victims were colleagues and family,'' Chamorro told me. ''In the 1980s we were prisoners of that era. To me it was justifiable to suppress freedom in order to preserve the state that made other liberties possible.''
 Among his fiercest critics were members of his own family. ''He was a cadre, a mechanized cadre,'' Antonio Lacayo, his brother-in-law, husband of Cristiana, told me. ''His headlines were slogans.'' Carlos's brother Pedro Joaquin expressed similar sentiments about his time at La Prensa: ''He never called me when Sandinista gangs attacked my house. He never spoke out against censorship, never called me to say, 'I'm sorry about what's happening.' '' At the time, Barricada and La Prensa were in a war of their own. La Prensa called Barricada ''BarriKGB.'' Barricada called La Prensa ''La PrenCIA.'' Privately, Dona Violeta took to calling her son's paper ''Barracuda.''
 But Nicaragua during those years was so polarized that the divisions in the Chamorro family were not especially unusual. (The spokeswomen for the Sandinista and contra armies, for example, were sisters.) What was unusual about the Chamorros, aside from their high profile, was that they still gathered for family events. ''Violeta was attacked by her brother-in-law and by her son, but at Christmas and my grandmother's birthday, the whole family got together,'' said Francisco, Xavier's son, who is now editor of Nuevo Diario. 
 What was that like? 
 He laughed. ''We didn't talk politics.'' 
 Cristiana explained further: ''My mother never distinguished between her children -- what she likes best is to see all of us at her house. She didn't take politics personally. But when La Prensa was closed, or there was a very strong government attack against my mother or La Prensa, Carlos and Claudia didn't come to the house that frequently. But we had a house at the beach and during vacations -- the volume was always lower during vacations -- and Carlos would show up as if nothing had happened.'' 
 Dona Violeta is now retired from public life and does not speak about politics. But at a recent lunch in her house she was willing to talk to me about her family. ''Everyone has the right to think as they want,'' she said. ''A mother doesn't abandon anyone. Family relations are family relations.'' 
 In 1990, after six years as president, and as the contra war was coming to a close, Daniel Ortega ran for re-election. The Sandinistas expected to win, perhaps by a landslide. The landslide instead went to the candidate of the momentarily united opposition: Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. ''I voted for Daniel Ortega,'' Carlos told me, and smiled sheepishly.
 At Barricada, the staff was in shock at the Sandinista's loss. For Carlos, the shock was more personal. ''My mother was president,'' he said. ''I'm here at Barricada. Do I want to be in opposition to my mother?''
 Well, yes, as it turned out, he did. Although Barricada eventually changed its slogan to ''For the National Interest,'' the paper was merciless with his mother's government. Then there was another, more pleasant shock: for the first time, Carlos did not have to censor himself. ''We can be real journalists, not people defending a political project,'' he said he remembers thinking. ''We began to feel liberated.'' The shift in Barricada was not only a professional imperative; it was a necessity for survival. Barricada had lost its income from government advertising. Now it had to survive by selling papers.
 Dona Violeta was a symbolic president; for all intents and purposes, the country was run by her chief of staff and son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo. But this woman, usually dressed beatifically in white, often photographed with her arms outstretched, helped bring to her country a degree of tolerance and freedom it had never before seen. The Chamorro children began to gather at their mother's house for supper on Sunday evenings. She was doing for Nicaragua what she was doing for her family. 
 Meanwhile, Barricada was evolving and its ties to the F.S.L.N. were loosening. Carlos told the F.S.L.N. that there were new rules: decisions would be made on journalistic, not political, criteria. In 1988 he visited Scandinavia and for the first time experienced -- and was deeply impressed by -- democratic-leftist government. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, when leftist movements all over Latin America began shifting away from authoritarianism, his beliefs about what was best for his country began to change in earnest. ''The conclusion you had to draw was that to be really on the left, you had to be democratic,'' he said. ''In the 1980s you could say what you wanted inside, but when the party made a decision, you followed it. After my mother became president, the debate became public. We were recognizing errors we hadn't wanted to admit before -- the war, bureaucracy, distancing ourselves from ordinary people. We had to examine why we lost. It couldn't still be an official newspaper.'' 
 Barricada, for example, did an investigative report in 1993 linking a cache of arms discovered in Managua, including 19 surface-to-air missiles, to the Salvadoran guerrillas and the Basque terrorist group ETA. The story deeply embarrassed the F.S.L.N., which had long denied letting Nicaragua be used as an operational base for ideologically kindred movements. Chamorro also investigated a terrorist group that compiled a death list of prominent rightists. Barricada found the group had associations with the F.S.L.N. Chamorro was told not to publish the article, but he did publish it, for good measure writing a strongly critical editorial and signing it. 
 The orthodox wing of the F.S.L.N. was furious at Barricada's transformation. Ortega, who remained the leader of the party, wanted a newspaper he could control. At the F.S.L.N. party congress of 1994, the hardliners purged the more democratic members; soon after, the F.S.L.N. took control of Barricada. Chamorro, Montenegro and other top editors were fired, and most of the reporting staff quit. The newspaper went back to filling its pages with long interviews with Sandinista comandantes. (The market spoke, and Barricada closed in 1998. La Prensa and Nuevo Diario continue to publish today.) 
 Dona Violeta was president until 1997, and was followed by two conservative governments, ending with Ortega's election. During this time, Chamorro became an independent journalist. In June 1995 he began ''Esta Semana'' and Cinco, and in 1996, Confidencial. The next year, he received a fellowship to study at Stanford University, and he and his family spent a year there and a year at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught reporting on Central America and took classes but also educated himself by watching ''60 Minutes'' and listening to NPR. In 2005 he added his daily show, ''Esta Noche.'' 
 His reporting was something new for Nicaragua. Latin America had little tradition of TV magazine shows outside Brazil and Argentina. And Nicaragua had rarely seen journalism that wasn't tied to a political party. ''He's the gold standard,'' said Maria Lopez Vigil, editor of Envio, the monthly magazine at Central American University in Managua. ''He's an intelligent, neutral professional -- not typical virtues here. Normally the press is very one-sided and sells itself for advertising. He's serious, honest and responsible. Maybe because he's the son of Pedro Joaquin or because of his years on TV, he has huge impact and influence among the elite.'' She paused. ''That the government touched him,'' she said, ''means it can touch anyone.''
 The government's decision to raid Chamorro's office in October seems to have come from the very top. After trying to arrange interviews with about a dozen Sandinista officials, I was granted one by Rafael Solis. He is a Supreme Court judge and an adviser to Ortega. Solis told me that the decision to raid Cinco was made by the government's security chief, Ana Isabel Morales. ''It could have come from the presidency,'' he allowed later. ''Whether she took the decision with the president or on her own as minister, it was still coming from very high.'' (Morales's office did not respond to a request for comment.)
 It was not a surprise. The government's displeasure with Chamorro and Montenegro dated back to the days of Barricada's independence in the '90s; the authoritarian left has always reserved its strongest wrath for the democratic left. But there have been other provocations. Recently, for instance, there was the matter of Zoilamerica Narvaez. She is the daughter of Ortega's wife, Murillo, from a previous relationship and as a teenager was adopted by Ortega. In 1998, at the age of 30, she stunned Nicaragua by announcing that Ortega had been sexually abusing her since she was 11, and she supplied a 48-page dossier of details. Murillo immediately called her a liar. Ortega, who denies the charges, initially used his legislative immunity to avoid them, then three years later had the matter turned over to a Sandinista judge who dismissed the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had passed. But the case has not been dropped by Latin American feminist groups, who organize protests wherever Ortega visits, calling him a rapist. 
 Montenegro, too, has been outspoken in her support for Narvaez and her fury at how the case was handled. She has also enraged the government for her attacks on a recent ban on abortion, which until 2006 was legal to save the life or health of the mother. But during his campaign, Ortega supported its complete illegalization, a move that neutralized the opposition of the Catholic Church. For months, the Web site of the president's office carried on its home page a headline that said ''An Agent Named Montenegro'' -- a link to an article from Murillo's personal magazine that claimed Montenegro was a C.I.A. agent. 
 Another story that stoked the government's anger was a segment on ''Esta Semana'' in 2007 that captured on tape a businessman being asked for a $4 million bribe in a matter concerning a land dispute with peasant cooperatives. The fixer who was to resolve the legal problems was a confidant of Ortega's. The government's immediate response was to attack the accusers. Its TV channel accused the businessman, his associates and Chamorro of drug trafficking. Chamorro's picture appeared on TV alongside some of the businessmen in the style of a ''Wanted'' poster, with the following list of accusations at the side: ''Crimes: stealing land, swindling cooperatives, attempt to bribe and export, falsification of documents.'' 
 When prosecutors announced in January that they were not going to press charges in the Cinco case, Chamorro tried to portray this as proof that citizens can stand up to their government. But it probably had more to do with his name and prominence, and in any event it was only a partial victory. The prosecutor who dropped the case went on to recommend that the government use its administrative power to pursue ''evidence'' that Chamorro was diverting money from Cinco to himself and his family. Chamorro disputes these charges convincingly; Oxfam Great Britain, the major source of the money, says it has full confidence in him and Cinco.
 The government may be trying to use the Cinco case to tighten its controls on civil-society organizations. Officials have talked about introducing legislation to prohibit nongovernmental groups from engaging in ''political'' activities -- it would be permissible, for instance, to feed the poor, but not to work to change antipoverty policy. Government officials are also discussing instituting a requirement that all foreign donations (which finance virtually every organization in Nicaragua) be approved by the foreign ministry. Ortega may also try to remove Cinco's legal status or push Chamorro off the air. Channel 8, which carries both his programs, depends heavily on government-paid programming and ads, and its license is up for renewal soon. 
 Solis, the judge and Ortega adviser, argued that I was making too much of these conflicts between the media and the government. ''There has been total freedom of the press except for a few isolated cases,'' he said. ''We have half a dozen TV channels, a quantity of newspapers, and they publish freely. And there is not a policy against civil society -- if it had been otherwise, we would have begun to requisition the books of some 4,000 organizations. Some people have tried to use isolated cases to create the perception of a policy of harassment. There is no such policy. The situation of these organizations is very particular. Some have confronted government policies like abortion. Some have made very critical personal attacks on the president and first lady.'' What struck me was that Solis considered this a defense. 
 I asked Chamorro if the intensity of the attacks against him ever led him to think that he was in physical danger. ''The moment you become a government target, there's a risk,'' he said. ''When people asked my father that, he'd reply that yes, he was afraid, but would then quote a Mexican saying: 'Each person owns his own fear.' That's the way to try to live.'' Chamorro has no bodyguards. At his wife's insistence he agreed to get a driver for his Toyota S.U.V., but he often drives alone anyway, as his father did. 
 Chamorro is the same age as his father on the day of his death. Last year marked 30 years since Pedro Joaquin Chamorro's assassination, and in January, at his father's grave, Carlos read from a collection of his father's articles and speeches about the press. ''I read things he wrote in 1974 and found they are very current today,'' he told me. ''One theme is the weight of free expression as the basis for all public liberties. The other dimension is his political thought: the need for profound social change, but with roots, so the changes last. This is different than the revolutionary dream -- where you have big radical changes, but then you see what happens. That's heroic, but what the country needs is gradual but real revolution, with strong democratic institutions. Back then my father was talking about justice, accountability of the government toward its citizens, clean elections, a ban on re-election. Back then it was Somoza, now it's Ortega.''
 Every year, Dona Violeta's charitable foundation and the United Nations award the Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Prize for Excellence in Journalism, and every year she hosts a luncheon in her home for the winners. She lives in a sprawling four-bedroom house with an interior courtyard in a middle-class neighborhood, surrounded by a wall, with the Nicaraguan flag flying from a tall pole. This year's gathering began in Dona Violeta's study, a room redolent of the past. Near the door there is a glass-fronted cabinet that serves as a shrine to her husband. It contains the artifacts of his life and death: a striped prison shirt; the now-shredded ivory sweater he was wearing when he was killed; a letter he was carrying; his glasses, still covered with dust. Next to the cabinet is a rug rolled up in a heavy plastic bag. It was the rug from the car he was shot in, still stained with blood. When the children gather at their mother's house on Sunday nights, the family eats in this room. 
 But today the lunch was more formal: seafood paella and sherbet served in the dining room. All of Dona Violeta's children were home, along with the spouses of Carlos and Cristiana. The Chamorros casually gathered in an open-air room off the dining room. Their conversation was about the doings of their children and grandchildren, family things, but also about the Ortega-Aleman pact, the National Assembly, Carlos's case. Politics, in other words -- a subject on which they are, for the first time, united.

HEADLINE: Developers Lend a Hand

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
IN today's market, some developers are creating financial programs that will persuade skittish buyers to overcome their fears and buy apartments. To set their condominium towers apart from all others, developers are offering price guarantees, mortgage insurance, payments to reduce mortgage rates and even their own loans. 
 ''We're trying to come up with creative solutions that work for everybody,'' said Andrew Gerringer, who oversees new development for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''They're not really amenities, but everybody's working for the edge that will draw more interest and sell more units.''
 Alchemy Properties, which has available apartments in four developments, has advertised that it will pay all transfer and mansion taxes. The developer is also working individually with buyers to help them get the financing they need.
 Kenneth S. Horn, the company's president, said that on several occasions, Alchemy had offered loans to buyers who could secure 80 to 85 percent financing, but could come up with only a 10 percent down payment. ''It's more of an accommodation,'' he said, ''and you have to be able to trust people.'' 
 Here are a few developments that have created what amounts to financial aid for buyers:
 SOLARIA A 64-unit building in Riverdale developed by Arc Development, with prices that range from $900,000 to $2 million, the Solaria has three programs: home assurance, which will pay mortgages, common charges and real estate taxes for up to a year if a buyer is laid off; rent to own, through which part of monthly lease payments are applied toward the purchase price of an apartment; and education credits, whereby Arc will offer a one-time $30,000 credit to buyers who have children in private school or an adult who is working toward a graduate degree.
 L HAUS A 120-unit building in Long Island City, Queens, marketed by Prudential Douglas Elliman, with prices of $445,000 to $1.35 million, L Haus has three programs: price protection, which guarantees a rebate if a similar home in the building is sold at a discount; 3-2-1 rate buy-down, in which the sponsor will pay to reduce a buyer's mortgage rate by three percentage points in the first year, two points in the second year and one point in the third year; and rent to own, which applies up to six months' rent toward the purchase price of an apartment.
 TOLL BROTHERS At its developments in New York City -- including Fifth Street Lofts in Long Island City, Northside Piers in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and 303 East 33rd in Murray Hill -- Toll Brothers has three programs: interest rate buy-down, in which the developer will pay points to reduce a buyer's mortgage rate; borrower's protection, a year's worth of mortgage insurance or a guarantee that if the buyer loses his or her job, the mortgage will be paid for up to 12 months; and second mortgages of up to 10 percent of the purchase price.VIVIAN S. TOY

HEADLINE: Changing Sounds Of Africa

BYLINE: By WILL HERMES

 BODY:
COOLLY elegant in a brown pinstripe pantsuit and a pageboy bob, the singer Mariam Doumbia, 50, sat in a lounge of a chic new hotel on the Bowery. She appeared slightly bored. She was on a publicity tour with her husband, Amadou Bagayoko, to promote the new Amadou & Mariam album, ''Welcome to Mali'' (Nonesuch), and as usual he was doing most of the talking. She applied hand cream, brushed her hair, twiddled her thumbs. But when an interviewer offered her headphones, she perked up. 
 ''Yes, yes,'' she exclaimed, swaying her head and snapping her fingers as she listened to the music. ''Very good.''
 The song she heard was an unofficial remix of ''Sabali,'' the ethereal electro-pop number that leads off ''Welcome to Mali.'' Written with the British musician Damon Albarn of the poppy hip-hop outfit Gorillaz, the original processes Ms. Doumbia's earthy alto with AutoTune, the omnipresent effects software used by T-Pain and Kanye West, among other international acts. The remix, which adds a charmingly lazy duet vocal by the Brooklyn musician Theophilus London, is from an online mixtape that is available free at myspace.com/londonwave. 
 ''All of our albums have been remixed in some way, so we are used to it,'' Mr. Bagayoko, 54, said in French through a translator. Like his wife, he appears younger than his years, and he looked sharp in a dark paisley shirt and sports jacket. ''It's an honor to be chosen by other artists,'' he said. ''And it helps bring the music to a larger audience.''
 Mr. Bagayoko and Ms. Doumbia, known across Africa as the Blind Couple of Mali, are extremely pragmatic about their art &#151; one reason why, at the moment, they are among the world's most renowned African musical acts. They released cassettes and CDs through the 1990s and early '00s, mixing gentle Malian pop with blues and other international flavors. Their breakthrough came in 2005 with ''Dimanche a Bamako,'' a modern-sounding collaboration with the fusion-minded European producer and artist Manu Chao. A pop hit in France, it turned up on numerous year-end best-of lists in the United States and earned them a Grammy nomination; it has sold more than 600,000 copies worldwide, impressive numbers for African music.
 ''Welcome to Mali'' was released in Europe late last year to great acclaim. The London Observer predicted it ''will be appreciated by millions; not as 'world music' but as the product of an authentically global pop phenomenon.'' The record will be out in the United States on Tuesday. 
 The duo's success may be about universal pop attributes as much as cultural exoticism. ''They're extremely accessible,'' said Bill Bragin, the director of public programming at Lincoln Center and a longtime international music promoter. ''They write great hooks and melodies. She has a terrific voice. He's a really interesting guitarist. Plus they have a great show. They're one of the few world-music acts where you don't feel you need to be schooled in the particular kind of music to appreciate it.'' 
 Like its predecessor ''Welcome to Mali'' is a pop-rock record grown from African terroir, and it arrives as the continent's musical exports are displaying an aesthetic shift. Like their international peers African artists are using digital technology to create musical hybrids and distribute them globally. At the same time Western fans of rock, rap and electronic music are using digital access to discover sounds that push familiar buttons in novel ways.
 Together these factors have helped dispel the notion of world music as a folk-rooted category geared strictly toward older listeners. Congolese acts like Konono Ndegrees1 and Kasai Allstars, for example, working with European producers and artists (like Bjork, who recorded and toured with Konono Ndegrees1), have connected their hypnotic, urbanized traditional music to Western fans of techno and psychedelic rock. And various types of contemporary African club music, especially the Angolan and Portuguese group Buraka Som Sistema, have begun traveling abroad. 
 The most high-profile example of this new world-music trend comes not from Africa, however, but via India: the Grammy-winning hit soundtrack to the film ''Slumdog Millionaire.'' Composed by A. R. Rahman, the music is modern Bollywood pop, full of digitally sequenced drums and processed vocals, raps, house music and schmaltzy balladry -- and yes, some sitar. A remix of its signature song, ''Jai Ho,'' was just released with English vocals by the Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger.
 ''The world music category is fragmenting the same way pop music has fragmented: into generational categories with various subcultural tribes,'' said Mr. Bragin, who sees Amadou & Mariam appealing to multiple audiences. Hooky and groove-oriented enough to appeal to dance-rock and jam-band fans, the duo's music has been championed in mainstream outlets as well as trend-spotting indie-rock Web sites like Stereogum.com and the hippie-rock news site Jambase.com. (Mr. Bagayoko is a hot blues-rock-style improviser on guitar.) Mr. West, meanwhile, recently mentioned the group and ''Sabali'' on his blog, kanyeuniversecity.com/blog. 
 Amadou & Mariam see using electronic music styles, like singing in a range of languages, as routes to new audiences. When they began making music at the Institute for Young Blind People in Bamako, the capital of Mali (they were married at the school in 1980), their ambition was solely to tour Mali, which has many cultures.
 ''When we started, we sang only in Bambara,'' Mr. Bagayoko said. ''But we wanted to reach other tribes. So we started to sing in Dogon, Tuareg, Tamasheq, Senufo, Songhai, Soninke, Malinke, Khassonke. Then it was French. And now English. People are touched when you sing in their language.'' 
 ''I Follow You,'' a sort of Malian waltz, is the duo's first all-English song, and the simple ballad is one of the most touching moments on ''Welcome to Mali.'' But the album is less an abandonment of the group's culture than an updating of it. In addition to the electro-pop tracks produced by Mr. Albarn (''Sabali'' and ''Africa,'' a collaboration with the Somali rapper K'naan), there is ''Djuru,'' which features the kora harp of the group's countryman Toumani Diabate, and ''Bozos,'' with the windswept desert sounds of the Malian violin. 
 All these styles, including kora traditionalism and hip-hop, are part of modern African music, a notion that is sometimes lost on Western audiences. ''People forget Africa is a big continent with different countries, and when you travel to these places, you see it's not all prehistorical,'' said Joao Barbosa, known as Lil' John, of Buraka Som Sistema. ''There are big cities with economies and traffic and Internet and cellphones.'' 
 Buraka Som Sistema is currently the international face of kuduro, the Angolan urban dance music that draws from American bass music and Antillean zouk as much as regional styles like semba. Its debut album, ''Black Diamond,'' will be released on the dance label Fabric on April 7 and includes ''Sound of Kuduro,'' featuring the rapper M.I.A., an early booster of the group. It occasionally samples old Angolan songs, but this is modern, computer-made dance music.
 ''It's a reaction to the whole world-music scene,'' Mr. Barbosa said of his group's pan-national music, which he sees as broadcasting the reality of 21st-century Africa. ''We want to change people's perceptions.''
 This change is gradually happening. Indigenous hip-hop and club-music scenes exist across Africa; besides kuduro, the dancehall, reggae-flavored hiplife from Ghana and kwaito music from South Africa, inflected with hip-hop and house music, have been thriving for years. And compilations like last year's ''Black Stars: Ghana's Hiplife Generation'' (out/here) are spreading the word.
 Amadou & Mariam, meanwhile, have a chance to reach tens of thousands of potential new fans when the duo opens for Coldplay at a series of stadium shows in the United States this summer. They will headline their own show at Webster Hall in New York on June 8 and will return to the hippie-pop festival Bonnaroo on June 12.
 And later this year Samou, the duo's son, will release the debut album by his rap group SMOD, produced by Mr. Chao. The parents are proud, but they did not get involved with the project. ''We're singers,'' Mr. Bagayoko said, laughing. ''We sing. We let the rappers rap.'' 
 Asked how their African fans like their music's more international direction, Mr. Bagayoko is emphatic. ''For African people it's progress. It brings the music forward. They're excited.''

HEADLINE: Two Chain Restaurants Stressing Healthy Food

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
TWO chain restaurants opened recently, one in New Canaan, the other in Darien, that are of greater appeal than the average run-of-the-salt-shaker variety of chains. 
 A search for good value in these dubious economic times is what attracted me to Le Pain Quotidien (which means ''Daily Bread '') in New Canaan in the first place. The layout is handsome and the concept appealing: pared-down accouterments, a rustic look (knotty pine tables, benches and cabinets full of Belgian oils and condiments for sale) and simple, healthy food well-prepared and reasonably priced. I don't know whether it's an incentive or deterrent, but every dish on the menu has its calorie content next to it.
 The restaurant is part of a Belgian chain, but this is its first venture in Connecticut and already it is a real hit locally. Though rather quiet in the evening, the place is hopping at breakfast and lunch. 
 Choices at lunch include 15 different tartines -- open-faced sandwiches on organic wheat bread -- as well as nine different salads and two quiches (though the ham was minimal, I liked the fluffiness and flavor of the quiche Lorraine). All the dishes have unusual accents, like olive oil, capers and anchovies with the organic egg salad tartine or a side of harissa-cranberry chutney with the chicken curry salad (though a nice idea, there was little evidence of the incendiary North African spice harissa). 
 The soups are standouts; served in huge bowls, accompanied by a big slab of organic bread, each is a meal in itself. The dinner menu is reasonably ambitious, with eight hot entrees, five salads, eight tartines and three special platters that two people might share. A very rich cappuccino, like regular coffee and tea, is served in enormous bowl-shaped handleless cups.
 Although less adventurous, Panera Bread has several things going for it: wholesome foods (many organic or natural items), generous portions and modest prices. A bowl of soup with half a sandwich on crusty organic bread (like the Asian chicken salad I had, along with chicken tortilla soup with black beans in a tomato base) is $7.09 and makes a very satisfying lunch. A child's special of a sandwich and yogurt is $3.99.
 As at Le Pain Quotidien, Panera Bread's soups are a high point. (If you call either establishment, a recorded voice gives you the day's soup specials.) Panera Bread features five regular soups (French onion, cream of tomato, chicken tortilla, chicken noodle, broccoli Cheddar) and two specials daily. 
 But to equate these two places would be like comparing apples and oranges. Le Pain Quotidien is by far the more polished in its variety, looks and comfort level, with very little chain feel. Panera Bread is a big nationwide chain, already with 11 outlets in southwestern Connecticut, including one next door in Norwalk.
 I would especially recommend Panera Bread for breakfast. Morning offerings include baked egg souffles, grilled breakfast sandwiches (on Panera's excellent ciabatta bread), granola parfait (with maple butter pecan granola and fresh strawberries), fresh-baked bagels and delicious pecan sticky buns, almond bear claws and other pastries. 
 The lunch and dinner offerings (the same for both) are scrawled on seven or eight menu boards visible overhead behind the counter. In all, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the nutritious quality and healthfulness of the various items -- the zesty soups, perky salads and sandwiches. And no one could argue about the final bill.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame The Business Trip

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE government is big and powerful. When it acts and speaks, the consequences can be immense and possibly not the intended ones -- and not at all helpful.
 Consider the issue of business travel. As everyone knows, the Treasury has been giving loans and bailouts to corporations in trouble, especially in the world of finance. There has been an outcry about some of these companies, which, after taking public money, held gatherings in what were seen as lush watering holes, places like Las Vegas or even spots in my beloved Southern California.
 There was an especially well-chronicled meeting near me, at the St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach, of executives of the American International Group, the bailed-out insurance company. Some politicians have characterized this event and many others as examples of taxpayers paying for inexcusably luxurious business travel. 
 Like other taxpayers, I hate to see my dollars going to entertain employees of bailed-out companies lavishly. Just as a matter of public decency, it is possible that they should wear the hair shirt for a time -- although it's hard to see what business purpose is served by punishing the most productive employees at a company, who are often the ones at business gatherings. 
 The problem is that animosity toward ill-advised travel has led to fear in business: that government or media circles will frown on it for having meetings at all, especially if the locale is deemed luxurious. Business people say they are canceling meetings left and right to forestall criticism.
 If this continues, it will be a puritanical excess that's the problem, not a jet owner's or a meeting planner's.
 The truth is that business meetings are usually not a waste of time, even if they are held in Las Vegas or at a resort with a golf course near a Southern California beach. They are not decadent, with rare exceptions. And at the business meetings I see, an incredibly heavy burden of work lies on the shoulders of those who attend.
 Of course, I wouldn't want to see taxpayer money going to buy Piper-Heidsieck for executives of bailed-out companies. Then again, I never see anything even slightly like that at business meetings. 
 At the gatherings I attend, men and women fly coach, stay in immense, boxy hotels, start their meeting days at breakfast at 7 a.m. and work through the day until far later than seems reasonable to me. Then they do it again the next day and the day after that, finally enduring the torture of waiting at the airport, next to screaming children, in order to get home.
 These meetings, while burdensome, are helpful to the businesses involved. They cannot be entirely replaced with teleconferencing or mass e-mailing. The personal touch, the sharing of facts and secrets face to face, are important. Could Congress really do its work if it held its sessions by teleconferencing? Could Congressional committee hearings work as well by conference call? Could the Supreme Court?
 Technology is wonderful and indispensable. But for finding out the tricks of the trade, the way business runs in bad times and good, the latest developments in business and the economy, nothing can replace the spark of intelligence that travels from person to person at meetings.
 Moreover, it would be harsh in the extreme to kick the hospitality industry when it is down by frowning on business meetings, thereby making hotels lay off cooks and waiters and maids.
 I understand the crusade against use of federal money for lavish parties and nauseating bonuses for executives of bailed-out companies -- though I have been to a lot of parties at the White House, under previous administrations, and some of these events have been darned lavish, and financed by taxpayers. I do lament that this crackdown on corruption could spread to firing an immigrant (who was just looking for a better life) from her job as a carpet cleaner in a hotel.
 MAYBE, with his customary precision of speech, President Obama could make it clear that he has nothing against business travel itself -- but that he is only against a glaring abuse of government aid to bailed-out companies.
 As my pal, Phil DeMuth, notes, who would be better off if business travel for meetings ground to a halt? No one and nothing. Business meetings are not the enemy. In terms of making the nation more productive and better off, they are builders, not saboteurs.

HEADLINE: Making Music With Less

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LIKE many musicians who play for the handful of small professional orchestras outside of New York City these days, Gabriel Schaff, a violinist, is struggling to cobble together a living. Mr. Schaff, 49, has contracts that guarantee work with four orchestras, including the Stamford Symphony Orchestra and Long Island Philharmonic. He substitutes in others, including the Westfield Symphony Orchestra in Union County. And he takes side work, like Broadway shows, in between. 
 But side work has grown scarcer as Broadway retrenches. Substitute jobs are in shorter supply. Nearly all the orchestras Mr. Schaff regularly plays for are offering less work than in the past, because of the economic downturn. And one of those groups, the Opera Orchestra of New York, has just canceled its two remaining shows this season at Carnegie Hall, citing significant reductions in ''all areas of public support.'' 
 ''It has forced me into a part-time, hand-to-mouth existence,'' said Mr. Schaff, who commutes to various jobs from his home in Harrington Park in Bergen County. 
 To try to balance their annual budgets, which range up to $2 million, many of these smaller orchestras in the suburbs that use professional musicians have reduced rehearsal time, shortened their seasons and scaled back productions.
 In addition to the Long Island Philharmonic, the Stamford Symphony and the Westfield Symphony, regional orchestras in the New York region include groups like the Westchester Philharmonic; the Hartford Symphony Orchestra and the New Haven Symphony Orchestra in Connecticut; and, in New Jersey, the Colonial Symphony, and the New Philharmonic of New Jersey, which perform in Morristown, and the Garden State Philharmonic in Ocean County. These ensembles have part-time schedules but full-time professional players. 
 In contrast, community orchestras -- groups like the St. Thomas Orchestra, based in White Plains; the North Shore Symphony Orchestra on Long Island; and the Bloomfield Symphony Orchestra in Essex County -- are composed largely of amateurs who work for little or no money. Though community orchestras may employ professional ''ringers'' who fill out sections and are paid, their organizational structures tend to be less like full-time orchestras' than are the regional orchestras'. 
 For the professional musicians, rehearsal time has emerged as a major point of contention. It is often the first thing orchestras trim, since such cuts are not visible to the public. Some orchestras, like the Colonial Symphony and the Long Island Philharmonic, are slashing rehearsal time to one session before some concerts, rather than two or three. Others are trying to hold the line after making cuts in the post-9/11 period, which is when the Stamford Symphony replaced four preconcert sessions of 2 1/2 hours each with three sessions of three hours.
 But Eckart Preu, the Stamford orchestra's fiery conductor, took the situation in stride. 
 Mr. Preu, 39, a native of Germany whose preshow ritual includes bouncing on the balls of his feet backstage like a soccer player, has a kinetic style well suited to the hurried pace that many musicians for regional orchestras say they now feel. He said that limiting rehearsal time helped maintain creative tension going into a performance. 
 ''The more you nail things down, the more perfect it's going to be, but also the less freedom you have in performance,'' he said.
 His views, however, were not echoed by his counterparts at other orchestras. 
 Itzhak Perlman, who has signed on for three seasons as artistic director of the Westchester Philharmonic and appeared twice so far this season, argued that more rehearsal time helped an orchestra get beyond a work's mechanics and find its artistic core.
 ''The more you play a piece, the more you feel free with it,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''Then you can actually forget about playing the piece and be busier about making music.'' 
 The Westfield Symphony, founded in 1983, recently reduced the number of rehearsals for some concerts from three to two. David Wroe, the symphony's conductor, said he worried that under-rehearsed, overcautious musicians would ultimately communicate their hesitancy to the audience. 
 ''In a safe performance,'' Mr. Wroe said, ''when the musicians are trying to keep it as controlled as possible, emotional intensity is compromised, I believe, and the audience does feel that.''
 The situation is unnerving freelancers like Mr. Schaff, the violinist. The net loss of an hour of rehearsal time may not seem like much, but when added to the hours of unpaid time spent preparing for rehearsals, it can add up to thousands of dollars.
 For the orchestra, of course, that means money saved. At the current base pay for musicians of $47 an hour for rehearsals, that would be $3,000 or more for a concert that calls for a full complement of players. And the public so far seems not to have noticed. 
 In interviews, longtime Stamford Symphony patrons who gathered at a Chinese restaurant for a ritual preconcert supper earlier this year generally offered praise for the orchestra. Two hours later, they packed the nearby Palace Theater and applauded the orchestra warmly. 
 But Mr. Schaff and some of his fellow orchestra members had a different take. Driving home after the show, Mr. Schaff said, their conversation quickly turned to the opening number, Samuel Barber's ''Adagio for Strings.'' They commented how even an extra hour of rehearsal time might have allowed the piece, squeezed between run-throughs of seven other works, to mature. 
 ''It's such a gorgeous piece, and yet it sounded like we were just walking through it,'' said Mr. Schaff, who has played with the orchestra for more than 20 years. ''It's a terrible feeling because we all wanted it to settle in and find its natural shape and natural drive.'' 
 Told of the musicians' worries, Barbara Soroca, executive director of the Stamford orchestra, whose background is in business, dismissed the concern. ''If you ask any musician or any music director, they would ask for even more rehearsal time,'' she said. ''This is an appropriate amount of time. It's pretty standard. Some orchestras have cut further.'' 
 Ms. Soroca's stance is not unusual among orchestra administrators, though she acknowledged the danger of further cuts. She said she planned to deal with a projected decline of 10 percent to 20 percent in contributions next season by using smaller orchestras for one or two concerts or moving rehearsals from the concert hall into less expensive rental space, which would save $10,000 over the season. 
 For the Westchester Philharmonic, Mr. Perlman has been seeking a different approach. At a rehearsal for a November concert, he asked Joshua Worby, the executive director, for an extra hour, and received it. The time, tacked on to a previously reduced schedule of three 2 1/2-hour sessions, was especially valuable in preparing Brahms's First Symphony, Mr. Perlman said. 
 Mr. Worby said that finding the money for the extra time was a struggle, but that he could not deny Mr. Perlman. He said he suspected that the renowned violinist would request additional rehearsal time again -- a request that, if granted, could begin to alter the calculus on which the orchestra's management decisions are based. 
 That Mr. Perlman received the additional time has not hurt his reputation with the Westchester Philharmonic players, some of whom had been anxious about his arrival in October, said Peter Reit, the principal French horn player, who, like nearly all of the orchestra's members, has played with it for most of its 26 years. 
 Mr. Perlman said he never planned to ''cause any revolutions.''
 By all accounts, Mr. Perlman has won over the musicians with his personal style, conducting technique and power as a drawing card, his reputation having spurred a sharp increase in attendance for performances at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College in New York. 
 But the orchestra, which in the post-9/11 period eliminated one of the five pairs of concerts it typically performed each season, has been unable to restore it, though that remains a goal. The orchestra, Mr. Worby said, is still carrying debt at a time when contributions are declining and costs are rising. He said that spending increased by 37 percent in the past year, partly as a result of Mr. Perlman's fees, increased marketing and advertising costs and a decision to use larger ensembles on a more consistent basis.
 To keep down costs, some orchestra directors are abandoning the practice of bringing in well-known soloists. In the midst of what the Stamford Symphony's promotions describe as ''A Season of Extraordinary Soloists,'' the executive director, Ms. Soroca, said she did not intend to book marquee names next season. She noted that the relative newcomer Tai Murray, 27, was well received as the soloist earlier this year on Barber's ''Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.'' 
 Most orchestra directors agree on the need to generate income by expanding education programs. The programs are often effective at gaining children's attention: At a recent performance at the Newbridge Road Elementary School in North Bellmore, N.Y., a quintet culled from the Long Island Philharmonic played for hundreds of enthusiastic 7- to 11-year-olds in a production that coupled stripped-down arrangements of popular orchestral themes with a script that referred to Harry Potter and other literary characters. 
 But Valerie Levy, a violinist who oversaw the proceedings in North Bellmore, said that even the in-school programs may be in trouble. ''It's very alarming,'' she said. After a period of growth in the programs, she said, inquiries for further performances on Long Island have fallen off dramatically. 
 Any falloff in education programs is a concern for musicians because the programs compensate for cuts elsewhere. At the Long Island Philharmonic, the programs give work to string players like Ms. Levy, who, like Mr. Schaff, has been hit by the Opera Orchestra of New York's recent cancellations. This month, the philharmonic performed Beethoven's Seventh Symphony with one rehearsal and six first violins, barely a third the number in top full-time orchestras. Smaller string sections have become more common as well at the Westfield Symphony, another orchestra Ms. Levy plays in regularly, and one in which Mr. Schaff substitutes.
 Though large for a second-tier New Jersey orchestra (the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, based in Newark, occupies the top tier on its own, outside the regional-orchestra class), the Westfield Symphony's $750,000 budget is only about half that of the Westchester Philharmonic or Stamford Symphony. That puts Mr. Wroe, the music director, at a competitive disadvantage despite his successes in extending the orchestra's cultural and financial reach. 
 The musicians and management have been unable to reach a collective bargaining agreement with terms that fully match those in pacts recently negotiated by the other regional orchestras working with Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said Ms. Levy, who is on the negotiating committee. 
 Mr. Wroe said, ''In light of the stresses and strains of the present economy, it's added an element of seriousness and urgency to the negotiations, and put an undue strain on us all.''
 Mr. Wroe said that growing pressure to cut costs led to the scheduling last month of Rossini's ''Barber of Seville,'' a piece that he felt needed relatively little rehearsal time -- and received it. 
 Mr. Schaff, recalling the rehearsals for that show -- fewer in number, more feverish in pace and employing a string section arguably thinner than the music demanded -- had little faith that the cost-cutting at the Westfield Symphony, or any other orchestra for which he played, was over. 
 ''This is only the beginning,'' he said.

HEADLINE: No Safety in Numbers

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Is there such a thing left as a safe investment? Stocks have been massacred, real estate all but wiped out. Each was promoted in its day -- as was gold -- as safe and secure, appropriate for widows and orphans. 
 If there is a truly last bastion of safety, it would be, of course, the U.S. Treasury bond, that venerable instrument with the full faith and credit of the United States behind it. Perhaps it is esteemed so highly because we think of it not as an ''investment'' per se but as an article of faith in Washington and, by extension, the entire country. It is our tax dollars, after all, that stand behind it -- the accumulated output of our citizens. And ever since the Wall Street meltdown, as investors have fled from any security carrying a whiff of danger, Treasuries have been in hot demand. 
 So it is an eye-opener, and rather depressing, to report that even Treasuries bear risk, in particular, the risk that flows from crowd psychology. Last month, in his annual letter to shareholders (of which I am one), Warren Buffett wrote: ''When the financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost equally extraordinary.'' 
 Pretty strong words for an investment that has outperformed stocks over the past 25 years and is widely referred to as ''riskless.'' Yet according to Buffett and other investors of a cautious bent, ''risk free'' Treasuries of longer maturities are anything but. None other than China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, expressed worry about the safety of China's big stake in U.S. bonds.
 Not since World War II has the government borrowed anything close to what it is borrowing now. Because of the economic slowdown, the stimulus package and various financial-relief measures, pundits estimate this year's federal deficit at $1.75 trillion. To put the figures in (alarming) perspective, over the past half century and regardless of the party in power, federal tax receipts have usually provided 80 to 90 percent of the money needed to fill the budget; thus, the government has had to borrow only the remaining fraction. But this year, it will need to borrow 45 percent, virtually half, of what it is projected to spend. This means that the U.S. government is looking much like a homeowner at the tail end of the boom: too hooked on spending (even if, hopefully, for a worthy cause) to stay within its means. 
 When you buy a Treasury security, you are actually lending the government money for a set period of time -- from 30 days to 30 years -- at a fixed rate of interest. Few people worry that Uncle Sam will go the way of a defaulting subprime borrower because the government, unlike other debtors, can always print the money it needs.
 But as James Bianco, who runs an eponymous bond-research firm, explains, investors in fixed-income securities face two types of risk. One is credit risk -- the risk of default. The other is what bond geeks refer to as ''duration'' risk. This is the risk that, even if the bonds are paid in full, the promised rate of interest will turn out to be worth less over time. 
 Inflation destroys bond values. It's not a big deal over one or two years, but if you hold a long-term bond and inflation takes off, the present value of the security will plummet. Bonds also lose value as interest rates go up. If rates on 30-year U.S. bonds, recently 3 percent, were to rise to, say, 6 percent, the value of bonds issued at the lower rate would fall nearly in half. (The reason is largely intuitive: if the market rate is 6 percent, nobody would be interested in a 3 percent bond, and its price would fall.)
 One thing that could make interest rates rise would be an economic recovery that spurred more firms to seek credit. That would be good news for the country, of course, but not for long-term bondholders. And it's conceivable that rates on Treasuries could rise even without a strong recovery. Government budget deficits always bring a fear of higher rates (interest rates represent the price of credit, and deficits mean that the government will be demanding more of it). And given the looming shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare, it is not clear when the deficits will end.
 Granted, Treasury bonds are not quite tulip bulbs or dot-com stocks. Investors purchase them out of fear, not greed. Presumably they are not doubling-down, buying Treasuries with borrowed money to juice profits. But that distinction may not save them.
 Think of the yield on Treasuries as a reverse indicator of investor sentiment. The stronger the attachment people have for Treasuries, the more willing they are to accept a low return. Once the Wall Street crisis hit, investors traded what had been a strong attachment to Treasuries for downright love. Naturally enough, given this fearful ardor, the yield touched post-Depression lows. 
 As with any investment, generalized enthusiasm leads to frothy prices. In seeking safety, global investors pushed Treasuries to a vulnerable level. Bond-market optimists take comfort from the Federal Reserve Board, which has hinted that to keep interest rates from rising, it would be the lender of last resort. But were the Fed to absorb surplus Treasuries, the government would, in fact, merely be ''printing money,'' says Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond house Pimco. When the economy rebounds, such a scenario could lead to a textbook case of inflation and devastate the ultimate ''safe'' investment. And lately, bond rates have begun to rise. 
 The primary lesson of this crisis is that we, as a nation, took on too much risk -- leveraging finite capital on a fantasy that no bet would ever go bad. But there's another lesson, too. Even safety has its price, and if we overpay for it, we create new risks. Risk, in short, may be something we have to live with.

HEADLINE: Try, Try Again, Or Maybe Not

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERLIN. 
Leslie Berlin is project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford. E-mail: prototype@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IF at first you don't succeed, it doesn't matter that you tried.
 That seems to be the message of a working paper prepared recently by a team at Harvard Business School. The study found that when it comes to venture-backed entrepreneurship, the only experience that counts is success. 
 ''The data are absolutely clear,'' says Paul A. Gompers, a professor of business administration at the school and one of the study's authors. ''Does failure breed new knowledge or experience that can be leveraged into performance the second time around?'' he asks. In some cases, yes, but over all, he says, ''We found there is no benefit in terms of performance.'' 
 The study looked at several thousand venture-capital-backed companies from 1986 to 2003.
 Professor Gompers and his co-authors Anna Kovner, Josh Lerner and David S. Scharfstein found that first-time entrepreneurs who received venture capital funding had a 22 percent chance of success. Success was defined as going public or filing to go public; Professor Gompers says the results were similar when using other measures, like acquisition or merger. 
 Already-successful entrepreneurs were far more likely to succeed again: their success rate for later venture-backed companies was 34 percent. But entrepreneurs whose companies had been liquidated or gone bankrupt had almost the same follow-on success rate as the first-timers: 23 percent. 
 In other words, trying and failing bought the entrepreneurs nothing -- it was as if they never tried. Or, as Professor Gompers puts it, ''for the average entrepreneur who failed, no learning happened.''
 This finding flies in the face of conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley, where failure is regarded as an important opportunity for learning. No less an authority than Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, says that in the Valley, ''You're more valuable because of the experiences you've been through under failures.'' 
 The basic idea behind the embrace of failure is this: Entrepreneurs who have built and then tried to save a company have seen what does and doesn't work. This experience is viewed as excellent preparation for tough situations that might arise in a new venture.
 ''Given conventional wisdom, we were expecting to find much lower differences between failed and successful entrepreneurs,'' Professor Gompers concedes. 
 Not all failures are equal, explains William H. Davidow, a founding partner in the venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures. A company might fail because its timing was bad or because the entrepreneur was a poor manager. Mr. Davidow, who says he would have expected ''a higher follow-on success rate for the failed entrepreneurs,'' says that an entrepreneur who has failed in a previous venture ''would get in the door to talk to me'' about a new idea. But, he adds, ''I would want to know why that last deal failed, and what the person learned from it.'' 
 Mark Pincus, founder and chief executive of Zynga Inc., a San Francisco company that develops online games that can be played on social networks like Facebook and MySpace, says his previous company, Tribe.net, ''is for sure a failure from the investors' standpoint.'' Tribe.net was an early social networking company that Mr. Pincus says raised $9 million in venture capital before it was liquidated in 2006. 
 Despite this outcome at his previous company, Mr. Pincus has raised $39 million in venture capital for Zynga, which he says is profitable and has eight million daily active users. In part, the support he received from venture capitalists reflects the fact that Mr. Pincus founded two successful companies before Tribe.net.
 But Mr. Pincus also thinks that in general, venture capitalists expect entrepreneurs to take risks, and both groups anticipate occasional failures. 
 ''As an entrepreneur, you have to get used to failure,'' he says. ''It is just part of the path to success.''
 Terence Craig, founder and chief executive of PatternBuilders, a company in South San Francisco, Calif., that builds software for the retail industry, says that ''there is such a thing as valiant failure.'' Mr. Craig says his first software company, Optimize Solutions, raised $4.5 million but closed in 2001 when the tech bubble burst. 
 At PatternBuilders, which Mr. Craig started in 2005, he has put into practice several lessons learned at Optimize. He says he is savvier about assessing competitors and ''focusing on customers' needs.'' Experiences at Optimize also taught him that people who have been successful in large companies are not necessarily going to work out at a start-up, he says. Instead, he looks for ''an entrepreneurial mind-set.'' 
 Mr. Craig says that his company will announce ''two Fortune-500 customers next quarter'' and that he is optimistic about PatternBuilders' future. He also believes that if the company fails, ''there is no downside from a career perspective.'' Even in the down economy, he says, he and his 15 employees are receiving recruiting calls.
 ALTHOUGH the study found that in general, failures are not a particularly effective teacher of entrepreneurship, Professor Gompers said that ''absolutely some entrepreneurs can learn'' from them.
 ''There are some talented entrepreneurs who fail on the first time, learn and then succeed,'' he said. But, he added, ''that is not the rule.'' 
 Where does Silicon Valley's deep-rooted belief in the value of failure come from? Mr. Gompers suggests what he calls ''attribution bias'' -- people generalizing from anecdotal success-after-failure stories. 
 ''There is a lot of industry folklore and myth out there,'' he says. ''We tried to bring data to bear on it.''

HEADLINE: Leaving the No Child Left Behind List

BYLINE: By ANNIE CORREAL

 BODY:
NINE schools and four school districts on Long Island have been removed from the list of schools that need improvement under the federal No Child Left Behind law, as New York made its biggest gains since the State Education Department began compiling the list in 2003, education officials said. 
 The state removes a school or district from the list based on student performance on math and English language arts tests. ''This year was the biggest improvement that we saw,'' said Jane Briggs, a spokeswoman for the State Education Department, after the department made its announcement last week. 
 On Long Island, the South Country, Freeport, Hempstead and Longwood school districts were removed from the list. The North Babylon and William Floyd districts were added, but each said it was because of errors. 
 ''Being off the list is an important acknowledgment that our plans and strategies are working,'' said Eric L. Eversley, the Freeport superintendent. He said he was ''certainly very happy'' when he got the news, which he called a boost for the district's teachers and 6,530 students.
 After being placed on the list in 2007, the Freeport district started looking more closely at performance data and began making quarterly assessments based on individual performance, he said. 
 At the Caroline G. Atkinson School, which serves Freeport's fifth and sixth graders, and which was also taken off the list this year, the school doubled the time devoted to math and English language arts, and added after-school and Saturday tutoring sessions, with the help of private grants. The principal, Linda Carter, said she was ecstatic that the school had been taken off the list. 
 A school or district is removed from the list when it shows improvement two years in a row in student performance in an area where a problem was identified.
 ''If they were identified for fourth-grade math, they would have to make the progress in fourth-grade math for two consecutive years in order to come off the list and be a school in good standing,'' Ms. Briggs said. 
 The other schools removed from the list were the Fulton School in Hempstead; Lawrence Senior High School; Brentwood High School; South Middle School in Brentwood; Cordello Avenue Elementary School in Central Islip; Patchogue-Medford High School; Riverhead Middle School; and Bellport Middle School in South Country. 
 Newly added to the list were Saltzman East Memorial Elementary School in Farmingdale and Clayton Huey Elementary School in Central Moriches.
 Across the state this year, more schools were removed from the list than last year. In 2009, 85 schools and 11 districts were removed, up from 46 schools and 4 districts in 2008, the State Education Department said.
 The number of schools and districts listed this year declined compared with the last two years. This year, there were 62 schools and 4 districts newly listed, compared with 123 schools and 9 districts in 2008. 
 In the William Floyd district, the superintendent, Paul Casciano, said in a statement that being added to the needs-improvement list was an embarrassment, and he attributed it to a coding error.
 James Montalto, a William Floyd spokesman, said that the district was cited for insufficient test participation because it erroneously marked 11 English-language learner students, who were exempt from a test, as having not taken it, meaning it appeared not to meet the state's participation standard.
 School officials said there has been concern over the process that places schools and districts on the ''in need of improvement'' list. Federal law requires schools and districts to assess the test scores of nine subgroups separately from the total student population, including students with disabilities, limited English proficiency and economic disadvantage, as well as several minority groups. Poor results by any subgroup can result in a school's being put on the list.
 ''It is a very intricate system, and coding errors can arise,'' Mr. Montalto said.

HEADLINE: Making Music With Less

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LIKE many musicians who play for the handful of small professional orchestras outside of New York City these days, Gabriel Schaff, a violinist, is struggling to cobble together a living. Mr. Schaff, 49, has contracts that guarantee work with four orchestras, including the Stamford Symphony Orchestra and Long Island Philharmonic. He substitutes in others, including the Westfield Symphony Orchestra in New Jersey. And he takes side work, like Broadway shows, in between. 
 But side work has grown scarcer as Broadway retrenches. Substitute jobs are in shorter supply. Nearly all the orchestras Mr. Schaff regularly plays for are offering less work than in the past, because of the economic downturn. And one of those groups, the Opera Orchestra of New York, has just canceled its two remaining shows this season at Carnegie Hall, citing significant reductions in ''all areas of public support.'' 
 ''It has forced me into a part-time, hand-to-mouth existence,'' said Mr. Schaff, who commutes to his various jobs from his home in Harrington Park, N.J. 
 To try to balance their annual budgets, which range up to $2 million, many of these smaller orchestras in the suburbs that use professional musicians have reduced rehearsal time, shortened their seasons and scaled back productions.
 In addition to the Long Island Philharmonic, the Stamford Symphony and the Westfield Symphony, regional orchestras in the New York region include groups like the Westchester Philharmonic; the Hartford Symphony Orchestra and the New Haven Symphony Orchestra in Connecticut; and, in New Jersey, the Colonial Symphony, the Garden State Philharmonic and the New Philharmonic of New Jersey. These ensembles have part-time schedules but full-time professional players. 
 In contrast, community orchestras -- groups like the St. Thomas Orchestra in Westchester, the North Shore Symphony Orchestra on Long Island and the Bloomfield Symphony Orchestra in New Jersey -- are composed largely of amateurs who work for little or no money. Though community orchestras may employ professional ''ringers'' who fill out sections and are paid, their organizational structures tend to be less like full-time orchestras' than are the regional orchestras'. 
 For the professional musicians, rehearsal time has emerged as a major point of contention. It is often the first thing orchestras trim, since such cuts are not visible to the public. Some orchestras, like the Colonial Symphony and the Long Island Philharmonic, are slashing rehearsal time to one session before some concerts, rather than two or three. Others are trying to hold the line after making cuts in the post-9/11 period, which is when the Stamford Symphony replaced four preconcert sessions of 2 1/2 hours each with three sessions of three hours.
 But Eckart Preu, the Stamford orchestra's fiery conductor, took the situation in stride. 
 Mr. Preu, 39, a native of Germany whose preshow ritual includes bouncing on the balls of his feet backstage like a soccer player, has a kinetic style well suited to the hurried pace that many musicians for regional orchestras say they now feel. He said that limiting rehearsal time helped maintain creative tension going into a performance. 
 ''The more you nail things down, the more perfect it's going to be, but also the less freedom you have in performance,'' he said.
 His views, however, were not echoed by his counterparts at other orchestras. 
 Itzhak Perlman, who has signed on for three seasons as artistic director of the Westchester Philharmonic and appeared twice so far this season, argued that more rehearsal time helped an orchestra get beyond a work's mechanics and find its artistic core. ''The more you play a piece, the more you feel free with it,'' he said. ''Then you can actually forget about playing the piece and be busier about making music.'' 
 In New Jersey, the Westfield Symphony recently reduced the number of rehearsals for some concerts from three to two. David Wroe, the symphony's conductor, said he worried that under-rehearsed, overcautious musicians would ultimately communicate their hesitancy to the audience. 
 ''In a safe performance,'' he said, ''when the musicians are trying to keep it as controlled as possible, emotional intensity is compromised, I believe, and the audience does feel that.''
 The situation is unnerving freelancers like Mr. Schaff, the violinist. The net loss of an hour of rehearsal time may not seem like much, but when added to the hours of unpaid time spent preparing for rehearsals, it can add up to thousands of dollars.
 For the orchestra, of course, that means money saved. At the current base pay for musicians of $47 an hour for rehearsals, that would be $3,000 or more for a concert that calls for a full complement of players. And the public so far seems not to have noticed. 
 In interviews, longtime Stamford Symphony patrons who gathered at a Chinese restaurant for a ritual preconcert supper earlier this year generally offered praise for the orchestra. Two hours later, they packed the nearby Palace Theater and applauded the orchestra warmly. 
 But Mr. Schaff and some of his fellow orchestra members had a different take. Driving home after the show, Mr. Schaff said, their conversation quickly turned to the opening number, Samuel Barber's ''Adagio for Strings.'' They commented how even an extra hour of rehearsal time might have allowed the piece, squeezed between run-throughs of seven other works, to mature. 
 ''It's such a gorgeous piece, and yet it sounded like we were just walking through it,'' said Mr. Schaff, who has played with the orchestra for more than 20 years. ''It's a terrible feeling because we all wanted it to settle in and find its natural shape and natural drive.'' 
 Told of the musicians' worries, Barbara Soroca, executive director of the Stamford orchestra, whose background is in business, dismissed the concern. ''If you ask any musician or any music director, they would ask for even more rehearsal time,'' she said. ''This is an appropriate amount of time. It's pretty standard. Some orchestras have cut further.'' 
 Ms. Soroca's stance is not unusual among orchestra administrators, though she acknowledged the danger of further cuts. She said she planned to deal with a projected decline of 10 percent to 20 percent in contributions next season by using smaller orchestras for one or two concerts or moving rehearsals from the concert hall into less expensive rental space, which would save $10,000 over the season. 
 For the Westchester Philharmonic, Mr. Perlman has been seeking a different approach. At a rehearsal for a November concert, he asked Joshua Worby, the executive director, for an extra hour, and received it. The time, tacked on to a previously reduced schedule of three 2 1/2-hour sessions, was especially valuable in preparing Brahms's First Symphony, Mr. Perlman said. 
 Mr. Worby said that finding the money for the extra time was a struggle, but that he could not deny Mr. Perlman. He said that he suspected the renowned violinist would request additional rehearsal time again -- a request that, if granted, could begin to alter the calculus on which the orchestra's management decisions are based. 
 That Mr. Perlman received the additional time has not hurt his reputation with the Westchester Philharmonic players, some of whom had been anxious about his arrival in October, said Peter Reit, the principal French horn player, who, like nearly all of the orchestra's members, has played with it for most of its 26 years. 
 Mr. Perlman said he never planned to ''cause any revolutions.''
 By all accounts, Mr. Perlman has won over the musicians with his personal style, conducting technique and power as a drawing card, his reputation having spurred a sharp increase in attendance for performances at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College in New York. 
 But the orchestra, which in the post-9/11 period eliminated one of the five pairs of concerts it typically performed each season, has been unable to restore it, though that remains a goal. The orchestra, Mr. Worby said, is still carrying debt at a time when contributions are declining and costs are rising. He said that spending increased by 37 percent in the past year, partly as a result of Mr. Perlman's fees, increased marketing and advertising costs and a decision to use larger ensembles on a more consistent basis.
 To keep down costs, some orchestra directors are abandoning the practice of bringing in well-known soloists. In the midst of what the Stamford Symphony's promotions describe as ''A Season of Extraordinary Soloists,'' the executive director, Ms. Soroca, said she did not intend to book marquee names next season. She noted that the relative newcomer Tai Murray, 27, was well received as the soloist earlier this year on Barber's ''Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.'' 
 Most orchestra directors agree on the need to generate income by expanding education programs. The programs are often effective at gaining children's attention: At a recent performance at the Newbridge Road Elementary School in North Bellmore, N.Y., a quintet culled from the Long Island Philharmonic played for hundreds of enthusiastic 7- to 11-year-olds in a production that coupled stripped-down arrangements of popular orchestral themes with a script that referred to Harry Potter and other literary characters. 
 But Valerie Levy, a violinist who oversaw the proceedings in North Bellmore, said that even the in-school programs may be in trouble. ''It's very alarming,'' she said. After a period of growth in the programs, she said, inquiries for further performances on Long Island have fallen off dramatically. 
 Any falloff in education programs is a concern for musicians because the programs compensate for cuts elsewhere. At the Long Island Philharmonic, the programs give work to string players like Ms. Levy, who, like Mr. Schaff, has been hit by the Opera Orchestra of New York's recent cancellations. This month, the philharmonic performed Beethoven's Seventh Symphony with one rehearsal and six first violins, barely a third the number in top full-time orchestras. Smaller string sections have become more common as well at the Westfield Symphony, another orchestra Ms. Levy plays in regularly, and one in which Mr. Schaff substitutes.
 Though large for a second-tier New Jersey orchestra (the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, based in Newark, occupies the top tier on its own, outside the regional-orchestra class), the Westfield Symphony's $750,000 budget is only about half that of the Westchester Philharmonic or Stamford Symphony. That puts Mr. Wroe, the music director, at a competitive disadvantage despite his successes in extending the orchestra's cultural and financial reach. 
 The musicians and management have been unable to reach a collective bargaining agreement with terms that fully match those in pacts recently negotiated by the other regional orchestras working with Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, said Ms. Levy, who is on the negotiating committee. 
 Mr. Wroe said, ''In light of the stresses and strains of the present economy, it's added an element of seriousness and urgency to the negotiations, and put an undue strain on us all.''
 Mr. Wroe said that growing pressure to cut costs led to the scheduling last month of Rossini's ''Barber of Seville,'' a piece that he felt needed relatively little rehearsal time -- and received it. 
 Mr. Schaff, recalling the rehearsals for that show -- fewer in number, more feverish in pace and employing a string section arguably thinner than the music demanded -- had little faith that the cost-cutting at the Westfield Symphony, or any other orchestra for which he played, was over. 
 ''This is only the beginning,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Turning Over Tomato Seedlings to the Professionals

BYLINE: By GERRI HIRSHEY

 BODY:
IN the months since our first-born lit out for his freshman year of college, I have struggled to find the upside of his absence. And now I've got it: His airy, empty bedroom is the perfect nursery for my vegetable seedlings, which have long tyrannized the family room with humming grow lights from late March through May.
 Mom's March madness will also be tempered somewhat this year by a startling resolution: No needy, space-hogging tomato seedlings. It's not because we're any less consumed by tomato lust. But something wonderful is happening, nationwide and here in Connecticut. Quality tomato seedlings for luscious heirloom varieties, many organically raised, are finally plentiful and reasonable. I've long grown my own of necessity, but now the pros do it. Better. 
 Case in point: Last season, a yellow Brandywine heirloom plant I bought on impulse grew into a tall, muscular vine that had to be triple-staked, so heavy was the fruit. When thickly sliced, each gorgeous, dense and sunny-sweet tomato covered a platter and elicited whimpers and moans from normally reserved dinner guests. I think I paid $2.95 for the 8-inch plant, which yielded about 15 tomatoes averaging a pound or more apiece. Since market prices for heirlooms were averaging $4 to $5 a pound, it seemed a robust profit at table.
 As a low investment-high yield money crop, home-grown tomatoes have long outdistanced the Dow. This has been true since the Depression-era 1930s, when a West Virginian named M. C. Byles, known as Radiator Charlie, used a baby's ear syringe and pollen from 10 plants to cross-breed the granddaddy of heirloom tomato plants. He called it the Mortgage Lifter. 
 What better-named talisman for our realty-challenged times than this sweet, pink-hued mega-fruit that can weigh in at more than two pounds? At a buck apiece -- a lot in those days -- Mr. Byles sold enough seedlings to pay off his $6,000 mortgage in six years. Growing a few plants at home won't pull any underwater homeowner to dry land these days. But a pre-season check with local growers reveals that the market is bullish indeed for heirloom tomato seedlings. 
 The first organically raised heirloom plants I came across, several years ago, were grown by Paul Bucciaglia, proprietor of Fort Hill Farm in New Milford, Conn. They were sure winners, snapped up quickly at area farmer's markets, and in fairly short supply. Happily, Mr. Bucciaglia has bumped up production and variety this year: Cherokee Purple, Brandywines, Striped Germans, yellow Lemon Boys and more. They'll be available in Fort Hill's stall at the Westport Farmer's Market. 
 ''Business is up significantly,'' said Barbara Pierson, nursery manager for White Flower Farm in Litchfield, which ships seedlings nationwide. ''There's a surge of interest in vegetables, berries and herbs. The savings are great, but for me it's about the flavor. I love going out at night and finding something that's just perfectly ripe for dinner. No market can give you that.''
 She's right, of course. Most of us grow tomatoes for love, not money. And tomato lust has gotten off to an especially early start at White Flower. Ms. Pierson just shot a video on how to select and grow tomato seedlings in containers, which is available on the nursery's Web
 site (whiteflowerfarm.com
 /video-growing-tomatoes-in-containers
 .html). And she is beginning to seed her stock for TomatoMania, the tomato freaks' Woodstock, which requires police for crowd and traffic control when it is held at White Flower in mid-May. 
 The events of Tomato Mania -- billed as ''the world's largest tomato seedling sale'' by its California-based promoter, Scott Daigre -- have been a West Coast phenomenon from Sonoma to Beverly Hills since 1991. Mr. Daigre, a garden designer turned the Dale Carnegie of tomatophiles, is running his Litchfield event from May 15 to 17. ''I'll have about 10,000 plants ready,'' said Ms. Pierson, who describes it as ''completely crazy. A madhouse. And a ball.''
 I called Sal Gilbertie, second-generation proprietor of Gilbertie's Herb Farms in Easton, Conn., which grew my standout yellow Brandywine. He has upped production of vegetable and herb plants by 20 percent this season, with full organic certification for the first time in the grower's 77-year history. ''Bad times are good for us,'' Mr. Gilbertie said. ''My family first made its money during the Victory Garden years in the '40s. It was huge.''
 United States Department of Agriculture records bear him out; in 1943, thanks to the nation's Victory Garden program, intended to boost backyard production and let the farmers feed World War II troops, more than 20 million home and community gardens yielded 8 million tons of food. The harvest represented 40 percent of the fresh vegetables consumed that year.
 For 2009, says Mr. Gilbertie, ''Tomatoes are the number-one crop.'' But he is gratified by the change in customers' sophistication. ''For years, everybody wanted one Early Girl, one Big Boy, one cherry plant. Now they're going to more plants, in more varieties. Brandywines, Mortgage Lifters, Jersey Devils.''
 Though seedlings go on sale in Gilbertie's Westport retail store the first week in May, Mr. Gilbertie urges patience when putting them into the ground. ''Around Mother's Day, everyone gets planting fever. But you don't gain anything by planting early here -- last year we had a late frost in May.'' Ms. Pierson concurs. ''For Zones 5 and 6, you really can't plant until Memorial Day. Plant late and be late, it's O.K. Stronger plants with better fruit is always worth the wait.'' 
 To my surprise, Ms. Pierson said that she now grows her own tomatoes exclusively in containers on her patio. ''I came to it because of rodents and other critters. It's just more protected by the house.'' 
 Don't I know it. Defending my own well-fenced tomatoes from rodent guerilla raids, I've tried everything from fake rubber snakes to netting to predator urine that costs nearly as much as Chanel per ounce. The pricey natural repellent of rosemary and mint I sprayed on last year worked pretty well. Will I calculate the cost-per-tomato saved? Nah. When you're standing amid the vines with sun-warmed tomato juice on your chin, economy is no match for lust.

OUTPOSTS March Madness is our greatest sideshow, mood-lifter and time-suck all in one. It's sports at its most thrilling, more so than the slow choreography of the World Series, the bloated spectacle of the Super Bowl or the go-through-the-motions slog of professional basketball playoffs. And forget about college football, which may have its championship system determined by Congress. There, a ''national title'' is conferred on a team that gets the highest ratings in a bowl sponsored by a company now in receivership.
 Give me the clean, no-excuse trials of the young hoopsters. Hilltoppers and Huskies, Owls and Orangemen, Sun Devils and Blue Devils (the Satan subset). One of 65 teams will emerge champion. No dispute. Lose a game, you're gone. Win six in a row, you're King of the World. 
 Of course, it's a fantasy. Of course, the highest-seeded teams, the interchangeable Louisvilles and UConns, are likely to end up in the Final Four. And, of course, we should continue to be outraged over those A.I.G. bonuses, through every game. In fact, we should suspend the national anthem for one round and just send a collective boo in the direction of the insurance company's headquarters. 
 -- Timothy Egan, 
 from ''The Case for Hoopsteria''
 Reader Comments:
 I also like the finality of the tournament: you lose, you go home. No do-overs, no appeals to a higher court, no op-ed pieces, no special elections. So the referee called a blocking foul when it really was a charge, no matter, it's over. But win six games and a legendary story is established that will be replayed over and over again. For the true fan, it is the anticipation of the win and not the gloom of possible defeat. Maybe a lesson that we Americans should apply to our current economic situation.

 DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES Now, I'm just as jealous of the yoga-pants-at-9-a.m.-on-Monday-morning crowd as the next frazzled working mom. But, I'm sorry to say, however delicious charting the downfall of the wealthy at-home mom may be, we do have to stop for a little reality check. While the rich, bathed in our attention, are turning necessity into a hand-wringing sociological event, most women in this country are just going about their business, much as they always have.
 We -- journalists and readers both -- simply must, for once, resist the temptation to let what may or may not be happening to the top 5 percent (or 1 percent) of our country's families set the story line for what women's lives are becoming in this recession.
 Because, the fact is, the story's not about them.
 -- Judith Warner, 
 from ''Families to Care About''
 Reader Comments:
 Part of what is so difficult about the past 30 years of advances for women is that women at the highest household income and education levels -- those women in the best position to advocate for change for less fortunate women -- have been sidelined by lack of family-friendly corporate policies, as well as uber-ambitious husbands who can't fathom staying home with a sick child for a day. We are all in this together, as a society. Family-flexible policies help men, women, and most importantly children. We should all work together to make work-life balance a reality for everyone.
 -- Posted by Leslie Morgan Steiner
 The one great benefit that could (but won't necessarily) come from this recession is a retreat from our obsession with the lives of the rich and famous. It's perfectly fine to want to have a nice ''lifestyle,'' and just as possible to have it without being fabulously wealthy. 
 To have even a minimally satisfying home life, however, it is necessary to have a stable income and a roof over your head. The threat to income stability and home ownership are overriding concerns today, so compelling that even the media have ditched the travails of Paris Hilton for the actual problems of real people.

 100 DAYS Just past the midpoint of President Obama's first 100 days in office, a pattern is developing. As with Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan at the start of their presidencies, Mr. Obama is enjoying an extended honeymoon with the American people. But as with these prior presidents, the president is more popular than some of his policies. Polls show that a majority of Americans supported the stimulus bill but worry about the long-term debt it will create. A majority of Americans oppose additional bailout of the banks, which members of the Obama economic team have said may be necessary.
 Mr. Obama has perhaps surpassed all his presidential predecessors in the astonishing number of environmental, health care, educational and other initiatives he has proposed in his first weeks in office. He realizes, as does his chief of staff, that a president's power is greatest when he first takes office. But the political dynamics are different for Democratic House members who won in traditionally Republican or toss-up districts in 2008. Eight of the 11 Democrats who voted against the original House version of the stimulus came from such districts.
 The Democrats have such an overwhelming majority in the House that they can afford to lose a few seats. But the situation is different in the Senate, where anachronistic rules often require 60 votes to proceed expeditiously. This required Mr. Obama to go all out to win passage of his stimulus bill. Democratic holdouts on the omnibus spending bill delayed its passage and tied the Senate into knots for several days. It is not hard to envisage a gridlocked Senate if the Democrats lose a couple of seats in the 2010 elections.
 -- Lou Cannon, from ''Popular Presidents, Fractious Parties''
 Reader Comments: 
 Trying to predict how President Obama's policies are going to work out in the long run is a little like trying to predict the outcome of the Civil War after Fort Sumter and Bull Run. It's the early innings yet, but a few trends are emerging. The executive branch contains millions of operatives but just two elected officials who represent the entire country. Congress has 535 elected officials, none of whom represents more than 1 percent of the nation, and only a relative handful of staffers. Trying to steer this body is like pushing a heavy wagon with loose wheels through a gravel pit. If the driver is patient and skillful it can be done -- sort of. One casualty of our governing enterprise is bound to be ideological purity.

HEADLINE: Classic Taverns Shifting Into a New Age, Painfully

BYLINE: By MOINA NOOR

DATELINE: Norwalk 

 BODY:
 WHEN the Silvermine Tavern closed in late February, hundreds of customers crowded into the 200-year-old building nestled on the Silvermine River for a final Sunday brunch. Between bites of scrambled eggs and its signature honey buns, patrons traded stories and lamented the shuttering of a restaurant that had become their neighborhood's community center. 
 Many Norwalk residents, like Chris Burr, have family stories that are connected to the tavern. Mr. Burr's late grandfather John Burr was a furniture maker who constructed the tavern's bar. ''My dad would bring all the relatives to the tavern for a drink, to touch the bar and connect with the old man,'' Mr. Burr said. ''It's the last connection we have to Grandpa.''
 ''Attending the last brunch was like coming to a friend's wake,'' said Eleanor Sasso, a Wilton resident who celebrated all of her family's milestones at the tavern. 
 Like other historic inns in the area, the Silvermine Tavern was part of the fabric of its community. Located on the banks of the river, the tavern, with its creaky floors and antique-filled rooms, played host to weddings, bar mitzvahs and countless other special occasions. Local residents also brought out-of-town guests to the inn to show off New England's bucolic beauty. Now, however, the tavern stands out as an example of how iconic inns in this corner of Fairfield County are struggling to remain viable businesses at a time of economic hardship and changing dining tastes. 
 In neighboring Westport, the Three Bears Restaurant, a 100-year-old tavern and one of the town's oldest restaurants, closed at the end of January. Owned by the Vazzano family for the last 40 years, the Three Bears filed for bankruptcy protection in October, and according to the Town of Westport's Web site, its owners still owe more than $19,000 in property taxes. In early February, the restaurant reopened with new management and a new name -- Tiburon (the name of a coastal city in California). 
 ''The Three Bears takes me back to my childhood,'' said Allen Raymond, 86, Westport's volunteer municipal historian. ''It was always such a treat to go there. It broke my heart to see it close.''
 The Cobb's Mill Inn in Weston and the Roger Sherman Inn in New Canaan also have new owners who are giving their establishments a fresher look while still maintaining some of the old-world charm by updating menus and decor. ''Before, many people perceived this place as stodgy,'' said Nes Jaffre, who with her husband, Joseph, purchased the Roger Sherman Inn in August 2008.
 ''My objective was to bring a great deal of new energy to the food and the atmosphere. I have a great love and appreciation for history, but we need to appeal to a new generation,'' she said.
 The original buildings of many Connecticut inns and taverns date back to Colonial times when they were mills, stagecoach stops or homes of prominent citizens. Most became restaurants in the early 1900s and benefited from the opening in 1938 of the Merritt Parkway, which allowed city dwellers to head for the country in greater numbers.
 ''A lot of these places became popular as a result of the Sunday drive out of the city,'' said Christopher Wigren, deputy director for the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. ''Also, at the turn of the 20th century, there was a renewed interest in Colonial history and architecture. Local residents developed an attachment to these quaint old places.''
 Over the years, the inns have become not only places to eat, but also meeting places for community groups and artists. The Rotary Club of New Canaan, for example, holds its weekly meeting at the Roger Sherman Inn, and the Silvermine Tavern had a popular weekly jazz night that featured local and internationally known musicians. 
 ''Many of the decisions pertaining to this community were made at the tavern,'' said Ms. Sasso, who is active in the Silvermine Community Association, which met regularly at the tavern. After the tavern announced its closing, the community association decided to postpone its annual art show featuring artwork by area residents that had been scheduled to open in late February. 
 Frank Whitman Jr., who inherited the Silvermine Tavern from his father, Francis Sr., said he put the tavern up for sale in 2007 and had been hoping to find ''a white knight'' for the three-acre property. He finally decided to close the 80-year-old business this year, after a very slow Christmas season. 
 ''High gas prices this summer and bad weather this winter kept people home, and of course, the economy was the deciding factor,'' said Mr. Whitman, who closed the tavern just days after informing the Silvermine Community Association of his decision. 
 A change in dining trends has also affected the Silvermine, he said. ''In the last 15 or so years, Fairfield County has become a hub of top-notch restaurants. Before South Norwalk was considered the inner city, New Canaan only had a couple of luncheonettes and Wilton was dry,'' he said, noting that these towns now have thriving downtown scenes. ''People now think twice before coming to an out-of-the-way destination.''
 With a greater variety of dining choices, culinary tastes have also become more sophisticated, he said. ''It's now northern Italian versus chicken pot pie,'' Mr. Whitman said.
 Indeed, when Nes and Joseph Jaffre took over the Roger Sherman Inn, the first thing they did was hire a new chef. It now features a ''seasonal French-American inspired menu.'' 
 While the Roger Sherman's emphasis is on fine dining, the inn also has a lounge with live music where bar food is served. Ms. Jaffre said that in these tough economic times, ''the lounge is key to bringing people in the door.'' 
 George C. Guidera, Weston's former first selectman, bought the Cobb's Mill Inn in 2006 with his son-in-law James E. Magee. They have replaced the entire staff and renovated the building. ''It's taken me a couple of years to get it to where it is,'' Mr. Guidera said. ''Before, there was no creativity and a refusal to do anything new.'' 
 Mr. Guidera said business is down this year, primarily because fewer corporate groups are holding events. He said he looked for clientele far beyond Weston and advertises on wedding Web sites. ''Ninety-five percent of our brides come from out of town,'' he said. ''My competition is any wedding site in the state of Connecticut and Westchester County.''
 Jay Karen, president and chief executive of the Professional Association of Innkeepers International, says that proprietors like the Jaffres and Mr. Guidera are headed in the right direction. Mr. Karen said visitors still love historic inns for their charm and character, but they want a contemporary experience. ''The buildings may be 200 years old, but the thinking can't be old,'' Mr. Karen said. ''Are they serving organic, locally grown food? Do the rooms have WiFi? Are the inns keeping abreast of their online reviews?'' 
 ''It used to be that you got married in one of these places because it was the only place you knew about,'' Mr. Karen said. ''Nowadays, you can search online for a historic inn anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Does Our Voting System Really Need Fixing?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Still Broken'' (editorial, March 18):
 You are correct in noting that our voting system is ''still broken'' and that recent reports have exposed serious flaws. Unfortunately, and this has been a concern since the introduction of national election reforms after the 2000 election, the public's interest level in how we vote dramatically drops immediately after an election. 
 Now is the time to address our voting system flaws. We should not wait until an election year, when the process becomes too politicized and time and financing become obstacles. 
 Our nation is too large and our elections are too important to wait. It is encouraging to see some activity by the Senate Rules Committee and a push for new laws. This focus must continue because true election reform is a continuing process.
 Jeffrey T. Zaino Vice President, Elections American Arbitration Association New York, March 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 We should not assume that elections can be perfected. All we can really hope for is good enough. Elections have always been incorrect. Paper ballots can be misread or lost. Electronic balloting has its own well-documented issues. Changes to correct one fault will only worsen or create others. For example, eliminating the deadline and residency requirements for registration would lead to more fraud.
 I also disagree that ''registering to vote and casting ballots in federal elections are federal acts.'' The presidency is the only office that is supposed to represent the entire American population, but the president is elected state by state through the Electoral College. Senators and representatives are all meant to act specifically as each locality's own representative.
 One shouldn't expect that federal laws can correct the deficiencies and abuses in state voting. We are in an era where losers will consider all votes questionable. Attempts to add laws to prevent abuse and fraud will only increase the litigation.
 Most of the improvements needed in the voting process can be accomplished without wholesale changes in the current system that could further damage the national discourse. 
 Christopher P. Brown Baltimore, March 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 What we call our democratic system of electing representatives to federal, state and local office may be imperfect, even ''broken,'' as you would have it, but it works -- particularly for those in office (most of whom are seeking re-election) and for those whose money put them there (most of whom are seeking dividends on that investment).
 I believe few would contest the assertion that tens of millions of American citizens, including ''the millions of registered voters who are being turned away,'' do not vote. This may be bad, or it may be good. We won't know, since we can't know how their votes would have gone. 
 What we do know is that our plutocratic form of democracy has worked to see us through wars, recessions and even depressions without loss of either leadership or unquestioning followership -- at least among those who do vote. Let's just leave it at that.

HEADLINE: Red Flags That Muni Investors Can't See

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
HAMMERED by turbulent stock prices, investors have retreated in recent months to the relative safety of good old municipal bonds. Trading in this $2.7 trillion market rose 22 percent in 2008. 
 Unfortunately, investor protection in this arena is so spotty that there is potential for much mischief.
 Full disclosure, that bedrock of fair securities markets, is the heart of the problem facing municipal investors. Indeed, municipal issuers often fail to file the most basic reports outlining their operating results or material changes in their financial conditions. 
 Even though hospitals, cities and states that borrow money are required by their bond covenants to make such filings, nondisclosure among the nearly 65,000 issuers is common, municipal market authorities say. One out of two issuers is more than a year late in its filings, according to DPC Data, a company in Fort Lee, N.J., that collects information on municipal securities transactions. One out of four is chronically delinquent, by three years or more. 
 You may not be surprised to learn why better disclosure falls through the cracks in the muni bond market: lax regulation. For example, legislation from the 1970s restricts the Securities and Exchange Commission from going after issuers that do not make required disclosures; the commission can spring into action only if fraud is suspected. 
 (Some fine print: The S.E.C. can take action against brokerage firms that underwrite muni bonds if the brokers let an issuer sell debt without being up to date on filings for the most recent five years. But such actions are unusual.)
 With the S.E.C. largely on the sidelines, disclosure enforcement in the muni market is left to participants. And guess what? They don't really want to police themselves very closely. 
 ''Monitoring the disclosure requirements is left to individuals trading the securities, the investors and the dealers,'' said Thomas Doe, chief executive and founder of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent strategy and data firm in Concord, Mass. ''There is little penalty to be suffered for not complying.''
 INVESTORS are the obvious losers in this setup. Especially at risk are individual investors, according to a recent study by DPC Data. The study has been supplied to Congress, which is considering whether the regulatory apparatus in the muni market should be changed. 
 DPC Data is one of four firms recognized by regulators as municipal securities information repositories. For the study, Peter J. Schmitt, DPC's chief executive, examined trades that involved issuers that had recently filed so-called distress notices, indicating that they were experiencing financial problems. 
 Mr. Schmitt found that an alarming number of these beleaguered issuers' securities were purchased by individual investors at nondistressed prices -- 100 cents on the dollar (known as par value) or higher. This indicates that brokerage firms executing the trades may not have been aware of the issuers' troubles or failed to give investors full disclosure about them, Mr. Schmitt said.
 ''The fact that these rules, which were meant to stimulate disclosure, have been swept under the rug and that the market has been allowed to go forward on poor and inconsistent information doesn't say a lot about how assiduously regulators are pursuing investor protection,'' Mr. Schmitt said. 
 It comes as no surprise that defaults and other stresses on municipal issuers rose significantly in 2008 as the credit crisis deepened. Some 348 distress notices were filed last year, up from 187 in 2007. 
 Although the economy was tanking, DPC data found that almost 28,000 trades took place in securities that issued a distress notice at some time during the year. Some 9,643 of those trades were sales to customers, both institutions and individuals; more than half of them -- 5,798 -- were bought at par value or higher. 
 Mr. Schmitt dug deeper, analyzing how many customer purchases were made after a distress notice was filed by the issuer. He found 1,782 such trades, of which 667 were sold at par or more. 
 Obviously, when evidence emerges that a debt issuer is under stress, one would expect the price of its bonds to fall. And yet hundreds of trades of exactly this kind of debt were priced at par or higher, which Mr. Schmitt finds troubling. 
 Other interesting details emerge in his study. For example, October was the biggest month for sales of distressed bonds to customers at par or premium prices. And 41 percent of the 667 purchases in distressed bonds appear to have been made by small investors, indicated by the size of each trade -- $50,000 or less. 
 The issuers behind almost half of the 667 issues tracked by Mr. Schmitt had not filed financial statements in either 2008 or 2007, he said. 
 Failure to enforce disclosure rules in the municipal market ''has created a no-penalty environment,'' Mr. Schmitt said, ''that leaves investors defenseless against questionable practices by dealers.'' 
 Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on March 10, Mr. Doe of Municipal Market Advisors said muni investors needed more protection. He recommended that Congress require the S.E.C. to oversee bond issuers' compliance with disclosure requirements and identify those that are not following the rules. 
 Conceding that this would be an enormous task, Mr. Doe suggested that the S.E.C. take over the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the entity established by Congress in 1975 to devise rules for brokerage firms and banks that sell and trade municipal bonds. The board is a self-regulatory organization and is already subject to S.E.C. oversight. 
 If the S.E.C. integrated the rulemaking board's operations, its fees from bond transactions would offset the costs of increased oversight. Last year the board generated around $20 million, Mr. Doe said. 
 It could not be more basic: investors need up-to-date information in order to make astute decisions. The DPC Data study certainly seems to indicate that investors are often in the dark on distress notices and may be paying up when they buy bonds of troubled issuers. 
 ''Investors need to know what is going on with an issue they are purchasing whether directly or through a managed fund,'' Mr. Doe said. ''Pointing out the flaws in these transactions highlights the problems with current regulation.'' 
 Mary Schapiro, the new head of the S.E.C., already has a lengthy to-do list. Here's hoping that disclosure enforcement in the crucial and increasingly popular municipal market ranks high on it.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Where Education and Assimilation Collide'' (''Remade in America'' series, front page, March 15):
 Congratulations for turning the spotlight on immigration with your series. Its principal focus should be on the long-term implications. 
 Thanks largely to immigration trends, the United States is on track to grow from 306 million today to 439 million by 2050, an increase in population with enormous implications for water scarcity, social cohesion, quality of life, educational attainment, the environment and our dependence on oil. 
 The critical question is not whether the country can absorb current levels of immigration in 2009, but whether it can do so in the long run. We may live in the moment, but future generations are condemned to living in the future. Let's ensure that it's a sustainable future.

 Though many of the issues for these parishioners are different from those facing the students in your article, the controversies over immigration are similar. 
 There are factors other than academic ''tracks'' that isolate immigrants. First among them is loud local opposition to illegal immigration, which erodes trust. 
 Class prejudice appears to play a role at Hylton High School, the Virginia school featured in the article, and I found cultural misunderstanding to be a powerful force in keeping people apart in one Midwestern town. 
 Schools and churches can help build trust slowly by providing periodic structured opportunities for people on different ''tracks'' to interact.

 To the Editor:
 More than two decades ago, I attended high school near a ski resort where the student body was divided along ethnic and class lines. About half of the students' parents were professionals, while the others toiled in construction and service jobs. 
 The impetus for the integration of cultures then was also economic: Hispanic families, attracted by low-paying but plentiful jobs in a prosperous location, abandoned their roots in search of better opportunities. 
 However, most of our families hailed from New Mexico, so there was not a language barrier. Still, the socioeconomic distance and tension between the groups were amplified by academic separation. 
 Many Hispanic students dropped out or languished in lower-level courses or special education. Stigmas and stereotypes abounded. The few of us in more advanced classes often felt like foreigners in our own classroom. 
 It's disappointing that while the scenery and particulars have changed over two decades, the situation remains the same.

 To the Editor:
 I came to the United States with my parents and sister after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In Los Angeles, we went to Bishop Conaty High School, instead of a school for non-English speakers many miles away. Although we did not speak a word of English, the students and faculty welcomed us. 
 The first year was very difficult; we spent many hours on homework, translating every word. But the next year, an amazing transformation occurred -- we started speaking and understanding English. We graduated; my sister became a chemist and I became a doctor. 
 Integrating non-English-speaking students into the mainstream makes sense. We must educate other students and faculty about helping non-English-speaking students.
 Judith Korek Amorosa New Brunswick, N.J., March 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 We applaud Hylton High School's efforts to educate newcomer students, but we think success for newcomers is based on more than academics. Work with the family is critical, as is providing opportunities for the child beyond the classroom.
 Community schools, in which vitally needed services as well as extended academic opportunities are based at the school, offer more chances for a student to adapt and excel. In this approach, trained staff members reach out to immigrant families, bringing them into the school and connecting them to services. They introduce them to other neighborhood families and help them feel less fearful and more comfortable.
 The outreach extends to new mothers to help them provide language-rich environments for their infants. Children whose families are connected to their schools fare better in life and in school than students who learn English by cramming for high-stakes exams.

 To the Editor:
 Applying one-size-fits-all state exams and the No Child Left Behind law to immigrant children results in narrowed curriculums, endless test prep and arbitrary declarations of school failure. Increasing percentages of students are denied a quality education, which benefits neither the students nor society. 
 Policy makers must face the reality of the country's public school population and revise testing mandates accordingly. In particular, the law's goal of 100 percent proficiency by 2014 is impossible when so many non-English-speakers enter our schools every year.
 President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan should consider these realities when proposing legislation to ''fix the failures of No Child Left Behind'' as promised in last fall's campaign.
 Jesse Mermell Executive Director, FairTest Boston, March 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 What a disgrace that the talented Ginette Cain, who directs the high school program for English learners in your article, needs to waste valuable class time teaching immigrant students how to memorize disjointed facts so they will pass required standardized tests.
 Public education in the United States has so much to offer students -- from social assimilation to the ability to achieve personal and economic success -- yet these opportunities are being lost because of high-stakes testing.
 This is the time to return to the education of the whole student.
 Elizabeth Ball Glenview, Ill., March 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I thought we'd pretty well settled in 1954 that segregation's stigma was not something American schools should perpetuate. But your article's more distressing image was the teacher informing her charges: ''You don't really need to know anything more about the Battle of Britain, except that it was an air strike. ... If you see a question about the Battle of Britain on the test, look for an answer that refers to air strikes.''
 No wonder dropout rates are high. It appears that the testocracy that runs our schools has turned even the most vital, engaging stories of human history into an exercise akin to memorizing phone books.
 If I were still in high school, I might find something better to do with my time, too.

THE FUTURE OF LIBERALISM
 By Alan Wolfe
 335 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95
 A TOLERABLE ANARCHY
 Rebels, Reactionaries, and the Making of American Freedom
 By Jedediah Purdy
 294 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $23.95
 Alan Wolfe's rescue of liberalism from the jaws of latter-day know-nothings and Jedediah Purdy's reconciliation of radical individualism with community obligation have a common theme: freedom is self-realization. Wolfe sees this as liberalism's gift to public discourse, and Purdy sees it as a uniquely American virtue -- that is, until it leads to the death of the last polar bear.
 From the contentious 1800 presidential election onward, Americans have longed to transcend ideology in the interest of unity. From Thomas Jefferson's inaugural appeal to the sense of national character that makes us more than federalists or republicans to Barack Obama's reminder that we are one nation, most Americans have shared the feeling that there is something more to political life than manifesto, doctrine and orthodoxy. This is especially true in times of crisis, when ideological dispute seems an irrelevant, if not also bitter, luxury. 
 Yet this fatigue with politics as usual, this almost nostalgic longing for a politics beyond politics, is doomed to wax and wane, if for no other reason than that many who practice politics on a daily basis do so out of conviction and belief. True, at all times there are many for whom politics is a matter principally of power and career and for whom parties, ideological factions and movements are mere avenues toward those goals. But the engine that drives the process is fueled by conviction, and that conviction produces individual and group identity and common beliefs.
 One mystery remains. Why are there always liberals and conservatives and what makes us so? After all the sociologizing about family tradition, geography, religion, economic status, blue and red states, and clan influence, perhaps Gilbert and Sullivan came closest: ''I often think it's comical / How Nature always does contrive / That every boy and every gal / That's born into the world alive / Is either a little Liberal / Or else a little Conservative!''
 Once inside the ideological matrix, however, things do get interesting. Following the fading of the New Deal into the historical sunset in the 1970s and the Age of Reagan's substitution of conservative dominance, Wolfe has undertaken a restoration of classic Enlightenment liberalism as processed through the blender of American politics. For those fed up with the Rovian demonization of the very word ''liberal,'' this is about as good as it gets. 
 In ''The Future of Liberalism,'' Wolfe does not simply attempt a defense of the New Deal, as some have mistakenly done. He reminds us of liberalism's deep conceptual, intellectual and, yes, moral roots. And he also reminds us that programs and policies, always contestable, are but the manifestation of principles that cause people of conviction to join parties, campaign for candidates and seek to demonstrate in practical ways that progress is neither a euphemism nor a chimera.
 The closest Wolfe comes to a core liberal principle is this: ''As many people as possible should have as much say as is feasible over the direction their lives will take'' (somewhat a definition of democracy itself). Further, liberalism's purpose is ''helping people to achieve control over their lives.'' Empowerment is the contemporary version of this principle, which originated with John Locke, not Franklin Roosevelt. 
 This is not a vision of the state telling people what they can and cannot do. This is government helping people to maximize their potential. Consequences, whether involving gender, race, ethnic derivation or economic condition, flow from this principle. Barriers have to be removed, and ladders of opportunity must be built. If markets remove barriers and build ladders, so much the better. If they do not, a principled liberal state has no choice but to act.
 Liberalism is substantive -- individual autonomy, freedom and equality; it is procedural -- fairness and impartiality; and it is temperamental -- invoking tolerant, open and charitable advocacy. Wolfe possesses the credentials to undertake the restoration of liberalism. A professor of political science at Boston College, he is also widely recognized for his singular efforts to reconcile religion with democratic polities.
 Wolfe's style is elucidatory rather than polemical. His balanced explication of ideas and their histories makes the book a candidate for advanced undergraduate courses, though more in political theory than in political science. He is strongest in showing the clash and bang of ideas in contest with one another. Most interesting, he demonstrates how conflicting ideas can be at once advantageous and antagonistic to the liberalism he advocates. 
 Having rejected Rousseau's nature in favor of Kant's culture (what Wolfe calls ''artifice'') as the basis of liberal thought, he then points out that both Calvinism (or fundamentalist Christianity) and modern evolutionary theory (atheistic Darwinism) are predestinarian enemies of liberal self-determination; that neither socialism on the one hand nor the ruthless markets of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman on the other guarantee any degree of equality of opportunity; that militarism's roots in Romanticism produce today's neoconservatism, itself a reaction against the perceived failure of cold war liberalism; that both traditional liberals and conservatives are guilty of a concentration of power that threatens freedom.
 Wolfe falters, however, in applying his liberalist structure to the globalized world. Though shunning antiglobalist window smashing, he concludes that ''the heyday of American liberalism's commitment to an open global economy . . . is clearly over.'' In response to this Canute-like assessment, reality might say, ''Not so fast.'' Ideologies placing themselves in the path of history's steamroller usually find themselves flattened into irrelevance. Better to see the opportunities in global commercial exchange to export liberal principles to certain foreign countries. 
 Ideas matter, and ideas synthesized into political ideologies have enormous consequences. If liberalism really were irrelevant, let alone dead, as its antagonists claim, why does it incur their continued wrath? As theorems and conjectures are to mathematics and quantum mechanics is to physics, so ideas and the principles of governance are to politics. This is especially true when those ideas coalesce into a comprehensive approach to social ordering. The mutant strain of present-day conservatism has not wanted to reverse the New Deal; it has wanted to reverse the Enlightenment.
 Between the fading of the New Deal and efforts like Wolfe's to restore the principles of liberalism, those principles did not disappear. They were simply abandoned by political leaders who substituted expediency for courage and conviction.
 For his part, Jedediah Purdy creates an idea-packed sandwich in ''A Tolerable Anarchy'': first a slice of radical American autonomy, which frightened both Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke (unnecessarily); then a slice of practical constraint on that autonomy, produced by Mother Nature herself in the form of a warming climate; and in between, a tour of American political history as it relates to the essence of freedom in different eras. This tour of freedom and its discontents passes through slavery and race, property and labor, conflict and war, utopias and morality.
 If Wolfe is for college seniors, it intends no disparagement to say that Purdy's tour is for sophomores. The explication of American constitutional thought, and its unique system of institutional guarantees of liberty, has been undertaken with much more scholarly authority by Bernard Bailyn, Gordon Wood, Joyce Appleby and many others and followed up to the present day by historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Eric Foner, also among many others. Wood, mentioned by Purdy only in a bibliographic essay, together with Bailyn, pretty much cornered the market on the radicalism of the American Constitution, including its assurance of individual self-determination, some years ago.
 Purdy, who teaches law at Duke University, is best known for publishing ''For Common Things,'' a sermon against the blight of irony, when he was in his mid-20s. Whitman is the poet of Purdyism, Emerson its theorist. He seems to say that the freedom unleashed by the American Revolution produced an individual, more than a political, climate of anarchy and rebellion -- something like Jefferson unleashing his inner Freud. Purdy's thesis is a work in progress by an inventive mind in evolution, a didactic and synoptic tour of American thoughts on freedom. It is sound descriptively, less sagacious prescriptively.
 Whatever Burke and Johnson may have made of the Declaration's brand of freedom, outside of Thomas Paine there was little support among the founders for Purdy's premise that freedom was meant as radical self-realization. He suffuses his book with statements like this one, about heroism: ''We might still hope to find that in our own brutal and hopeful history and the principles we take from it, which we can ever and again aim to make good this time.'' Such declarations, seemingly filtered through the pen of Faulkner, are either mystifyingly profound or confusingly self-evident.
 After concluding digressions on risk insurance for students who don't know what field to pursue and complex property rights in a digital age, Purdy confronts the climatic results of industrial production and unregulated consumption in the false pursuit of self-realization. He finds that, like regulated markets, our freedom can be preserved only by placing it under constraints. 
 So we have a veteran scholar restoring a system of thought and belief supporting principles of tolerance, openness and liberation, after a prolonged neo-medieval era, and an emerging scholar concerned with preserving radical autonomy in an age when nature itself can no longer sustain it. Perhaps the liberal spirit, incorporating a decent respect for the opinions of science, can discover a way to rescue nature while preserving our individual and collective souls.

HEADLINE: He Who Dares to Mention Police Pay

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: East Brunswick 

 BODY:
 ANOTHER budget season has arrived in the tense municipal chambers of New Jersey, the first since the economy began its slide toward who knows where, and with it a fresh set of worries about what to do when the bills come due.
 Layoffs loom. Revenue gaps widen. The word ''furlough'' has entered daily conversation. So unsettling have the numbers proved, in fact, that some elected officials have begun to ask aloud a question that previously was uttered only in private: How much more can we afford to pay our police?
 ''The public is unaware of how expensive this is,'' said L. Mason Neely, the chief financial officer in this sprawling Middlesex County township for the last 34 years. ''It may be time to rethink the whole structure of how we deal with public safety and what we pay, and how soon we retire people.'' 
 When you say things like that in public -- as Mr. Neely has for decades now, longer than almost anybody in the state -- you get two reactions: outrage from the police and firefighters, whose dangerous jobs are a bulwark against chaos; and whispered assertions of support from local officials who have watched public safety costs consume ever-larger portions of their budgets, but who have to face, as Mr. Neely does not, the voters and the powerful unions that shape elections. 
 ''I can't tell you how many people privately say, 'I agree, it's a big problem,' but they're intimidated,'' Mr. Neely said. 
 So it was a sign of just how dire times are when a prominent Democratic county executive, Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr. of Essex County, stood beside the Republican mayor of the small Bergen County borough of Closter, Sophie Heymann, at a press conference a few weeks ago and called for reforms to the binding arbitration system that governs police and fire contracts.
 ''Everybody is discussing it -- this is like the No. 1 issue now in the state,'' Mr. DiVincenzo said last week. ''Everybody supports it, everybody knows it's the right thing to do, but who would stand up and be counted?''
 When police officers and firefighters hit a wall in contract talks, they have a right unique among the state's public employees: to seek a settlement from a state-appointed arbitrator. They are not permitted to strike, so binding arbitration was established several decades ago as a way to give them more leverage in negotiations. 
 But a series of recent arbitration awards in police contracts -- with 4 percent annual wage hikes at a time when many workers are instead facing pay cuts or the unemployment line -- seemed to buttress the longtime complaint of many local officials: that the system is weighted toward the public safety unions, and has driven compensation costs to levels that are hard to sustain, especially in tight times.
 ''I don't know how we're going to do it -- we've already cut everything else but police in the last two years,'' said Ms. Heymann, 80, who has been mayor for two years, and who was working on her town's budget this week. Revenues are down $500,000 from last year, but among the higher costs she faces is $65,000 more in police salaries, mandated by a recent arbitration agreement. ''Unfortunately, I can fight all I want, but it's not going to help my poor borough, because we're going to be stuck now for the next three years paying that 4 percent increase every year.''
 Mr. DiVincenzo's attention was concentrated on the issue by his own looming date with an arbitrator, for the law enforcement personnel who account for a third of the county's 3,400 employees. He has offered a three-year contract with a 3 percent wage increase in the first year, and nothing in the last two. ''This county will be bankrupt,'' he said, if an arbitrator awards a contract with 4 percent increases like Closter's.
 ''I have nothing but respect for them and the job they do, but I have a job to do, too,'' he said. ''Maybe it's suicidal, but the taxpayers can no longer afford it.''
 The union that represents about three-quarters of the state's law enforcement officers disagrees. ''Overall, I don't see the mass number of awards or people getting these awards that shows it's a problem,'' said James Ryan, spokesman for the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association. ''One of the things I worry about with these economic conditions is that, the way we're set up in New Jersey, with so many small towns, the biggest expense in any municipal budget is typically going to be your police department, so it's very easy to pick on.''
 A survey by the state P.B.A. of its 33,000 members during the first two weeks of March found that 20 percent of the police agencies in New Jersey are considering layoffs that would eliminate up to 325 jobs. Over the last three years, the survey found, 297 law enforcement jobs were lost in the state. 
 But in Mr. Neely's office here, a few steps down the hall from the Police Department, he just keeps adding up the numbers, and they just keep growing more alarming. The average salary for a patrolman in New Jersey with 7 to 10 years' experience, according to the state P.B.A., is $83,000, before overtime. Salaries tend to be highest in the suburbs nearest New York: Eighteen of the 22 officers in the Closter Police Department make more than $100,000.
 What worries him most, though -- and what he has spoken out about most loudly, earning the enmity of public safety unions -- is what happens after officers retire. There are about 46,000 public safety officers currently on the job, and they can typically retire with 65 percent pay and fully paid health benefits after 25 years, regardless of age. New Jersey had 31,726 retired officers and firefighters in 2007, the most recent year for which numbers are available, according to the State Division of Pension and Benefits. 
 ''He could easily be retired for 40 years, so you're paying him 40 years of pension for having worked 25 years,'' Mr. Neely said. ''That's very expensive, and that's the culture change I'm talking about that we need to rethink.''
 In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. David A. Paterson have proposed establishing a minimum retirement age of 50 for the police and firefighters, and requiring them to work 25 years, rather than 20, before full retirement benefits kick in. But no one on this side of the river has floated anything similar, and Mr. Neely isn't holding his breath.
 ''It hasn't surfaced yet,'' he said, and it won't ''until the Legislature feels enough pressure, either through not being re-elected or someone makes it an issue.''
 In the last few weeks, governing bodies in about 10 towns in Bergen County, Democratic and Republican alike, have passed resolutions supporting reforms for binding arbitration, and Mr. DiVincenzo has been trying to collect enough support to persuade somebody in Trenton to sponsor a bill. 
 ''I told him I would gladly stand with him hand in hand on the steps of the State House to call for some relief,'' said Timothy C. McDonough, the mayor of Hope Township in Warren County, and the president of the League of Municipalities. ''The support is absolutely there, but I think a lot of mayors and county officials are just so frustrated that they think it's a fight that's never going to be won.''
 Mr. Neely was working on his budget last week, too, wondering what he would have to cut to make it balance, glad that some other voices had joined his chorus, but also skeptical that anything will change before he himself retires. He is 69, and has long been eligible, but is not yet willing. ''I'm not fully depreciated yet,'' he said, using the language of his trade for his value as an employee, and then he punched some more numbers into his adding machine.

HEADLINE: In This Scottsdale, Leave the Bolo Tie at Home

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
WITHIN 10 minutes of stepping inside a bar called the Pussycat Lounge, just after midnight, I realized that I had packed the wrong clothes (khakis, a Clash band T-shirt) for the new Southwest. It was as if an assembly line of Armani designers were outfitting all the other men in some back room unavailable to me. 
 One guy, in a tuxedo, looked like George Clooney when he was Dr. Doug Ross on ''E.R.'' I gawked. A blond surfer-boy-type in a white T-shirt, black jacket and very tight black pants looked like an actor on ''Gossip Girl.'' I peered. 
 Not a soul, it seemed, was looking at me -- including the bartenders who kept walking by my extended $20 bill. 
 I finally started waving the $20 like some overeager patron at a strip club. One of the bartenders stopped and stared. 
 I shouted over the sound system, ''I'm underdressed, right?'' After a second, he replied, ''Well, are you staying nearby?''
 Before experiencing the Pussycat Lounge during my first night in Scottsdale, Ariz., my assumptions about this city ran in the direction of golf courses, spa weekends, snowbirds and endless supplies of dry desert heat and tanned leather goods. Same name, different Scottsdale. 
 Unlike many cities that rebrand themselves as ''new'' in a tourism marketing campaign, yet in fact change very little, Scottsdale is rethinking itself in ways that are as apparent as they are ambitious, hoping to compete with Palm Springs, Las Vegas and even South Beach for party-seeking travelers.
 A high-energy night-life scene, with celebrities descending on places like Suede, Axis/Radius and the Pussycat Lounge -- all about a block apart -- has taken root in the last few years, and freshly thought-out hotels like the Mondrian and the W Scottsdale are integrating desert-themed architecture with high-end pampering. Less obvious, but perhaps even more interesting, entrepreneurs are rethinking some of the city's old spaces and strip malls, turning them into small hubs of wine bars and lounges and restaurants and independently owned shops.
 It came as a slight shock, for instance, to learn that one attractive new restaurant, the Mission -- with enormous wax-dripping candles and vintage chandeliers, dark-wood paneling and oversize mirrors -- was once a plumbing supply store.
 ''Our site's old owner built this whole area, when a dirt road served as the main drag, and cars used to pull up and park in the area that's our patio now,'' said Brian Raab, a partner in the Mission, which specializes in modern Latin cuisine (the skirt-steak tacos were delicious) and Southwest staples like guacamole with jalapeno. ''For a while, this space was a hamburger place with no air-conditioning, grilling burgers three months out of the year when you could stand the heat.''
 A recession is a challenging time for a city to continue its reinvention, and indeed, there is already chatter that the W, which opened in September, may be on the ropes. (The hotel's corporate chiefs put out a statement recently to rebut the reports on the Internet that it was closing later this year.) But a distinct frontier mentality comes across in conversations with residents -- even the model look-alikes who wait tables -- about how Scottsdale is following the trail blazed by places like Las Vegas that turned empty desert into a destination because people acted on a vision.
 Scottsdale, of course, isn't empty desert, and what already exists there isn't simply being bulldozed away. But cities can be rethought. There was an exhibit this winter at the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art called ''Flip a Strip,'' which rethought old strip malls not only in the Phoenix area but also across America and imagines a chic, modern reconception of the ways cities can be enjoyed.
 ''There was such a post-World War II growth explosion on all this open land, and we built all this stuff, and now we have it but it's not all working anymore,'' said Barbara Meyerson, the museum's interim director. ''I think cities out West have been attracting people who say, 'Here's a pile of lemons, what can I make out of it?' The exhibit reflected a real transformative spirit in Scottsdale right now.'' 
 The museum has maintained an Internet site showcasing the ''Flip a Strip'' exhibit (www.flipastrip.org) because it proved so popular with visitors to the museum and its Web site, even though the exhibit itself closed in January.
 ''Let's face it, there are days when I would love to get pampered at a resort, but after a day or two that would get really old,'' Ms. Meyerson said. ''What Scottsdale has figured out is that you can set up camp here and venture out all day in the desert and in town and all night at clubs and lounges, or you can just stay inside your camp and find all-purpose luxury.''
 Resorts like the Mondrian, the Hotel Valley Ho, the Camelback Hotel and Spa and now the W have created a strong foundation for the new Scottsdale. The Mondrian is typical of this city's reinvention: it is set against a well-trafficked street, and there is a large parking lot before you reach the main doors, which does not provide much sense of tranquillity or luxury. But then the Mondrian bursts with vines and flowers in its effort to create a Garden of Eden feel, and the day bed mattresses along its two pools have a terrifically mellowing, sexy quality. 
 The hotel's nighttime lounges, Red Bar and Midnight Room (the latter is outdoors), were designed by someone who must have wanted every night to feel like Valentine's Day after dark. Sitting there, I felt as though love connections were happening in the nooks and private cabanas all around me.
 ''What makes a hotel special is its intimacy -- intimacy is its own form of energy -- and that's the sort of energy that we're really going for here,'' said David Morgan, the general manager of the Mondrian. ''A lot of people look at Scottsdale and see resorts and golf, but what's starting to happen is they're seeing us as a modern, sophisticated destination, not just the tacky tourist shops.''
 The new W Scottsdale is testing the proposition that the city has become so fashionable that there is a market for more boutique hotels than just the Mondrian. 
 ''The W likes to believe that they cater to the same market that we do, and we do split the same local demographic that's drawn to the night life that we both offer,'' said Mr. Morgan of the Mondrian. ''That said, we offer something distinctive.'' 
 To that end, representatives of the Mondrian eagerly provided a list of more than 100 celebrities who have visited the hotel and lounges: from Beyonce, Blake Lively and Bradley Cooper to Halle Berry, Paris Hilton, Spike Lee and several professional athletes. 
 The new W Scottsdale is also proudly describing itself as a celebrity magnet. While the W Scottsdale opened in September with built-in brand loyalty among travelers through the Starwood Points program of its corporate parent, it is also more than a 20-minute drive east from downtown Phoenix and about 15 minutes north of Arizona State University, making it a little isolated for many of its regular customers. 
 Scottsdale is still evolving as a tourist destination. Since the W opened, some weekends have sold out and about 2,000 people hit its recent Masquerade Ball, members of the management team said. But other weeks have been much slower, which have led to reports on HotelChatter.com -- strongly denied by Leon Young, the general manager of the W Scottsdale -- that the hotel was in trouble. 
 To be sure, it would also be surprising for Starwood to let a major new property in a high-profile destination shutter so soon. And the W's staff sees a major target of opportunity in Scottsdale. 
 The hotel is a gem, too, featuring a pool with glass holes on the bottom that allow views from the lobby below. The rooms have beds placed in the center and flat-screen TVs, DVD players, stereos and other creature comforts set around them. 
 ''I think it's a younger demographic looking for a less chaotic Vegas, a less stereotypical West Coast experience, but want to feel the hipness,'' Mr. Young said. ''And we have the great opportunity of being the new kid, and everyone wants to experience us.''
 That moxie is in plentiful supply in Scottsdale. The Museum of Contemporary Arts refreshes itself with new exhibits every few months; while the space itself is 10 years old, visitors recently were overheard remarking how there was something new every time they came. And it is a splendid museum: there is an ''outdoor skyscape'' area with graded grassy slopes and an O-shaped sitting area (called ''Knight Rise'') that is probably the most meditative space I've ever experienced on land.
 On Thursdays and weekend nights, the sidewalks around Suede and the Pussycat Lounge have a pure Mardi Gras feel: not enough square footage per person to move comfortably. ''We've got 50,000 students at Arizona State,'' said Chad Landau, a promoter for the Pussycat Lounge, ''so that fuels the scene, and that energy draws people in their 30s, 40s, 50s -- a chain reaction, right?'' 
 Inside Axis-Radius, a dance club, the bodies seem even more packed. Suede is more casual, a shiny new wine bar where laughter competes with the sound system. 
 To paraphrase Mr. Young, Scottsdale does indeed seem like the new kid of the Southwest right now, and its pride in its own newfound modernity is inviting. Even if it's hard to get served at the bar wearing an '80s T-shirt.

HEADLINE: Is Antarctica Getting Too Popular?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
LAST month, on its next-to-last day of a 15-day Antarctic tour, the Ocean Nova, carrying 65 passengers and a crew of 41, ran aground in Antarctica and was stalled for more than a day. Damage was minor (some flaking paint and dents to the hull), and all passengers on the cruise, run by Connecticut-based Quark Expeditions, were safely transferred to another ship. But the incident, the fourth maritime accident in three years involving excursion vessels in Antarctica, is raising concerns about the dangers of fast-growing tourism in the region. 
 The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than quadrupled in the last decade, growing to 45,213 in the 2007-2008 season, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators. More than 30,000 of those visitors arrived in small ships and set foot ashore, up from 9,857 in 1998-99. But an even faster-growing category was so-called cruise-only passengers -- 13,000 in 2007-2008, up from 6,930 the previous year -- who view the Antarctic shore from ships carrying more than 500 passengers. 
 The great majority of the voyages operate in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts north toward South America, from mid-October to early April. 
 The number of visitors is expected to be down slightly for the 2008-9 season, but tour operators say numbers are holding up relatively well considering the recession and the cost of Antarctic trips, typically about $10,000 a person. Like Mount Everest, tour operators say, Antarctica has become a destination with cachet, favored by adventurous travelers seeking bragging rights. 
 ''Antarctica does seem to be in its Everest moment, with the concern about global warming spurring interest in all things ice,'' said Barbara Banks, director of marketing for Wilderness Travel, based in Berkeley, Calif., which offers tours to the region from $8,995 a person. ''The allure of Antarctica is also that one can experience an otherworldly realm, similar to the high mountain realm of Everest or the most remote regions of the Sahara, but with relatively little physical effort other than being prepared for seasickness and bad weather. The ship does the hard work for you.'' 
 But going to Antarctica isn't exactly like taking a cruise to the Mediterranean. ''It's very different when you're operating in such a remote part of the world,'' said Jim Taylor, co-owner of Polar Cruises, based in Bend, Ore., which has been specializing in small-ship travel to Antarctica and the Arctic since 1996. Even the most experienced outfitters still have to contend with Antarctica's severe weather conditions, ice-covered waters and remoteness from rescue centers. ''It truly is adventure travel,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 In December, the Argentine cruise ship Ushuaia ran aground on rocks off the coast of Antarctica. In November 2007, the Explorer, owned by G.A.P. Adventures of Toronto, struck an iceberg and became the first commercial passenger ship to sink there.
 Two other passenger vessels ran aground in Antarctica in recent years, the Nordkapp, owned by Hurtigruten, a Norwegian cruise line, and Quark's Lyubov Orlova. In each case, contingency plans worked and passengers were safe, but the accidents raise concerns about both the environmental risks posed by the increasing number of vessels, some of which carry thousands of people, and the safety of those passengers. 
 ''This is a concern of ours,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''You have a 3,000-passenger ship that goes to Antarctica, hits a rock, and so the closest ship of any size that could possibly rescue these people is many days away.'' With smaller ships, a rescue would be easier. ''With under a couple hundred passengers,'' he said, ''there's enough of them circling around there all the time that can help each other out.'' 
 Large ships take careful precautions ''to stay well clear of uncharted waters and are very cognizant of ice around the ship,'' said Steve Wellmeier, executive director of the Antarctica tour operators organization, which mandates that members like Holland America Line and Princess Cruises, with ships that carry more than 500 passengers to Antarctica, do not let passengers debark there.
 ''As the safety and security of our passengers is our paramount priority, we would not operate in any way to jeopardize this,'' Karen Candy, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, said. She said some of the precautions taken by Princess included cruising in a ''relatively ice-free, limited area of the peninsula'' and using an experienced captain and an ice pilot, a specialist in navigating icy waters. 
 After last month's grounding of the Ocean Nova, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, an environmental group, called for stronger controls over tourism vessels in the Antarctic, including limits on the size of ships, the number of passengers per ship and the amount of fuel on board, as well as standards for hull strength and stringent qualifications for ice navigators.
 The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators has drawn up its own standards. It requires an outfitter seeking membership to take along an observer on a trip to ensure they are in compliance with the regulations. Those guidelines have also been adopted by the Antarctic Treaty system, a series of agreements among 47 countries that operate bases in Antarctica. But enforcement can be tricky. 
 Seven nations claim to control portions of Antarctica, though those claims are not recognized under international law. And the region's location makes it difficult to police. ''Because of its remote location, it's not possible to have a lot of enforcement of anything in Antarctica,'' said Ashton Palmer, president of Expedition Trips, based in Seattle, which specializes in selling small-ship cruises. ''There is no one down there making sure companies are operating in the right way.''
 Travelers who want to make sure they are booking with a reputable company when planning a trip to Antarctica should look for tours on vessels with ice-strengthened hulls (reinforced against contact with ice) and an experienced ice captain, who commands the ship through polar waters. 
 The Antarctica's remoteness also creates problems when passengers unexpectedly need medical care, and a growing number of tour operators, including Abercrombie & Kent and Polar Cruises, require that their passengers buy emergency-evacuation insurance. Because the cost of dealing with an onboard medical emergency like a broken leg can be upward of $25,000, buying the additional coverage is a good idea even if it's not required. 
 Once onboard, pay attention to the emergency drills and safety announcements. Despite the experience and preparedness of the outfitter and crew, there are simply no guarantees.
 The Ocean Nova had an ice-strengthened hull and a captain with more than 25 years experience sailing polar waters. Quark Expeditions is considered a leading Antarctic outfitter. The ship encountered extremely high winds that dragged it, along with its anchor, and lodged it in craggy rocks.

HEADLINE: State's Top Orchestra Faces Changes

BYLINE: By DAN WAKIN

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
 THE New Jersey Symphony Orchestra sailed into this season having left much unpleasantness far in its wake. It moved out of its shabby downtown Newark headquarters into shiny offices nearby, eliminated a passel of debt and seemed to have put to rest the debacle of a rare-instrument purchase that brought unwanted scrutiny. 
 The major uncertainty was who would take the musical reins after the departure at the end of this season of its musical director, Neeme Jarvi. But like all arts institutions, the symphony was hit hard by the economic crisis, forcing wrenching cost-cutting and shrinkage for an orchestra that has built-in challenges. 
 Its president and chief executive, Andre Gremillet, has instituted measures that are becoming increasingly common at orchestras nationwide. 
 Facing a $2 million deficit on a budget of $14 million this year, Mr. Gremillet in the fall dismissed three administrative staff members and canceled the orchestra's two-week June festival. (By comparison, the larger Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra laid off nine staff members and the Philadelphia Orchestra let go of 12 in March.)
 For next season, Mr. Gremillet has eliminated nine subscription concerts out of this season's 70. Instead of higher-paid visiting soloists, two orchestra members -- the cellist Jonathan Spitz and the flutist Bart Feller -- will play concertos with the orchestra.
 Outside soloists -- next season's roster includes the violinist Sarah Chang and the pianists Olga Kern and Olli Mustonen -- have agreed to fee reductions, Mr. Gremillet said. 
 ''Everyone is aware that it's not business as usual, soloists included,'' he said.
 Corporate giving in particular is down. A.I.G., for instance, withdrew support of the orchestra's 13 weekly radio broadcasts for next season, but Gus Gomide, an orchestra spokesman, said a replacement had stepped forward, though he would not disclose the identity of the donor. Foundation support and state aid are also down. 
 Just comparing the season brochures gives a palpable feel of the change in fortunes: Next season's is much flimsier, 20 pages instead of 40. 
 Ticket sales, too, are mediocre, with subscription concerts averaging about 63 percent of capacity. On the bright side, orchestra officials said a new pops-style series called ''Best of...'' has been successful, with capacity at about 80 percent. The concerts, replacing 16 subscription performances around the state, feature a sampling of movements, readings and other nonmusical elements centered on a composer or theme like ''Best of Beethoven'' or ''Best of Shakespearean Romance.'' 
 The idea is to help break down the perception that classical music is ''something for the elite,'' Mr. Gremillet said. The series will return next season.
 Caught between the twin colossuses of the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, the New Jersey Symphony is like a troubadour, shuttling through seven concert spaces around the state. The players must quickly adjust to the different acoustics of the halls, which range from the 800-seat Richardson Auditorium at Princeton University to the 2,750-seat Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. Because of the relatively short season -- 12 weeks next season, down from 15 and compared with about 30 at the New York Philharmonic -- and lower salaries, many of the players also perform with other groups, like the orchestras of the New York City Opera and New York City Ballet and Broadway shows. At the same time, the New Jersey Symphony has a core of loyal patrons and subscribers, many of whom like the quick drive to Englewood or Red Bank to hear a concert.
 Mr. Gremillet, 42, a conservatory-trained pianist, took over in January 2007 after running a pipe organ manufacturer near Montreal, in the area where he grew up. He has shown savvy, inviting the Newark schools superintendent, Clifford B. Janey -- as soon as Mr. Janey was named to the position last summer -- to narrate Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals'' for a family concert. (The symphony receives grant and state money to provide educational services, which it considers a major part of its mission.)
 Mr. Gremillet also engineered a deal with Opera New Jersey to have the symphony serve as the pit ensemble for three productions in July in Princeton, a money-making proposition for the orchestra, and to jointly produce a production of Bizet's ''Carmen'' in Newark, New Brunswick and Princeton in February. 
 While it searches for a new music director, orchestra officials said they are relieved that Mr. Jarvi has agreed to stay on as an artistic adviser, taking on a role similar to that of Charles Dutoit in Philadelphia, which is also without a music director.
 The search committee has met about a half-dozen times over the past six months, said Ruth C. Lipper, a co-chairman of the New Jersey Symphony's board. As usual in such searches, the orchestra has promised to take its time to find the right fit.
 ''This is almost like falling in love,'' Ms. Lipper said. ''We'll know when we find the right candidate.''
 She said a ''reasonable timetable'' would mean having a music director in place by the end of next season.
 Another looming challenge will be the negotiation with the players of a new contract; the current one expires Aug. 31. The downsized season, with fewer weeks of work, carries the implicit suggestion that pay should drop. That is all up for negotiation, Mr. Gremillet said.
 At least one distraction seems to have ended. In late 2007, a group of investors agreed to buy a collection of rare string instruments, including some made by Guarneri and Stradivari, that the orchestra had previously bought. Their value had been overstated and an internal report found that some orchestra officials had deceived the board and public about their worth.
 The purchase has retired the orchestra's debt, including loans incurred to buy the instruments, Mr. Gremillet said. ''We cleaned the slate for the first time in a decade,'' he said. The deal allowed the orchestra to keep playing the instruments for at least five years and required the handing over of two Stradivarii immediately to the investors. The investors have since lent them back to the orchestra, Mr. Gremillet said.

HEADLINE: WINKs Make Developers Smile

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
IN a generally weaker market for condominiums, one type of buyer is showing increasing strength: WINKs. Housing trend analysts came up with the acronym for ''women with income, no kids.'' 
 Last year in New Jersey, almost half of all condominium buyers -- 45 percent -- were women in this category, analysts say. That fact dovetails with the findings of various national studies that over the last decade, the number of unmarried women buying housing of any type increased 20 percent.
 The Otteau Valuation Group in New Brunswick recently reported that in New Jersey, WINKs represented 21 percent of all buyers last year, up from 14 percent the year before. 
 The percentage of single male buyers rose to 10 percent from 9 during that period.
 ''Amongst all single-woman buyers, condos are far and away the most popular choice,'' said Jeffrey G. Otteau, who heads the group, a housing-trend analytical company. 
 Of the studies bolstering that finding, one conducted two years ago by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies has been described as the first major analysis of female buyers.
 The terms ''unmarried'' or ''single'' include the not-yet-married, the divorced and the widowed, Mr. Otteau said. Women with grown children or children who do not live in the household are also included.
 ''I didn't know I would be called that,'' said Luma Oweis, who recently bought a two-bedroom condo at 40 Park, a building now under construction in Morristown. ''But it fits.''
 Ms. Oweis, 36, a geotechnical engineer who founded her own company four years ago, is single, childless and a first-time buyer. She said she decided on a condo because, ''I think it's a good lifestyle for me: convenient, in the center of town, only two miles from my office.''
 She said she preferred the ''social atmosphere'' of a condo to the relative isolation of a single-family house, and wanted to ''look out the door and see action, and buzzing around.''
 Also, Ms. Oweis said, she often works 18-hour days and eats out a lot during the week, so she is excited about the prospect of being able to walk to restaurants in downtown Morristown.
 Unit prices at 40 Park start in the low $500,000s and exceed $1 million for penthouses overlooking the historic Morristown Green. But market analysts say that the surge in WINK condo buyers holds true across the price spectrum. 
 In addition, some brokers said they had already noted that single women were increasingly part of a separate recession-related mini-trend: shared housing.
 At the Mill Pond at Eatontown, a newly built development where two-bedrooms start at $252,990, Nancy and Ann Mareska, sisters aged 48 and 45, each bought condos. 
 Also at Mill Pond, Joan Marangella, 68, and Liz Campoli, 52, who are longtime friends, became joint purchasers of a two-bedroom. Every unit in the complex has nine-foot ceilings and a patio or deck. 
 All four of the women are divorced. As the Harvard study noted, women who owned homes while married frequently have equity available to invest in new homes.
 ''Lizzie and I were both looking to downsize,'' said Ms. Marangella, who has grown children and is a supervisor at a cardiology group. 
 ''I felt the economy and everything was going downhill. It is important to foresee these things, and make a conscious decision.''
 Several studies of female buyers have noted that while unmarried women have lower average incomes than unmarried men and couples, they are less likely to finance their home purchases, and that if they borrow, they borrow less.
 Tara Gellatley, who set herself a goal of having a custom-built abode by the age of 35, is currently picking out tiles, trims and fixtures for the condominium that she is buying at Water's Edge at Point Pleasant, a Pulte Homes development.
 ''I'm proud of buying as a single woman,'' said Ms. Gellatley, 33. ''You put yourself on a tight budget, set guidelines and boundaries, and you can do it.''
 Ms. Gellatley, who is employed in her father's maritime shipping business, bought her first condo in Brick 10 years ago when she worked in the hotel industry.
 The Harvard study found that unmarried women are much less likely to live with their parents than single men are. 
 But the question of whether WINKs are more likely to receive financial help from family members to establish their own households was not addressed.
 Certainly, it happens.
 ''I really wanted to have my own place,'' said 25-year-old Christine Corrales, who owns a one-bedroom apartment at the Trump Plaza in Jersey City. ''My mom became an investor so I could do that.''
 Ms. Corrales says she is thrilled with the secure, ''hotel-like'' atmosphere at Trump, where the 24-hour concierge is there should she forget her keys, and the people from the in-house dog-walking service always say hello.
 Ms. Gellatley, meanwhile, is financing her own purchase, but moving into the same complex where her father bought a penthouse condo last year.
 And Ms. Oweis will be living just two blocks away from her parents. They recently bought a condo at the Vail Mansion development in Morristown.

AS a filmmaker William Wellman loved planes, trains and automobiles -- but mostly planes. A volunteer member of the Lafayette Flying Corps in World War I, he drew on his experiences as a combat pilot for ''Wings'' (1927), his first major hit as a director and the first film to win the Academy Award for best picture (then called most outstanding production).
 And Wellman continued to draw on his aviation background throughout his long career in Hollywood (including his 1954 hit, ''The High and the Mighty''), not only to tap the thrill of fast, free movement but also to create emotionally vivid, male-centered melodramas. His most personal films portray the bonds that develop between men under pressure and what happens when those bonds are threatened by a female presence. 
 Warner Home Video has devoted this third and latest volume in its ''Forbidden Hollywood'' series of pre-Code films to six features from Wellman's most intensely creative period, the years he spent as a contract director at Warner Brothers in the early 1930s: between ''Maybe It's Love'' (1930) and ''Female'' (1933), he directed 17 movies in whole or in part, including a couple of loan-outs to RKO and MGM. Most of these 70- to 80-minute features are swift, hard, topical dramas, filmed in the vigorous, headlong style epitomized by his best-known picture of the time, ''The Public Enemy'' (1931). 
 ''The Public Enemy,'' which made a star of James Cagney, isn't part of the current collection. (It has already been issued, in a recently rediscovered, uncensored print, as part of the ''Warner Gangsters Collection, Volume 1.'') But Wellman's first film with Cagney is here: the superb ''Other Men's Women'' (1931), a railroad drama in which Cagney, billed sixth, makes a remarkable entrance bounding along atop a line of moving boxcars (clearly Wellman's kind of guy). 
 The plot of ''Other Men's Women'' lays out the archetypical Wellman situation. Bill (Grant Withers) and Jack (Regis Toomey) work together as fireman and engineer, driving freight trains through Southern California; all is well until Bill, a hard-drinking, unsettled type, finds himself falling for Jack's warmly domestic wife, Lily (Mary Astor). Tensions explode into a fistfight in the engine cab, causing an accident in which Jack is left blinded and Bill burdened with unbearable guilt. Redemption, a recurring motif in Wellman films, is available only through sacrifice in the line of duty, and Bill finds his chance during a spectacular finale, when rising flood waters threaten to wipe out a trestle bridge. 
 Recently freed from the constraints of studio-bound early-sound technology, Wellman seems almost giddy with the possibilities of location shooting, moving his camera with abandon, staging dialogue scenes atop moving trains, constructing at least one live sound set (a greasy spoon where the waitress is a young Joan Blondell) in the middle of a busy switchyard, where freight trains rumble past. The gigantic engines become the objective correlatives of the characters' clashing emotions, as the powerful imagery overcomes Wellman's enduring flaw: a simplistic, often inconsistent sense of character. 
 That flaw is very much on display in ''The Purchase Price'' (1932). Barbara Stanwyck stars as a New York showgirl who hides out from a possessive gangster boyfriend (Lyle Talbot) by agreeing to become the mail-order bride of a Midwestern farmer (George Brent). Wellman presents the rural characters, including the miscast Brent, as lumbering cretins, never quite accounting for the sudden change of heart that propels Stanwyck into Brent's arms and a new identity as a gallant homesteader in a gingham dress.
 Women remain abstract figures in ''Frisco Jenny'' (1932), with Ruth Chatterton as the mannish proprietor of a San Francisco brothel; and ''Midnight Mary'' (1933), with Loretta Young as (another) Broadway babe prepared to take a murder rap to protect her married lover (a dweeby Franchot Tone). 
 Made at MGM, ''Midnight Mary'' smoothes out the rough edges of Wellman's style: the shots match and the tone is more even, but the vigor and spontaneity of the Warner films is almost gone. Those qualities return in spades in the final two titles in the collection, both superlative examples of Warner Brothers social drama at its grittiest and most engaged. In ''Heroes for Sale'' (1933), Richard Barthelmess plays Tom Holmes, a Job-like figure who endures most of the horrors that the early 20th century had to offer. 
 Wounded in trench fighting in the Great War, Tom comes home with a morphine addiction that costs him his job in a bank, the first of many misfortunes that include losing his wife (Loretta Young, whose saintly good looks find better use here) in a violent strike action, serving a jail term as a dangerous radical and finally being forced out on the road with the army of the unemployed, chased from town to town by local cops and railroad dicks. ''Anyhow, we've got something to be thankful for,'' Tom observes near the end of the film. ''It's stopped raining!'' 
 ''Wild Boys of the Road'' (1933) also takes place in a Depression America of foreclosures, flophouses and freight yards, although this time the characters are a pair of middle-class teenagers (Frankie Darro and Edwin Phillips) who have left home to relieve the burden on their parents. The emotional triangle returns, this time provoked by a buddy who turns out to be a girl in disguise (Dorothy Coonan, Wellman's future wife and mother of their seven children). (Louise Brooks played a similarly ambiguous figure in his 1928 Paramount silent, ''Beggars of Life.'') 
 As in ''Other Men's Women,'' a railroad accident has tragic results for a central character, though the film is not as bleak as ''Heroes for Sale.'' This time Wellman allows for a distant glimmer of hope, in the form of a judge (Robert Barrat) who is carefully framed alongside a National Recovery Administration poster. 
 Wellman was not an elegant stylist, like his Warner Brothers colleagues Michael Curtiz and William Dieterle, but his movies, particularly from this period, have a blunt, almost physical force that carries its own conviction. In ''The Purchase Price'' Wellman has a character punch the camera right in the ''face,'' a shot that Sam Fuller would rediscover 20 years later.
 The enforcement of the Production Code in 1934 would put severe restraints on Wellman's rambunctiousness, though he would continue to produce films of value until the end of his career (which came, appropriately, with the semi-autobiographical ''Lafayette Escadrille'' in 1958, with Tab Hunter as an American ace pilot flying for France in World War I).
 This collection, assembled with the taste and technical excellence we've come to expect from Warner DVDs, offers an outstanding introduction to a very rich body of work. (Warner Home Video, $49.98, not rated)

HEADLINE: Lowered Expectations For the Bulls' Return

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT the 1980s and '90s, investors took comfort in knowing that short-term setbacks were just that: short. Back then, it took only about a year and a half, on average, for stocks in a bear market to slide from peak to trough and then climb all the way back. 
 But this is a different era. The downturn, which cut the Dow Jones industrial average in half, is already nearly a year and a half old, and despite recent gains there's no clear sense that the worst is over. 
 So it's time for investors to reset their expectations, many market strategists say. At the very least, don't count on the market normalizing, or ''reverting to the mean,'' with much speed. And don't count on the market recouping all its losses for several more years.
 Setting aside specific problems now facing the economy -- like the credit crisis and the continuing troubles in the housing and financial sectors -- the math of recovering from downturns of this magnitude is hard to overcome quickly. James B. Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter in Whitefish, Mont., studied bear market recoveries since 1929; he found that after the most significant downturns -- like this one -- it has taken more than seven years for stocks to fully recoup losses. 
 For example, it took 7.2 years after the start of the bear market in 2000 for stocks to reach a bottom and then to climb back to the 2000 peak. After the bear started growling in 1973, it took 7.5 years to return to the high. And after the 1929 crash, equities didn't return to their previous peak for another quarter of a century. 
 The current bear market started on Oct. 9, 2007. Based on the average recoveries of the past, the Dow may not make it all the way back to its peak of 14,164 until late 2014. And some market observers say it could take significantly longer.
 But don't stocks usually bounce aggressively off their lows? And aren't stocks supposed to perform much better than average after years when they perform much worse than average? 
 Maybe not. A recent report by Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School found that the payoff for investing in stocks following bad years was only slightly better than after good ones.
 The report looked at global stock market performance going back to 1910. In five-year periods after the worst years in the market, stocks returned 7.1 percentage points above the prevailing yield on a three-month Treasury bill. Following the best years, stocks gained 6.8 points above cash. The study was part of the 2009 Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook. 
 ''Betting on quick mean reversion is a dangerous thing,'' Professor Dimson said.
 But assume for a moment that the market is due for a big snap-back. Even if that were to occur, stocks would still have a steep mountain to climb.
 ''We could have a legendary run off the lows, but it may still take us 10 years to get back to our old highs,'' said Jeremy Grantham, chairman of the investment management firm GMO. 
 Historically, bull markets have gained around 38 percent in their first 12 months. That amounts to more than a third of the total gains throughout a typical bull market's life. Let's assume that such an initial surge happens this time. 
 The Dow is trading 7,278. A 38 percent rise would lift the Dow to 10,043. Even assuming a 10 percent annual climb thereafter -- a big assumption in tough times -- it would take nearly four more years to get back to even. That would bring us to 2013.
 Investors who bank on 10-percent-plus returns may be fooling themselves, says Robert D. Arnott, chairman of the investment management firm Research Affiliates. ''The folks who are thinking that we could go back to a sustained period of double-digit annual returns for stocks haven't really studied their history,'' he said.
 Based on long-term returns of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, including dividends, Mr. Arnott said it was reasonable to expect that stocks might generate annual returns of around 8.5 percent. 
 IN the 1990s, he noted, earnings growth was higher than average. That, as well as investors' willingness to pay higher prices for each dollar of earnings, accounted for the outsize market gains in that decade, he said.
 But that kind of euphoria about stocks will probably not be repeated anytime soon, as price-to-earnings ratios for stocks have fallen back in line with their historical norms and are well below their recent highs. ''We have to move people away from the mind-set that anything less than double-digit returns is disappointing,'' Mr. Arnott said.
 Here's another way to think about it: Even if it takes 10 years for the Dow to claw back to its old highs, at an annual rate of nearly 7 percent, ''you would have still done very well -- certainly better than in T-bills,'' Mr. Dimson said.
 Single-digit stock returns may not seem all that thrilling, compared with the huge numbers posted during the bull market of the '90s. But for many investors, a stretch of modest returns might be a great relief after the losses of the last few years.

HEADLINE: Making Music With Less

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LIKE many musicians who play for the handful of small professional orchestras outside of New York City these days, Gabriel Schaff, a violinist, is struggling to cobble together a living. Mr. Schaff, 49, has contracts that guarantee work with four orchestras, including the Stamford Symphony Orchestra and Long Island Philharmonic. He substitutes in others, including the Westfield Symphony Orchestra in New Jersey. And he takes side work, like Broadway shows, in between. 
 But side work has grown scarcer as Broadway retrenches. Substitute jobs are in shorter supply. Nearly all the orchestras Mr. Schaff regularly plays for are offering less work than in the past, because of the economic downturn. And one of those groups, the Opera Orchestra of New York, has just canceled its two remaining shows this season at Carnegie Hall, citing significant reductions in ''all areas of public support.'' 
 ''It has forced me into a part-time, hand-to-mouth existence,'' said Mr. Schaff, who commutes to his various jobs from his home in Harrington Park, N.J. 
 To try to balance their annual budgets, which range up to $2 million, many of these smaller orchestras in the suburbs that use professional musicians have reduced rehearsal time, shortened their seasons and scaled back productions.
 In addition to the Long Island Philharmonic, the Stamford Symphony and the Westfield Symphony, regional orchestras in the New York region include groups like the Westchester Philharmonic; the Hartford Symphony Orchestra and the New Haven Symphony Orchestra in Connecticut; and, in New Jersey, the Colonial Symphony, the Garden State Philharmonic and the New Philharmonic of New Jersey. These ensembles have part-time schedules but full-time professional players. 
 In contrast, community orchestras -- groups like the St. Thomas Orchestra in Westchester, the North Shore Symphony Orchestra on Long Island and the Bloomfield Symphony Orchestra in New Jersey -- are composed largely of amateurs who work for little or no money. Though community orchestras may employ professional ''ringers'' who fill out sections and are paid, their organizational structures tend to be less like full-time orchestras' than are the regional orchestras'. 
 For the professional musicians, rehearsal time has emerged as a major point of contention. It is often the first thing orchestras trim, since such cuts are not visible to the public. For some organizations, the first deep reductions in rehearsal time began during the economic slump that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. For example, that is when the Stamford Symphony replaced four preconcert sessions of 2 1/2 hours each with three sessions of three hours.
 But Eckart Preu, the orchestra's fiery conductor, took the situation in stride. 
 Mr. Preu, 39, a native of Germany whose preshow ritual includes bouncing on the balls of his feet backstage like a soccer player, has a kinetic style well suited to the hurried pace that many musicians for regional orchestras say they now feel. He said that limiting rehearsal time helped maintain creative tension going into a performance. 
 ''The more you nail things down, the more perfect it's going to be, but also the less freedom you have in performance,'' he said.
 His views, however, were not echoed by his counterparts at other orchestras. 
 Itzhak Perlman, who has signed on for three seasons as artistic director of the Westchester Philharmonic and appeared twice so far this season, argued that more rehearsal time helped an orchestra get beyond a work's mechanics and find its artistic core. ''The more you play a piece, the more you feel free with it,'' he said. ''Then you can actually forget about playing the piece and be busier about making music.'' 
 In New Jersey, the Westfield Symphony recently reduced the number of rehearsals for some concerts from three to two. David Wroe, the symphony's conductor, said he worried that under-rehearsed, overcautious musicians would ultimately communicate their hesitancy to the audience. 
 ''In a safe performance,'' he said, ''when the musicians are trying to keep it as controlled as possible, emotional intensity is compromised, I believe, and the audience does feel that.''
 The situation is unnerving freelancers like Mr. Schaff, the violinist. The net loss of an hour of rehearsal time may not seem like much, but when added to the hours of unpaid time spent preparing for rehearsals, it can add up to thousands of dollars.
 For the orchestra, of course, that means money saved. At the current base pay for musicians of $47 an hour for rehearsals, that would be $3,000 or more for a concert that calls for a full complement of players. And the public so far seems not to have noticed. 
 In interviews, longtime Stamford Symphony patrons who gathered at a Chinese restaurant for a ritual preconcert supper earlier this year generally offered praise for the orchestra. Two hours later, they packed the nearby Palace Theater and applauded the orchestra warmly. 
 But Mr. Schaff and some of his fellow orchestra members had a different take. Driving home after the show, Mr. Schaff said, their conversation quickly turned to the opening number, Samuel Barber's ''Adagio for Strings.'' They commented how even an extra hour of rehearsal time might have allowed the piece, squeezed between run-throughs of seven other works, to mature. 
 ''It's such a gorgeous piece, and yet it sounded like we were just walking through it,'' said Mr. Schaff, who has played with the orchestra for more than 20 years. ''It's a terrible feeling because we all wanted it to settle in and find its natural shape and natural drive.'' 
 Told of the musicians' worries, Barbara Soroca, executive director of the Stamford orchestra, whose background is in business, dismissed the concern. ''If you ask any musician or any music director, they would ask for even more rehearsal time,'' she said. ''This is an appropriate amount of time. It's pretty standard. Some orchestras have cut further.'' 
 Ms. Soroca's stance is not unusual among orchestra administrators, though she acknowledged the danger of further cuts. She said she planned to deal with a projected decline of 10 percent to 20 percent in contributions next season by using smaller orchestras for one or two concerts or moving rehearsals from the concert hall into less expensive rental space, which would save $10,000 over the season. 
 For the Westchester Philharmonic, Mr. Perlman has been seeking a different approach. At a rehearsal for a November concert, he asked Joshua Worby, the executive director, for an extra hour, and received it. The time, tacked on to a previously reduced schedule of three 2 1/2-hour sessions, was especially valuable in preparing Brahms's First Symphony, Mr. Perlman said. 
 Mr. Worby said that finding the money for the extra time was a struggle, but that he could not deny Mr. Perlman. He said that he suspected the renowned violinist would request additional rehearsal time again -- a request that, if granted, could begin to alter the calculus on which the orchestra's management decisions are based. 
 That Mr. Perlman received the additional time has not hurt his reputation with the Westchester Philharmonic players, some of whom had been anxious about his arrival in October, said Peter Reit, the principal French horn player, who, like nearly all of the orchestra's members, has played with it for most of its 26 years. 
 Mr. Perlman said he never planned to ''cause any revolutions.''
 By all accounts, Mr. Perlman has won over the musicians with his personal style, conducting technique and power as a drawing card, his reputation having spurred a sharp increase in attendance for performances at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College. 
 But the orchestra, which in the post-9/11 period eliminated one of the five pairs of concerts it typically performed each season, has been unable to restore it, though that remains a goal. The orchestra, Mr. Worby said, is still carrying debt at a time when contributions are declining and costs are rising. He said that spending increased by 37 percent in the past year, partly as a result of Mr. Perlman's fees, increased marketing and advertising costs and a decision to use larger ensembles on a more consistent basis.
 When Stephen Belth became the executive director of the Long Island Philharmonic in 2005, he inherited a huge budget deficit. Several corporate sponsorships had vanished, leading to canceled concerts and missed payrolls, though the musicians continued to play when asked and were ultimately paid, said Mr. Schaff, an orchestra member. 
 When the New York Philharmonic this month canceled its annual free summer concert in Heckscher State Park in Islip, the Islip Arts Council asked the Long Island Philharmonic to present a concert on July 18 instead. But it is an open question whether the financing can be found, said Lynda A. Moran, the arts council's executive director. Like other orchestra directors, Mr. Belth has stepped up his efforts to seek donors. Increasingly, he has enlisted the music director, David Stewart Wiley, and the concertmaster, Erica Kiesewetter, in ''cultivation events'' at which they mingle with and play for potential patrons in their homes. 
 Mr. Belth has also restored a policy of engaging big-name soloists. With a budget that has risen to $2.1 million after falling to $1.5 million, he has hired players like the flutists James Galway and his wife, Jeanne Galway, a Long Island native, who nearly filled the Staller Center, in Stony Brook, and the Tilles Center, in Brookville, on consecutive nights last fall. The pianist Andre Watts is scheduled to play Beethoven in April. 
 To keep down costs, some orchestra directors are abandoning the practice of bringing in well-known soloists. In the midst of what the Stamford Symphony's promotions describe as ''A Season of Extraordinary Soloists,'' the executive director, Ms. Soroca, said she did not intend to book marquee names next season. She noted that the relative newcomer Tai Murray, 27, was well received as the soloist earlier this year on Barber's ''Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.'' 
 Most orchestra directors agree on the need to generate income by expanding education programs. The programs are often effective at gaining children's attention: At a recent performance at the Newbridge Road Elementary School in North Bellmore, a quintet culled from the Long Island Philharmonic played for hundreds of enthusiastic 7- to 11-year-olds in a production that coupled stripped-down arrangements of popular orchestral themes with a script that referred to Harry Potter and other literary characters. 
 But Valerie Levy, a violinist who oversaw the proceedings in North Bellmore, said that even the in-school programs may be in trouble. ''It's very alarming,'' she said. After a period of growth in the programs, she said, inquiries for further performances on Long Island have fallen off dramatically. 
 Any falloff in education programs is a concern for musicians because the programs compensate for cuts elsewhere. At the Long Island Philharmonic, the programs give work to string players like Ms. Levy, who, like Mr. Schaff, has been hit by the Opera Orchestra of New York's recent cancellations. This month, the philharmonic performed Beethoven's Seventh Symphony with one rehearsal and six first violins, barely a third the number in top full-time orchestras. Smaller string sections have become the norm as well at the Westfield Symphony, another orchestra Ms. Levy plays in regularly, and one in which Mr. Schaff substitutes.
 Mr. Wroe, the Westfield Symphony conductor, said that growing pressure to cut costs led to the scheduling last month of Rossini's ''Barber of Seville,'' a piece that he felt needed relatively little rehearsal time -- and received it. 
 Mr. Schaff, recalling the rehearsals for that show -- fewer in number, more feverish in pace and employing a string section arguably thinner than the music demanded -- had little faith that the cost-cutting at the Westfield Symphony, or any other orchestra for which he played, was over. 
 ''This is only the beginning,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Who Threw The DVD From the Train?

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 DESPITE the feverish attention on box-office results each weekend, the truth is that Hollywood stopped relying on the multiplexes to make money a long time ago. For over a decade, a motion picture's caboose -- DVD sales -- has been the driver of its profitability.
 The DVD money has been so big that studio decisions about whether to green-light a movie have sometimes gone like this: Is this film going to draw interest at the box office? We're not sure? Well, if it's only a modest success, that's O.K. We can count on consumers to toss the DVD into their shopping carts and make us whole. Who's up for martinis at the Hotel Bel-Air?
 Now that train is reversing. Business at the multiplex is going gangbusters. Ticket sales are up 14 percent this year over the same period in 2008, according to the tracking firm Media by Numbers. Attendance is up 12 percent after falling the last two years. 
 But according to studios, sales for some new-release DVDs are down a jaw-dropping 40 percent, hammered by the recession, a saturated market (on sale now: the complete ninth season of ''Murder, She Wrote'') and a shift to Internet downloads.
 At least for the moment, Hollywood is heading back to the days when the theatrical run of a film was actually important for more reasons than serving as a marketing platform for home video. 
 ''There is no more downside protection for producers in the video marketplace,'' said Ingo Vollkammer, a co-founder and a co-chief executive of Leomax Entertainment, an independent production and film finance company. ''Movies today need to be theatrically driven.''
 Studios, of course, aren't giving up on DVDs; home video is still a huge business. But the movie capital is starting to acknowledge that it has no idea what the immediate future will look like -- maybe DVD sales will perk up in a few months, or maybe high-definition Blu-ray discs will finally pop, or maybe the whole thing is kaput as video-on-demand services take root. So producers are being leaned on to come up with a different type of movie.
 ''Anything that can drive the audience to the theaters has an easier time getting made now,'' said Kevin Misher, a former Universal and Sony executive and now a leading independent producer. 
 In addition to big ''tent pole'' blockbusters, that means movies that are fun to watch in groups: at least 10 musicals are in full-steam-ahead development, including a remake of ''My Fair Lady.'' And it means more pictures that are pre-branded: ''Monopoly'' and ''Candy Land,'' the movies, are on the way. Most of all, it means a strong return by major studios to middle-of-the-road, genre pictures.
 When executed correctly, Hollywood genre films -- inexpensive movies that honor cinematic rules instead of defying them and stick to carefully defined categories -- have tended to snag more than enough viewers to justify their modest cost. And lately they have been on fire. Hollywood insiders recoiled at the Sony film ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop'' until it started printing money at the multiplex. So far, this screwball comedy, made for $26 million, has sold $138 million in tickets and is still playing.
 But the movie that has studios the most jealous is ''Taken,'' a genre film from 20th Century Fox about a former C.I.A. agent on a quest to save his kidnapped daughter. It was produced for about $33 million and has sold $127 million in tickets (and counting) since its release on Jan. 30.
 This middle ground once represented the meat of the movie business but receded over the last decade as the industry pursued the fringes of the market -- tiny specialty films and blockbusters -- because of the huge DVD upside, among other things. Generally speaking, the middle just wasn't where the smartest people wanted to play.
 The pendulum shift back to the big screen is changing that. ''Taken'' was directed by Pierre Morel, an arty French director who is ascending rapidly on Hollywood's hot-new-thing list. Mr. Misher is behind ''Public Enemies,'' a big-budget gangster movie starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale that is set for a July release. But first he has ''Fighting,'' a genre film being released by Universal on April 24. It stars Channing Tatum as a young counterfeiter who is introduced to underground street fighting by a scam artist (Terrence Howard).
 EVEN the high-brow Miramax (''Doubt'') and Fox Searchlight (''The Wrestler'') appear to be tilting more heavily toward the pack-'em-in middle. Miramax is about to release a teenage comedy called ''Adventureland,'' billed as a romp on par with ''Superbad'' from 2007. Fox Searchlight is rolling out ''Miss March,'' about a guy in search of his virginal high-school sweetheart, who has become a centerfold model.
 Marc Abraham, the director of ''Flash of Genius,'' about the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper, sees high-brow as a hard sell. ''The sweat factor these days is pretty high for anything that isn't a sure sell on screen,'' he said. ''Flash of Genius'' was cheered by critics but not by the box office. 
 For now, Mr. Abraham, also a successful producer, is shelving his idea about a Hank Williams biopic. Instead, he is pursuing a prequel to ''The Thing,'' the 1982 John Carpenter movie about a shape-shifting alien confronting scientists in the Antarctic. ''There's some brand potential there that the studio can tap into,'' Mr. Abraham said.
 In addition to coming up with a different type of movie, producers are also having to build them differently -- namely, with less money. Without the DVD back end to count on, studios are recalibrating budgets, demanding leaner talent deals and asking producers to do more with less.
 During a recent interview tied to his movie ''Confessions of a Shopaholic,'' the producer Jerry Bruckheimer said: ''You can set the tone for a big movie just by showing some huge vistas or something at the beginning. There are all kinds of tricks we will have to use.''
 Mr. Abraham, who is also working on a remake of ''Creature From the Black Lagoon,'' agreed, but said he saw studios moving more into medium-size pictures rather than trying to cut back too much on behemoths like ''Pirates of the Caribbean 4,'' which Mr. Bruckheimer has in the works.
 ''Trying to change a project to fit a supposed DVD number is like hitting a trifecta,'' he said. ''Not something I would suggest doing.''

HEADLINE: Those Persistent Anonymous Sources

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT. 
The public editor can be reached by e-mail: public@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Times has a tough policy on anonymous sources, but continues to fall down in living up to it. That's my conclusion after scanning a sampling of articles published in all sections of the paper since the first of the year. This will not surprise the many readers who complain to me that the paper lets too many of its sources hide from public view.
 Consider:
 The policy says anonymous sources should be used only as ''a last resort when the story is of compelling public interest and the information is not available any other way.'' But in an article about the decoration of New York apartment building lobbies, a woman was granted anonymity to describe a particularly edgy one as ''a den of hell.'' She had been visiting a friend in the building and would not give her name, the article said, ''for fear of offending the hostess.'' 
 In last Sunday's Times, a ''senior government official who was not authorized to speak on the record'' denounced bonuses to A.I.G. executives as ''unacceptable.'' Last resort? A reader peeking over the top of the paper that day could have seen Lawrence Summers, the president's chief economic adviser, calling the bonuses ''outrageous'' on television. 
 The policy says the newspaper will not allow personal or partisan attacks from behind a mask of anonymity. Yet an anonymous Yankees official could trash Alex Rodriguez (''His legacy, now, is gone''), and an anonymous Jets official could say that the team did not want to sign Terrell Owens because he would have poisoned it and torn up the locker room. A competitor of an Internet start-up was allowed to slam its business model without his name being attached to his belittling quotes.
 The policy says rote references to sources who ''insisted on anonymity'' or ''demanded anonymity'' should be avoided because they ''offer the reader no help and make our decisions appear automatic.'' Since Jan. 1, sources who ''spoke on condition of anonymity'' have appeared in The Times more than 240 times. Often a reason was given, but sometimes there was no explanation for why a source needed anonymity and nothing to help a reader decide how reliable the person's information was. 
 A recent article about The Washington Post's handling of the ''Doonesbury'' comic strip said sources at The Post asked not to be identified ''for fear of appearing to embarrass a colleague.'' That amused Frank Herron of Winchester, Mass. ''It's nice to see that journalists still have feelings and are sensitive to the feelings of others,'' he said.
 Some reasons for withholding names are understandable: a man who came upon an assault victim in Manhattan feared speaking on the record because the attacker was still free. Others are baffling: a source in an article about drug testing in baseball wanted anonymity ''because he was discussing drug-testing information.''
 Accepting a source's demand for anonymity is sometimes essential to getting critical information, but editors and reporters at The Times tell me that they understand how overuse of unnamed sources can damage credibility. ''Reporters really recognize, as do editors, that when you can name sources, you have a much more authoritative first draft of history than you do with one larded with anonymous sources,'' said Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news.
 Last year, at my request, a group of journalism students at Columbia University studied anonymous sources in The Times and concluded that their use was actually down by roughly half since a strengthened policy was adopted in 2004. But the students said the paper failed to follow its own rules for explaining them nearly 80 percent of the time. Bill Keller, the executive editor, told the newsroom that the study presented ''an excellent opportunity to remind ourselves that unnamed sources are not to be used lightly, and to reiterate the rules governing their use.'' 
 With my assistant, Michael McElroy, I took another look at the issue after The Times was burned this year by anonymous sources peddling false information about Caroline Kennedy. Given the examples we found -- nonessential and even trivial information attributed to anonymous sources, personal attacks, and inadequate details about a source's credibility -- I think it is time again for a forceful rededication to the newspaper's own standards. ''We need to do better,'' Keller agreed. 
 After reviewing some examples, Craig Whitney, the standards editor, said, ''The bar should be far higher than it is before a reporter puts an anonymous quote in and before an editor lets it stay in.'' Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief, said he was thinking of holding a bureau meeting to discuss pushing back against the city's prevailing culture of anonymity. ''We work very hard to avoid unnecessary anonymous sources,'' Baquet told me. ''All that said, we can do better.''
 Next week, I will deal more with the special challenges Washington presents. Getting anything to change there won't be easy. The Obama administration, which promised new transparency in government, has fallen into old Washington ways, sometimes providing officials for comment only if they are not named and holding background briefings for large groups of reporters at which the public cannot be told who did the talking. Times journalists daily face unpleasant choices: accepting information without being able to name the source, or refusing it at the risk of shortchanging readers and seeing it reported elsewhere.
 Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said the administration frequently makes officials available to speak on the record. But, in a comment revealing of the administration's news management philosophy, he said there are times when officials will talk only anonymously so they can get into policy details, speak more candidly and ''keep the emphasis on the most important name in any story, which is President Obama.''
 To see how pervasive the culture of anonymity is in Washington, consider that President Obama recently walked in on his way to dinner and joined senior members of his administration who were arguing with The Times's David Brooks about one of his columns. In Brooks's next column, about this meeting, the most senior of all officials simply became one of ''four senior members of the administration.'' His cover was blown later. 
 I asked Brooks if he had asked the president to go on the record. He said he had not, because ''I thought in those informal circumstances it would be wrong to quote him by name.'' Brooks said that, as a columnist, he looks for information to shape opinions for which he takes full responsibility. He sees that as different from the role of a reporter seeking facts from identifiable sources. I understand the difference, but I would have asked.
 Abramson, a former Washington bureau chief, said she thinks the city's problems with anonymous sources are part of a ''culture of hiding who is talking'' that is spreading everywhere, in part because ''any quote can become an Internet time bomb.''
 It is spreading, it seems, even to some readers who hate anonymous sources in their newspaper. Two of them, after calling my attention to examples in this column, asked not to be identified.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ROZEK, PROFESSOR EDWARD J

 BODY:
ROZEK--Professor Edward J. October 13, 1918-February 19, 2009. Edward Rozek passed away at his home of natural causes on February 19, 2009. A professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado, he was born and raised in Poland. After the country was overrun by Hitler and Stalin, he escaped via Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Italy to France. There he joined the First Polish Armored Brigade which took part in the defense of Paris. 
After France fell, he made his way to England. He became commander of a platoon of tanks in the 10th Reconnaissance Regiment of the First Polish Armoured Division, which fought from Normandy to northern Germany. He was wounded three times. The last time he was blinded by an anti-tank land mine and spent 10 months in English and Scottish hospitals. He received four Purple Hearts, three Crosses of Valor, four British war medals, and Polonia Restituta Officer Class and Komandoria. He ended his military career with the rank of Major. In 1948, the British Government gave him, as a former officer, a one-way ticket to anywhere in the world. He chose to take the Queen Mary to America. He arrived with no family, only $50 and a suitcase full of books. After working on a dairy farm and then a gas station to earn college tuition, he was admitted to Harvard where he earned three degrees: A.B. (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa), A.M. and Ph.D. In 1956, he became a professor of comparative governments at the University of Colorado. He directed the Central and East European Studies Program for 25 years and was deputy editor of the Journal of Central and East European Affairs. He founded and for 34 years directed the Institute for the Study of Economic and Political Freedom. He also founded and directed from 1972 to 1999 the Center for Science and Technology, which organized numerous conferences in which several Nobel Prize winners and other distinguished scholars from American and European universities participated. He lectured at many universities and public institutions in the United States, Europe, South Korea, the Republic of China, and South Africa. Professor Rozek wrote several books. The best-known is Allied Wartime Diplomacy, for which he received the National Book Foundation Award. The American philosopher Sidney Hook dedicated his book, Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy, as follows: "To Edward J. Rozek---Embattled fighter for free men, free society and the free university against fascism, communism and totalitarian liberalism." CU students elected him Professor of the Year and Distinguished Faculty Member. After teaching for 43 years at the University of Colorado, Professor Rozek retired in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he held the Endowed Garnsey-Rozek Professorship in Economics and Political Freedom at the University of Northern Colorado. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, Professor Rozek was a member of Ronald Reagan's Advisory Council on Defense and Foreign Policy. He was an honorary member of the legendary Solidarity of Poland and received Knighthood in the Venerable Order of St. John, which was founded around 1100 AD. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; his sons, Christopher and Jonathan, and four grandchildren, Alexander, Philip, Thomas and Christina. Services were held at Sacred Heart of Mary Church in Boulder, CO on February 24. Memorial contributions can be made to the Orphanage for the Blind and the Deaf and sent to Wells Fargo Bank, PO Box 227, Boulder, CO 80306-9980.

HEADLINE: In a Downturn, Corporate Ties Have Put a Bind on Sports

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The worst economy since the Great Depression is settling over the fields, courts, tracks, luxury suites and boardrooms of professional sports. 
 The N.F.L. cut 169 jobs, and its commissioner reduced his salary by about 20 percent. The N.B.A. shed a tenth of its staff, and ESPN will not fill 200 vacant jobs. The United States Olympic Committee laid off 54 workers to cut millions from its budget, and Nascar teams have laid off hundreds of employees.
 The L.P.G.A. Tour is dropping four tournaments because three title sponsors dropped out, and the PGA Tour will lose three title sponsors but no events. Wells Fargo rescued the insolvent bank Wachovia -- then stripped Wachovia's name from a PGA Tour event.
 The stories are part of a narrative thread that only grows longer. 
 ''Consumers and companies are hurting, and some people don't know if they're going to sleep in a house or not,'' L.P.G.A. Commissioner Carolyn Bivens said. ''We have to keep in perspective that this is a golf and entertainment business.''
 Nascar teams like the legendary Richard Petty's have merged with others because sponsorships dried up. Honda ended its Formula One sponsorship. This year's Detroit Grand Prix was canceled, trimming the IndyCar Series to 17 races.
 Teams have frozen or cut ticket prices, and some, like the Nets and the Minnesota Timberwolves, will give refunds to season-ticket holders if they lose their jobs. 
 Athletes have also felt the pinch. Two players on each team in the W.N.B.A., now without the contracted Houston Comets, will lose their jobs, the result of a reduction in rosters to 11. 
 Several N.F.L. teams, including the Washington Redskins, the Denver Broncos and the Cleveland Browns, have laid off employees. The Jets will furlough 60 workers for two weeks in June and July.
 And the Arena Football League canceled its 2009 season to cut labor costs and drop its salary cap well under $2 million a team.
 Pro sports were once thought to be more resistant than other industries to recessions, but this is no ordinary downturn. Teams, leagues and tours have become increasingly reliant on revenue from corporate sponsorships, advertising and luxury suites, and are likely to suffer more than they did in previous downturns. The financial and automotive industries, so heavily invested in the marketing of sports, are undergoing upheavals that have required government bailouts and rounds of layoffs to survive.
 General Motors, the nation's largest sports advertiser, did not renew its U.S.O.C. sponsorship or advertise on the Super Bowl last month. And it cut its ties to two Nascar tracks and Tiger Woods, who had endorsed its Buick division.
 ''Corporations have played a bigger role in the last 10, 20 years, so sports have become more susceptible to their ups and downs,'' said David Carter, a professor of sports business at the University of Southern California. ''Before this, it was all about catering to the fans and making sure the turnstiles were clicking.''
 In a recession so severe that some call it a depression, leagues are happy to see attendance stay flat or go up just a little, as in the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. On the Nascar Sprint Cup circuit, the Daytona 500 sold out and the Shelby 427 in Las Vegas nearly sold out. But the Kobalt Tools 500 on March 8 in the Atlanta area came up 30,000 fans short of a full house, a little worse than in recent years.
 Carter said sports usually acted as a lagging indicator of distress, meaning teams, leagues, tours and other organizations might be suffering even after other sectors of the economy started to recover. Sports, especially at the highest levels, operate with financial cushions: multiyear contracts with sponsors, television networks and luxury box renters. 
 The N.B.A.'s deals with ESPN and Turner Sports, for instance, pay it more than $900 million a year and end in 2015-16; the L.P.G.A. recently signed a 10-year deal with the Golf Channel and a long contract with J Sports in South Korea. Even Wells Fargo's deactivation of Wachovia's golf tournament sponsorship does not mean the bank will stop paying its fees for five more years. And the L.P.G.A. Tour's loss of Safeway as the title sponsor of a tournament in Arizona was backstopped by the quick substitution of J Golf.
 But any sense of long-term economic stability has been jolted.
 Bank of America's decision to end talks to be the elite sponsor of the new Yankee Stadium means an annual loss of at least $10 million to the team. The bank did not want to face the type of scorn from Congress, the news media and fans that has tarred Citigroup for its seemingly inescapable $400 million naming-rights deal with the Mets for Citi Field.
 The Indiana Pacers are losing $30 million this season and are among 15 N.B.A. teams in the red. The 30-team league would not say if the Pacers were one of 12 teams that borrowed from a recent $200 million addition to its $1.7 billion credit facility. The new credit, Commissioner David Stern said, is an affirmation of strength, not financial weakness.
 ''Owners can borrow at better terms than they can get individually,'' he said, adding that the additional credit is not crisis-related but can be used for various purposes.
 If Stern is not scared, Joseph S. Blatter, the president of FIFA, soccer's governing body, seems to be. 
 Blatter said he was worried that the financial security afforded by sponsor and television contracts for next year's World Cup in South Africa would be followed by the ''second wave of an economic tsunami'' and send shivers through the sport.
 Closer to home, P.S.E.&G., New Jersey's largest utility, made a decision that, if emulated in stadiums and arenas nationwide, will erode bottom lines. It chose to save $400,000 a year by not renewing its leases on luxury boxes at the Izod Center, the Prudential Center, the minor league Riverfront Stadium and Giants Stadium (although it has chosen to rent one at the new Giants-Jets stadium), and at two arts facilities.
 Effect on Leagues
 Major League Baseball may be a test case for middle-of-the-recession fan behavior, more than the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., whose regular seasons are nearly over. 
 Two-thirds of the 30 major league teams have not raised ticket prices -- although the Yankees have altered that equation somewhat with premium seats ranging from $350 to $2,500 each, and they have heavily marketed the unsold high-priced real estate. 
 Attendance has been a bit higher in spring training. But even if nearly 79 million fans show up for regular-season games, as they have in recent years, how much will their spending on food and souvenirs decline? 
 ''You'd be foolish to speculate,'' said Bob DuPuy, the M.L.B. president. ''We're hoping to short-circuit it as much as possible with our commitment to providing affordable entertainment. We're guardedly optimistic.'' 
 Still, a week after DuPuy spoke, Commissioner Bud Selig told The Los Angeles Times that he was increasingly concerned about the extent to which baseball might be hurt at the gate because some fans had lost their jobs since last season.
 ''I used to think we were recession-proof,'' Selig said. ''I really did. This is different.''
 In small and big ways, the scope of the recession's impact has been felt.
 The N.H.L. cut its revenue-growth goal to 5 percent from 7 percent earlier this season, and it expects next season's salary cap to be flat.
 ''Any breathing fan has to be concerned,'' N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said. ''We're in uncharted waters. We need to be careful.''
 In tennis, the WTA Tour said it expected revenue to fall by as much as 20 percent this year.
 ''We're nervous like everyone,'' said Larry Scott, the chairman of the WTA Tour, who, like the L.P.G.A.'s Bivens, says his sport's global reach offers some stability.
 Fans Prioritize Spending
 Major League Soccer is holding its own. It has renewed deals with its nine sponsors and has a new team in Seattle that has sold 25,000 season tickets (and newly awarded franchises in Vancouver and Portland) with the allure of an average ticket price of $20. Three of the league's four television deals have years to go.
 But Commissioner Don Garber said there was reason to worry.
 ''We're all dependent on ad dollars and people spending money on tickets,'' he said. ''I don't believe people will prioritize spending over putting food on the table.''
 Roger Curtis, the president of Michigan International Speedway, seemed to grasp Garber's concerns as well as anyone. The track, in Brooklyn, is 70 miles from Detroit, where the Big Three automakers have scaled back their involvement in motorsports. 
 ''The economy's been an issue for three if not four years, so we've been dealing with this longer than any other area of the country,'' Curtis said.
 The track hosts two Sprint Cup races, one of which lost 3M as a sponsor. Sponsor hospitality will be down. So are suite rentals. Curtis has cut ticket prices by 25 percent for this season, reduced traffic snarls and improved seating and signage.
 ''We view ourselves as a lot more Disney than we do a sporting event,'' he said.
 Hope amid economic gloom is central to Arena Football's planned return and to the startups of Women's Professional Soccer, a seven-team league; and the United Football League, which will open in October with four teams, four fewer than planned.
 ''I'm pretty confident,'' said Frank Vuono, the chief operating officer of the United Football League. ''If it wasn't the worst economy in history, I'd be flying sky high.''

HEADLINE: Liberians 'Jubilant' at Extension of Temporary U.S. Residence Permit

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Liberian immigrants in New York celebrated the news on Saturday that President Obama had granted a temporary reprieve to some who were facing the possibility of expulsion at the end of the month. 
 Mr. Obama signed an order on Friday extending by 12 months a policy that grants Liberians the temporary right to live and work in the United States, an administration official said. 
 The policy was to expire on March 31, presenting the Liberians with a stark choice: Uproot themselves and return to Liberia, which remains politically and economically unstable, or stay in the United States illegally and risk deportation. 
 ''People are jubilant, people are happy,'' said Jacob D. Massaquoi II, executive director of African Refuge, a community organization on Staten Island that helps Liberian refugees. 
 Special residency and employment rights for Liberians were first granted in 1991 as civil war tore apart their country. Thousands fled their homeland and moved to the United States. A particularly large number settled on Staten Island, where many went to schools and colleges, married, had children, started businesses and bought property. 
 The program was extended or renewed several times. But after the end of the civil war in 2003, and elections in 2005, the United States government decided it was time to lift the special allowance, known as Temporary Protected Status. In 2007, President George W. Bush granted an 18-month extension, which federal officials said would be the last one.
 But in recent months, civic leaders in the Liberian-American community asked Mr. Obama, who has sole authority in the matter, to extend the program once more. They argued that the alternative could divide families and rupture communities.
 ''It would have a huge impact,'' said Jennifer Gray-Brumskine, vice chairwoman of the Staten Island Liberian Community Association. ''Separating families would create a new post-traumatic syndrome.'' 
 The consequences, the advocates said, would also be acutely felt in Liberia. The unemployment rate there is about 85 percent, and many people there depend on money sent by Liberians in the United States to survive. 
 Now that the community has been granted another reprieve, its leaders say they will press Congress to provide Liberian exiles with an expedited path to citizenship. 
 But their campaign will most likely run up against strong opposition, particularly from groups seeking tighter restrictions on immigration. 
 Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a public policy group that seeks to reduce immigration, said that Temporary Protected Status was intended to provide relief to populations during acute emergencies.
 In an e-mail message, he said that any ''heart-tugging personal stories of separation'' were ''the unavoidable trade-off for having accepted America's hospitality for so long.'' 
 According to the Department of Homeland Security, about 3,500 Liberians were registered under the program in 2007. 
 Liberian community leaders say that the refugee population is far larger -- in the tens of thousands, by some estimates -- but that most either never registered or failed to maintain their registration, and are therefore in the country illegally. 
 An Obama administration official said on Saturday that Liberian exiles who were not registered in 2007 would not be eligible to register under the new extension. 
 Some Liberians, mindful of the impending deadline, filed applications in recent months for a change of immigration status that would allow them to remain in the country legally on various grounds when the current policy expires. 
 But in interviews on Staten Island this month, it was apparent that many, if not most, Liberian exiles there had decided to stay regardless of whether Mr. Obama postponed the deadline, resigning themselves to staying under the radar of immigration officials.
 Among them is Madeline, a home health aide who has been living in the United States since the early 1990s and spoke on the condition that neither her surname nor her age be published for fear of alerting the immigration authorities. 
 She said that she had no intention of moving back to Liberia, and that her family there supported her decision. 
 ''I'm going to run away and hide somewhere,'' she said. ''Even my relatives are saying, 'We're going to pray for you.' They're depending on me.''

HEADLINE: In Weekly Address, Obama Presses Congress on Budget

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, signaling the start of what promises to be a bruising fight with Congress, said he expected lawmakers to pass a budget that would finance major programs in his economic recovery plan while substantially cutting the country's national deficit. 
 In his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, Mr. Obama said he would spend the coming week pushing for the programs in his $3.6 trillion budget. 
 ''As the House and the Senate take up this budget next week, the specific details and dollar amounts in this budget will undoubtedly change,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's a normal and healthy part of the process.''
 But Mr. Obama said that ''when all is said and done,'' he expects a budget that will reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil by investing in wind power and solar power technology, advanced biofuels and fuel-efficient cars. 
 He said the final budget must also invest in education programs and changes in health care. And all of that should be done, he said, while cutting the national deficit.
 ''To those who say we have to choose between health care reform and fiscal discipline, I say that making investments now that will dramatically lower health care costs for everyone won't add to our budget deficit in the long term; it is one of the best ways to reduce it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Obama's remarks came a day after the Congressional Budget Office released projections that the White House's tax and spending plans would create deficits totaling $2.3 trillion more during the next decade than the president's budget had projected. The remarks also come in the wake of public uproar over the disclosure of executive bonuses at the American International Group, which has received more than $170 billion in federal bailout money. 
 Mr. Obama said on Saturday that he would meet with Congressional leaders in the next week and would hold a prime-time news conference on Tuesday to discuss his economic recovery plans.
 ''With the fiscal mess we've inherited and the cost of this financial crisis, I've proposed a budget that cuts our deficit in half by the end of my first term,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's why we are scouring every corner of the budget and have proposed $2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade.''
 Reducing the deficit while expanding the programs that Mr. Obama wants will be a tough job, particularly given the amount of money that American taxpayers are being asked to pump into the country's besieged financial sector. Part of Mr. Obama's proposal is to raise taxes on families making more than $250,000 a year.
 Mr. Obama spent two days this past week holding town-hall-style meetings in California, where he said he heard from ordinary Americans who wanted to see the economy get back on its feet. 
 ''With the magnitude of the challenges we face, I don't just view this budget as numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's an economic blueprint for our future -- a vision of America where growth is not based on real estate bubbles or overleveraged banks, but on a firm foundation of investments in energy, education and health care that will lead to a real and lasting prosperity.''

HEADLINE: An Entourage of Their Own

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN

DATELINE: West Hollywood, Calif. 

 BODY:
 CROSS-LEGGED in one director's chair was Lorene Scafaria -- black pants, brown high heels, amused gaze -- leaning in to ask the next question. Waiting to answer, cross-legged in another, was Diablo Cody, struggling to keep her short blue dress from riding up.
 The two women, both 30, both screenwriters at the top of their game, both gorgeous, looked as if they were about to crack up. Ms. Scafaria turned to the audience.
 ''This is weird because we hang out a lot,'' she said. ''We've seen each other naked.'' 
 Some in the room tittered -- maybe even Twittered. But Ms. Scafaria plunged ahead. She wanted to ask Ms. Cody about her new project with Steven Spielberg, ''The United States of Tara,'' but ended up revealing another intimate glimpse (sans nudity) of her close friendship with the woman she was supposed to be interviewing.
 ''Mr. Spielberg will call her and she'll be afraid to answer the phone,'' Ms. Scafaria said of Ms. Cody. ''I'll be like, 'Answer the phone!' '' 
 Ms. Cody said: ''I'll think it's all over. I'm a pessimist.''
 Ms. Scafaria said, ''He'll be calling to praise her.'' 
 Ms. Cody won an Oscar for her screenplay for ''Juno.'' Ms. Scafaria is the screenwriter for ''Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist.'' If any of the 100 members of the Writers Guild of America who heard them speak on this recent evening wondered how the women act when they are not in front of an audience, the answer would have been, pretty much the same. 
 Except for one thing: Ms. Scafaria and Ms. Cody are usually not a duo, but half of a quartet. With their pals Dana Fox, who wrote ''What Happens in Vegas,'' and Liz Meriwether, a playwright-turned-screenwriter, they make up a Hollywood powerhouse writing posse who call themselves ''The Fempire.''
 You can find them at work in their Laurel Canyon homes in their pajamas, or sitting next to one another at laptop-friendly restaurants. To see them gathered amid the dinosaur topiary around Ms. Fox's swimming pool with their dogs (they all have dogs) is to see four distinct styles of glamour that bear little resemblance to traditional images of behind-the-scenes talent. Whenever one of them has a movie opening, they all rent a white limousine and go from theater to theater to watch the first audiences react.
 ''We're usually drunk by the third theater,'' Ms. Cody said. ''It's super porno and tacky, and we love doing it.''
 It sounds like fun and games -- the boozy, all-woman answer to those close-knit gangs of Hollywood boy-men captured on screen in ''Entourage'' and embodied by the real-life Apatown, the industry moniker for filmmaker Judd Apatow's coterie of actors and screenwriters including Paul Rudd, Jason Segel and Seth Rogen. But these women also work hard: Ms. Cody, Ms. Fox and Ms. Scafaria can command seven figures to write a movie that makes it into theaters with big stars. Ms. Meriwether (the others call her ''the freshman'') is on her way to joining them. That's no small achievement when you consider that among the screenwriters who are in steady demand for major projects, only about 20 are women. Don't even try to credit their bankability to their looks. 
 ''When you read a screenplay, it doesn't come with a picture on the cover,'' said Adam Siegel, president of Marc Platt Productions, a producer who is friends with all four women and has worked with all except Ms. Cody. ''I know a few beautiful women, but none of them write like Dana, Liz, Lorene or Diablo.''
 But not everyone loves these four women, and plenty are happy to say so (many of them anonymously). So among them there is also a battle-scarred camaraderie. ''Whenever you have a project out in wide release, there are haters,'' Ms. Cody said. ''Blogs, imdb, Rotten Tomatoes, reviews. It's a lot to deal with. When most people get Googled, they get maybe a Facebook page. When we get Googled, there's criticism, bad reviews, commentary on the way we look. You need people who have been through it.''
 The Fempire's solid front -- all four wear the same gold necklaces with tiny heart pendants inscribed with words that can't be printed here, gifts from Ms. Cody -- seems to make some men nervous and envious at the same time.
 ''I adore them and I'm terrified of them,'' said Jason Reitman, who directed ''Juno.'' ''There's so much talent packed in the group. Writing is such a solitary activity. The idea that they have each other is quite lovely. When I think of the four of them together, writing, of course I'm jealous.''
 Ms. Fox and Ms. Scafaria were the first to meet, at a Halloween party about five years ago. They bonded over health problems resulting from the stresses of writing. ''We talked about our bowels, and I was like, 'O.K., we're best friends now,' '' Ms. Scafaria said. 
 Then, about seven months before the release of ''Juno,'' which became a sleeper hit, Ms. Fox was on a panel with Ms. Cody. She liked her and decided to corral her into the gang. It wasn't easy. Ms. Fox called Ms. Cody a few times before hearing back.
 ''She thought I was being aloof, but really I'm just neurotic,'' Ms. Cody said. 
 Ms. Scafaria soon set Ms. Cody up with a college friend who became her boyfriend. ''We're like a family,'' Ms. Scafaria said.
 Then came Ms. Meriwether, a successful playwright in New York. Her agent, Cliff Roberts of William Morris, sent her first television pilot, ''Sluts'' -- about a group of recent college graduates who move to New York -- to Ms. Scafaria and Ms. Fox about a year ago. While the series was never picked up by a network, the pilot did gain Ms. Meriwether entree to the Fempire. (Mr. Roberts represents those three women; Ms. Cody remains loyal to the agent who plucked her from the blogosphere, Sarah Self of the Gersh Agency.) 
 ''The way they live their lives was a good example of how to work and live as a female screenwriter in L.A.,'' said Ms. Meriwether, 27, who moved to Laurel Canyon last fall. ''Movies have always been written by groups of people, and it goes along well with the writing process to have people to bounce things off of.'' 
 She looks as if she could be cast as the love interest in a Woody Allen movie, a thinking man's Scarlett Johansson in dark framed glasses. Her first movie script, ''Friends With Benefits,'' is being produced by Ivan Reitman (Jason Reitman's father).
 In addition to testing out dialogue and story structure with one another, the four women say they plan to produce one another's work and would even like to form a production company. Ms. Fox has already signed on to produce Ms. Meriwether's next project, ''Bailout,'' a comedy for Universal about a family dealing with the economic crisis.
 ''There are so few slots for us in Hollywood,'' Ms. Cody said. ''Sometimes you hear the lobsters-in-a-pot metaphor -- if the lobsters cooperated, they could get each other out. We're cooperating. We refuse to just lie there and boil.''
 Ms. Fox (at 32, the closest thing the group has to a den mother) just got her first producing credit for ''Couples Retreat,'' which stars Vince Vaughn. She describes the Fempire this way: ''It's rare to find women who have that balance between work and life, who are really psyched for another woman's success. I love that about our little group.''
 They change out of their work pajamas as the sun goes down and can be found at places like the Village Idiot, Pace and the Chateau Marmont. Their four-way chatter is a thicket of one-liners and retorts that cannot be printed here, touching on boyfriends, dogs, weekend getaways, food, hikes, actors, directors and the endless stream of revision notes from producers.
 Screenwriters usually don't have stylists or publicists, yet the women said they feel pressure to look photogenic in a way that is not demanded of male screenwriters. (One recent evening, each woman had to check the label she was wearing when asked to identify it -- Juicy Couture and Ella Moss were represented.)
 This was never truer than during the hoopla surrounding ''Juno,'' Ms. Cody's story of a pregnant teenager who decides to have her baby and give it up for adoption. The other women lent or bought outfits for Ms. Cody, but that was the least of it.
 ''They supported me through the wildest time in my career,'' Ms. Cody said. ''They helped me be excited for things when I was kind of shellshocked. They were the ones who had to literally take me aside at the 'Juno' premiere and say: 'This is fun. You will never forget this. Please enjoy yourself.' '' 
 The Fempire also watched her back when she found herself, and not her characters, made the center of attention, with a Letterman appearance, a ''Saturday Night Live'' parody -- and a chorus of the previously mentioned haters, their ire sparked by everything from Ms. Cody's looks, dresses and tattoos to her history of stripping and style of writing. 
 ''I flew to New York a couple times to hold Diablo's bag when she was doing press,'' said Ms. Fox, who also held Ms. Scafaria's handbag at the Toronto Film Festival. (This is usually a job relegated to publicists.) ''I love holding my ladies' bags.''
 Ms. Cody may be the best-known of the four, but she shares the spotlight.
 ''I always tell them, 'I may have the awards, but in 20 years, I'm going to be living in one of your guest houses,' '' Ms. Cody said over dinner at Canter's, a deli, before the recent forum for the Writers Guild, where she battled her short blue dress.
 Later, during the forum itself, Ms. Scafaria tried some questions the organizers wanted her to ask Ms. Cody about her ''craft,'' a word that Ms. Scafaria seemed to find hokey. ''I'll do anything for you,'' Ms. Cody told her. ''But you see me working, I'm not going to lie.''
 Ms. Scafaria asked anyway: ''They want to know what's an average workday like for you, so I'm going to ask, what's a non-average workday like for you?''
 Ms. Cody replied, ''I cried four times today.'' 
 Ms. Scafaria said, ''You're very tough, but you're very emotional.''
 Ms. Cody paused, looking out at the crowd, and said, ''We should be drunk for this.''

THE NEWSMartin Brodeur, the goaltender for the New Jersey Devils since 1993, notched the 552nd regular-season victory of his National Hockey League career on Tuesday, breaking the league record. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS After deflecting a shot by Troy Brouwer of the Chicago Blackhawks with three seconds remaining to preserve a 3-2 lead and claim the record, Brodeur cut down one of the nets he defended during the game as a souvenir. The goalie he eclipsed, Patrick Roy, retired in 2003 after 12 seasons with the Montreal Canadiens and 8 with the Colorado Avalanche; Roy still holds the league record for combined regular-season and playoff victories, with 702.
 THE NEWS More babies were born in the United States in 2007 than in any other year in American history, according to new estimates reported on Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The total tiny-nose count topped the previous record, set in 1957 at the height of the post-war baby boom, but the country's fertility rate remains far below what it was 50 years ago, when nearly as many babies were born but there were only about 58 percent as many women in the country. The fertility rate, which drifted downward for decades, ticked up slightly in 2007, in part because more teenagers became pregnant, the center said.
 THE NEWSPresident Obama appeared as a guest on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' on Thursday, the first time a sitting president has done so. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS While Mr. Leno did crack a gentle joke or two at the president's expense during his opening monologue, once Mr. Obama was on the set, the conversation stuck largely to policy matters and small talk. One attempt at self-deprecating humor turned into a gaffe when the president likened his poor bowling scores to the Special Olympics; his press office said sheepishly on Friday that he had meant no offense. Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain both made the talk-show rounds during the election campaign.
 THE NEWS The biennial British International Motor Show has been canceled for 2010, the first time the show, the biggest consumer exhibition in Britain, has been called off in peacetime since it began in 1903. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The shaky state of the auto industry and the broader economy made manufacturers hesitant to commit to the show, which moved to London in 2006 from its longtime home in Birmingham, organizers said. Similar problems caused this year's Brisbane show to be postponed until 2010. But there was little outward sign of distress at the leading European auto event, the Geneva Motor Show, which ended last Sunday.
 THE NEWS The federal budget deficit for the 2009 fiscal year is on pace to reach $1.8 trillion, quadruple the $459 billion record set last year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Relative to the size of the economy, it would be the largest deficit since World War II. The $700 billion Wall Street bailout and a steep drop in expected tax revenue contributed to the calculation. Looking ahead, the budget office estimated that the president's spending proposals would produce $9.3 trillion in deficits over the next decade, compared with the $7 trillion estimated by the White House. The new figures, released Friday, are certain to raise alarms on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Dodd, Facing Opposition, Pushes Back

BYLINE: By MARK PAZNIOKAS. 
E-mail: mpazniokas@comcast.net

DATELINE: FARMINGTON 

 BODY:
 ON a 48-hour swing through Connecticut last weekend, Senator Christopher J. Dodd began acting like a candidate for re-election, staging press events and commandeering a Sunday news show.
 A newly aggressive Mr. Dodd was reacting to a spate of bad press and poor polling, including a Quinnipiac University survey showing him in a statistical tie with Rob Simmons, a former congressman who announced his candidacy last week.
 His delicate political condition brought him to the University of Connecticut Health Center, which obliged his desire for a health care forum by organizing a celebration of President Obama's order lifting federal restrictions on research involving human embryonic stem cells. 
 ''We all could use some good news,'' Dr. Cato T. Laurencin, the dean of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, told a small assembly gathered in a subterranean lobby.
 Especially Mr. Dodd.
 The event here was as much about restoring Mr. Dodd's political health as recognizing the stem cell research under way at UConn and Yale. Dr. Laurencin stood at a lectern that bore the sign ''Science Saving Lives. Senator Chris Dodd.''
 With an approval rating of 46 percent, according to the Quinnipiac poll, the Democratic senator is seen as sufficiently vulnerable for Republicans to actually compete for a chance to oppose him next year, the 30th anniversary of his election to the Senate. 
 Mr. Simmons, a former three-term congressman from Stonington, opened his campaign last Sunday. State Senator Sam S. F. Caligiuri of Waterbury said he expected to follow. Thomas C. Foley of Greenwich, a major Republican fund-raiser who was a development official in Iraq and ambassador to Ireland, was also weighing a run.
 ''I understand it,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''I'm a big boy.''
 Mr. Dodd, who turns 65 in May, has suffered a string of setbacks since ending his presidential campaign on the night of the Iowa caucuses.
 His role as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is putting him center stage in the drama over efforts to bail out Wall Street. Last week, Mr. Dodd was being criticized by Republicans and others for his role in the legislation that allowed federal recovery money to be used for bonuses for A.I.G. employees.
 His involvement in long-ago real estate dealings are back in the news, as is his relationship with Edward R. Downe Jr., a friend and benefactor who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in an insider trading case in the early 1990s. 
 President Clinton granted Mr. Downe a pardon in 2001. Mr. Dodd had written a letter to the president supporting the pardon.
 Together, it all threatens to hobble his 2010 run like an arthritic knee.
 ''His name has been dragged through the mud long enough that his poll numbers have deteriorated to the point where people like Simmons, they're circling,'' said Kenneth Dautrich, a political analyst at the University of Connecticut. ''They smell blood.''
 Mr. Dodd has begun to push back, a welcome change to friends and supporters who have found him oddly passive in recent months. But he said he would not obsess over polls and bad press. 
 ''I can't become preoccupied by it,'' Mr. Dodd said in an interview. ''If you let that become the prism through which you do everything, you lose yourself. You've got to be who you are.''
 Changing the subject might be difficult. At Trinity College in Hartford on March 13, Mr. Dodd staged a press event to highlight his proposal to protect consumers from predatory credit card companies, but reporters asked him about the polls and Mr. Downe.
 Last Sunday, WFSB-TV's ''Face the State'' aired a 30-minute interview in which Mr. Dodd renewed his pledge to seek re-election and addressed two recent columns by Kevin Rennie of The Hartford Courant about the senator's dealings with Mr. Downe.
 After initially declining an interview request, Mr. Dodd had agreed to appear for the entire program, causing the station to postpone an already-taped appearance by Mr. Simmons and Mr. Caligiuri.
 Mr. Dodd said he deplored Mr. Downe's wrongdoing, but he did not apologize for sticking by him as a friend. He also defended his financial dealings with Mr. Downe as falling within Senate ethics rules.
 Mr. Dodd acknowledged in recent interviews that in the mid-1980s he joined Mr. Downe in buying a condominium that became the senator's Washington residence, and that Mr. Downe introduced him to William B. Kessinger, a Kansas City businessman who helped the senator buy a home in Ireland 10 years later.
 Mr. Dodd later bought out both men's interests. 
 The senator said that he was speaking about the Downe matter now because he does not want to repeat the mistake he believes he made last year in failing to aggressively respond to a story about favorable treatment he and his wife received from Countrywide Financial on two refinanced mortgages in 2003.
 ''I think he came across pretty well,'' said Jonathan Pelto, a former state legislator and political director for the Democratic Party. ''It was a real important step in shoring up his base of support.''
 Christopher Healy, the Republican state chairman, said the senator's two purchases of real estate with the assistance of wealthy friends would play poorly with voters.
 Some Republicans said privately that they believed Mr. Dodd would eventually yield the Democratic nomination to Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has an 81 percent approval rating. Mr. Simmons would not say if he would rather face Mr. Dodd or Mr. Blumenthal.
 ''That's really completely out of my control,'' Mr. Simmons said.
 Mr. Caligiuri took a similar position, though he agreed that Republican strategists see Mr. Dodd as the weaker candidate: ''That's the conventional wisdom.''
 Meanwhile, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee welcomed Mr. Simmons to the race by branding him a supporter of George W. Bush, a tactic successfully used against him in his losing House re-election bid in 2006. Mr. Simmons called the effort stale. 
 ''This race is about the future, not the past. This race is about the 21st century, not the 20th century,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''This race is about doing something to stabilize our economy, create jobs and get America back on track again.''
 Mr. Dodd, who has no wish to spend the next year discussing old real estate deals, can only hope that is the case.

HEADLINE: Are We Home Alone?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I ran into an Indian businessman friend last week and he said something to me that really struck a chord: ''This is the first time I've ever visited the United States when I feel like you're acting like an immature democracy.'' 
 You know what he meant: We're in a once-a-century financial crisis, and yet we've actually descended into politics worse than usual. There don't seem to be any adults at the top -- nobody acting larger than the moment, nobody being impelled by anything deeper than the last news cycle. Instead, Congress is slapping together punitive tax laws overnight like some Banana Republic, our president is getting in trouble cracking jokes on Jay Leno comparing his bowling skills to a Special Olympian, and the opposition party is behaving as if its only priority is to deflate President Obama's popularity. 
 I saw Eric Cantor, a Republican House leader, on CNBC the other day, and the entire interview consisted of him trying to exploit the A.I.G. situation for partisan gain without one constructive thought. I just kept staring at him and thinking: ''Do you not have kids? Do you not have a pension that you're worried about? Do you live in some gated community where all the banks will be O.K., even if our biggest banks go under? Do you think your party automatically wins if the country loses? What are you thinking?'' 
 If you want to guarantee that America becomes a mediocre nation, then just keep vilifying every public figure struggling to find a way out of this crisis who stumbles once -- like Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner or A.I.G.'s $1-a-year fill-in C.E.O., Ed Liddy -- and you'll ensure that no capable person enlists in government. You will ensure that every bank that has taken public money will try to get rid of it as fast it can, so as not to come under scrutiny, even though that would weaken their balance sheets and make them less able to lend money. And you will ensure that we'll never get out of this banking crisis, because the solution depends on getting private money funds to team up with the government to buy up toxic assets -- and fund managers are growing terrified of any collaboration with government.
 President Obama missed a huge teaching opportunity with A.I.G. Those bonuses were an outrage. The public's anger was justified. But rather than fanning those flames and letting Congress run riot, the president should have said: ''I'll handle this.''
 He should have gone on national TV and had the fireside chat with the country that is long overdue. That's a talk where he lays out exactly how deep the crisis we are in is, exactly how much sacrifice we're all going to have to make to get out of it, and then calls on those A.I.G. brokers -- and everyone else who, in our rush to heal our banking system, may have gotten bonuses they did not deserve -- and tells them that their president is asking them to return their bonuses ''for the sake of the country.'' 
 Had Mr. Obama given A.I.G.'s American brokers a reputation to live up to, a great national mission to join, I'd bet anything we'd have gotten most of our money back voluntarily. Inspiring conduct has so much more of an impact than coercing it. And it would have elevated the president to where he belongs -- above the angry gaggle in Congress.
 ''There is nothing more powerful than inspirational leadership that unleashes principled behavior for a great cause,'' said Dov Seidman, the C.E.O. of LRN, which helps companies build ethical cultures, and the author of the book ''How.'' What makes a company or a government ''sustainable,'' he added, is not when it adds more coercive rules and regulations to control behaviors. ''It is when its employees or citizens are propelled by values and principles to do the right things, no matter how difficult the situation,'' said Seidman. ''Laws tell you what you can do. Values inspire in you what you should do. It's a leader's job to inspire in us those values.''
 Right now we have an absence of inspirational leadership. From business we hear about institutions too big to fail -- no matter how reckless. From bankers we hear about contracts too sacred to break -- no matter how inappropriate. And from our immature elected officials we hear about how it was all ''the other guy's fault.'' I've never talked to more people in one week who told me, ''You know, I listen to the news, and I get really depressed.''
 Well, help may finally be on the way: one reason we've been sidetracked talking about bonuses is because the big issue -- the real issue -- the president's comprehensive plan to remove the toxic assets from our ailing banks, which is the key to our economic recovery, has taken a long time to hammer out. So all kinds of lesser issues and clowns have ballooned in importance and only confused people in the vacuum. Hopefully, that plan will be out by Monday, and hopefully the president will pull the country together behind it, and hopefully the lawmakers who have to approve it will remember that this is not a time for politics as usual -- and that our country, alas, is not too big to fail. Hopefully ...

HEADLINE: Is a Food Revolution Now in Season?

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif. 

 BODY:
 AS tens of thousands of people recently strolled among booths of the nation's largest organic and natural foods show here, munching on fair-trade chocolate and sipping organic wine, a few dozen pioneers of the industry sneaked off to an out-of-the-way conference room.
 Although unit sales of organic food have leveled off and even declined lately, versus a year earlier, the mood among those crowded into the conference room was upbeat as they awaited a private screening of a documentary called ''Food Inc.'' -- a withering critique of agribusiness and industrially produced food.
 They also gathered to relish their changing political fortunes, courtesy of the Obama administration. 
 ''This has never been just about business,'' said Gary Hirshberg, chief executive of Stonyfield Farm, the maker of organic yogurt. ''We are here to change the world. We dreamt for decades of having this moment.''
 After being largely ignored for years by Washington, advocates of organic and locally grown food have found a receptive ear in the White House, which has vowed to encourage a more nutritious and sustainable food supply.
 The most vocal booster so far has been the first lady, Michelle Obama, who has emphasized the need for fresh, unprocessed, locally grown food and, last week, started work on a White House vegetable garden. More surprising, perhaps, are the pronouncements out of the Department of Agriculture, an agency with long and close ties to agribusiness.
 In mid-February, Tom Vilsack, the new secretary of agriculture, took a jackhammer to a patch of pavement outside his headquarters to create his own organic ''people's garden.'' Two weeks later, the Obama administration named Kathleen Merrigan, an assistant professor at Tufts University and a longtime champion of sustainable agriculture and healthy food, as Mr. Vilsack's top deputy.
 Mr. Hirshberg and other sustainable-food activists are hoping that such actions are precursors to major changes in the way the federal government oversees the nation's food supply and farms, changes that could significantly bolster demand for fresh, local and organic products. Already, they have offered plenty of ambitious ideas.
 For instance, the celebrity chef Alice Waters recommends that the federal government triple its budget for school lunches to provide youngsters with healthier food. And the author Michael Pollan has called on President Obama to pursue a ''reform of the entire food system'' by focusing on a Pollan priority: diversified, regional food networks.
 Still, some activists worry that their dreams of a less-processed American diet may soon collide with the realities of Washington and the financial gloom over much of the country. Even the Bush administration, reviled by many food activists, came to Washington intent on reforming farm subsidies, only to be slapped down by Congress.
 Mr. Pollan, who contributes to The New York Times Magazine, likens sustainable-food activists to the environmental movement in the 1970s. Though encouraged by the Obama administration's positions, he worries that food activists may lack political savvy.
 ''The movement is not ready for prime time,'' he says. ''It's not like we have an infrastructure with legislation ready to go.''
 Even so, many activists say they are packing their bags and heading to Washington. They are bringing along a copy of ''Food Inc.,'' which includes attacks on the corn lobby and Monsanto, and intend to provide a private screening for Mr. Vilsack and Ms. Merrigan.
 ''We are so used to being outside the door,'' says Walter Robb, co-president and chief operating officer of Whole Foods Market, the grocery chain that played a crucial role in making organic and natural food more mainstream. ''We are in the door now.''
 AT the heart of the sustainable-food movement is a belief that America has become efficient at producing cheap, abundant food that profits corporations and agribusiness, but is unhealthy and bad for the environment.
 The federal government is culpable, the activists say, because it pays farmers billions in subsidies each year for growing grains and soybeans. A result is an abundance of corn and soybeans that provide cheap feed for livestock and inexpensive food ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup.
 They argue that farm policy -- and federal dollars -- should instead encourage farmers to grow more diverse crops, reward conservation practices and promote local food networks that rely less on fossil fuels for such things as fertilizer and transportation.
 Last year, mandatory spending on farm subsidies was $7.5 billion, compared with $15 million for programs for organic and local foods, according to the House Appropriations Committee.
 But advocates of conventional agriculture argue that organic farming simply can't provide enough food because the yields tend to be lower than those for crops grown with chemical fertilizer. 
 ''We think there's a place for organic, but don't think we can feed ourselves and the world with organic,'' says Rick Tolman, chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association. ''It's not as productive, more labor-intensive and tends to be more expensive.''
 The ideas are hardly new. The farmland philosopher and author Wendell Berry has been making many of the same points for decades. What is new is that the sustainable-food movement has gained both commercial heft, with the rapid success of organic and natural foods in the last decade, and celebrity cachet, with a growing cast of chefs, authors and even celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Gwyneth Paltrow who champion the cause.
 It has also been aided by more awareness of the obesity epidemic, particularly among children, and by concerns about food safety amid seemingly continual outbreaks of tainted supplies.
 While their arguments haven't gained much traction in Washington, sustainable-food activists and entrepreneurs have convinced more Americans to watch what they eat.
 They have encouraged the growth of farmers' markets and created such a demand for organic, natural and local products that they are now sold at many major grocers, including Wal-Mart.
 ''Increasingly, companies are looking to reduce the amount of additives,'' says Ted Smyth, who retired earlier this year as senior vice president at H. J. Heinz, the food giant. ''Consumers are looking for more authentic foods. This trend absolutely has percolated through into mainstream foods.''
 While the idea of sustainable food is creeping into the mainstream, the epicenter of the movement remains the liberal stronghold of Berkeley, Calif.
 It was there in 1971 that Ms. Waters started a restaurant, Chez Panisse, that used fresh, organic and locally grown products, a novelty at the time that has been widely copied by other chefs. In the years since, she has become a food celebrity, the ''mother of slow food,'' as a ''60 Minutes'' profile called her.
 Mr. Pollan teaches journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and is among a group of authors who have tapped into a wide audience for books that encourage local or organic foods while detailing what they view as health and environmental risks of processed foods and large-scale agriculture.
 His book ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' has remained on best-seller lists since it was published in 2006. Another activist, Eric Schlosser, wrote ''Fast Food Nation,'' a critical look at industrialized fast food that was published in 2001 and is now required reading at some colleges. And Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, has become a ubiquitous and widely quoted critic of commercial food manufacturers.
 Beyond authors, academics and chefs, the sustainable-food movement also owes much of its current success to pioneers in the organic and natural foods industry. Many started their businesses for idealistic reasons and have since turned their start-ups into multimillion-dollar, even billion-dollar, corporations.
 Manufacturers improved their organic and natural products, long confined to musty natural-food stores, so they could compete with conventional foods on packaging and taste. Whole Foods Market also lured more mainstream customers by redefining what a grocery store should look like, creating lush displays of produce and fish that have influenced more traditional grocers.
 Nancy M. Childs, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's University, said sustainable food activists forced the broader public to focus on the quality and sourcing of food, which in turn has prompted demand for farmers' markets and local produce. She says that ''continual attention in the news'' also gave the movement legs.
 But Ms. Childs worries that some of the activists' recommendations for buying fresh, local or organic food cannot be adopted by many Americans because those foods may be too expensive. ''By singling out certain lifestyles and foods, it's diminishing very good quality nutrition sources,'' she says. ''Frozen goods, canned goods, they are not bad things. What's important is that people eat well, within their means.''
 ''We'd all love to live on a farm in Vermont, right?'' she adds.
 Even Jeffrey Hollender, the president of the green cleaning-products company Seventh Generation, worries that some of his movement's messages are a tough sell when consumers are stretched thin. 
 Although some people argue that there are hidden costs to cheap food, from environmental damage caused by factory farms and fertilizer runoff to the health costs associated with eating highly processed, calorie-laden food, the fact remains that commercially produced food is relatively inexpensive.
 ''The idea of the true cost of food?'' Mr. Hollender asks. ''That's the last thing consumers want to hear right now.''
 The sustainable-food crowd isn't alone in its love fest with the Obama administration and Mr. Vilsack. Food-safety activists have praised Mr. Vilsack's remarks about creating a single food-safety agency, and nutrition advocates are enthused about his comments on school lunches and health care reform.
 ''There are tremendous opportunities with health care reform,'' says Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ''Cutting sodium consumption in half should save over 100,000 lives a year.'' 
 THERE is little in Tom Vilsack's resume to suggest that he would one day be lionized by America's food glitterati.
 A native of Pittsburgh, he became a small-town mayor and lawyer in Iowa, where he represented struggling farmers during the farm crisis in the 1980s. As a state senator and later as governor of Iowa, Mr. Vilsack promoted ethanol production and agricultural biotech, leading one consumer group to label him a ''shill'' for Monsanto.
 When a coalition of food activists and farmers, Food Democracy Now, circulated a petition urging President Obama to pick an agriculture secretary committed to sustainability, Mr. Vilsack was not one of its recommended candidates.
 Mr. Vilsack said that he was a chubby child and maintains a deep affection for cookies. But something has changed in Mr. Vilsack, an avid runner, including his eating habits. ''I'm much more inclined to eat fresh fruits and vegetables,'' he says. ''I had organic yogurt for breakfast. Trust me, I would have not have had that two years ago, or four years ago.''
 He was motivated to eat healthier because he is expecting his first grandchild and regrets that his parents did not live to meet his own children.
 Mr. Vilsack's brief tenure at the agriculture department has unnerved the food lobby and cheered sustainable-food activists, who are in agreement with many of his stated priorities.
 He has said he hopes to devote more resources to child nutrition to improve the quality of school breakfasts and lunches. He also wants to make sure that only healthy choices are available in school vending machines.
 Noting that the department's recently released Census of Agriculture included more than 100,000 new small farmers, he said he wanted his agency to help them develop regional distribution networks. The small farms' produce could be sold to institutional buyers like schools.
 Ultimately, he said, agriculture and food policy should fit into the Obama administration's planned overhaul of health care, by encouraging nutrition to prevent disease. It should also be part of the effort to combat climate change, by encouraging renewable energy and conservation on farms, he said.
 Of course, Mr. Vilsack will need the approval of Congress for any major changes in farm policy, and therein lies his greatest challenge. Congress passed a farm bill last year that details farm policy for the next five years, and farm-state legislators say they are not interested in starting over.
 When the Obama administration recently proposed a budget that would cut subsidies to the nation's largest farmers and bolster child nutrition payments, it was greeted with hostility in Congress, even by some Democrats.
 It didn't help that Mr. Vilsack framed the budget as a choice between helping 90,000 farmers or 30 million children, a statement that he later characterized as inartful.
 Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma and the ranking minority member of the House Agriculture Committee, said in a statement that ''this proposal is ill-timed, ill-conceived and completely out of touch with the realities of agriculture production.'' 
 FOR all the enthusiasm that sustainable-food activists and celebrities have for the Obama administration, their sudden interest in Washington has already ruffled feathers.
 Ms. Waters wrote a letter to the Obamas in January suggesting that she convene a ''kitchen cabinet'' to pick a suitable chef for the White House, ''a person with integrity and devotion to the ideals of environmentalism, health and conservation.'' Her letter touched off withering criticism in the blogosphere, with one food pundit blasting what he called Ms. Waters's ''inflexible brand of gastronomical correctness.''
 The Obamas stuck with the existing chef, who it turns out was already an ardent -- though quiet -- proponent of locally grown food.
 In addition, some sustainable-farm advocates who have worked on these issues for decades in Washington are chafing at the idea of celebrity activists swooping into town.
 Ferd Hoefner, policy director of the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, says that during the Carter administration he fought to get $5 million in federal money to promote farmers' markets (about the same as allocated last year).
 While he acknowledges that it has been an uphill fight, Mr. Hoefner said the activists had made major strides in recent years, winning more federal dollars for organic research and to help farmers convert to organic methods and add value to their operations by, for example, converting to grass-fed beef. As part of the economic stimulus plan, the Agriculture Department also plans to award $250 million in loan guarantees, spread over the next two years, for local and regional food networks, he said. 
 Mr. Hoefner said he was impressed by the number of people who rallied for a White House garden. ''We just want to make sure that interest in that symbolic action can be channeled into some of the more difficult policy challenges,'' he said. 
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, welcomes newcomers to the cause but cautions that farm policy ''does not have sharp turns.''
 Mr. Harkin has spent years trying to increase federal dollars for child nutrition and for conservation programs that reward farmers for protecting the environment, relatively small programs that he says can expand under the Obama administration.
 ''We bend the track a little bit and get the train going in a little bit different direction,'' he says. ''We're hoping we can bend it a little bit more. Consumers are demanding it.'' 
 There are already signs that the sustainable-agriculture track is bending farther than before. The conservative pundit George F. Will wrote a column endorsing many of Mr. Pollan's ideas, and a prominent food industry lobbyist who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to reporters said he was amazed at how many members of Congress were carrying copies of ''The Omnivore's Dilemma.'' 
 ''I'm not sure how much it's penetrating the mom shopping at Food Lion,'' he says. ''I've had so many members mention Michael's name to me, it's staggering.'' 
 Back in Anaheim, Mr. Hirshberg, the head of Stonyfield Farm, said he, too, is optimistic that change is at hand. But he reminded the small crowd that the organic industry remains a ''rounding error,'' roughly 3 percent, of the overall food and beverage business.
 ''We're at the starting line,'' he says. ''This is our job, our government. We've got to take it back.''

HEADLINE: Ballots Look Familiar? That's Not An Accident

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
A decade ago, Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire and a lifelong Democrat, was weighing a bid for mayor as a Republican. Mark Green, a Democratic stalwart, was angling for another citywide run, based on his record as an outspoken public advocate. And Republicans were optimistic about winning statewide offices, thanks to scrappy politicians like Rick A. Lazio and Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 How times have not changed. 
 Close your eyes, and you might think that the elections of 2009 and 2010 in New York are simply reruns of the 1990s, given the number of familiar names who have returned or reportedly are thinking about coming back.
 There are politicians who, after a defeat, vanished from electoral politics for years but are now itching for a return engagement. Come on down, Mr. Green and Mr. Lazio!
 There are politicians who have been mentioned as possible returnees, perhaps out of nostalgia as much as anything else. That means you, former Gov. George E. Pataki. (Some Republicans are urging him to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand next year.)
 There are also politicians who are bolstering someone else's candidacy, even if they themselves are not seeking another run. Not yet, anyway. So get ready for another election season with the former one-term mayor David N. Dinkins and the onetime mayoral runner-up Fernando Ferrer, who, in separate announcements, recently became co-chairmen of Councilman David I. Weprin's campaign for city comptroller.
 ''There's a certain 'Back to the Future' element to all of this,'' said George Arzt, a veteran political consultant.
 It has always been hard for new candidates to break into New York politics, given its sometimes clubby nature and the high cost of television advertising, said Joseph Mercurio, another longtime political consultant. But this year has been especially difficult, in part because of Mr. Bloomberg's successful effort to extend term limits to 12 years from 8.
 Given the powers of incumbency and the scarcity of open seats, only those with either a lot of money or a lot of experience can compete. That favors politicians from elections past.
 ''In politics, name identification is golden, and tough to achieve,'' said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ''Once you have it, it is currency you can spend in future elections. People will remember the name long after they know why they remember the name.''
 The recession is also conspiring against change, at least in local matchups, said Robert Y. Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia University. That is because people are less inclined to test something new, whether a product or a politician, and more deferential to tried-and-true brands like a Bloomberg or a Rudy.
 ''In this day and age of uncertainty, it's good to have someone you can trust,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, an avid supporter of Mr. Bloomberg. ''It's deja vu all over again.'' 
 No wonder, then, that Mr. Green, who was public advocate from 1994 to 2001, was immediately anointed the front-runner last month when he declared his candidacy to reclaim his old job.
 It did not matter that he announced his candidacy relatively late in the election cycle. It did not matter that he had no money, compared with two of his challengers, Councilman Eric N. Gioia (who has collected more than $2.3 million) or Councilman Bill de Blasio ($943,000). Nor did it matter that he lost the 2001 mayor's race, and declared after losing the 2006 primary for attorney general that he was through with electoral politics.
 ''Plus ca change,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ''Once the bug bites any of them, it's a very rare guy or woman who can walk away.''
 At least two City Council members who were forced out of office in 2001 because of term limits are back for another shot at their old seats: Karen Koslowitz, of Queens, and Stephen DiBrienza, of Brooklyn. And another member of the term-limited class of 2001 could join them later: Julia Harrison, who is eyeing her old seat in Queens, now held by Councilman John C. Liu, who is running for comptroller.
 On the state level, the Republican Party has been searching for big-name former officials to run against two Democrats who they believe are vulnerable next year: Gov. David A. Paterson and Ms. Gillibrand.
 Enter Mr. Lazio, a former congressman from Long Island who lost to Hillary Rodham Clinton in a bruising Senate race in 2000. He has since largely retreated from public view, working at JPMorgan Chase as a lobbyist and a managing director of the asset management group.
 But he re-emerged in January, at least in news reports, when he was widely said to be considering a run for governor in 2010.
 Mr. Giuliani has not exactly withdrawn quietly since leaving City Hall in 2001. But should he run for governor in 2010, he would no doubt prefer to talk about his record as mayor in the 1990s, not his disastrous bid for president in 2008.
 Mr. Pataki, meanwhile, has kept a low profile since finishing a third term in Albany in 2006. 
 All of these names are enough to make Mr. Koch joke about someone else who might join the fray, too. ''I've still got a few months to decide,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Worries Voiced Over Economy

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The global economy is on pace to shrink by 1 percent to 2 percent this year, the head of the World Bank said Saturday. 
 Speaking at the Brussels Forum on geopolitical problems, the bank's president, Robert B. Zoellick, said that 2009 would be a ''dangerous year'' as the global economy wrestles with its first recession in more than 60 years.
 ''We haven't seen a figure like that globally since World War II, which really means since the Great Depression,'' he said.
 Global trade is set to slide the most in 80 years as demand dries up, with East Asia being the hardest-hit region. The World Bank has forecast a 2.1 percent decline in global exports this year, which would be the first such drop since 1982.
 Mr. Zoellick's remarks came less than two weeks before heads of state from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing economies are to gather in London to discuss a coordinated response to the economic slump. Mr. Zoellick urged G-20 leaders to use the meeting on April 2 to create a review process to determine whether further stimulus measures are needed.
 ''There is a legitimate debate about how the stimulus will be used,'' he said at the forum. 
 The European Union economy will shrink 3.2 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday, cutting a January forecast of a 2 percent contraction. Japan's economy is forecast to shrink by 5.8 percent, according to the fund, while the United States is seen contracting 2.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Pension Cuts Rise; So Do Concerns

BYLINE: By DUNSTAN A. MCNICHOL

DATELINE: Trenton 

 BODY:
 REDUCING contributions to New Jersey's $56 billion public pension system is central to Gov. Jon S. Corzine's budget-trimming strategy in these recessionary times, but some legislators and others say they fear for the system's ability to cover its growing retirement obligations to teachers and public employees. 
 ''The day of reckoning is coming,'' said State Senator Bill Baroni, Republican of Mercer County, whose district includes more public employees than other lawmakers'. ''They're doing all they can to hurt the pension system.''
 In the last few weeks, Mr. Corzine has proposed withholding about $1.5 billion in state payments into the pension accounts, lawmakers have approved a plan to let local governments defer millions more in scheduled pension support and the state has ordered a study of the very structure of the retirement system. 
 ''It's a systemic attack on the pension system by wizards who are supposed to know better,'' Mr. Baroni said.
 Mr. Corzine said he could not justify spending billions on long-term retirement commitments when the state is scrambling to find money for schools, property tax relief and other priorities.
 ''About one hour's movement in the stock market is more than any of these changes,'' he said about the declining state support for the pension system. ''I would hope we would make a first priority of getting back to putting these dollars in the pension system when the revenues allow.''
 In a typical month, the pension funds pay out $300 million to $400 million more than they take in through contributions from employees and employers, William G. Clark, director of the state's Division of Investments, told the funds' oversight board recently.
 The State Investment Council, which monitors the pension funds, is so concerned that on Thursday its members took the unusual step of voting to send a delegation to lobby Mr. Corzine and legislators for better funding of the pensions.
 Mr. Corzine included about $3 billion in pension contributions in his first three state budgets. But this year, as the economy soured and tax revenues plunged, he cut his proposed payment by $784 million, opting to pay only $500 million into the system this June, said Tom Vincz, a Treasury Department spokesman.
 For the fiscal year that begins July 1, Mr. Corzine has proposed a smaller contribution of $400 million, Mr. Vincz said.
 On Monday, lawmakers narrowly approved a measure that would let local governments defer up to half the $1.2 billion they are scheduled to pay into the pension accounts next month.
 The measure passed without a single Republican yes vote. 
 ''It doesn't make sense for us to continue to dig the hole that is clearly so deep we don't know how we're going to get out,'' said Senator Jennifer Beck, a Monmouth County Republican.

HEADLINE: Has a 'Katrina Moment' Arrived?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
A CHARMING visit with Jay Leno won't fix it. A 90 percent tax on bankers' bonuses won't fix it. Firing Timothy Geithner won't fix it. Unless and until Barack Obama addresses the full depth of Americans' anger with his full arsenal of policy smarts and political gifts, his presidency and, worse, our economy will be paralyzed. It would be foolish to dismiss as hyperbole the stark warning delivered by Paulette Altmaier of Cupertino, Calif., in a letter to the editor published by The Times last week: ''President Obama may not realize it yet, but his Katrina moment has arrived.'' 
 Six weeks ago I wrote in this space that the country's surge of populist rage could devour the president's best-laid plans, including the essential Act II of the bank rescue, if he didn't get in front of it. The occasion then was the Tom Daschle firestorm. The White House seemed utterly blindsided by the public's revulsion at the moneyedinsiders' culture illuminated by Daschle's post-Senate career. Yet last week's events suggest that the administration learned nothing from that brush with disaster. 
 Otherwise it never would have used Lawrence Summers, the chief economic adviser, as a messenger just as the A.I.G. rage was reaching a full boil last weekend. Summers is so tone-deaf that he makes Geithner seem like Bobby Kennedy. 
 Bob Schieffer of CBS asked Summers the simple question that has haunted the American public since the bailouts began last fall: ''Do you know, Dr. Summers, what the banks have done with all of this money that has been funneled to them through these bailouts?'' What followed was a monologue of evasion that, translated into English, amounted to: Not really, but you little folk needn't worry about it. 
 Yet even as Summers spoke, A.I.G. was belatedly confirming what he would not. It has, in essence, been laundering its $170 billion in taxpayers' money by paying off its reckless partners in gambling and greed, from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup on Wall Street to Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank abroad. 
 Summers was even more highhanded in addressing the ''retention bonuses'' handed to the very employees who brokered all those bad bets. After reciting the requisite outrage talking point, he delivered a patronizing lecture to viewers of ABC's ''This Week'' on how our ''tradition of upholding law'' made it impossible to abrogate the bonus agreements. It never occurred to Summers that Americans might know that contracts are renegotiated all the time -- most conspicuously of late by the United Automobile Workers, which consented to givebacks as its contribution to the Detroit bailout plan. Nor did he note, for all his supposed reverence for the law, that the A.I.G. unit being rewarded with these bonuses is now under legal investigation by Britishand American authorities.
 Within 24 hours, Summers's stand was discarded by Obama, who tardily (and impotently) vowed to ''pursue every single legal avenue'' to block the bonuses. The question is not just why the White House was the last to learn about bonuses that Democratic congressmen had sought hearings about back in December, but why it was so slow to realize that the public's anger couldn't be sated by Summers's legalese or by constant reiteration of the word outrage. By the time Obama acted, even the G.O.P. leader Mitch McConnell was ahead of him in full (if hypocritical) fulmination.
 David Axelrod tried to rationalize the lagging response when he told The Washington Post last week that ''people are not sitting around their kitchen tables thinking about A.I.G.,'' but are instead ''thinking about their own jobs.'' While that's technically true, it misses the point. Of course most Americans don't know how A.I.G. brought the world's financial system to near-ruin or what credit-default swaps are. They may not even know what A.I.G. stands for. But Americans do make the connection between their fears about their own jobs and their broad understanding of the A.I.G. debacle. 
 They know that the corporate bosses who may yet lay them off have sometimes been as obscenely overcompensated for failure as Wall Street's bonus babies. As The Wall Street Journal reported last week, chief executives at businesses as diverse as Texas Instruments and the home builder Hovnanian Enterprises have received millions in bonuses even as their companies' shares have lost more than half their value.
 Since Americans get the big picture of this inequitable system, that grotesque reality dwarfs any fine print. That's why it doesn't matter that the disputed bonuses at A.I.G. amount to less than one-tenth of one percent of its bailout. Or that CNBC -- with 300,000 viewers on a typical day by Nielsen's measure -- is a relatively minor player in the crash. Or that Edward Liddy had nothing to do with A.I.G.'s collapse, or that John Thain, of the celebrated trash can, arrived after, not before, others wrecked Merrill Lynch. 
 These prominent players are just the handiest camera-ready triggers for the larger rage. Passions are now so hot that even Bernie Madoff's crimes began to pale as we turned our attention to A.I.G.'s misdeeds, just as A.I.G. will fade when the next malefactor surfaces.
 What made Jon Stewart's takedown of Jim Cramer resonate was less his specific brief against CNBC's cheerleading for bad stocks than his larger indictment of the gaping economic inequality that defined the bubble. As Stewart said, there were ''two markets'' -- the long-term market that Americans earnestly thought would sustain their 401(k)'s, and the fast-moving, short-term ''real market'' in the back room where high-rolling insiders wagered ''giant piles of money'' and brought down everyone with them. 
 No one is more commanding on this subject than our president. In his town-hall meeting in Costa Mesa, Calif., on Wednesday, he described the A.I.G. bonuses as merely a symptom of ''a culture where people made enormous sums of money taking irresponsible risks that have now put the entire economy at risk.'' But rhetoric won't tamp down the anger out there, and neither will calculated displays of presidential ''outrage.'' We must have governance to match the message.
 To get ahead of the anger, Obama must do what he has repeatedly promised but not always done: make everything about his economic policies transparent and hold every player accountable. His administration must start actually answering the questions that officials like Geithner and Summers routinely duck. 
 Inquiring Americans have the right to know why it took six months for us to learn (some of) what A.I.G. did with our money. We need to understand why some of that money was used to bail out foreign banks. And why Goldman, which declared that its potential losses with A.I.G. were ''immaterial,'' nonetheless got the largest-known A.I.G. handout of taxpayers' cash ($12.9 billion) while also receiving a TARP bailout. We need to be told why retention bonuses went to some 50 bankers who not only were in the toxic A.I.G. unit but who left despite the ''retention'' jackpots. We must be told why taxpayers have so little control of the bailed-out financial institutions that we now own some or most of. And where are the M.R.I.'s from those ''stress tests'' the Treasury Department is giving those banks?
 That's just a short list. In general, it's hard to imagine taxpayers shelling out billions for a second bank bailout unless there's a full accounting of every dime of the first, and true transparency for the new plan whose rollout is becoming the most attenuated striptease since the heyday of Gypsy Rose Lee.
 Another compelling question connects all of the above: why has there been so little transparency and so much evasiveness so far? The answer, I fear, is that too many of the administration's officials are too marinated in the insiders' culture to police it, reform it or own up to their own past complicity with it. 
 The ''dirty little secret,'' Obama told Leno on Thursday, is that ''most of the stuff that got us into trouble was perfectly legal.'' An even dirtier secret is that a prime mover in keeping that stuff legal was Summers, who helped torpedo the regulation of derivatives while in the Clinton administration. His mentor Robert Rubin, no less, wrote in his 2003 memoir that Summers underestimated how the risk of derivatives might multiply ''under extraordinary circumstances.''
 Given that Summers worked for a secretive hedge fund, D. E. Shaw, after he was pushed out of Harvard's presidency at the bubble's height, you have to wonder how he can now sell the administration's plan for buying up toxic assets with the help of hedge funds. It will look like another giveaway to his own insiders' club. As for Geithner, people might take him more seriously if he gave a credible account of why, while at the New York Fed, he and the Goldman alumnus Hank Paulson let Lehman Brothers fail but saved the Goldman-trading ally A.I.G.
 As the nation's anger rose last week, the president took responsibility for what's happening on his watch -- more than he needed to, given the disaster he inherited. But in the credit mess, action must match words. To fall short would be to deliver us into the catastrophic hands of a Republican opposition whose only known economic program is to reject job-creating stimulus spending and root for Obama and, by extension, the country to fail. With all due deference to Ponzi schemers from Madoff to A.I.G., this would be the biggest outrage of them all.

HEADLINE: Stopping 'Stop-Loss'

 BODY:
The men and women who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan have made many sacrifices over the last seven years, including repeated and extended combat deployments. So it is very good news that Defense Secretary Robert Gates has decided to phase out the deeply unpopular stop-loss program, which forces soldiers to remain in the military after their enlistments end. 
 An estimated 120,000 troops have been affected since 2001, including 13,000 who are still prevented from exiting the service. It is hard to argue with critics who deride the program as a back-door draft. But then, the all-volunteer military was never designed to be abused as it was during the Bush administration: indefinitely deployed and in permanent crisis mode. 
 Mr. Gates seemed appropriately contrite when he told reporters that holding so many soldiers against their will was ''breaking faith.'' He was right.
 The program was used during the 1991 gulf war and several other conflicts. But it became a serious burden on soldiers when President Bush launched the so-called surge in Iraq. For too long Mr. Bush -- who despite all evidence thought he could make quick work of Afghanistan and Iraq -- resisted calls to expand the active-duty Army. He finally agreed under pressure from Congress and the military.
 The Army has already added some 60,000 troops -- it is now at 547,000 -- making it possible to wind down the stop-loss program. President Obama's decision to withdraw forces from Iraq more quickly than they are being increased in Afghanistan also allows for more flexibility. And then there is one of the few silver linings of the economic collapse: it has helped the military draw in more new recruits and retain officers. 
 The stop-loss program is not being eliminated entirely. Mr. Gates predicted that a much reduced number of soldiers -- scores rather than thousands -- would still be kept on after their enlistments were over. And any soldier in the program as of last October will get paid an extra $500 a month. 
 We hope that the Pentagon makes good on this commitment to use the stop-loss program sparingly -- only when a service member has a unique, needed skill or is part of a unit with a special mission. The best way to address the problem is for Mr. Obama and Congress to continue funding an expanded Army and Marine Corps and to resist waging unnecessary wars like the one in Iraq.
 Still, Mr. Gates's decision is a sign that the administration recognizes the intolerable stresses placed on the overstretched military -- and the men and women who are its core -- and is committed to finding relief.

HEADLINE: A Diverse Set of Voices Struggles to Be Heard on School Control

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Zakiyah Ansari sat in the back row of the auditorium at New York City College of Technology with a dog-eared sign reading ''Don't Believe the Hype!''
 For the fifth time in seven weeks, Ms. Ansari had spent a long day at a public hearing of the State Assembly's Education Committee on whether to renew the 2002 law that gives New York City's mayor control over its schools and expires on June 30. She had grown accustomed to the vending-machine lunches, the long slogs to unfamiliar corners of the city and hours upon hours of quarreling between lawmakers and bureaucrats from the City Department of Education.
 And she was hardly alone. Several hundred people turned out for the final hearing on Friday in Downtown Brooklyn, many waking early to car-pool or ride the bus with their friends and stake out seats. 
 Each hearing followed a familiar routine, taking on the aura of a trial with lawmakers as the chief prosecutors. Each morning around 10 a.m., a familiar set of players filled the seats: education policy devotees, advocates for teachers and, in large numbers, parents affiliated with organizations that either feverishly oppose or passionately support the idea of centralized power. Often they stayed until after dark.
 Ms. Ansari, a mother of eight (four currently in public schools), is part of a group called the Campaign for Better Schools, which has suggested major changes to the system of mayoral control. When an Assembly member asked Department of Education officials for graduation rates for black and Hispanic students on Friday, she shook her head as education officials seemed unable to find the numbers.
 ''How do you forget that?'' Ms. Ansari said quietly. Then she held up a report by her group containing the bleak numbers and proclaimed, ''I have them!'' 
 City officials ultimately found the data, showing a gap of as much as 26 percentage points between white students and black and Hispanic students.
 ''That does not show racial progress,'' Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries said. ''That is an embarrassing number.''
 On the other side, members of the East Brooklyn Congregations, rallied in the early-morning snow, moving into the auditorium to cheer and stomp their feet as their minister testified in support of the mayor.
 At one point, the group gathered in the hallway to pray. ''We ask you, God, that our children be kept first,'' said the minister, the Rev. David K. Brawley. 
 Enrique Diaz, 17, a member of the group, had not heard of mayoral control before Thursday. But when his economics teacher at Bushwick Leaders' High School for Academic Excellence explained the concept, he decided to attend the hearing.
 He said he supported keeping mayoral control of the school system. ''Education should be our first priority,'' he said. ''I think if control stays in the city, they can provide more services to the children.'' 
 Earlier in the day, William C. Thompson Jr., the city's comptroller and a candidate for mayor, outlined a detailed position on the city's education system for the first time, to cheers from critics of the mayor in the audience. 
 At the center of Mr. Thompson's proposals were significant changes to the Panel for Educational Policy, the 13-member body that replaced the old Board of Education; critics say it has turned into something of a rubber-stamp board for the mayor's policies.
 Mr. Thompson proposed creating a 19-member advisory board of teachers, parents, business leaders and administrators that would nominate three people for each of nine seats and allow the mayor to choose among them. Currently, he appoints 8 of the 13 panel members on his own.
 Mr. Thompson also echoed critics of mayoral control in calling for more channels for parental participation, an independent body to audit data and more power for local education councils.
 ''The current administration has sought to avoid debate and public scrutiny,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''while fundamental decisions regarding education reform have been made by executives with very little education background.''
 As the day progressed, city officials sparred with lawmakers over test scores, class size, test preparation and no-bid contracts. Parents booed, hissed and applauded, flashing signs and passing out pamphlets.
 Two of the heavyweight parent groups at the hearings were the Campaign for Better Schools and Learn NY, a nonprofit organization that supports mayoral control. Both organizations estimated that they had recruited hundreds of parents to attend the hearings.
 Some parents -- and children -- had negotiated days off from work and school to attend. A group of older women knitted as officials droned on about national test scores and contract procurement.
 Laura Acosta, an organizer for Learn NY who does not have children in public schools, said that she had learned over the course of the hearings that even representatives of warring groups could find common ground. She said every parent she had spoken with agreed that parents should have more of a voice in education decisions.
 ''If people really took the time to listen to each other,'' she said, ''maybe we can come to some sort of happy place.''

HEADLINE: SIDESHOWS: The Art of the Distraction

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The questions flew hard and fast at President Obama last week as he stood on the White House South Lawn, preparing to escape for California's gentler climes. How, Mr. Obama was asked, would he quell public anger over $165 million in bonuses for employees of the bailed-out insurance giant, A.I.G.?
 ''I don't want to quell anger,'' he replied. ''I think people are right to be angry. What I want us to do, though, is channel our anger in a constructive way.''
 It was too late. By the time Air Force One took off, Congress was in full-recriminations mode, with the usual hearings and declarations of outrage. The A.I.G. chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, was pleading with bonus-takers who got more than $100,000 to give half the money back. The search for culprits -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner? Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman? Mr. Obama himself? -- was in full bloom. That old Washington question was back: Who knew what, and when? 
 But something else about the scene rang familiar: it was a sliver of news, seemingly a side issue, run amok. In the grand scheme of today's taxpayer expenditures -- $787 billion for economic recovery; another $700 billion to shore up shaky financial institutions; who knows how many more billions tomorrow -- the A.I.G. bonuses amount to small change. But the small change became a big deal in an instant, dominating the talk shows and threatening to undermine Mr. Obama's domestic agenda.
 ''This is the kind of issue Washington chases like catnip,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, lamented in an interview. ''What would be a mistake would be to get so distracted by the catnip-chasers that we lose our own path. We are not going to do that.''
 Mr. Obama is hardly the first American president to grapple with a distraction, a diversion -- an outright red herring, some might call it -- that grew bigger than itself. Ronald Reagan had the Air Force's $7,622 coffeepot and the Navy's $435 claw hammer, as well as an ill-fated effort to save money by classifying ketchup as a school lunch vegetable. Bill Clinton had midnight basketball and a high-priced haircut from a Beverly Hills stylist aboard Air Force One. George W. Bush was blindsided by an executive branch decision to contract with Dubai Ports World, an Arab-owned company, to manage terminals in six American ports.
 What these stories share is a simple and clear narrative that captures the public imagination by tapping into some larger fear or existing perception -- ''a proxy for a bigger concern,'' in the words of Ed Gillespie, former counselor to Mr. Bush. If that concern runs deep enough, the side issue becomes the main issue. 
 Thus did the A.I.G. bonuses become a symbol of long-simmering taxpayer resentment over Wall Street bailouts, and economic inequity in general, raising essential questions about fairness and personal responsibility -- themes Mr. Obama has repeatedly evoked. The story line had shock appeal: fat cats get rewarded for driving the economy into a ditch. 
 ''These things catch on because there is some fundamental issue that people are able to attach to,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication who directs the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. ''There has to be a sense of good and evil, a dramatic arc to it that makes some intuitive sense, so it can't be terribly complex.''
 Mr. Reagan's Pentagon purchases, for example, unleashed pent-up anger over wasteful defense spending, while ketchup-as-a-vegetable reinforced perceptions of him as uncaring toward the poor. Mr. Clinton's effort to fund ''community activities like midnight basketball'' in a crime-prevention measure gave Republicans just the ammunition they needed to portray him as soft on crime. The Air Force One haircut, meanwhile, hurt Mr. Clinton, who had cast himself as an ordinary guy in his campaign against the first President Bush.
 ''The story about the haircut, even though it was a nonsense story, caused a big drop in his standing on being in touch with people,'' said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's pollster at the time. ''When Bill Clinton came in, Americans thought they had a president who was in touch. What the haircut seemed to say was that he was really with the elites.''
 Some distractions are cynical political maneuvers, manufactured by one political party to throw a wrench into the agenda of another. But the ones that pose the greatest political danger are those that seem to erupt spontaneously, crossing political boundaries by putting a president at odds with his own party.
 That was the case in 2006, when the Bush administration was caught flat-footed by news of its own Dubai ports deal. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, picked up on it, accusing Mr. Bush of outsourcing port security. But the issue really took off when Republicans, fed up with the administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq, turned on the president.
 ''It matched the meta-narrative that this administration can't handle Iraq and the Middle East,'' said Eric Ueland, who was chief of staff to one Republican critic, the former Senate majority leader Bill Frist. ''A lot of elements combined, so that when somebody said, quite simply, 'The Bush administration is turning ports over to a Middle Eastern government,' you got a lot of resonance.''
 Mr. Bush made matters worse for himself by arguing that the White House was bound by the contract and insisting he would live up to it -- the very same argument the Obama administration made last weekend in explaining why the A.I.G. bonuses would have to be paid. That may be a reasonable policy argument, but politically, it is tone-deaf.
 ''This is the difference between running for office and holding office,'' said Mr. Gillespie. ''When you're running for office, you say, 'That's ridiculous and we're not going to do that.' When you're in office, you actually have to do things sometimes that are not politically easy, because it's the job.'' 
 Still, the notion that a president is powerless to get taxpayers' money back is not a particularly satisfying one; what the public wants in these situations ''is closure,'' Mr. Gillespie said. Thus, the Reagan administration's ketchup plan went nowhere. Mr. Clinton signed the crime bill, but Republicans revived the basketball issue during his re-election campaign. And Dubai Ports World, in a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction twist, abandoned its deal by eventually selling its American operations to a unit of A.I.G.
 ''Under these circumstances, you have victims and you need to find a villain,'' Ms. Jamieson said. ''We need a narrative explanation that tells us how we got here, and attaches blame.''
 Mr. Obama seemed to sense the public's need for blame last week, judging by his administration's fast pivot from the contract-is-a-contract narrative to a new, more appealing message. ''Listen, I'll take responsibility; I'm the president,'' Mr. Obama told a crowd in Costa Mesa, Calif. The next day, appearing on ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' he declared, ''We're going to do everything we can to see if we can get these bonuses back.'' 
 Congress seemed to sense the need for blame as well. Representative Paul Kanjorski, the Pennsylvania Democrat who was chairman of last week's A.I.G. hearing in the House, viewed the session as a kind of catharsis -- a public venting that he said he hoped would clear a path for Mr. Obama to turn the nation's attention back to the larger question of how to stabilize the economy. ''I think it was healthy that we did it,'' he said.
 Yet by week's end, it was clear that the furor had exacted a price. As the House passed legislation imposing a 90 percent tax on bonuses after bailout, the White House ducked questions about whether Mr. Obama would sign such a bill. Mr. Geithner's credibility was badly damaged, in part because of his shifting explanations of how he learned of the bonuses. Mr. Dodd suffered as well, for his role in writing legislation that, in the end, allowed the bonuses to be paid.
 Mr. Gillespie said the cost to the new White House was clear; no longer would Mr. Obama be able to ''rush the net'' by asking Congress to quickly approve legislation. Mr. Axelrod insisted that the furor would die down -- Americans, he said, had bigger things to worry about, like jobs and health care -- yet conceded that Mr. Obama, who expects to ask Congress for yet more money to stabilize the nation's shaky bank system, will now have a much tougher time doing so.
 ''He has a difficult job,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''because he has to explain to the American people, who are furious, why we need to maintain a strong functioning system of credit so that people can get loans, and businesses can get loans. At the same time, he has to explain to Wall Street why people are legitimately outraged by what they have done. Both are made more difficult by these kinds of stories.''

HEADLINE: A Scrappy Local Paper Ponders Its New Parent

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
THIS is not an obituary. The Brooklyn Paper lives. 
 Since 1978, it has been a ''loud, offbeat and somewhat irreverent'' voice in the borough, in the words of its founder and publisher, Ed Weintrob. The paper did, however, undergo something of a transformation this month when it was purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. 
 Just what this will mean for the paper, which has a circulation of 44,500, is unclear. 
 ''This is a crazy turn of events and one that leaves many of us feeling slightly (slightly?) uncomfortable,'' Louise Crawford, a columnist for the newspaper, wrote on her blog, Only the Blog Knows Brooklyn.
 The News Corporation owns the rival Courier-Life Publications, and some of the chain's dozen papers report on the same brownstone neighborhoods that The Brooklyn Paper covers. The Murdoch purchase is the most recent example of the corporation's effort to expand coverage of the boroughs outside Manhattan; the News Corporation also bought papers in Queens and the Bronx, as well as Courier-Life in Brooklyn, in 2006 and 2007.
 Yet brownstone Brooklyn is not known for being particularly hospitable to Mr. Murdoch's brand of conservative journalism. 
 ''I think the fact that Mr. Murdoch bought these papers tells us something about the direction news may be going in,'' said Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, whose district includes Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Fort Greene.
 A News Corporation spokesman confirmed the purchase but declined to say more.
 The absorption of an independent, family-run newspaper with 10 employees into a global media conglomerate seems like a drastic shift in parentage. But Gersh Kuntzman, The Brooklyn Paper's editor and a former New York Post columnist, said he did not expect the Brooklyn newspaper's style or content to change.
 ''The Brooklyn Paper's always had a very independent feel, and we've been told to continue that feel,'' said Mr. Kuntzman, whose paper is peppered with playful headlines with exclamation points. ''We're a scrappy paper. We always have been; we always will be.'' 
 Some media-vigilant Brooklynites are skeptical. For example, while The Brooklyn Paper has been generally critical of the controversial Atlantic Yards development project, other News Corporation publications, such as The New York Post, have supported it.
 ''I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict that The Brooklyn Paper's news coverage of Atlantic Yards will diminish somewhat (as it already has), and its editorial criticism will diminish even more,'' wrote Norman Oder, a critic of the development, on his blog Atlantic Yards Report. 
 The paper's employees will leave their Dumbo office and join Courier-Life in an office in Downtown Brooklyn that is owned, as Mr. Oder noted, by the Atlantic Yards' developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. 
 Some skeptics have also suggested that the purchase may signal a move toward consolidation, noting that The Greenpoint Courier, a Courier-Life Paper, published its final issue last week, soon after The Brooklyn Paper, which covers Greenpoint, was bought. 
 ''Whether they'll eventually merge the papers, they're not saying,'' said Aaron Short, who worked as a reporter for The Greenpoint Courier until he said he was fired on March 13. ''It just doesn't make sense to have two sets of advertisers and two sets of reporters who cover the same area.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 5, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 22 about the News Corporation's acquisition of The Brooklyn Paper misstated the reason that Aaron Short, a reporter, left The Greenpoint Courier, another newspaper owned by the corporation. Mr. Short was let go because the newspaper shut down; he was not fired.

HEADLINE: Chavez Trims Venezuelan Budget as Low Oil Prices Squeeze Economy

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez announced a series of economic measures Saturday night, including a reduction in this year's federal budget and a modest increase in the value-added tax, that are aimed at offsetting a recent plunge in the government's oil revenues. 
 Mr. Chavez said the changes were needed to shield Venezuela from the global financial crisis. Growth slowed in the most recent quarter to its most sluggish rate in five years. 
 But Mr. Chavez ruled out deeper adjustments, like a devaluation of the currency, the bolivar, or an increase in subsidized gasoline prices, which are among the world's cheapest. 
 ''Fortunately we have lots of maneuvering room,'' Mr. Chavez said in a two-and-a-half-hour address on national television, during which he browbeat senior officials about their high salaries and jokingly floated the idea of tapping the expanding ranks of the American unemployed by hiring English teachers from California for public schools here.
 The new measures also include a plan to expand the government's domestic debt by about $10 billion. 
 It was unclear precisely how these additional funds would be obtained, although the president referred to the possibility of compelling private banks to transfer resources to his government for agricultural projects. 
 Faced with low oil prices, Mr. Chavez said he was basing the new budget on an oil price of $40 a barrel this year, instead of $60. Venezuela's oil, which generally trades at a discount to other blends because it is costlier to refine, currently sells for about $43 a barrel, he said.
 The budget would be reduced by 6.7 percent, largely through cuts in office remodeling, purchases of new vehicles, foreign travel for government officials and other nonessential expenses, Mr. Chavez said. He also lambasted civil servants for partaking in luxuries like whiskey-fueled holiday parties. 
 As part of the adjustments, Mr. Chavez said his government would also raise the minimum wage this year by 20 percent from its current level of about $372 a month at the official exchange rate. 
 But annual inflation of 29.5 percent in metropolitan Caracas, while slowing slightly in recent months, would still outstrip the wage increase. 
 Mr. Chavez insisted that ''not one hair has been touched'' in Venezuela by the global crisis, despite signs of distress like delays in payments to foreign oil services companies that have idled drilling rigs, and a halt by Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction giant, in work on the Caracas subway system this month because the government failed to pay its bills. 
 Uncertainty over low oil prices, with Venezuela relying on oil for 93 percent of its export income, was reflected in feverish black-market trading in the bolivar in recent days, as Venezuelans tried to move money offshore. 
 Despite the spreading concerns, Mr. Chavez said he was pressing ahead with nationalizations, including that of Banco de Venezuela, a unit of Spain's Banco Santander, and the takeover of key infrastructure like seaports, airports and highways that are in states governed by his opponents.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks to Increase Oversight of Executive Pay

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting from London.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration will call for increased oversight of executive pay at all banks, Wall Street firms and possibly other companies as part of a sweeping plan to overhaul financial regulation, government officials said. 
 The outlines of the plan are expected to be unveiled this week in preparation for President Obama's first foreign summit meeting in early April.
 Officials said the proposal would seek a broad new role for the Federal Reserve to oversee large companies, including major hedge funds, whose problems could pose risks to the entire financial system. 
 It will propose that many kinds of derivatives and other exotic financial instruments that contributed to the crisis be traded on exchanges or through clearinghouses so they are more transparent and can be more tightly regulated. And to protect consumers, it will call for federal standards for mortgage lenders beyond what the Federal Reserve adopted last year, as well as more aggressive enforcement of the mortgage rules. 
 The administration has been considering increased oversight of executive pay for some time, but the issue was heightened in recent days as public fury over bonuses spilled into the regulatory effort. 
 The officials said that the administration was still debating the details of its plan, including how broadly it should be applied and how far it could go beyond simple reporting requirements. Depending on the outcome of the discussions, the administration could seek to put the changes into effect through regulations rather than through legislation. 
 One proposal could impose greater requirements on company boards to tie executive compensation more closely to corporate performance and to take other steps to ensure that compensation was aligned with the financial interest of the company. 
 The new rules will cover all financial institutions, including those not now covered by any pay rules because they are not receiving federal bailout money. Officials say the rules could also be applied more broadly to publicly traded companies, which already report about some executive pay practices to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama repeatedly urged regulators to adopt new rules to give shareholders a greater voice in setting executive pay for all public companies. And last month, as part of the stimulus package, Congress barred top executives at large banks getting rescue money from receiving bonuses that exceeded one-third of their annual pay. 
 The regulatory plan is being put together ahead of the meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations in London. The meeting, which begins April 2, is expected to be dominated by the global financial crisis and discussions about better oversight of large financial companies, whose problems could threaten to undermine international markets.
 An important part of the plan still under debate is how to regulate the shadow banking system that Wall Street firms use to package and trade mortgage-backed securities, the so-called toxic assets held by many banks and blamed for the credit crisis. 
 Officials said the plan would also call for increasing the levels of capital that financial institutions need to hold to absorb possible losses. In a sign of the economic system's fragility, officials said the administration would emphasize that those heightened standards should not be imposed now because they could discourage more lending. Rather, they would be put in place after the economy began to rebound.
 ''The argument some are making is that they don't want to be stepping on the gas pedal and the brake at the same time,'' said Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former top official at the International Monetary Fund.
 Administration officials are also debating how tightly to supervise hedge funds. 
 A broad consensus has emerged among regulators and administration officials that hedge funds must be registered and more closely monitored, probably by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But officials have not decided how much the funds will have to disclose about their investments and trading practices. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the regulatory plan was still being formulated and they did not want to upstage Mr. Obama or Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who will describe the plan when he appears before Congress on Thursday.
 A central aspect of the plan, which has already been announced by the administration, would give the government greater authority to take over and resolve problems at large troubled companies not now regulated by Washington, like insurance companies and hedge funds. 
 That proposal would, for instance, make it easier for the government to cancel bonus contracts like those given to executives at the American International Group, which have stoked a political furor. Under the proposal, the Treasury secretary would have the authority to seize and wind down a struggling institution after consulting with the president and upon the recommendation of two-thirds of the Federal Reserve board.
 Long before he became Treasury secretary, Mr. Geithner sought broader authority for the government to resolve problems at financial institutions not under bank regulators' supervision. 
 The government now has the power to take over only the banking unit that controls federally insured deposits of large troubled institutions, not the parent company -- a limit that could pose problems if large financial conglomerates like Citigroup or Bank of America continued to spiral downward.
 In unveiling the regulatory plan, Mr. Obama would signal to Europe that he intended to crack down on the risk-taking and other free-wheeling practices by the financial industry that resulted in the global economic meltdown. 
 France and Germany especially have suggested that the better response is not more government spending but tighter regulation. 
 The Obama administration has urged European nations to do more to restart their economies through financial stimulus. Mr. Obama is hoping that by showing a serious commitment to tighter regulation he can more easily persuade other countries to increase government spending and stimulate demand by consumers and businesses that would help pull the global economy out of a serious decline.
 But the administration's efforts, especially on tighter regulation of hedge funds, are not expected to assuage some European countries. Moreover, the hedge fund industry has significant influence on Capitol Hill and has shown that it can defeat proposals it finds onerous. 
 While a growing number of hedge fund advisers have voluntarily agreed to register with the S.E.C., many of the most prominent ones are expected to oppose efforts to require them to provide what they consider proprietary information about their holdings and trading practices, even on a confidential basis.
 From the outset of the Obama administration, officials and European leaders have disagreed over how much to limit pay. And Mr. Geithner has discouraged the administration from imposing across-the-board limits on compensation of all employees at troubled companies receiving federal assistance and more burdensome pay restrictions at healthy institutions that the administration is trying to encourage to take government money so they can increase lending.
 Last week, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, also called on regulators to supervise executive pay at banks more closely to avoid ''compensation practices that can create mismatches between the rewards and risks borne by institutions or their managers.'' Much of the plan would require the approval of Congress, where divisions are forming over how best to overhaul financial industry oversight.
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Financial Services Committee, said he believed giving the government new authority to take over troubled companies could be adopted by the House relatively quickly, particularly after the furor over the A.I.G. bonuses.
 ''This would give the government the same powers that you would get as if the company were in bankruptcy,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview shortly after meeting with Mr. Geithner on the plan. 
 But Mr. Frank and other lawmakers said other elements of the plan could take more time, like expanding the authority of the Federal Reserve to become a systemic regulator.
 In a hearing Thursday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the banking committee, expressed skepticism about that proposal. ''Whether or not those vast powers will reside at the Fed remains an open question,'' said Mr. Dodd, pointing out that the Federal Reserve had failed to apply tough oversight of the companies it now regulates.

HEADLINE: Some Rich Districts Get Richer As Aid Is Rushed to Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: RANDOLPH, Utah 

 BODY:
Dale Lamborn, the superintendent of a somewhat threadbare rural school district, feels the pain of Utah's economic crisis every day as he tinkers with his shrinking budget, struggling to avoid laying off teachers or cutting classes like welding or calculus.
 Just across the border in Wyoming, a state awash in oil and gas money, James Bailey runs a wealthier district. It has a new elementary school and gives every child an Apple laptop.
 But under the Obama administration's education stimulus package, Mr. Lamborn, who needs every penny he can get, will receive hundreds of dollars less per student than will Dr. Bailey, who says he does not need the extra money. 
 ''For us, this is just a windfall,'' Dr. Bailey said. 
 In pouring rivers of cash into states and school districts, Washington is using a tangle of well-worn federal formulas, some of which benefit states that spend more per pupil, while others help states with large concentrations of poor students or simply channel money based on population. Combined, the formulas seem to take little account of who needs the money most.
 As a result, some districts that are well off will find themselves swimming in cash, while some that are struggling may get too little to avoid cutbacks. 
 Still, educators are accepting the disparities without challenge. Utah, which stands to get about $400 less per student than Wyoming, says it is grateful for the money and has no complaint. There is widespread recognition that the federal money is helping to avert what could have been an educational disaster in some places.
 Democrats in Congress decided to use the formulas to save time, knowing that devising new ones tailored to current conditions could require months of negotiations.
 ''These formulas were the best vehicle for getting these emergency economic recovery funds out to school districts as quickly as possible, to help them immediately stave off layoffs,'' said Rachel Racusen, a spokeswoman for Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. 
 The education secretary, Arne Duncan, said that he, too, was aware of the disparities but that no formula was perfect. ''In this case, people are just extraordinarily thankful for these unprecedented resources,'' Mr. Duncan said in an interview. ''So I'm aware of these disparities, but we've received zero complaints.''
 Still, the occasional mismatch between educational needs and emergency financing can be striking. 
 Utah, where a $1.3 billion budget deficit has threatened deep school cuts, will get about $655 million in education stimulus money, or about $1,250 per student, according to the federal Department of Education. Wyoming, which has no deficit and has not cut school budgets in many years, will get about $1,684 per student.
 North Dakota, which also has no budget problems, will receive $1,734 per student. California, which recently closed a $42 billion budget gap through July 2010 partly through deep spending cuts, will get $1,336 per student.
 New York is a huge winner. With the nation's second-largest budget deficit, the state benefits from a formula that sends extra money to concentrations of poor students, as well as one that rewards states for their own school spending. New York will receive about $1,724 per student, the most of any large state and roughly $400 more per pupil that than Connecticut and New Jersey.
 The money in question is part of $97 billion to be administered by the Education Department under the stimulus law. 
 Within weeks, states will begin receiving a large part of the roughly $80 billion to be distributed over two years. Most of the rest of the $97 billion will go toward college grants to low-income students.
 About $50 billion, which Congress labeled a fiscal stabilization fund, will flow to states based on a formula that takes into account population, as well as the number of 5- to 24-year-olds. The states have some discretion, but part of the money must go toward avoiding or reversing cuts. 
 About $25 billion will be sent to the nation's 14,000 school districts for spending on poor and disabled students according to long-standing formulas. And Mr. Duncan will use $5 billion to reward states for exemplary systems.
 Last month Mr. Duncan released state-by-state allocations of the education stimulus money. They were divided by Department of Education enrollment numbers to calculate the money on a per-student basis.
 Washington, which is treated as a state under the stimulus, will get the highest allocation, $2,112 per student. Michelle Rhee, the schools chancellor there, said spending could be tricky.
 ''We don't want to be in a position of bringing in this huge amount of money and then having to lay people off in two years after the money runs out,'' Ms. Rhee said.
 In Maryland, Prince George's County, which borders Washington, appears likely to receive less than $1,500 per student. ''I can tell you we're not complaining,'' said John White, a spokesman for the county schools. His district had been planning to cut 1,000 of its 17,000 employees and to furlough others to save money, he said, but the federal money will reduce the layoffs and make the furlough unnecessary. 
 Things are also working out better for Mr. Lamborn, whose district is in Rich County in northeastern Utah, where 450 children of coal miners and ranchers attend four austere rural schools. The Utah Legislature, facing a deficit of more than $1 billion, was preparing to cut school spending statewide by 17 percent. Last week, it reduced that cut to 5 percent.
 Mr. Lamborn said a 17 percent cut in his district, where the starting pay for a teacher is $32,000, would have been devastating. ''I didn't even want to think about it,'' he said. 
 Even a cut of 5 percent may result in the elimination of a teacher or two, Mr. Lamborn said. He snorted last week when he read a federal guidance letter that said, ''Spend funds quickly to create and save jobs.''
 ''We won't be creating any,'' he said. ''We hope to save some.''
 Across the state line in Evanston, Wyo., where Dr. Bailey is superintendent, the Uinta County District 1 has enjoyed years of growing budgets. Students attend new or updated schools with plenty of computers; high-tech smart boards have replaced blackboards. The starting pay for a teacher is $41,500. Achievement is improving, especially in math, and a teacher training program is enriched by outside consultants. 
 In a meeting last week, some educators questioned whether the district could spend the $1.5 million in new federal money wisely, without losing focus on its goals, which include improving adolescent literacy skills.
 ''Out of the blue this money has dropped in, and it's kind of a distraction,'' Dr. Bailey said.

For example, Wyoming is among the states getting the most per pupil, while neighboring Utah gets the least.
Much of the education money is to help states in economic crisis avoid classroom cutbacks. But the $8.6 billion received by California will not prevent all school layoffs provoked by the nation's biggest budget gap. North Dakota, in contrast, has no budget gap and its $168 million in stimulus money is pure windfall. (Sources: Department of Education

HEADLINE: Obama Responds to Cheney's Criticism

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has hit back at former Vice President Dick Cheney, calling Bush administration policy on detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ''unsustainable.'' 
 ''How many terrorists have actually been brought to justice under the philosophy that is being promoted by Vice President Cheney?'' Mr. Obama said Friday in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS. 
 The president was responding to recent charges by Mr. Cheney that the administration's decision to shut down the Guantanamo prison, along with other policies on the treatment of terrorism suspects, would make the United States more vulnerable to attacks.
 Bush administration terrorism policy ''hasn't made us safer,'' Mr. Obama said, according to excerpts of the interview released Saturday. 
 ''What it has been,'' he continued, ''is a great advertisement for anti-American sentiment.''
 Mr. Obama defended the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who has come under fire as public anger over bonuses paid to Wall Street executives has grown and the nation's economic crisis has deepened.
 Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Geithner had not discussed whether Mr. Geithner should resign. And even if Mr. Geithner offered to resign, the president joked that his response would be, ''Buddy, you've still got the job.''

HEADLINE: The Recession, for Fun and Profit

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Terrified by the collapse of the global economy? Have plummeting stock markets convinced you that the mattress is the only safe place left to stash whatever is left of your retirement savings? 
 Chill. The experts in the financial services industry are hard at work sifting for the hidden diamonds amid the financial rough, devising new strategies to invest profitably through these difficult times. 
 Just Friday morning in my in-box I found a killer suggestion from Goldman Sachs: the timing is ripe, it said, to ''open receiver positions in Turkish 1y cross currency swap rates at 11.10 with a target of 9% and a stop of 12.0%.'' On Thursday it proposed shorting credit default swaps on Sweden and buying, yes, Fannie- or Freddie-backed mortgages. 
 If there is a lesson from the galactic financial mess we are in, it seems to be that smart-enough people can always find a way to profit from even the deepest depression.
 JPMorgan, for instance, suggests selling the Hungarian forint against the euro, a perfect position to profit from what is likely to be a sharp Hungarian recession this year, which will put pressure on it to devalue its currency.
 If you are queasy about dabbling in faraway countries where strange languages are spoken, there are also options to profit from recession at home. Last month, Merrill Lynch suggested American muni bonds on the grounds that even if their finances look dismal, the feds are unlikely to let states and municipalities go under. ''One would think that taking the 'fiscal stimulus' to the grass roots level would be the most effective way of dealing with the situation,'' it said.
 There is even a good strategy to invest in domestic equities. All you do is buy them at night and sell them in the morning. Last week, Goldman Sachs noted that short-selling the S.&P. index by the day and buying it overnight would have produced a 9 percent return since the start of 2008 -- respectable considering the S.&P. had fallen by nearly half since then.
 I realize it must feel somewhat strange to be taking financial advice from the people who brought us the collateralized debt obligation and the credit default swap, those ''financial weapons of mass destruction,'' in Warren Buffett's parlance. But who else should we take investment advice from? 
 Mr. Buffett's own ''Buy'' recommendation last October has taken a beating. And though President Obama is clearly a profound thinker, his observation that stocks are cheap these days sounds somewhat amateurish.
 The experts in the financial industry, by contrast, are pros. The mortgage-backed bonds they manufactured may have lost most of their value; debt markets may have frozen; economic activity might have fallen off a cliff. But what other industry can persuade the government to hand over several hundred billion dollars in a heartbeat?
 Nobody has a better handle on how to make money, in good times or bad.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Ideals in Conflict on the Texas Prairie

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
WALLER, Tex. -- Over the years the Katy Prairie has survived the cattle ranchers who tamed its fields, the rice farmers who cleared its wildflowers and tall grasses, and even the encroachment of Houston, some 30 miles to the east, whose spiraling outward growth turned most of the formerly lonesome prairie into subdivisions and strip malls.
Now the prairie is facing a new threat: the federal stimulus law.
Texas plans to spend $181 million of its federal stimulus money on building a 15-mile, four-lane toll road -- from Interstate 10 to Highway 290 and right through the prairie -- that will eventually form part of an outer beltway around greater Houston called the Grand Parkway. 
The road exemplifies an unintended effect of the stimulus law: an administration that opposes suburban sprawl is giving money to states for projects that are almost certain to exacerbate it.
A new master-planned community called Bridgeland is rising on the prairie along the proposed site of the road; once completed, the development is expected to have 21,000 new homes on 11,400 acres. Other developers are eagerly awaiting the new road so they can start building on their empty land, too.
Though the road is welcomed by developers, it is bemoaned by transportation advocates who lament that it will lead people to settle far away from the main centers of employment -- locking more people into long commutes.
''They should be spending the money where the people are,'' said Robin Holzer, the chairwoman of the Citizens' Transportation Coalition, a Houston-based advocacy group, who added that the money would have been better spent on transit or on alleviating congestion on roads through more developed areas.
President Obama made his opposition to sprawl explicit during a trip to Florida last month while he was pushing for the stimulus bill's passage. ''The days where we're just building sprawl forever, those days are over,'' he said, urging officials to employ ''innovative thinking'' when deciding how to spend their transportation money.
But to ensure that the money is spent quickly, the law leaves decisions of how to spend some $27.5 billion in transportation money up to the states -- and quite a few are using their shares to build new and wider roads that will spur development away from their most populous centers.
North Carolina is extending Interstate 295 outside Fayetteville, which will benefit Fort Bragg but use up limited resources that were being sought by bigger areas like Charlotte and Raleigh. New Hampshire plans to widen Interstate 93, which gets clogged because so many residents of southern New Hampshire now commute to Boston for work. Lawmakers in Washington decided to widen several highways around the state, but snubbed projects sought by Seattle.
The plan to build a new leg of the Grand Parkway near here highlights the tension between some of the competing priorities of the Obama administration. The administration's desire to change the way the country thinks about development, and to wean it from its dependency on foreign oil, is clashing with its need to spend stimulus money as fast as possible. And its call for creating or saving 3.5 million jobs is bumping up against its wish to curb sprawl, which eats up land but creates jobs in construction and strip malls and fast food restaurants that remain after the road builders have all gone away.
Mr. Obama made environmental concerns central to the $787 billion stimulus bill that Congress passed last month. The law provides money for renewable energy and for making federal buildings energy efficient, and it gives tax credits to buyers of plug-in hybrid cars. The logo the administration created for the economic recovery program is not only red, white and blue, but green too: it shows white stars on a blue background, white gears on a red background, and white leaves on a green background.
A White House spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that the stimulus bill would promote ''long-term sustainable development'' by spending billions of dollars on renewable energy, mass transit, rail service and urban development, and he added that the choice of most transportation projects was left to states.
''The Recovery Act creates jobs by investing in immediate projects such as highways, bridges and tunnels -- and within limitations to prevent waste, fraud, and 'highways to nowhere' -- grants the states and their citizens broad discretion to choose which highway projects get funding,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a statement.
But some environmentalists here worry that the law will destroy part of the last 150,000 undeveloped acres of a prairie that was once 1,000 square miles -- a treasured expanse of open land in the shadow of Houston that attracts bird watchers, hunters, hikers and prairie flower enthusiasts. The Sierra Club, which sometimes leads groups through the prairie to see its bald eagles, ducks, geese, herons and egrets, filed a lawsuit seeking to halt the project so another environmental review can be conducted.
''When you get out here, it seems you're not even close to Houston,'' Brandt Mannchen, a volunteer with the club, said on a recent tour of the prairie, where he pointed out native grasses and flowers. ''This is what we're trying to protect.''
The road won environmental approval from the federal government last year and took a step forward this month when county officials awarded several design and engineering contracts. It is more controversial for its proposed use of tolls -- little loved in Texas -- than for questions about land use. But supporters of the project, which has been discussed and planned for more than two decades, say that Houston will continue to expand westward with or without the road, and that it would be better to plan for the growth than to react to it once it comes.
''Our interest is to encourage what we call quality growth,'' said Roger H. Hord, the president of the West Houston Association, a group of property owners and businesses in the area. ''I understand there are concerns about sprawl. Houston is what it is. It will grow. We've had a pattern of it since we've started. The point we're trying to make is, we can either plan for that growth and get in advance of it, or we can not plan and just let it happen.''
Mr. Hord pointed out that the road would connect two existing highways and said it would ease congestion on some of Houston's other beltways. He said that an existing leg of the Grand Parkway, just to the south of the proposed leg, would give a sense of what the new stretch of the Grand Parkway might look like when it is done. The existing stretch is lined with strip malls and gas stations and drug stores and a huge 7,600-acre residential development called Cinco Ranch that is popular with families.
It feels a world away from the landscape of fields, ranches and prairie to the north -- land that nature lovers have been patiently working for years to conserve.
When a rare swath of unspoiled prairie plant life -- including switchgrass, prickly rattlesnake master and bright orange Indian paintbrush flowers -- was threatened by bulldozers last summer, volunteers laboriously dug up more than 2,000 square feet of it, trucked it away, and replanted it on land protected by the Katy Prairie Conservancy, which has bought or protected nearly 18,000 acres of the prairie and hopes to save more than 50,000 acres, though developers have pushed the price of land up in recent years.
Hopping out of his pickup, shielded from a little welcome rain by his white Stetson, Wesley Newman, the conservancy's land manager, showed off the rescued prairie garden outside the conservancy's field office here.
''We actually have a little patch of intact prairie, if you will,'' he said, standing among tufts of tall grass just a few miles west of the proposed highway.

HEADLINE: Sweden Says No To Saving Saab, A National Icon

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
TROLLHATTAN, Sweden -- Saab Automobile may be just another crisis-ridden car company in an industry full of them. But just as the fortunes of Flint, Mich., are permanently entangled with General Motors, so it is impossible to find anyone in this city in southwest Sweden who is not somehow connected to Saab.
Which makes it all the more wrenching that the Swedish government has responded to Saab's desperate financial situation by saying, essentially, tough luck. Or, as the enterprise minister, Maud Olofsson, put it recently, ''The Swedish state is not prepared to own car factories.''
Such a view might seem jarring, coming as it does from a country with a reputation for a paternalistic view of workers and companies. The ''Swedish model'' for dealing with a banking crisis -- nationalizing the banks, recapitalizing them and selling them -- has been much debated lately in the United States, with free-market defenders warning of a slippery slope of Nordic socialism. 
But Sweden has a right-leaning government, elected in 2006 after a long period of Social Democratic rule, that prefers market forces to state intervention and ownership. That fact has made the workers of Trollhattan wish the old socialist model were more in evidence.
''I don't think the government knows the situation in this town, how many people depend on Saab,'' said Therese Doeij, 25, a clerk at a photo shop who has several friends who work at the company. ''To them it's just a factory. They don't see the people behind it.''
Governments all over the world are confronting the disintegration of the global automobile market in different ways, with loans, bailouts and takeovers.
But Sweden's approach has been particularly hard-nosed, and particularly unequivocal.
Why is the government apparently dead set against helping Saab, an iconic brand that stands as a global symbol of Sweden, with Ikea, Volvo and Abba?
That is what Paul Akerlund, the local chairman of the automobile workers' union, wonders.
''I'm a little surprised,'' he said. ''They say the market should help itself, but the market has collapsed around the whole world. It's an extraordinary situation.''
He added, with a note of accusation in his voice, ''In Germany, France and England, the government is going in to help the car manufacturers.''
Swedish officials have condemned what they see as protectionism by other European countries that have pledged to prop up their own failing car industries. They have also been scathing about General Motors, Saab's owner, and the last thing they want is to seem to be bailing out a despised foreign company.
Struggling for its own survival, G.M. has said it will completely pull out of Saab by the end of 2009, a course that Ms. Olofsson, the enterprise minister, described as tantamount to declaring ''that they wash their hands of Saab and drop it into the laps of the Swedish taxpayers.''
She said: ''We are very disappointed in G.M., but we are not prepared to risk taxpayers' money. This is not a game of Monopoly.''
Saab lost about $343 million last year. It is now going through a Swedish process known as reorganization, a step short of bankruptcy, as it tries to persuade its creditors to prop it up while it looks for a buyer. Joe Oliver, a spokesman, said in an interview that ''around six serious investors,'' from Sweden and abroad, had expressed interest.
Time is running out.
But the prospect of failure is too awful for Trollhattan's mayor, Gert-Inge Andersson, to even contemplate. In a city of about 54,000 people, Saab employs 4,000.
''I'm being optimistic, because I can't envision a time when Saab doesn't exist,'' Mr. Andersson said in an interview in City Hall.
His son worked at Saab for a decade; his daughter's boyfriend works there now. ''Saab is our identity,'' he said. ''We have lived with it for many years, and it's very important to all of us.''
Saab was always known for its innovative engineering. But analysts say that in recent years, with General Motors's emphasis on volume rather than individuality, it has lost its edge.
''Under G.M.'s ownership, they denuded the intellectual content behind the brand,'' said Peter Wells, who teaches at Cardiff Business School in Wales and specializes in the automotive industry. ''Its products are not exciting enough, and Saab doesn't have a strong brand identity anymore.''
The numbers speak all too loudly. Saab sold just 93,295 vehicles worldwide last year, 21,383 of them in the United States. As global demand plummets, the expectations for this year are even more dire. The company announced this month that it planned to lay off 750 workers in Trollhattan.
This is not a rich city. Besides Saab, the largest employer is the municipal government. The houses run mostly to modest wooden two-story structures and low-rise brick apartment buildings. But about 40 percent of the people here drive Saabs, Mayor Andersson said. On a cold evening last month, 3,000 people held a torchlight ceremony to show their support for the company.
Leave the tourist office and you come immediately to the Saab Museum. A shining, sparkling valentine to a company and an industry, it features treasures like the groundbreaking turbo engine unveiled at the 1977 Frankfurt automobile show, and the prototype of the very first Saab car, from 1947 -- Ur-Saab, its license plate says proudly. All the cars here, even the rarest and most precious, are still driven from time to time by enthusiasts.
Some 50,000 tourists visit each year, said Ola Bolander, who works at the museum. Saab sponsors a festival for its fans every other year; 20,000 came to the last one, in 2007. ''Saab has always been a bit different, a bit more interesting,'' Mr. Bolander said. ''It's gone its own way, and it's in the heart of the Swedish people.''
Sweden has nine million people. Labor leaders say Saab's collapse would disproportionately affect southwest Sweden, an industrial belt that is also home to Volvo. But it would reverberate through the rest of the economy, which depends heavily on industrial exports, jeopardizing perhaps tens of thousands of jobs.
Sweden is famous for its generous unemployment provisions, which include retraining for laid-off workers. But unemployment is quickly rising. Tomas Eneroth, a member of Parliament and the spokesman for industry and trade for the opposition Social Democrats, said the government's tough line was foolish.
''The fact that they are so passive,'' he said, ''is every day now making it worse and jeopardizing the possibility of having Saab still in Sweden.''
Around the corner from City Hall, Johann Riden, a sales clerk in an electronics store, said about half his customers worked either at Saab or at companies that do business with Saab.
''I have friends there, my colleagues have family there, and my friends have family there,'' said Mr. Riden, 32. ''If you look around, you see Saab everywhere.''

HEADLINE: When Madison Avenue Wanted a Glimpse of the Future, He Was the Chief Seer

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AN era is ending on Madison Avenue as Robert J. Coen, who has been predicting and following trends for advertising spending through 12 presidencies, steps down from his post as the lead forecaster at a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Mr. Coen, who is 86, has spent the last six decades at units of Interpublic. Heck, his career actually predates Interpublic; when he began at McCann-Erickson in New York in 1948, Interpublic was 13 years from being incorporated. 
''Bob Coen is the unequaled dean of advertising forecasting,'' said Leland Westerfield, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, ''and the benchmark by which all those in advertising, media and finance have gauged their own expectations for the advertising economy.''
Most recently, Mr. Coen has been senior vice president and forecasting director at a media agency named Magna, part of the Mediabrands division of Interpublic. Mr. Coen will become an adviser to Magna, Mediabrands is to announce on Monday, as he passes his lead forecasting role to Brian Wieser, a senior vice president at Magna who was being groomed for a larger role at the agency.
Mr. Wieser, 34, will become senior vice president and global forecasting director at Magna; the post Mr. Coen has held since Harry S. Truman was in the White House is thus expanded to take on more of a worldwide purview.
''It's a good way to pass the torch along,'' Mr. Westerfield said.
When Mr. Coen started 61 years ago, advertising spending in the United States totaled -- according to his own data, of course -- almost $4.9 billion. By comparison, his most recent forecast for 2009 calls for ad spending to reach $258.7 billion.
Stepping down ''was something I thought about periodically in the last couple of years,'' Mr. Coen said in an interview. ''I knew it would eventually come.''
As for the choice of Mr. Wieser to succeed him, Mr. Coen said, demonstrating his characteristically dry humor: ''Brian's been around here for a while. It's about time he started doing some of the work, the real work.''
Mr. Coen has presented his forecasts twice a year, with updates as needed, and written data-dense publications carrying the title ''Insider's Report.''
The first Coen forecast each year, in June or July, has typically been sponsored by Magna or one of the other Interpublic agencies for which he has worked; among them were Magna Global and Universal McCann in addition to McCann-Erickson (now McCann Erickson Worldwide).
The second Coen forecast each year, in December, has usually been part of media conferences sponsored by brokerage firms like Paine Webber or UBS.
''We plan to continue doing what we've done,'' Mr. Wieser said of the scheduling of the forecasts.
Mr. Coen has tracked spending trends in local and national media, compared ad spending with gross domestic product and examined plans by marketers in categories from airlines to toiletries. Although he has concentrated on the United States, his forecasts have also covered international markets.
''When I started at CBS 21, 22 years ago, I'd hear, 'We've got to see what Bob Coen has to say,' '' said Elizabeth Herbst-Brady, president at Magna.
''I'm not that concerned about the transition,'' she added, ''because we're going to be taking advantage of Bob's depth of knowledge and perspective.''
Already, Ms. Herbst-Brady said, Mr. Wieser (pronounced Weezer) has started interviewing Mr. Coen for a series of video presentations on advertising through the decades. A preview clip is to appear on Monday on the Mediabrands Web site (mediabrandsww.com).
In 1948, television was barely a gleam in Milton Berle's eye. National radio networks still broadcast comedy, drama and variety shows, along with soap operas. And tens of millions of Americans read mass magazines like Life, Look, The Saturday Evening Post and Collier's.
As different as the media landscape is today, Mr. Coen said, ''there has always been a lot of change,'' listing developments like the growth of outdoor advertising and the rise of direct mail.
Plans call for Mr. Wieser, who has concentrated on trends in the new media since joining Magna in 2003, to incorporate into his forecasts more data about the Internet and emerging media.
''I started my involvement in the media industry in 1993 when I was putting a radio station on the Internet,'' Mr. Wieser said.
Still, ''I don't think we'll be Twittering our forecasts immediately,'' he added, laughing.
If Mr. Wieser's tenure is to match Mr. Coen's, Mr. Wieser would be in his new post until 2070.
''I hadn't thought about that,'' Mr. Wieser said, adding quickly, ''I'm imagining a 'Futurama' interview with the head'' of a reporter asking questions. (On that animated sitcom, set at the turn of the 31st century, the heads of people from the 21st century are kept alive in jars.)
Mr. Coen is not typically one to reminisce, although when asked he will discuss his memories of leading industry figures like H. K. McCann, a co-founder of McCann-Erickson, and Marion Harper Jr., who founded Interpublic.
As for his starting salary, ''it was something like $50 a week,'' Mr. Coen said, adding, ''I knew I was expecting more because I had a master's degree. I had just read about a guy who got a job as an elevator operator for $50 a week.''
Mr. Wieser does not need ''a lot of advice,'' Mr. Coen said, but when pressed to pass on a word or two of wisdom, he offered this: In calculating figures for forecasts and presentations, ''do everything twice.''

HEADLINE: Tax on Bonuses Will Hurt Sector

 BODY:
President Obama has been vague about legislation that would retroactively levy huge taxes on bonuses paid by the largest recipients of government bailout money. Rather than just avoid associating himself with it, now is the time for him to stand up and oppose it.
Paying out big bonuses at a time of national sacrifice is distasteful, particularly when it comes to the people who helped lead the American International Group into bankruptcy through their incompetence. But mutating the tax code is not an effective means for shaping good public policy. 
Here are six reasons to kill the legislation.
1. The bills would almost certainly be challenged as an affront to Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, which states that, ''No bill of attainder or ex post facto law will be passed.'' Congress has the right to set tax policy. But legal experts are divided on whether the Supreme Court will uphold a blatant attempt to punish a subsection of society after the fact. At least one lawmaker has talked about retaliation. It would also be a field day for lawyers, incurring huge legal costs on both the government and banks -- money much better spent elsewhere.
2. Financial institutions that accepted government funds as part of an effort to shore up confidence but now say they didn't really need them would be unfairly punished. The $165 million in guaranteed bonuses paid out to the dunderheads in A.I.G.'s derivatives group may have sparked the legislation, but it will snag profitable banks like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, along with others, like Citigroup, that are admittedly more deserving of a government crackdown.
3. A rush to pay back government funds -- a possible consequence of the legislation -- would remove capital from the banking system when it needs it most. Many of the banks that received money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, don't technically need it. They could repay enough to exempt them from the strictures of the bills wending their way through Congress. But unless they replace the Treasury Department's money by raising equity, that will reduce their Tier 1 capital, and thereby their willingness to lend and investors' confidence in their cushions to handle future bad loans on their balance sheets.
4. By rushing bills through the House and Senate, legislators have undermined government efforts, and especially the Treasury's. Castigating the effort of Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to persuade A.I.G. to withhold bonuses within the confines of the law has also damaged confidence in the administration's point man in finance and will make it even more difficult to recruit talent to the shockingly undermanned Treasury Department. The pragmatic Mr. Geithner was no doubt trying to give bigger issues the majority of his attention. The A.I.G. debacle may have shown him to be a novice political operative or orator -- but that's not what he was hired for.
5. The Congressional action also endangers other efforts to shore up the financial system and the economy. The government is urging the private sector to participate in programs intended to invigorate the securitization market (the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility) and remove dodgy assets from the banks (the Public-Private Investment Fund). Potential participants are now worried that Congress could use the taxpayer financing of these initiatives to impose greater regulation on the programs after the fact, as it has now done for TARP recipients.
6. Foreign banks and bankers will benefit at the expense of United States banks and bankers. Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, UBS, Barclays and Nomura have wanted for decades to grab market share on Wall Street. Because the tax rules will not affect them, they can now dangle huge retention bonuses and guarantees to the best bankers and traders in the business, from New York to San Francisco to Shanghai. Banking employees based in the United States -- and any United States taxpaying employees elsewhere -- would be sorely tempted by such offers. That could leave the American banks in even worse shape to pay back the government, create credit and generate tax revenue.
There have to be better ways to address the bonus fiasco at A.I.G. In any event, it's more important to think about how to improve the system for the future. That's what Mr. Obama should put firmly at the top of the agenda.

HEADLINE: No More Easy Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- In the bungalow offices here that house Steven Spielberg's newly formed DreamWorks Studios, the swagger is suddenly being dialed back a notch or two.
When the company reorganized itself as an independent operation a few months ago, Stacey Snider, a co-owner of DreamWorks and its chief executive, envisioned herself presiding over a grand new empire. It was a nice fantasy while it lasted.
''You're not presiding over anything,'' Ms. Snider, 47, said that she had quickly realized. ''You're back in the trenches.''
After riding two decades of almost nonstop growth from the cable and video revolutions, a new generation of Hollywood power players is finally being forced to test its mettle. 
These executives -- consummate insiders who enlisted when young and worked their way up -- now find themselves pushing 50 just as some brutal problems are pushing back: a collapse in DVD sales, a credit crisis that has curtailed financing for new movies, a group of corporate owners determined to pull more profits from studios to compensate for hard-hit publishing and broadcast television divisions.
''These folks were born from a place where they knew no failure -- all they could ever see was up, both for the business and their careers,'' said Peter Guber, a former chairman of Sony Pictures who is now a producer and industry elder statesman. ''Now they must confront the unsettling truth that failure is close at hand and that it's on their backs to make sure that doesn't happen.''
To date, the current leaders have had to focus more intently on becoming masters of organizational behavior than rebooting businesses. ''Consensus management is what they know,'' said Mr. Guber. But as studios trim staff and producer deals, many are now hoping to emulate some of the entrepreneurial cowboys -- David Geffen, Barry Diller and Michael Eisner come to mind -- from the generation of moguls that preceded them.
Inevitably, the sudden shift has set off soul-searching among the loose network of allies and adversaries who must rewire the industry in the short span before a next Hollywood generation comes along to replace them. They are tightening belts, lowering expectations and becoming occasionally more cutthroat, but also grappling with some unusually philosophic thoughts about a business for which they now have to fight.
Rough and tumble is not in this generation's DNA. Most hail from elite universities, in contrast to predecessors like Mr. Geffen or Mr. Diller, who had no college degrees. The co-chairmen of Universal Pictures, Marc Shmuger and David Linde, respectively attended Wesleyan and Swarthmore. Ms. Snider has degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Los Angeles, school of law.
''You're looking at a business that is recalibrating itself,'' said Mr. Linde. The 49-year-old executive, who clambered into show business in the 1980s by way of Paramount's New York-based legal department, added, ''I don't think we today know precisely how it's changing.''
Uncertainty breeds stress, even among friends. Last month, for instance, once-close relations between Universal and DreamWorks became strained after Ms. Snider's company initiated talks, without giving Mr. Shmuger's studio an expected heads up, about a distribution arrangement with Walt Disney Studios.
''People are living in fear, and sometimes it manifests itself in bad behavior,'' said Mr. Shmuger, 50, who started in the business during college as a freelance copywriter for movie posters, and who spoke recently of the general climate, not of a specific incident.
''Darwinian'' is one word Patrick Whitesell, a partner at the Endeavor talent agency, uses to describe the current landscape, while Chris Silbermann, president of International Creative Management, calls it ''disorganized.'' Both agreed that people who were formerly able to succeed by clinging to mediocrity suddenly find themselves without cover.
''Everybody has to dig deeper than they ever have,'' said Mr. Whitesell, who came up in television and now represents such stars as Christian Bale and Shia LaBeouf. ''That means more creative deal-making, more complete understanding of the economics of the industry, more hard-edged business decisions.''
Mr. Silbermann said: ''The only way to survive is to get beyond the knee-jerk resistance to change. What's scary is that a lot of people in the movie business aren't admitting that to themselves yet.''
A number of executives and agents declined to be interviewed for this article, citing concerns about competitors or corporate overseers. Among those who preferred not to speak were Richard Lovett, 48, and Bryan Lourd, 49, both of whom are managing partners at the Creative Artists Agency; Rob Moore, 46, the vice chairman of the Viacom-owned Paramount under Brad Grey, who turns 52 this year; and Jeffrey Robinov, the 50-year-old president of the Warner Brothers Pictures Group, which is owned by Time Warner.
They follow a generation of heavyweights who, having come of age with less to lose in the tough economic climate of the 1970s, were more willing to speak openly about their dilemmas. Mr. Lourd and Mr. Lovett were understudies to Michael Ovitz, a highly public superagent who helped to found Creative Artists. Mr. Robinov has climbed rungs under Barry M. Meyer, the eloquent chairman of Warner Brothers who has more than 40 years of show business experience on his resume.
The people who did speak acknowledged that many outside the glamour industry have it much worse. Hollywood is manufacturing one of the only products consumers are still lining up to buy, evidenced by a surge in box office revenue since December. That uptick is not nearly enough to offset the decline in DVD sales, but other businesses -- online streaming, mobile, video-on-demand -- are expanding and could pick up the slack.
''I look at it as growing pains,'' said Donald De Line, 50, a Disney and Paramount executive who is one of the industry's leading producers. ''We're going to figure it out, and the revenue streams will get healthy again. That's the history of Hollywood.''
Enduring financial pain is not why Kevin Misher, a 44-year-old producer who studied finance at the University of Pennsylvania, came to Hollywood. After making his mark as an executive at Universal and Sony, however, Mr. Misher last year lost the comfort of a Paramount producing deal when it was bought out by the studio during widespread cost-cutting.
''You're ultimately fending for yourself here,'' said Mr. Misher. Like more than a few similarly aged ''studio babies,'' he now operates from an office far removed from the company lots, but is still feeding the system films like ''Public Enemies,'' a gangster drama directed by Michael Mann scheduled for release by Universal in July.
But he, too, sees an upside: The tough operating environment has forced producers like himself and Ms. Snider deeper into the moviemaking process.
''This is what you love to do, get on with it,'' Ms. Snider recalls telling herself lately, even as DreamWorks was scrambling to complete financing arrangements that would let it get another round of films in production.
Ms. Snider added that she and the rest of her generation -- having figured out that the real prize is being in the game -- might stay in it a bit longer than intended, instead of clearing the way for thirtysomethings awaiting their turn at the top.
''They're going to have to kick me out,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Energy Secretary's Challenge: Serving Under a Microscope

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As a physicist, Steven Chu has seen atoms suspended in a powerful laser beam and DNA stretched out in a vacuum chamber.
But in his new job as energy secretary, Dr. Chu is observing phenomena he never saw in the science laboratory.
At a recent Senate hearing, for example, he witnessed a junior cabinet member (himself) being systematically dissected by a senior senator (John McCain).
Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, was unhappy when Dr. Chu affirmed the Obama administration's intention to suspend work at a planned nuclear waste site in Nevada. ''What's wrong with Yucca Mountain, Dr. Chu?'' he demanded repeatedly as Dr. Chu tried to explain.
''I think we can do a better job,'' Dr. Chu finally replied. 
For a slight, soft-spoken Nobel laureate, Washington has been an initiation that he has likened to being ''dumped in the deep end of the pool.'' Dr. Chu, 61, was chairman of Stanford's physics department and ran a national research laboratory. But in addition to being verbally slapped around by Mr. McCain, he has been forced to backtrack on some ill-informed comments about OPEC and ordered to spend quickly tens of billions of dollars in stimulus money with virtually no top-level help.
Dr. Chu is still mastering skills like ducking a tough question from a reporter and delivering the all-purpose ''I'll get back to you on that.''
He has admitted his naivete on certain policy questions, like OPEC production quotas, and is still getting used to the scrutiny that comes with a cabinet job.
''I didn't appreciate how much of a public figure you become,'' Dr. Chu said in an interview recently in Milwaukee, where he spent the day talking to scientists about biofuels and touring a home that was being weatherized under a local program.
President Obama has assigned Dr. Chu to carry out some of his central priorities: wean America from dependence on fossil fuels, rebuild the nation's electrical grid and address the challenges of climate change.
The science part of his job is the most rewarding, Dr. Chu said. On his visit to Milwaukee, he visibly brightened when one University of Wisconsin researcher told him about a local entrepreneur who was turning the waste products from cheesemaking into ethanol, which was then blended with gasoline at a nearby convenience store.
''Does he drop some off at the liquor store on his way?'' Dr. Chu asked impishly.
A few hours later, wearing khakis frayed at the cuffs and brown, thick-soled professorial shoes, he dutifully traipsed through the small house that was getting new insulation and appliances to cut the owner's electric bills. When he emerged, five news cameras were set up on the lawn. But to his relief, most of the questions went to Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, who had accompanied him on the tour.
Asked later what part of his job he liked the least, Dr. Chu said: ''The fact that I'm constantly being told that I have to be careful what I say to the press and in public. I can't speculate out loud anymore. Everything I say is taken with total seriousness.''
Yet as he takes on one of the toughest policy and management challenges in government, Dr. Chu brings certain assets that none of his peers or predecessors have had: a Nobel Prize, a YouTube following (for his lectures on climate change) and an unofficial theme song (''Dr. Wu'' by Steely Dan). He is a major celebrity in Taiwan, where scientific achievement is rewarded with rock star status. He is a member of Academica Sinica, Taiwan's most distinguished scholarly society, as was his father.
Dr. Chu is struggling to get his arms around one of the most perplexing and intractable bureaucracies in Washington and to efficiently -- and carefully -- disperse $39 billion in funding from the stimulus package. Most of the department's top appointed positions, including deputy secretary, remain unfilled, leaving him largely reliant on career staff members to manage 114,000 employees and contractors and a budget that has more than doubled this year. The task at times appears overwhelming, and some in Washington quietly wonder if Dr. Chu is in over his head.
Karen Harbert, president of the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, praised Dr. Chu's academic credentials, calling him Mr. Science. But she suggested that the main decisions on energy and climate change policy were being made at the White House by a small team led by Carol Browner, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
''Is he secretary of energy or secretary of research and development?'' Ms. Harbert asked.
Dan Leistikow, the Energy Department's director of public affairs, said that Dr. Chu was a scientist, not a politician, and should be given a little time to adjust.
''A Nobel scientist is more likely to figure out Washington than a career politician is to figure out how to deal with carbon sequestration,'' Mr. Leistikow said.
Dr. Chu came to Washington after serving as director of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, a civilian research organization with 4,000 employees and a $600 million annual budget. Before that, he was a professor and research scientist at Stanford and Bell Laboratories. He shared the 1997 Nobel in physics for his work on cooling and trapping atoms with laser light.
He comes from a family of academic overachievers. His father emigrated from China to study chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and retired as a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. His mother studied economics in China and at M.I.T. One brother, Gilbert, is a professor of medicine and biochemistry at Stanford; the other, Morgan, is a highly regarded intellectual property lawyer in Los Angeles. Dr. Chu once described himself as the academic black sheep of the family.
Morgan Chu said of his brother, ''He's acclimating very well, all things considered.'' He added, ''He has a wonderful set of skills for the job -- an unbending respect for discovering the unvarnished truth and a willingness to challenge established dogma.''
Matt Rogers, an energy expert with McKinsey & Company whom Dr. Chu brought in last month to help speed the pace of Energy Department spending, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Dr. Chu as just a science geek. ''He is a kind man; he is a nice man,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''But he is not a patient man. People are going to have to take a deep breath and realize they're going to be moving at a much quicker pace than they were used to.''
Dr. Chu said he had been frustrated by the job vacancies and the glacial pace of his department. He is eager, he said, to get on with what he sees as his main task: finding and financing the scientific breakthroughs that will end the nation's dependence on carbon-based fuels and solve the climate change problem.
Borrowing an analogy from the world of physics, he said that in Washington, Newton's first law -- a body in motion tends to stay in motion -- does not apply. ''In a bureaucracy, if you start something in motion, it either stops or gets derailed,'' he said. ''You have to keep applying force.''
He intends to keep applying that force, he said, because it could help solve the world's energy and climate change problems.
''If we don't spend this money wisely and invest in new technology that addresses these challenges,'' he said, ''we will have failed the country. We will have failed the world.''

HEADLINE: When the Economy Really Did 'Fall Off a Cliff'

BYLINE: By JEAN STROUSE. 
Jean Strouse is the author of ''Morgan: American Financier'' and the director of the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at The New York Public Library.

 BODY:
IN what may come to be the definitive line about our current economic crisis, Warren Buffett said on the CNBC program ''Squawk Box'' this month that the United States economy has ''fallen off a cliff.''
The most trusted investor in history went on the air to talk, with characteristic candor and humor, about the horrendous truth we pretty much know, possibly in an effort to calm things down and point toward some answers we don't yet know. He proceeded to give his views on what went wrong (''everybody thought house prices could go nothing but up ... so you had $11 trillion of residential mortgage debt built on this theory ''), on people's paralyzing fear and confusion (''We are in a very, very vicious negative feedback cycle .... I don't want this to be the last line of the movie''), and on the absolute necessity of fixing the banks and taking clear, decisive action. 
A look back at the handling of another financial crisis a full century ago underlines the point about decisive action. You just don't want to take the wrong decisive action. Markets today are immeasurably more complex, global, fast-moving and regulated (a lot of good that did) than they were a hundred years ago, but the need for strong leadership has not changed.
In early 1906, the banker Jacob Schiff told a group of colleagues that if the United States did not modernize its banking and currency systems, its economy would, in effect, fall off a cliff -- that the country would ''have such a panic ... as will make all previous panics look like child's play.''
Yet the country failed to reform its financial institutions, and conditions deteriorated steadily over the next 20 months. There was a worldwide credit shortage. The American stock market crashed twice. The young Dow Jones industrial average lost half of its value.
In October 1907, when a panic started among trust companies in New York and terrified depositors lined up to get their money out, Schiff's dire prediction seemed about to come true. The United States had no Federal Reserve, the Treasury secretary did not have much political authority, and the president, Theodore Roosevelt, was off shooting game in Louisiana.
J. Pierpont Morgan, a 70-year-old private banker, quietly took charge of the situation.
In the absence of a central bank, Morgan had for decades been acting as the country's unofficial lender of last resort, gathering reserves and supplying capital to the markets in periods of crisis. For two harrowing weeks in 1907, with the whole world watching, he operated like a general, deploying three young lieutenants to do leg work and supply him with information, and bringing two other leading bankers, James Stillman of National City Bank and George Baker of the First National Bank, into a senior ''trio'' to make executive decisions. (First National and National City eventually combined to form what is now Citigroup -- are the shades of Baker and Stillman writhing over what has become of their descendant institution?)
The Morgan teams ran ''stress tests'' on the unregulated trust companies, figuring out which were impossibly overleveraged and should be allowed to fail, and which were basically sound but crippled by the panic. Once they had determined that a trust was essentially healthy, the bankers supplied it with cash, matching their loans dollar-for-dollar with the trust's collateral assets.
When the New York Stock Exchange nearly closed early one day in October 1907 because financial institutions calling in loans were choking off the market's money supply, Morgan summoned the presidents of New York's major commercial banks to his office and came up with $24 million to lend to the exchange. Next, New York City ran out of cash to meet its payroll and interest obligations; Morgan and company conjured up a $30 million loan and prevented default.
At the end of Week 1, President Roosevelt sent a letter to the press congratulating the ''substantial businessmen who in this crisis have acted with such wisdom and public spirit.'' Shipments of gold were on the way from London to New York, and confidence had returned to the French Bourse, ''owing,'' reported one paper, ''to the belief that the strong men in American finance would succeed in their efforts to check the spirit of the panic.'' During a panic, confidence is almost as good as gold.
At the end of Week 2, Morgan called 50 presidents of trust companies to his private library on East 36th Street, locked the doors, and did not let them out until they had signed on to a final $25 million loan. The scholar of Renaissance art Bernard Berenson told his patron Isabella Stewart Gardner that ''Morgan should be represented as buttressing up the tottering fabric of finance the way Giotto painted St. Francis holding up the falling church with his shoulder.''
Though Morgan had a large sense of public duty, he had not shouldered the falling church out of pure altruism. His self-interest operated on a national scale. His clients -- many of them Europeans who had invested for decades in the emerging American economy through the House of Morgan -- had billions of dollars committed in the United States. In watching over their long-term interests, trying to control the excesses of the business cycle and maintain the value of the dollar, Morgan had come to serve as guardian of American credit in international markets.
His power in 1907 derived not from the size of his own fortune but from the trust placed in him by investors, other bankers and international statesman. After Morgan died in 1913, the newspapers reported his net worth as about $80 million -- roughly $1.7 billion in today's dollars. John D. Rockefeller, already worth a billion in 1913 dollars, is said to have read the figure, shaken his head, and remarked, ''And to think he wasn't even a rich man.''
Trust in Morgan was by no means universal. In 1907, some of his critics charged that he had started the panic in order to scoop up assets at fire-sale prices and line his own pockets. In fact, the Morgan banks lost $21 million that year.
The difficulty today of assigning dollar values to ''toxic'' assets makes Morgan's job look easy. Yet though the amount of money required for the 1907 bailouts is pocket change compared to the current trillions, at the time, the troubles and the numbers seemed enormous.
No single figure, much less a private banker, could wield the kind of power in today's gargantuan collapsing markets that Morgan had a hundred years ago. And so far, not even the combined official powers of the Fed and Treasury have been able to stop the cascading disasters. Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said recently that he couldn't remember a time ''maybe even in the Great Depression, when things went down quite so fast, quite so uniformly around the world.''
Perhaps new economic leadership will emerge during this crisis, under our gifted, charismatic president. It seems likely to consist of people who have the kind of experience, judgment and authority Morgan had -- possibly a new ''trio'' made up of the current Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke; Paul Volcker; and Warren Buffett.
Only Mr. Bernanke is formally in a position to exercise that high authority now, which he is doing -- he announced last week that the Fed would inject an extra $1 trillion into the financial system. Mr. Volcker, chairman of the White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board, could easily be promoted to a more dominant role. Mr. Buffett has already stepped up in public, praising the steps the Fed took last fall to insure money markets and commercial paper as ''vital in keeping the place going'' (if the Fed hadn't acted, Mr. Buffett told his CNBC interviewer, ''we'd be meeting at McDonald's this morning'').
Moreover, Mr. Buffett said he could ''guarantee'' that in five years or so ''our great economic machine'' will be running a lot faster than it is now, with the government playing an enormous role in how quickly it recovers. Last fall he declared that we had just been through an ''economic Pearl Harbor.'' Last week he said that in order to fight this economic war the country has to unite behind President Obama, the government has to deliver ''very, very'' clear messages and we all have to focus on three jobs:
Job 1: win the economic war.
Job 2: win the economic war.
Job 3: win the economic war.
Just what Morgan would have said.

HEADLINE: At N.F.L. Meeting, Money Issues Hover

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
When the N.F.L. holds its annual meeting of owners, general managers and coaches each spring, it resembles little more than a very large -- and very luxurious -- water-cooler conversation. There is plenty of gossip and company business. And this year, as in almost every other workplace, a lot of fretting about the economy. 
 This year's meeting opens Monday, and money will be the common thread in many of the sessions, particularly among the 32 team owners. 
 How much is the league making, and how much will revenue diminish if the economy continues its slide? 
 How much will the players union, with DeMaurice Smith as its new executive director, want when negotiations open soon for a new collective bargaining agreement? 
 And how much is at stake if the owners lock out players when the current deal expires in two years, as many agents and players suspect owners are already preparing to do? 
 The discussion will include consideration of expanding the regular season to 17 or 18 games, one method to increase revenue that would have to be negotiated with players as part of the new labor deal. (There will not be a vote, though.) 
 But that is for the long-range thinkers. For everyone else, this meeting will focus on rules adjustments -- relatively minor ones -- many of them designed to enhance player safety. They include the elimination of the bunch formation on onside kicks and the wedge formation using three or more players on kickoff returns, in an attempt to reduce the risk of injuries. Hits to the helmet of a defenseless receiver made with a forearm or shoulder could also be prohibited, adding to the helmet-to-helmet ban that the N.F.L. cracked down on last year. And officials will be told to make horse-collar tackles and low hits on quarterbacks a point of emphasis. 
 Also part of the discussion is whether to be able to review a play in which a quarterback drops the ball in the act of throwing. The competition committee wants to allow referees to use replay to determine if it is a fumble or an incomplete pass, a call Referee Ed Hochuli got wrong in Week 2 last season, almost certainly costing the San Diego Chargers a victory. 
 If the teams approve the change, the play would be reviewable, just as the down-by-contact decision became reviewable two years ago. 
 ''We've had some high-profile plays this year,'' said Rich McKay, the competition committee co-chairman. ''We think we would propose that would be reviewable and think that is a play in which people play right through the fumble recovery, so we would like to treat it like down by contact.'' 
 The Chargers are also at the center of a potential change to the draft order. It would mean that playoff teams would pick according to when they were eliminated from the postseason. In the 2009 draft, the Chargers, with a worse record, will draft ahead of the Indianapolis Colts, whom they defeated in the first round. The change would not take place until the 2010 draft. 
 Perhaps the biggest rules conversation will be about one that will not be changed. Overtime -- the bane of Donovan McNabb's existence -- will remain the same after a survey of players showed strong support for the current sudden-death format, even though the team that won the overtime coin toss won the game 63.3 percent of the time, 43.4 percent of the time on the first possession. Those figures are so lopsided that fans and members of the news media discussed changes during the 2008 season, and even McKay and Ray Anderson, the N.F.L.'s executive vice president for football operations, called them troubling. Players, though, had a different view. 
 ''Myself, I was a little surprised at how adamant the players were about not wanting to change the current overtime system and agreeing with Rich's assessment that they say, Look, the excitement is there, everyone has got an opportunity to win this thing in regulation,'' Anderson said. ''They were pretty adamant that extended play time, when you're playing 20 games, exposes you to injury risk, and they'd just as soon say, Let's battle it out during regulation, and if you can't win it in regulation, you take your chances in overtime.'' 
 EXTRA POINTS
 New England Coach Bill Belichick was the dominant figure at last year's meetings, answering questions for the first time about the Patriots' illicit videotaping follies and even explaining himself to owners and coaches behind closed doors. This year, Belichick is not expected at the meetings at all, staying behind to work on draft preparation. With Belichick absent, the most in-demand coach will probably be Denver's Josh McDaniels, who left Belichick's staff to take over the Broncos and promptly angered quarterback Jay Cutler by entertaining trade offers for him because McDaniels hoped to acquire Matt Cassel. The N.F.L. meetings rarely produce big trades the way baseball's winter meetings do, but the Cutler standoff will keep McDaniels's table full when coaches meet with reporters this week.

HEADLINE: Recession Takes Toll on Direct Mail Ads

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
Responding to the financial crisis, American companies sharply reduced their spending on direct-mail marketing last year, according to the Winterberry Group, a marketing consultancy. Winterberry said this was the first such decline in more than 60 years of record-keeping. The company arrived at the figures by surveying 305 companies in the direct-mail industry. 
 The cuts represented at least nine billion pieces of mail, according to Winterberry's analysis of Postal Service reports. Not surprisingly, credit card and mortgage service solicitations dropped the most sharply, falling 21.8 percent and 38.8 percent in volume respectively, according to Mintel Comperemedia, a direct-mail tracking firm.
 Winterberry said the cuts were caused primarily by the financial crisis, but also by rising postal, paper and labor costs, which have pushed marketers toward online solicitations. Winterberry said 45 percent of the marketers in its survey were switching to cheaper paper and raw materials to cut costs. ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: With Green Intentions, Entering the Realm Of Co-op Board Politics

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Seated at an oval table with spreadsheets and calculators at the ready, the six-member board of River Arts, a 244-unit co-op development in Washington Heights, mulled over the pros and cons of investing in solar power. 
 Ed Lloyd, the board president, was not convinced that the co-op would get its initial investment back. 
 ''I don't want us to be all caught up in green and end up in the red,'' he said. ''I'm as environmentally conscious as the next person but we can't base it all on that.''
 Jack Fogle, a resident who had worked for more than a year with the co-op's energy committee to sell the idea, pressed on. 
 ''If we take the risk, that money will pay us back for the next 30 years,'' said Mr. Fogle, who is also the building's manager.
 The politics at residential buildings, which are notoriously contentious, have become even more so as environmental issues have entered the fray. At many co-ops and condominiums, the members of energy and green committees lobby and cajole their neighbors to embrace projects that sometimes require upfront money, like solar panels, but more often just demand interest and effort on the part of residents, like recycling correctly.
 It can be a thankless job that sometimes is met with indifference, skepticism and even outright hostility. But environmentally motivated residents say they operate on the theory of, ''If I don't do it, who will?'' as it was put by Sharon Lee Ritchie, who started a green committee in her co-op in Harlem.
 While more fervent advocates can gravitate toward weighty projects -- a green roof or solar panels, for example -- mundane measures can make more of an impact, experts say. But no matter what the investment, environmental consciousness can be a tough sell in a bad economy, especially when it can takes years to recoup the initial cost for some projects. 
 At River Arts, one argument that was used to sell the board on the idea of solar energy was the savings achieved by Cabrini Terrace, another co-op in Washington Heights, which went solar in 2007 and shared its figures with the River Arts board.
 Frank Rathbun, a spokesman for Community Associations Institute, a national group that represents homeowner associations, said that if co-op boards ''can show savings, the homeowners are going to be a lot more receptive.'' 
 That has been the case at River Arts, which overlooks the Hudson River on Riverside Drive. In 2007, members of an energy committee had pushed to install solar panels to produce part of the building's electricity, but the board balked because it would take 10 years to recover the investment through energy savings, Mr. Fogle said.
 Since then, new federal, state and city tax credits have become available, reducing River Arts' net cost of a $400,000 system to $10,000 -- meaning it would take about one year for the co-op to recover the investment, Mr. Fogle said. The co-op expects its solar power to eventually reduce energy costs by $7,000 a year. At a committee meeting in January to plan the presentation for board members and shareholders, tensions rose as discussions stalled on details like how much information shareholders needed to hear about the timeline for the project.
 ''People! People!'' Mr. Fogle shouted. ''You don't need to give people more than is necessary.'' He walked out of the room, returning a few minutes later in a calmer state.
 Finally, at a meeting in February, the hard work seemed to be paying off. 
 ''Financially, it sounds like the numbers are reasonable,'' conceded Mr. Lloyd, the board president.
 There is little question that the green movement has gained significant traction in recent years. 
 In New York, city officials say residential buildings produce more carbon dioxide emissions -- 30 percent -- than any other large sources of emissions, such as commercial buildings or transportation. Nearly two-thirds of those emissions come from the use of electricity and natural gas.
 Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, said he knew interest in greening buildings was high when he called a conference on the topic in late 2007 and a standing-room-only crowd of 500 people came.
 ''The green-building movement is now commonplace,'' he said. ''It's a combination of economics, saving the environment and this whole notion that the measures we take enhance the quality of life,'' he said.
 Yet there are still battles to be fought, and not all of them related to money. At River Arts, part of the challenge is to win over apathetic residents.
 One member of the energy committee, Julie Ruben, said that an informational meeting on the idea for solar in December drew barely a dozen people. The co-op residents will ultimately have to vote to approve the plan.
 And at another co-op building in Washington Heights, the residents' input was nearly avoided altogether at first. Yonah Zur, 31, a musician who lives with his wife and young son, got a compost pile going in his co-op's backyard with the knowledge of only the few members of the building's garden committee. He said that compost bins are often mistakenly assumed to smell and attract rodents, and he worried about the reaction from the rest of the owners.
 ''I wanted to make it work and then show the neighbors,'' Mr. Zur said.
 After eight months of composting food scraps and leaves by himself in a spot not visible from most of the building's 120 units, Mr. Zur put up signs in the elevator last May, announcing a garden clean-up and a compost lesson. Now as many as 10 apartments use four compost bins. But one neighbor did not like the aesthetics of a tall bin that held a pile of leaves outside her window. 
 ''She was complaining about the look of it,'' Mr. Zur said. The problem was solved by moving the bin eight feet away from the neighbor's apartment. 
 Many of those pushing for greening buildings argue that any step, no matter how small, helps create a commitment that can lead to more ambitious undertakings. 
 Ms. Ritchie, the co-op owner in Harlem, said that she did not feel it was realistic to go for big energy projects when her 241-unit co-op in Harlem already has a list of must-do capital projects. So she turned her attention to ''doable'' things like a clothing and fabric recycling program, partnering with Wearable Collections, a local business that does curbside pickups. 
 Experts from the U.S. Green Building Council, a nonprofit group that certifies buildings for energy efficiency and other environmental features, say that it is the unglamorous measures that are beneficial but often overlooked. Those include insulating steam pipes, sealing leaks around windows, weather-stripping doors, investing in a gas-fired boiler or co-generation, sub-metering electricity so owners pay for their own consumption, or even making sure lights are not left on all the time.
 Ms. Ritchie, who owns an event planning and design business, said she convinced a skeptical building superintendent -- ''just humor me for a week,'' she told him -- to try out eco-friendly cleaning products, which come in such highly concentrated formulas, she said, that they now save the building $500 a month in cleaning supplies. 
 Still, for almost two years, her building's green committee had only one member: Ms. Ritchie. ''I just think people are busy and they're happy to participate without spending any of their time,'' she said of her rewarding but lonely greening experience.
 She was overjoyed this month when seven new volunteers agreed to join her committee.

HEADLINE: Tempo of Audits Drops for Those Making $1 Million or More

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
While the number of wealthy Americans swelled in the last couple of years, they faced less scrutiny from tax authorities, according to a study of government data by outside researchers. 
 The Internal Revenue Service audited only about four of every 100 Americans' returns with income of at least $1 million in the fiscal year ended October 2008, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research organization affiliated with Syracuse University. 
 The I.R.S. acknowledged that it had audited a smaller portion of these returns than in years past, but disputed the group's interpretation of the data. The government calculated the audit rate at 5.6 percent among millionaires, compared with 4.4 percent by T.R.A.C.
 The government estimated that the chance of a millionaire being audited declined last year by 19 percent -- significant, but less severe than the 36 percent drop claimed by T.R.A.C. 
 ''We essentially audited as many millionaires as in the previous year, but there were more returns,'' said Terry Lemons, an I.R.S. spokesman. The I.R.S. said it audited just over 23,000 returns of the nearly 340,000 filed by millionaires in 2007. That compares with just over 21,800 returns filed by 398,000 millionaires in 2008.
 While the number of millionaires was growing, the I.R.S. had to shift its focus last year to processing tax rebate checks related to the first economic stimulus package, from the Bush administration last summer. 
 Mr. Lemons added that wealthy Americans with at least $10 million in income still stood the highest chance of any income group of being audited -- about 10 percent.
 T.R.A.C., which has a long-running dispute with the I.R.S. over how to interpret data, said an agency official told it on Friday that audit rates for previous years had been misreported, leading to a discrepancy between the two organizations on the size of the decline for audits of millionaires.
 Because it takes years to conduct audits, scrutiny last year almost certainly involved those tax returns filed while the economy was still booming, before the subprime mortgage collapse, stock market plunge and federal bailout of the financial system.
 ''Given the lag between the year that income is received, a return is filed, and then becomes subject to audit, the drop in the audits occurred for those returns with income earned at the height of the real estate boom, just before the economy turned sour,'' the T.R.A.C. report said.
 The income of the 400 wealthiest Americans swelled in 2006, to an average of $263 million, according to I.R.S. data. Since 1996, this group's share of the nation's total wealth has nearly doubled to more than 22 percent.

HEADLINE: Free Room and Board Give a Job New Allure

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. 

 BODY:
As a resident assistant at Seton Hall University, Mark Cantine has brokered peace between warring roommates, called for medical transport after a student became dangerously drunk, nudged one freshman who was sleeping all day into counseling and rescued another who had locked himself in his bathroom -- twice. 
 In exchange, Mr. Cantine got rescued himself -- from living at home in nearby Montclair, N.J., with his parents and four younger siblings. Compensation for the position was free room -- a single, at that -- and board, a $10,000 value. ''If I didn't get it, I was planning to commute,'' he said. ''It's allowed me to stay on campus and really get involved.''
 With the economy in shambles and the cost of higher education spiraling ever higher, being an R.A., as the job is known, has a newfound cachet: 168 Seton Hall students applied this spring for 30 spots, up from 104 applicants two years ago. At New York University, where they use the more common term of resident adviser, the number of graduate students interested in a position jumped to 246 last year from 148. At Clemson University in South Carolina, applications more than doubled in the last year, to 240, while at the University of Virginia, 390 students submitted applications, nearly 100 more than usual. 
 The position -- part therapist, part event planner, part enforcer -- has long been seen as a leadership role that bolsters a resume, but now is increasingly embraced as a financial crutch. Tara J. Hart, director of housing and residence life at Seton Hall, a Roman Catholic university where about half of the 5,000 undergraduates live on campus, said she was wary of aspiring R.A.'s attracted mainly by the benefits.
 ''When we're recruiting students, we put out there that if you're doing this for the money, you will have earned it by Halloween,'' she said. ''The nature of this job is that much will be asked of you.''
 Norbert Dunkel, president of the Association of College and University Housing Officers International, called the nationwide growth in R.A. applications ''substantial'' and said, ''the obvious reason is the economy.'' Compounding the crunch, he said, are people like Mr. Cantine who want to come back for a second (or, in his case, third) year as an R.A., which typically is thought of as a one-year job.
 Beyond the short-term savings, the experience can also help in an increasingly slim job market. 
 ''These kids learn problem-solving, conflict resolution, crisis management, communication skills and programming,'' said Mr. Dunkel, director of housing at the University of Florida. ''You can translate that skill set to any career. It doesn't matter whether you're a teacher in a classroom or an accountant.''
 At Seton Hall, resident assistants help students negotiate the required roommate contracts in the fall. They respond to noise complaints and report under-age drinking. They log reports of clogged toilets and broken door locks. They conduct health and safety inspections of dorm rooms. They organize at least five social events a semester -- a pizza party, perhaps, or a volleyball game, or round-table discussion with faculty. 
 And they mediate roommate conflicts. And mediate.
 Tehmina Qureshi, a senior resident assistant here, joked that the up-close view of Middle East strife she had as an intern at the Pakistani Mission to the United Nations prepared her for the conflicts on the third floor of Boland Hall.
 There was, for example, the imbroglio involving a student who complained about an odor emanating from her roommate's closet. Ms. Qureshi, who could not smell anything, tried to resolve the problem, but the student wound up moving to a different room -- and eventually out of Seton Hall altogether. ''She really wanted to go to music school,'' she said.
 Then there was the awkwardness when a student came to Ms. Qureshi complaining that she felt like she and her roommate, who shared a major and many friends, were attached at the hip. Ms. Qureshi encouraged the woman to broach the subject with the roommate -- who, it turned out, also felt they were spending too much time together.
 ''Usually, both have the issue and neither wants to talk about it,'' Ms. Qureshi said. ''A lot of the problems arise from a lack of communication.''
 Ms. Qureshi, who moved to New Jersey from Pakistan as a girl, has two younger siblings, one also in college; she says she is happy she could help defray the cost of her education for her father, who owns a convenience store. ''It's a great gift,'' she said of the R.A. position.
 University officials are keenly aware of the stresses associated with the job. Tom Ellett, associate vice president for student affairs at New York University, said he was careful to praise R.A.'s for planning interesting activities and for crisis work.
 ''If someone is involved in suicide prevention, they get a handwritten thank-you note from me,'' he said. ''You have to make them feel important, and one way is by listening to them.''
 Aware that therapists often need therapy, Cornell has residence hall directors -- full-time administrators who meet with the R.A.'s individually every two weeks. 
 ''It's always a general check-in,'' said Mary Ann Krisa, a residence hall director who oversees 16 resident advisers, who in turn oversee 575 students. '' 'How are you doing? Stress level: good, bad or ugly? What's going on on your floor?' One of the things about working with Cornell students is that they're all extremely sharp and they're going 100 miles per hour constantly. But even R.A.'s get tired.''
 With increasing competition, the selection process has become more intense. At Seton Hall, students must have at least a 2.5 grade-point average to apply. They write essays and submit references, then have group interviews in which they confront challenges like, this year, planning a December event about healthy eating with a $50 budget. (''We get a sense of how they would function in a team,'' Mrs. Hart said.) Then, individual interviews.
 Students learned Friday whether they were chosen. Michael Ojo, a sophomore, was thrilled to get picked for a second year in a row.
 Mr. Ojo, whose parents live in Manalapan, said he has enjoyed good relationships with the 28 freshmen in his hall, and is especially proud of an event he helped organize with the African Student Association called ''Rep Your Nation,'' in which students of all nationalities shared their culture.
 ''If I hadn't been chosen I'd be commuting from home, which would be two hours traveling every day,'' Mr. Ojo said. ''It's a big help.''

HEADLINE: Preaching the Benefits of Renting Computing Power

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Marc Benioff was a visionary, seeing vast potential in selling business software as a service over the Web. 
 Today, he's just another executive selling so-called cloud computing, the bandwagon du jour in the technology industry. 
 Mr. Benioff, the animated chief executive of Salesforce.com, helped revive the idea of having businesses lease time on computer servers rather than buy the equipment and software. 
 This pitch has paid off for Salesforce, based in San Francisco, which just celebrated its 10-year anniversary and crossed the $1 billion mark in annual revenue. Now, just about every major technology player, including Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Amazon.com, offers computing services on a rental model. 
 Mr. Benioff describes himself as ''the Billy Graham of cloud computing.'' And last week, he began a revival tour, to evangelize Salesforce's technology to a few hundred people at a time in hotels around the country. 
 ''I am sure there are C.E.O.'s who are not willing to do this or are afraid to do this,'' Mr. Benioff said. ''I feel a need to do this.'' 
 During a gathering last week here in Silicon Valley, Mr. Benioff took the stage at a Marriott hotel in front of current and potential Salesforce customers. A bear of a man at a full-figured 6-foot-5, Mr. Benioff looked more like an agitated linebacker than a software advocate, traipsing back and forth across the stage with his arms flailing and voice booming as he delivered a sermon about cutting capital costs during a down economy. 
 True to his ''one convert at a time'' mentality, he was not afraid to do a little laying on of hands. 
 One customer popped on stage to demonstrate how his business had tweaked Salesforce's software to suit its needs. When the man struggled to get the software working, Mr. Benioff held him by the shoulder and called an employee up to fix the problem. Mr. Benioff then jumped into some patter about Salesforce's 24-hour customer service and gave out his e-mail address.
 His message seems to resonate with businesses during these tumultuous times. In February, Salesforce reported a 34 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue, to $290 million, and net income of $14 million, up from $7.4 million in the same period last year. The sales and earnings figures beat analysts' expectations. 
 NetSuite, a smaller competitor, last month reported a 31 percent jump in fourth-quarter revenue, to $41 million. 
 Salesforce and NetSuite face a raft of competition from some of the largest technology companies around, including Oracle and Microsoft, which have lumbered into the software rental game. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Sun Microsystems sell access to their data centers on a pay-per-use model. 
 Mr. Benioff welcomes such competition, saying that such rivalries only raise the credibility of the business model. 
 ''Every time someone buys a server, a switch or a data center, I have failed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Common Sense to the Rescue of Policy

POWER RULES
 How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy
 By Leslie H. Gelb
 334 pages. Harper. $27.99.
 Few Americans know the inner world of American foreign policy -- its feuds, follies and fashions -- as well as Leslie H. Gelb. He served Lyndon B. Johnson in the Pentagon and Jimmy Carter in the State Department. He was a foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times and president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Power Rules'' builds on that lifetime of experience with power and is a witty and acerbic primer for moderate pragmatists.
 His chief targets are ideological dogmatism and imperialist hubris. America should be unafraid to exercise power, but it must be mindful that power's reach usually exceeds its grasp. According to Mr. Gelb liberal Democrats should stop apologizing when they use American power, and conservative Republicans should stop believing that no problem can resist the application of American force. Both need to understand that power is wasted when it's used unwisely. The chief missing ingredient in United States foreign policy, he argues, is common sense. 
 Common sense for Mr. Gelb means an anti-utopian, evidence-based, pragmatic, moderate foreign policy focusing on achievable goals, rather than unattainable and hubristic master strategies like trying to foster democracy in countries where you can't drink the water.
 We can't drink the water in Afghanistan, and Mr. Gelb advises that America should abandon ambitions of state or nation building there and concentrate instead on eliminating Al Qaeda. Military force alone can achieve little. To marginalize Al Qaeda and deny it sanctuary, America needs to find someone -- President Hamid Karzai or a democratically elected successor -- who can make the deals with southern Pashtun tribal leaders that might pull them away from the Taliban and from Al Qaeda. Engaging India, Iran, Pakistan and Russia will help provide Afghanistan the minimum external guarantees it needs to survive as a state, while cunning alliance building by the Afghan government with local tribal leaders in the south may help isolate the insurgents and drain away their popular support.
 Surging the United States military into the south of Afghanistan will help chiefly as a political demonstration of commitment. It tells the insurgents the West is there to stay, at least until political stability is irreversible. 
 Even these pragmatic and modest goals may not be attainable. America, Mr. Gelb fears, is ''at the point of declining as a nation and a world power.'' It still has no competitor at the top of the power pyramid, but its long-term dominance is being eroded by unmet challenges. No country with a debt America's size, he points out, has ever remained dominant for long, and no country with schools as lacking in rigor as America's has much hope of dominating a global economy for long either.
 President Obama can't hope to achieve much overseas, Mr. Gelb argues, unless he first rebuilds at home: better health care, decent education, less dependence on foreign oil and less of the even more deadly dependence on foreign creditors.
 Reckoning with the limits of American power is not a new challenge. Tiny states like Cuba have defied America for 50 years, Mr. Gelb says, and ideologically resolute ones like Iran have bested it for 30. What is new is the painful discovery that although America can win any pitched battle it fights, it cannot stop any moderately cunning terrorist from inflicting terrible casualties on its soldiers and civilians.
 Asymmetric threats are new, but they can be met by adapting doctrine, training and equipment. Military superiority remains an essential component of American power -- Mr. Gelb is against cuts in defense spending -- but force must be the servant of politics and diplomacy, not its master. Unless the threat of military force is backed by what he calls a ''power package'' of diplomatic threats and political inducements, force alone can rarely achieve its goals. 
 Mr. Gelb's favorite test case of success in the application of the power package is Libya. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had felt the wrath of Reagan's jets, so the application of force concentrated his mind. But it was the package of political inducements offered by President George W. Bush that persuaded him to stop supporting terrorists and abandon his nuclear ambitions. 
 At the same time America needs allies and partners to get anything done. Both Britain and the much despised United Nations were helpful in bringing Libya into the fold. America has to realize it can't achieve its goals without allies, and its allies need to accept that they can't solve problems without American leadership.
 Nothing will happen on global climate change, for example, unless the American administration forms a green coalition among the next most powerful countries in the world: China, India, Russia and the Europeans. Canada, my country, ought to be on the list -- it's an energy superpower, supplying almost a quarter of United States energy requirements, and it's also a green energy pioneer -- but it merits not a single mention in ''Power Rules.'' The point here is not to carp, but to reinforce Mr. Gelb's own message: America can't afford to ignore friends.
 Mr. Gelb says he believes in problem-solving coalitions, but he doesn't want Gulliver tied down by the United Nations or other multilateral bodies. Indeed, he seems allergic to creating new multilateral institutions.
 Case-by-case problem solving has the virtue of lowering global expectations -- and fears -- of American power, but Mr. Gelb's approach may miss the particular challenge of our current situation. It also forgets when America showed greatness. America's true glory days were moments of institution building, when Roosevelt and then Truman created the United Nations, NATO and the Bretton Woods financial system. 
 Talk of Bretton Woods II may be overambitious, but some new global architecture of financial regulation and oversight, or at least more effective coordination of national regulation, is going to be necessary once we touch bottom in this financial crisis. American financial misrule may have gotten us into this mess, but it will be American leadership that will have to dig us out, with the help of solvent allies with good banking systems, like Canada's, among others.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 8, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Books of The Times review on March 23, about ''Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy,'' by Leslie H. Gelb, misstated the amount of energy Canada supplies to the United States in a passage about the need for powerful countries to act together on global climate change. Canada supplies about one-quarter of the United States' energy imports, not about one-quarter of its energy requirements.

HEADLINE: Costly Home Health Care

 BODY:
Health care reformers have long advocated providing more care to patients in their own homes or communities instead of treating them in costly institutions like hospitals and nursing homes. So it is disturbing to learn that charges have risen well above reasonable levels in one segment of the home health care market -- short-term care provided to Medicare beneficiaries after, or sometimes instead of, hospitalization. The problem is compounded by fraud. 
 In its annual report to Congress this month, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group of independent experts, concluded that home health agencies have been paid significantly more than their cost of providing the services in recent years. Their average margins were about 16.5 percent a year between 2002 and 2007, and, even after some rate adjustments, are expected to exceed 12 percent this year in the midst of a recession. Experts say there is room to reduce payments substantially without harming the provision of such services as skilled nursing care, physical or occupational therapy, speech therapy and medical social work.
 The overpayment problem is exacerbated by fraud and manipulation, according to a report issued recently by the Government Accountability Office. The G.A.O. looked at seven states that experienced the highest growth rate in Medicare home health expenditures from 2002 through 2006 and found a substantial number of abuses. These included overstating a beneficiary's condition to get an improperly high reimbursement, billing for patients who were not homebound and thus not eligible for home health care, and making unnecessary visits.
 Some of the worst abuses were in Texas and Florida, where spending growth was highest. In Houston, more than 90 percent of the beneficiaries reviewed in one audit had improperly been given the most severe clinical rating. In Miami-Dade County, a disproportionately high number of diabetics were getting skilled nursing visits every day to administer their insulin shots despite lack of evidence that they needed any help; some were coached on how to lie about their need for assistance.
 Federal officials are taking steps to reduce fraud, and Congress is pushing them to do more. The bigger cost issue -- paying too much across the board for home health services to Medicare beneficiaries -- would largely be solved by President Obama's budget proposals. His budget plan calls for saving a hefty $37 billion over the next decade by reducing Medicare's projected home health care expenditures in order to help finance his broader health care reforms. 
 Home health care companies are already complaining that the cuts will hurt patients, but their industry is one of the most profitable parts of Medicare; it needs to do its fair share to curb the relentless surge in Medicare spending. If the nation's health system is to move toward greater reliance on home care, it needs to be sure it is paying the right price.

HEADLINE: Broken Trust Shakes Web From Farmer To Cow

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: FERNDALE, Calif. 

 BODY:
 In the verdant Eel River Valley of Northern California, where everyone is tied by blood or business, a dairy farmer named John Vevoda does his part. Though the roars of tractors have deafened an ear, and decades of nudging cows while milking have ruined a shoulder, he accepts his role and fulfills it.
 He and his family keep a herd of 600. He employs Alan, Alberto, Dave, Edgar, Jesus, Jose and Umberto. He pays his bills. He recycles. And every two days, he forwards thousands of gallons of raw milk to the Humboldt Creamery, which rises five miles away beside the twisting, rushing Eel River.
 The creamery looms as well over the area's economy, linking many through an understood compact: the 50 farmers who own it as part of a cooperative, including Mr. Vevoda; its 200 employees; on and on, down to those who count on its support of the annual Easter Seals telethon. Just recently the creamery began selling preferred stock so people here can own a piece of something local and organic that makes them proud. 
 But that delicate compact snapped last month when the creamery's longtime chief executive left one day and never came back, though he passed on word of possible irregularities in the books. Now the 80-year-old creamery is in jeopardy, as are the livelihoods of people like Mr. Vevoda. He joins the ranks of so many others who feel betrayed -- by the Bernard Madoffs, the American International Groups and the predatory lenders who have come to define this distrusting time.
 Mr. Vevoda's dairy-farm view of the world makes it hard for him to accept what has happened in Humboldt County. The way he sees it, you can't just skip a milking, or stay in bed when a cow is calving. These animals count on you, and you count on these animals. The same with people.
 One Thursday about a month ago, while Mr. Vevoda worked his farm, his herding dogs galumphing about him, the creamery's chief executive, Rich Ghilarducci, left for some business in San Francisco. He and John grew up in nearby Rio Dell, and Rich was in the same class as one of John's sisters. Everyone here knows Rich.
 Late the next day, a San Francisco law firm whose specialties include white-collar criminal defense called the creamery's lawyer with cryptic news. Expect to receive Mr. Ghilarducci's resignation letter any minute now. Also, you could have problems with the creamery's financial statement, so you might want to stop selling those preferred stocks.
 The chief operating officer, Len Mayer, frantically kept calling Mr. Ghilarducci. Finally, he just left a message: ''Rich. Give me a clue.''
 He has not received an answer. Mr. Ghilarducci and his wife, it seems, have left their Rio Dell home, a silver teapot on the stove, a classic car in the garage. A local newspaper, The Ferndale Enterprise, later found him at his second residence, in Arizona, and published a photograph of his right arm closing the door to questions.
 The central question -- what happened? -- essentially remains unanswered. Mr. Mayer would not provide a figure for the creamery's financial hole, although he acknowledged that the $400,000 raised through the sale of the preferred stock could not yet be returned to investors; it's been spent. He also said the creamery had been in touch with three federal investigative agencies in San Francisco.
 The damage, Mr. Mayer said, ''is big enough to threaten the future of the creamery.''
 Mr. Ghilarducci's lawyer, Elliot R. Peters, declined to say why his client abruptly left his job, home, colleagues and friends. But he said that Mr. Ghilarducci had ''never done anything he thought was contrary to the interests of the Humboldt Creamery.''
 In fact, he said, Mr. Ghilarducci had worked hard for the creamery, and had used $200,000 of his own money -- taken from a home equity line of credit -- to cover the creamery's payroll last year.
 Mr. Mayer, though, said he was unaware of any financial rescue by Mr. Ghilarducci, beyond investments he had made along with other creamery executives. As for whether Mr. Ghilarducci has ever done anything contrary to the creamery's interests, Mr. Mayer answered in this way:
 ''He ups and resigns without any warning? And he's not reachable?''
 On the Saturday after the resignation, while Mr. Vevoda tended to his Holsteins, unawares, creamery executives holed up at a bed-and-breakfast and pored over financial records. On the Sunday, while the Vevoda family attended church, the executives told the creamery's nine board members, all dairy farmers, what little they knew: holes in the financial records, an inability to recreate the balance sheet, and Rich in the wind.
 Around 7 that Monday morning, a board member came to the Vevoda farm with a statement about to be issued by the creamery. It included phrases like independent inquiry and sudden resignation and inaccurate financial statements.
 Mr. Vevoda exploded. He ordered the man to the family kitchen, because Kris, his wife, needed to be in on this. He then called his son and partner, Robert, and said, Get your butt up here. The three Vevodas stood around the dark granite counter while the board member, who was not offered coffee, stammered that he didn't know any more.
 John yelled, Kris cried and Robert kept asking, ''Are we getting paid?'' But after a while, what can you say?
 John Vevoda, 56, body aching, stared out the kitchen windows, past the hummingbird feeders, past the welcome flag waving over the herb garden, to the acres of Vevoda pasture. He thought of his 35 years as a dairyman and the many trials he had endured, none greater than this: 
 In 1987, his first wife, Margaret, and their 5-year-old son, John, drowned while swimming in the Eel River. Another son, the son now standing beside him in the kitchen, saw it happen; he was 9. 
 Things went haywire after that. But through all the drinking that never rinsed away the grief, Robert Vevoda, 31, recalls that his father made him breakfast every morning, packed his lunch for school and kept the dairy going.
 Finally, John Vevoda's mother, Lotta, intervened by tracking down a high school girlfriend of John's from the Bay Area. Kris was the mother of three children, divorced and working as an assistant bank manager. When her secretary said someone was asking for her by her maiden name, she hesitated about taking a call from that deep in the past.
 She took the call. 
 As he stared into the green beyond the kitchen, Mr. Vevoda did some math. The creamery owed them $120,000 for the milk they produced in January, money needed to pay bills. And they had another $380,000 invested in the dairy cooperative. All of it now at risk or gone.
 That night, John Vevoda got out of bed and threw up.
 For the next several days, forensic accountants hired by the creamery worked in Mr. Ghilarducci's office. There, under the gaze of dozens of his stuffed toy cows, they tried to make sense of the books.
 The creamery's executives then met with the cooperative's 50 farmers in the turf building at the county fairgrounds. After a somber discussion, and with one executive near tears, the farmers voted unanimously to defer $2 million in payments for their January milk so the creamery could keep the doors open, pay employees, calm antsy vendors -- and buy time while trying to figure out how to survive.
 Matters had become that precarious. ''If, say, the guy who sells us lids for our milk cartons wants to get paid immediately, everything grinds to a halt,'' Mr. Mayer said.
 When the fragile compact is broken -- when that responsibility to one another is betrayed -- the repercussions are felt by people far removed from, say, an office filled with stuffed toy cows. There are the dairy farmers, some of whose families helped establish the Humboldt Creamery cooperative in 1929. The local Easter Seals telethon, which no longer has the creamery's financial support. The creamery employees, truckers, suppliers of lids. Their families.
 The Vevodas. John's mother, who lent them $10,000. Their employees. Their employees' families, including Edgar's two children, one 5 years old, the other 4 months old. The cows.
 With their January payment short about $100,000, the Vevodas asked for time from their vendors and lenders. But the bank went ahead and processed a $20,000 mortgage payment. And one of their feed suppliers said that from now on, it's cash on delivery.
 The Vevodas faced some hard choices; after all, Kris Vevoda said, ''You can't just open the gates and tell the girls to have a nice life.'' So they held a staff meeting in the milk barn, while 24 Holsteins in the stalls waited to be milked.
 We'll be using cheaper feed, John Vevoda explained. No layoffs, for now, but you'll be working five days a week, not six. No more overtime. Oh, and please don't cash your checks until after 3 on Monday.
 The men listened. A silent exchange of glances told Robert the men wouldn't leave them in the lurch. Then the morning's five hours of milking began. 
 The other day, those employees were back in the barn, milking the cows, while John and Kris Vevoda worked in the office and tried to keep it together. At one point the phone rang, and they decided not to pick it up. 
 Soon there came the disembodied voice of a former employee, now retired, offering to help with the milking of the cows. ''You don't have to pay me,'' he said. ''We're praying for ya.''
 Click.
 The words seemed to confirm what John Vevoda had been trying to say all along about our obligation to one another, and he almost smiled.

HEADLINE: Matthews Renews Contract At MSNBC

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Chris Matthews, the usually garrulous host of ''Hardball'' on MSNBC, has quietly signed a new long-term contract to remain with the cable network through the next election, signaling that he had quit entertaining any plans to run for a Senate seat. 
 The deal is for at least four years. Financial terms were not disclosed, and neither side would confirm whether MSNBC had won a reduction in salary for the host, as it had been reported to be seeking. Previous reports put his annual salary at about $5 million. 
 One executive involved in the negotiations said, ''Whether he took a slight cut or got a slight raise, it's nobody's business.'' 
 Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC, said the deal would guarantee that Mr. Matthews would ''be around to cover the next presidential election.'' Mr. Matthews, known for his combative interviews, said he was happy to be staying on. ''I love what I do,'' he said. ''It's transparent. You can see it in my face.''
 For some time last year it was not clear just how much Mr. Matthews, 63, did love what he did. He was exploring a run for Senate from his home state, Pennsylvania, as a Democrat. Mr. Matthews had at one time worked as an aide to Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts, the Democratic House speaker during much of the 1980s. 
 Mr. Griffin said about Mr. Matthews's dalliance with a political career, ''I never really took it seriously.'' But his rather public testing of the waters during a presidential campaign raised questions about how he could remain at a news organization while seeking public office. 
 Mr. Matthews said that he had been serious about the Senate seat, now held by Arlen Specter, a Republican, and took umbrage at any suggestion that he might have been using the idea as negotiating leverage.
 ''I think it's unfair people think like that,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''That's sacrilegious.'' 
 He said he had held a lifelong love affair with the Senate. ''I grew up reading 'Advise and Consent.' I would go to Washington on high school trips with the band and I would see senators just like in 'Advise and Consent.' Humphrey, Dirksen, Goldwater.'' He added, ''To be a senator was the greatest thing in the world.''
 He modified that view as he examined the current role of senators, which, he said, has become dominated by raising funds. And he came to question, he said, whether he had at least one prerequisite for a political career.
 ''Every great guy has three things,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''Motive, passion and spontaneity. Clearly I had the final two. But motive? I would say to my wife, 'When the tough calls come, I would do the right thing. I would check the Constitution.' And she would go, 'What do you want to do?' I didn't have that drive to do particular things.''
 Mr. Matthews was in New York recently for a lunch at the Sea Grill restaurant. Before he sat down for an interview, he stopped at a table where the former first lady, Laura Bush, was sitting with a friend. She had previously greeted another NBC News star, Matt Lauer, effusively. But Mr. Matthews, who had been tough on Mrs. Bush's husband, got a somewhat chillier reception. Mr. Matthews said he understood. ''Hey, I'm tough on everybody.''
 Supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton accused him of being overly tough on their candidate during the Democratic primaries. He said at one point that she owed her political career to the fact that her husband had ''messed around'' and later apologized, saying the remarks had been ''nasty'' and ''callous.'' 
 He seemed far more enthusiastic about Barack Obama, most memorably saying, ''I felt this thrill going up my leg'' during one of Mr. Obama's speeches.
 He said that Pennsylvania political figures and consultants had pursued him. Last October, he was a guest at a dinner in Manhattan organized by Robert Wolf, president of UBS investment bank and one of Mr. Obama's top fund-raisers, and attended by Democratic donors. 
 One of the attendees said at the time that it was the understanding of those at the meeting that Mr. Matthews was feeling out his prospects and whether money would be available to him.
 In October, Mr. Matthews disputed the idea that the dinner was an overt political introduction, saying that he had never told anyone at the dinner -- or anywhere else -- that he was running. Mr. Griffin raised no formal objection to the meeting, but he said last week, ''I told Chris not to drag this out or it will present a problem.'' 
 Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, said, ''You can't be using your job in the media to promote a political career.'' He said Mr. Matthews ''got pretty close to the line, but he never actually got to the point of starting an exploratory committee.''
 As to the conflict issue, ''I was sensitive to it,'' Mr. Matthews said. It came to a head, he said, early this year, when Mr. Specter was battling Eric Holder's nomination to be attorney general. With Mr. Specter likely to be in the headlines of a continuing political story, Mr. Matthews said his job and political ambitions could no longer be reconciled. 
 ''That moment, that day, I told the producers around me: I'm not running. I cannot be in a position where I'm either dodging the story or dealing with it in a way where people believe me to be self-interested,'' he said. 
 Mr. Matthews said he had proved his worth to the network over the last year. ''My numbers were good,'' he said, adding that his program -- shown at 5 and 7 p.m. -- set up MSNBC's prime-time stars Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow. 
 The audiences for ''Hardball'' are growing. In February, Mr. Matthews added viewers from the same month in the election year, to 616,000 from 531,000 for his 5 p.m. show, and to 871,000 from 699,000 for the repeat at 7. 
 With the intense interest in the economy and the new president, Mr. Matthews said, ''That microphone is more potent than any legislative position.''

HEADLINE: Marketing as Backbeat At Indie Music Festival

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO; Melena Ryzik contributed reporting.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
How much branding is too much? 
 That question was pondered and debated by fans, musicians and corporate sponsors alike at the annual South by Southwest music festival here, where logo-filled banners line the streets downtown, and a flier stapled to a telephone pole might be for an indie-rock showcase in a parking lot, a marketing experiment for a blue-chip soft drink company or both.
 South by Southwest, which ended its 23rd installment on Sunday, is celebrated around the world as one of the great institutions of independent music, drawing record labels, bloggers, booking agents, filmmakers, radio programmers and anyone else in search of the next cool thing. As it has grown, so has its attraction to corporate America as a rare nexus of tastemakers, leading to saturation promotional tactics that strike many festivalgoers as excessive. 
 ''I'm wary when I end up at events like 'Smokin' Music,' '' said Kenneth Tan, a vacationing bookstore employee from New York, ''where they offer me free packs of cigarettes and a pass to get into after-show parties for my phone number and e-mail so they can send me advertisements for future American Spirit promotions.''
 Sponsors do more than just hand out samples and collect e-mail addresses. They provide the shadow financing that pays for much of what happens at South by Southwest, from the rent for off-site party spaces to artists' lodging and travel expenses. For many bands the only substantial performance fee of the week might come from a sponsored party. 
 Marketers, promoters and artist managers say that a modest branded party at South by Southwest costs $10,000 or so, but that major events with top talent can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In return that talent is often publicly grateful for the sponsor's largess. Kanye West made sure to give a shout-out to Levi's in a performance at its Levi's/Fader Fort party space on Saturday night. 
 Although the economy has forced many companies to trim their budgets, sponsorship and advertising were ubiquitous in downtown Austin. Giant balloons shaped like energy-drink cans bobbed in the wind on East Sixth Street, and nonmusic companies like PepsiCo, BlackBerry and National Public Radio have established a greater presence, as music magazines and record labels have scaled back.
 ''The core of the 18-to-34 demographic has not been as affected by the economy as the 30- to 40-year-olds,'' said Jon Cohen of Cornerstone, a multifaceted marketing firm that organized the Levi's/Fader Fort. ''They have no mortgage, no kids. The brands that target those consumers have not been hit quite as hard.''
 For most sponsors, however, simply putting up signs and handing out samples is no longer very effective. This year PepsiCo, the beverage and snack conglomerate, was an official sponsor of South by Southwest, landing its logo on banners and program guides. But if that was the only exposure, it would be a waste, said Frank Cooper, PepsiCo's vice president for portfolio brands. 
 ''Having a name on a banner now, if that's all you do, it's become wallpaper,'' he said. ''We're past the world where you can simply write a check. Now consumers ascribe value to those who create, and brands have to create.''
 On Thursday night Mountain Dew, a PepsiCo brand, had a showcase for its Green Label Sound project, which releases music by hipster-approved acts like Matt & Kim and the Cool Kids. Held under a tent in a restaurant parking lot, the event resembled any unfancy party at South by Southwest. The performers included the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, a bouncy indie-pop band from New York that only hours earlier had played in a small bar a few blocks away.
 But for PepsiCo, which encouraged its employees to chat about the event on blogs, Facebook and Twitter, it was an important test of a new, immersive approach that, if successful, could be used for other big festivals like Coachella or Bonnaroo, Mr. Cooper said.
 For many companies, though, the backlash has already begun. Scion, a Toyota brand that was a major presence at South by Southwest for the last four years, pulled out this year because the combined noise of so many competing sponsors was starting to drown out the music, said Jeri Yoshizu, Scion's manager for sales promotions and a veteran of underground music sponsorship.
 ''The music was lost among the banners, the energy drinks and the guerrilla marketing happening all over the place,'' she said. ''It was a bummer. There was a disconnect between the music and the people who wished to hear it.''
 Though attendance this year was about even with last year -- about 12,000, a spokeswoman said -- the economy this year seems to have squeezed fans, who have a knack for enjoying the fruits of sponsors' generosity while blocking out their messages. The streets were just as crowded during the afternoons, when the clubs fill with free sponsored parties, as they were at night for the official showcases, when attendees need a badge that can cost up to $695.
 At the Perez Hilton party late Saturday in an old Safeway store, the walls were covered with sponsor names -- Alize, Dos Equis, Dell -- and the crowd included plenty of people who said that they appreciated what the companies make possible. 
 ''It's great,'' said Amber Zook, 26, a landscape designer from Austin. ''A few years ago you couldn't do anything because the badges were so expensive. Now everything you want to go to is free.''

HEADLINE: A Web Site's For-Profit Approach to World News

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
Overseas reporters have been a casualty of budget-chopping news organizations, leaving an opening for the online start-up GlobalPost. But at a time when many news executives are exploring nonprofit business models to keep specialized reporting flowing, GlobalPost, which made its debut on Jan. 12, is intended to be a moneymaking venture.
 With 65 correspondents worldwide -- drawn from a surfeit of experienced reporters eager to continue working in their specialties even as potential employers disappear -- GlobalPost has begun offering a mix of news and features that only a handful of other news organizations can rival. 
 Recent articles, free at GlobalPost.com, included reports on Thailand's Islamic insurgency and Indian yogis worried about the financial crisis.
 That ad-supported reporting is only one part of the GlobalPost business plan. If it is to succeed, it will depend in part on how many people sign up for a separate paid section of the site, which was to have been available in test mode beginning last week but is now expected to go online in the coming days. 
 Called Passport, it offers access to GlobalPost correspondents, including exclusive reports on business topics of less interest to general audiences, conference calls and meetings with reporters, and breaking news e-mail messages from those journalists. 
 Passport subscribers, who pay as much as $199 a year, can suggest article ideas. ''If you are a member, you have a voice at the editorial meeting,'' although the site will decide which stories to pursue, said Charles Sennott, a GlobalPost founder and its executive editor. He said Passport is meant to ''create a feeling of community'' for subscribers who might otherwise see newsrooms as ''impenetrable and fortresslike.'' 
 GlobalPost correspondents, who include the former Washington Post writer Caryle Murphy in Saudi Arabia and a Time magazine correspondent turned novelist, Matt Beynon Rees, in Jerusalem, are paid extra for Passport work. Their basic compensation is $1,000 a month for four articles, plus shares in the venture. The site had 500 applicants for the jobs, Mr. Sennott said.
 Only a couple of dozen people have signed up for Passport, said Philip Balboni, GlobalPost's other founder and the president and chief executive. The site is depending on marketing partnerships to generate subscriptions, some discounted, and hopes to have more than 2,000 by year's end.
 Two months in, the Boston-based company says demand for the free site -- the mainstay of the business -- is ahead of expectations. It has logged 250,000 unique users who have visited at least once, compared with the 90,000 Mr. Balboni had hoped for by now, and 1.1 million page views, more than half from returning visitors. ''People have clearly liked what they've seen,'' Mr. Balboni said, adding that the site has had visitors from every country except North Korea, Chad and Eritrea.
 Advertising remains slow, he acknowledged. Liberty Mutual Insurance signed on for a year, and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University has been advertising on a trial basis. ''I think it will just take time,'' Mr. Balboni said. ''We are in an incredible down market.''
 More encouragingly, a third revenue stream has been growing, as the company has signed up a growing number of news outlets, including The Daily News and The Boise Weekly of Idaho, to carry its reports and have use of its correspondents.
 CBS Radio News recently signed a nonexclusive deal. It will be able to call on GlobalPost correspondents during breaking news, as a backup to its own reporters, said Harvey Nagler, CBS News's vice president of radio. 
 Public television's ''Worldfocus'' weeknight newscast features reports from GlobalPost correspondents, who carry inexpensive Flip digital video cameras when in the field. 
 The site was started with $8.5 million from private investors. 
 Mr. Balboni, who created the New England Cable News network, said he was a passionate defender of for-profit journalism. ''I believe deep in my heart and soul that the discipline of the marketplace makes for a stronger organization,'' he said. ''It gives you a far greater chance to be a self-sustaining enterprise, without having to turn to government or foundations,'' which can be mercurial, he said. 
 Long before the debate about whether newspapers and magazines should be charging for Web content, Mr. Balboni envisioned having consumers pay for at least a part of GlobalPost, he said. It was a lesson he learned after years in the cable TV business, which is supported by subscribers as well as ads. Having created a hybrid model, he said, ''now we have to prove it in the marketplace.''
 Alan D. Mutter, a media investor who analyzes news-business models at the blog Reflections of a Newsosaur, praised GlobalPost in an interview ''for being thoroughly modern in its approach to revenue, in that it understands it won't be simply advertising or subscriptions.'' He added, ''They've identified every conceivable revenue stream I can think of.''
 But questions remain, he said, including how many news organizations still have the budget to pay to use its articles, and whether GlobalPost's executives can create compelling content that will draw enough subscribers. ''I've seen other publishers who offered premium content, and the content wasn't good enough to make you want to write a check,'' he said. 
 ''This is definitely a forward-looking model, but it remains to be seen whether the audience materializes and whether they can execute,'' Mr. Mutter said, adding that ''I think everyone wishes them well because they are pretty close to what the future will be for news publishing.''

HEADLINE: Asian Stocks Rise on Hopes for Treasury Plan

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Stock markets in Asia rallied Monday as hopes for the beleaguered American financial system overcame concerns about the still-dire outlook for the global economy.
 The gains -- more than 3 percent in Japan, Taiwan and India, and more than 2 percent in South Korea, Singapore and Australia and 4.3 percent in Hong Kong -- were the latest in the past two weeks as investors around the world took heart from plans by the Obama administration to stabilize the American banking system and from news from leading financial institutions like Citigroup that the year had begun well. 
 On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will announce the details of the administration's long-awaited plan to purchase troubled assets and remove them from the balance sheets of banks, spurring banks to lend more money to consumers and companies.
 Hopes that this plan would begin to resolve the troubles at big financial institutions and set the stage for a gradual recovery in the real economy helped markets across Asia accelerate Monday.
 The benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Japan, where markets had been closed for a national holiday on Friday, rose 3.4 percent to a seven-week high.
 Banks were among the main beneficiaries, with the top Japanese lender, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, jumping 4.7 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 7.3 percent and Mizuho Financial 5.3 percent.
 Mitsubishi UFJ announced it planned to close 50 branches and cut 1,000 jobs to slim down its operations as Japan's recession and the sharp fall in the stock market eroded its earnings.
 Still, analysts remained divided as to whether the rallies seen around the world this month represented a sustained recovery or not.
 Many caution that the economic outlook -- and thus the outlook for a recovery in corporate earnings -- remains dim. Exports, the mainstay for many Asian economies, have slumped, while domestic spending in many parts of the region remains anemic.
 A Japanese government survey released Monday showed big Japanese manufacturers were much more pessimistic about business conditions in the first three months of 2009 than they were in the previous quarter. The tankan, a closely watched quarterly survey by the Bank of Japan, which will be released on April 1, also is expected to make for grim reading.
 ''Is the new bull market starting?'' asked analysts at Citigroup in Hong Kong in a research note on about Asia, excluding Japan, on Monday. ''We remain skeptical -- no one knows if this is a bear or a new bull market.''
 Others have begun to turn cautiously optimistic.
 Garry Evans, Asia strategist at HSBC in Hong Kong, in a note last week said that ''history shows that bear markets end when monetary policy is eased aggressively and the banking system is sorted. The former has now happened; the latter may soon. There seem more upside than downside for stocks.''
 ''We understand the taboo in the U.S. on nationalizing banks, but we see the chances of a comprehensive bailout plan as quite high now,'' Mr. Evans said.

HEADLINE: Yes, Stewart, CNBC Still Trusts Cramer

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: Jim Cramer's personal brand 

 BODY:
not to mention that of CNBC's, his employer -- has taken a beating in the last month. But CNBC still trusts him. 
 The business network, a unit of NBC Universal, continues to show the ''In Cramer We Trust'' commercials that were blasted by Jon Stewart of ''The Daily Show'' weeks ago during a much-talked-about war of words and video clips. On Friday afternoon, one of the commercials -- which play off the United States motto ''In God We Trust'' to promote Mr. Cramer's program ''Mad Money'' -- called him ''the voice of experience you can trust.'' 
 Mr. Stewart's criticisms of CNBC, delivered over many nights with the help of out-of-context video clips, included several that singled out Mr. Cramer, accusing him of promoting companies like Bear Stearns before they collapsed.
 For his part, Mr. Stewart said that his network, Comedy Central, ''doesn't have the slogan 'In Stewart We Trust.' '' He whispered the punchline: ''They don't want people to think I'm God.'' 
 Mr. Stewart even suggested some alternate slogans, including ''Cramer: he's right sometimes'' and, more judgmentally, ''He's like a dartboard that talks.'' 
 CNBC declined to comment on the commercials. But the network has aggressively defended itself from the complaints of Mr. Stewart and others that it had inadequately covered the origins of the financial crisis. Last week Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, told attendees of an investors conference that ''to suggest that the business media or CNBC was responsible for what is going on now is absurd.'' 
 In a statement Friday, the network said that it is ''built for balance'' and said that ''since the crisis began the most notorious bears have appeared regularly to debate the most prolific bulls.'' 
 ''If people are looking to pass out the blame, there are numerous offenders who are way ahead of the media: the lenders, mortgage brokers, speculators, legislators and regulators, who have billions in budget and thousands of employees,'' the statement said. BRIAN STELTER

HEADLINE: In Downturn, the Business of Campaigning Is Booming

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Over more than two decades of consulting, George Arzt branched out from political clients to private ones -- hospitals, developers and nonprofits that he said paid well and did not demand as much. 
 These days, though, he can no longer count on those private clients to bankroll his business: some asked him to cut his fees, while others dropped his services altogether as they confronted economic woes.
 ''I had to go back to politics to offset the losses on the other end,'' said Mr. Arzt, who is running the public advocate campaign of Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn. 
 The city is contending with gaping budget holes, companies are slashing their operations, stores are shutting down, and workers are losing their jobs. But at least one industry is still going strong: political campaigns.
 In interviews, consultants, pollsters, election lawyers and other strategists said that business was, in fact, very good this year. There are city elections this fall, with a fair number of competitive races already off the ground. As of March 12, 216 candidates had registered with the city's Campaign Finance Board, an unprecedented number this early in the election cycle, a board spokesman said. At least 39 of the candidates have signed up since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg engineered an extension of term limits in November, allowing two-term incumbents like himself to run again. 
 There are also plenty of organizations that need help shaping their message in these hard times, the consultants said. For example, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East and the Greater New York Hospital Association recently hired Knickerbocker SKD, a political communications firm, to create a multimillion-dollar campaign protesting Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed health care cuts. 
 ''Direct mail; TV, radio and newspaper ads; rallies and fund-raising parties: all of these things have to be done if a candidate wants a shot at winning or if a special-interest group wants to be heard,'' said Michael Tobman, a consultant who is working with Leslie Crocker Snyder on her campaign for Manhattan district attorney.
 Jerry H. Goldfeder, a veteran elections lawyer who is representing the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., in his mayoral bid, said, ''My practice is booming and I feel grateful to have such interesting work during this recession.''
 No one can predict how much money will be spent on campaigns this year, given the number of candidates running. The total amount has already exceeded $14 million, according to the latest campaign filings, and Mayor Bloomberg is expected to spend about $80 million of his own fortune on his re-election campaign.
 Still, there are challenges, especially for fund-raising consultants, who are having to come up with new ways to raise money for candidates. Gone are the days when enough campaign cash to last several months could be raised with a single event, like the $5,000-a-head dinner held at a Sheraton hotel in December for Mr. Paterson.
 Now, fund-raiser parties are often smaller, cheaper and more intimate affairs, with cash bars and finger food instead of a formal meal. The consultants said that they were increasingly forging alliances with community organizers, who can quickly tap into vast networks of volunteers to find someone willing to play host at an event at his or home. Candidates are also spending more time personally soliciting donations on the phone. 
 Perhaps more than ever before, the consultants said, public funds will bring a welcomed boost to campaign coffers. The city's campaign finance system provides a $6-to-$1 match to donations of up to $175 for candidates who agree to abide by its strict fund-raising limits. 
 ''If the economy only allows you to raise $20,000 or $30,000 for your City Council race, you can still mount a viable campaign,'' said Scott Levenson, who is working on Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr.'s bid for Bronx borough president. 
 The candidates who started collecting donations early are at an advantage because they have already been able to build sizable war chests, Mr. Levenson said. 
 Councilman Eric N. Gioia of Queens, who is running for public advocate, has raised more than $2.3 million so far, mostly in $10 increments, his campaign manager, Eli Richlin, said. That is almost $1 million more than the total raised by the two-term incumbent Betsy Gotbaum for the 2005 race, according to campaign finance records.
 In the comptroller's race, which is shaping up to be this year's most competitive, the leading fund-raiser is Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, who has raised $3.1 million, records show. By contrast, in 2005, Mr. Thompson, the incumbent, collected $2.3 million in private donations to finance his re-election bid. 
 ''Because of the economy, donors are much more limited in what they'll write a check for, so you have to decide what's the best way to do voter contact, looking at cost and trying to maximize every dollar,'' said Chung Seto, who is running Mr. Liu's campaign. ''The good thing is that with technology, we don't have to rely on TV and print ads, like in the old days.''
 Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a fund-raising consultant who has worked for numerous candidates running for state and city office, said, however, that there were expenses that cannot be spared. 
 ''The question that I find myself pondering with a candidate these days is, should we send a postcard invitation for the fund-raiser, which is cheaper to mail, or should we send a formal invite with a stamped envelope inside so that people can send in their checks with their reply?'' Ms. Peeler-Allen said. 
 ''We might save on the postage with postcards,'' she added, ''but if people get that stamped envelope, chances are that your candidate is going to get back a check.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Rounding Up Investors to Buy Bad Bank Assets

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, ERIC DASH and RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
This article is by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Eric Dash and Rachel L. Swarns.
 WASHINGTON -- Obama administration officials worked Sunday to persuade reluctant private investors to buy as much as $1 trillion in troubled mortgages and related assets from banks, with government help.
 The talks came a day before the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, planned to unveil the details of the administration's long-awaited plan to purchase troubled assets, meant to remove them from the balance sheets of banks and, in turn, spur banks to lend more money to consumers and companies. 
 The plan relies on private investors to team up with the government to relieve banks of assets tied to loans and mortgage-linked securities of unknown value. There have been virtually no buyers of these assets because of their uncertain risk.
 As part of the program, the government plans to offer subsidies, in the form of low-interest loans, to coax private funds to form partnerships with the government to buy troubled assets from banks.
 But some executives at private equity firms and hedge funds, who were briefed on the plan Sunday afternoon, are anxious about the recent uproar over millions of dollars in bonus payments made to executives of the American International Group. 
 Some of them have told administration officials that they would participate only if the government guaranteed that it would not set compensation limits on the firms, according to people briefed on the conversations. The executives also expressed worries about whether disclosure and governance rules could be added retroactively to the program by Congress, these people said. 
 A spokeswoman for the Treasury declined to comment on the conversations over the weekend.
 Administration officials took to the airwaves Sunday to reassure investors that the public would distinguish between companies like A.I.G., which are taking government bailout money, and private investment groups that, under this latest plan, would be helping the government take troubled assets off the books of some of the country's biggest banks.
 ''What we're talking about now are private firms that are kind of doing us a favor, right, coming into this market to help us buy these toxic assets off banks' balance sheets,'' Christina D. Romer, the White House's chief economist, said in an interview on ''Fox News Sunday.'' 
 ''I think they understand that the president realizes they're in a different category,'' she said, adding, ''They are firms that are being the good guys here.''
 Last week, the House passed a bill that would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid since Jan. 1 by companies that owe the government at least $5 billion in bailout loans. This week, the administration is planning to call for increased oversight of executive pay at all banks and Wall Street firms. 
 Private equity firms and hedge funds have historically been only lightly regulated and have not been subjected to the same disclosure requirements that are applied to banks and trading companies. 
 Mr. Geithner faces a highly charged and politicized audience when he introduces the troubled-assets plan on Monday, after a week filled with vitriolic attacks over his handling of A.I.G. bonus payments. 
 Mr. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, are scheduled to testify to the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday about the bonus payments. 
 Given that private equity firms, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds are perhaps the only institutions with cash to invest in such a program, the administration went on the offensive on Sunday in an effort to win them over. 
 In phone conversations, the administration gave some of these prospective investors a preview of the program, the people briefed on the conversations said.
 Three chiefs of investment firms said in interviews that they were impressed with the terms of the program -- which would have the government lend nearly 95 percent of the money for any investment -- but remained reluctant to participate because of the potential for future regulation. 
 ''The deal is good, but it's not worth it if I'm buying myself into a retroactive tax or a Congressional hearing,'' the chief executive of a major investment firm said, insisting on anonymity because he did not want to seem at odds with the Treasury Department in the event that his firm ends up participating.
 Despite the reluctance of some investors, others voiced optimism about the plan. Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, a money management company, said his firm planned to participate in the program. 
 ''We will be raising money on behalf of our clients,'' he said, adding that he was not worried about government intervening in his business. ''I don't see how Congress can interfere in this.''
 Pimco, a large bond fund, also was expected to participate.
 Still, a big stumbling block remained: how to place a value on mortgage-related assets that have not been traded for months.
 Executives briefed on the plan said it did not address the central question of how to bridge the divide between what the banks want to sell the assets for and what investors are willing to pay for them. The government hopes that the subsidies it provides to investors are so rich that they will be willing to risk overpaying somewhat for the assets.
 The White House plan is intended to leverage the dwindling resources of the Treasury Department's bailout program with money from private investors to buy as many toxic assets as possible and free the banks to resume more normal lending. 
 Austan Goolsbee, staff director of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, said on Sunday that his discussions with private investors led him to believe that they would participate.
 ''What we have seen in our discussions with people is that if you lay out clear rules that are responsible, people want to participate if there's a business reason to participate,'' Mr. Goolsbee said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' 
 ''In this circumstance, where we're trying to encourage the private sector to participate, that's going to be treated totally differently than companies like A.I.G. or Fannie Mae, where they are only in business because the government saved them,'' he said.
 At least one administration official also seemed to signal that the 90 percent tax on bonuses passed by the House might not become law. 
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden's senior economic adviser, Jared Bernstein, said on ''This Week'' on ABC that he thought President Obama might be concerned about ''using the tax code to surgically punish a small group of people.''
 Eric Dash and Rachel L. Swarns reported from Washington, and Andrew Ross Sorkin from New York.

HEADLINE: From Tehran to Tel Aviv

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
With his bold message to Iran's leaders, President Obama achieved four things essential to any rapprochement.
 He abandoned regime change as an American goal. He shelved the so-called military option. He buried a carrot-and-sticks approach viewed with contempt by Iranians as fit only for donkeys. And he placed Iran's nuclear program within ''the full range of issues before us.''
 By doing so, Obama made it almost inevitable that one of the defining strategic issues of his presidency will be a painful but necessary redefinition of America's relations with Israel as differences over Iran sharpen. I will return to that below. 
 The innovations in the president's Persian New Year, or Nowruz, overture to Tehran were remarkable. He referred twice to ''the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' a formulation long shunned, and said that republic, no other, should ''take its rightful place in the community of nations.'' Here was explicit American acceptance of Iran's 30-year-old clerical revolution.
 He said establishing constructive ties would ''not be advanced by threats,'' a retreat from his own campaign position that the military option must always remain on the table. Instead he offered ''mutual respect.''
 I was in Iran in January and February. The visit convinced me that confrontational American high-handedness has been a disaster; that facile analogies between the Iranian regime and the Nazis dishonor six million victims of the Holocaust; that the regime's provocative rhetoric masks essential pragmatism; and that the best way to help a young, stability-favoring population toward the reform they seek is through engagement.
 Obama has now taken all the steps I called for then. The policy changes emerged from an interagency review of the failed Iranian policy of recent years. The shift demanded courage.
 One of the people involved in the review told me he had been bombarded by warnings from Israel and Sunni Arab states that engagement with Iran would lead nowhere. Of course they would say that; any Iran breakthrough will shake up current cozy U.S. relationships from Jerusalem to Riyadh. 
 Obama's overture represented a victory not only over such lobbying but also over officials' favoring tightened sanctions or delaying any American initiative until after Iran's June presidential election.
 The hard part has just begun.
 Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded to Obama with a scathing speech at the country's holiest shrine in Mashad, recalling every past U.S. misdeed, describing prerevolutionary Iran as ''a field for the Americans to graze in,'' and demanding concrete steps -- like a lifting of sanctions -- rather than words.
 View all that as an opening gambit. Khamenei also quieted the crowd when it began its ritual ''Death to America'' chant and he said this: ''We're not emotional when it comes to our important matters. We make decisions by calculation.''
 That's right: the mullahs are anything but mad. Calculation will demand that Iran take Obama seriously.
 The country's oil revenue has plunged, its economy is in a mess, its oil and gas installations are aging. It has deepening interests in a stable Iraq and an Afghanistan free of Taliban rule. Its nuclear program involves a measure of brinkmanship that must be carefully managed. Khamenei's essential role is conservative -- the preservation of the revolution. He can only be radical up to a point.
 Iran's apparent inclination to take up a U.S. invitation to attend a conference on Afghanistan later this month may be more significant than Khamenei's words. In any event, overcoming a 30-year impasse will take time and consistency.
 The clock is ticking -- and Obama's will not be the same as that of Israel's prime minister designate, Benjamin Netanyahu.
 Already divergent U.S. and Israeli approaches to Iran were evident in Israeli President Shimon Peres's coupling of his own Nowruz address to the Iranian people (not its leaders) with a statement predicting that they would rise up and topple ''a handful of religious fanatics.'' 
 A senior Israeli official told me Iran has 1,000 kilos of low-enriched uranium and will have 500 more within six months, enough to make a bomb. It could then opt for one of three courses.
 Rush for a bomb by shredding the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, adapting its centrifuges and producing enough highly enriched uranium within a year.
 Move the process to a secret site, in which case getting a bomb would take longer, perhaps two years.
 Or continue making low-enriched uranium so that ''it would have enough for 10 bombs if it decides to rush at a later stage.''
 And where, I asked, is Israel's red line? ''Once they get to 1,500 kilos, nonproliferation is dead,'' he said. And so? ''It's established that when a country that does not accept Israel's existence has such a program, we will intervene.''
 I think there's some bluster in this. Israel does not want Obama to talk, talk, talk, so it's suggesting military action could happen in 2009, within nine months.
 Still, this much is clear to me: Obama's new Middle Eastern diplomacy and engagement will involve reining in Israeli bellicosity and a probable cooling of U.S.-Israeli relations. It's about time. America's Israel-can-do-no-wrong policy has been disastrous, not least for Israel's long-term security.

HEADLINE: Leading Military at Time of War, But Not as a 'War President'

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama rarely, if ever, uses the phrase ''war on terror.'' Like presidents before him, Mr. Obama has a top-secret intelligence briefing every day, yet it is not necessarily first on his schedule. And when he sent 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, he announced the news in a written statement, not a public address.
 As he heads toward his next big decision as commander in chief -- a new strategy for Afghanistan, to be announced as early as this week -- Mr. Obama, by necessity and temperament, is wearing the role in ways distinctly different from former President George W. Bush.
 Mr. Obama, of course, leads in very different times. Mr. Bush forged his identity as commander in chief during the crucible of the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Obama faces not only two wars but also a crumbling world economy that his homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, has described as a threat to the nation. 
 But while Mr. Bush often called himself ''a war president,'' that phrase seems to be missing from Mr. Obama's lexicon.
 The shift is evident in their schedules. 
 The first person Mr. Bush saw in the Oval Office each morning was his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, for a discussion, among other things, about what had happened overnight in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the top-secret intelligence briefing, the ''president's daily brief,'' had a sacrosanct place in the presidential schedule: 8 a.m.
 By contrast, Mr. Obama has added a briefing on the economy, and the timing of his Oval Office intelligence sessions varies each morning. Occasionally, the economics briefing comes first; one day early in his presidency, he visited his daughters' school and held a bill-signing event first. He has also discontinued Mr. Bush's practice of weekly videoconferences with ground commanders in Iraq -- a sign that conditions have improved, but also a stylistic change.
 And while Mr. Bush had routine secure video exchanges with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Mr. Obama has less personal contact with those heads of state, his aides say. 
 ''The president believes that we've got multiple means of communication,'' said his senior adviser, David Axelrod.
 Mr. Obama's style of decision-making is also different. He ''is somewhat more analytical, and he makes sure he hears from everybody in the room on an issue,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has worked for both presidents, said this month on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. 
 Mr. Gates added that Mr. Bush ''was interested in hearing different points of view but didn't go out of his way to make sure everybody spoke.''
 Mr. Bush often said he relied on his military commanders to determine troop levels; his last step before making such decisions was typically to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a process set up by Mr. Gates. But Mr. Obama has made clear he wants to hear from his entire national security team, including his secretary of state, before making major military decisions.
 Thus, Mr. Obama's first visit to ''the tank,'' the secure Pentagon conference room, did not focus exclusively on Iraq and Afghanistan. ''This was less a meeting about the wars than it was an opportunity for the new commander in chief to get to know his top generals,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, who was there. ''It was a very energetic, sophisticated conversation about global threats.''
 The weight of military leadership has hardly disappeared. In an interview broadcast Sunday on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, Mr. Obama said that sending the additional troops to Afghanistan had been the hardest decision of his young presidency. And he has followed some patterns set by Mr. Bush.
 Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama sends letters to the families of those killed in combat; he signs them, simply, ''Barack.'' 
 Mr. Axelrod said the deaths took a toll on the ordinarily even-keeled president. ''He doesn't get too high or too low,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''but to the extent that he does become reflective, it is after the notification of a soldier's loss.''
 And like Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama tries to meet privately with wounded soldiers, as he did at Camp Lejeune, in North Carolina. In his speech there last month, he also took pains to praise the success of the military in a war he opposed, saying, ''We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein's regime, and you got the job done.'' 
 Now Afghanistan is high on Mr. Obama's agenda, and his new strategy for the war could define his presidency the way Iraq defined Mr. Bush's.
 Top Obama aides said last week that they were still deciding how he would make the announcement -- whether in a speech, a White House ceremony or some other setting. If the past two months are any guide, the president, who never served in the military and campaigned as an antiwar candidate, will use the occasion to try to reach out to troops, all while forging a different path from his predecessor.
 ''After the attacks on 9/11, George Bush talked about the global war on terror as a kind of central theme of his thinking,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, a Democratic former congressman who was co-chairman of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and occasionally advises Mr. Obama. ''And he viewed all of his actions, including the accumulation of executive power, even the phrase 'enemy combatants,' as flowing from the commander in chief's powers. 
 ''With President Obama, conceptually it is very different.'' 
 Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of trying to minimize the role of commander in chief. Several former Bush advisers said they were shocked that he had sent troops to Afghanistan without a formal public explanation. 
 ''The contrast to Bush could hardly be more striking,'' said Thomas Donnelly, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calling it ''L.B.J. and Vietnam-type behavior.''
 Mr. Obama is too young to have faced the draft and is unencumbered by the ghosts of the Vietnam War -- an accident of birth that his advisers believe gives him a certain freedom in cultivating relationships with the military, a core constituency for Mr. Bush. ''He's been able to shift the paradigm a little bit,'' said Mark Lippert, a top foreign policy adviser.
 Mr. Obama's words of praise for the troops at Camp Lejeune were part of that presidential courtship. Soldiers who knew how critical he had been of the Iraq war were surprised.
 ''Marines are a tough crowd, and he is our new commander in chief,'' said Sgt. Maj. Joel Collins, who served in Iraq and is now stationed at Camp Lejeune with a battalion that cares for wounded soldiers. ''That went a long way toward telling us that the president does have our back.''
 Aides said the language was included at Mr. Obama's direction. ''He wanted to acknowledge that, from a military standpoint, the troops in Iraq have succeeded in their mission,'' said Ben Rhodes, his foreign policy speechwriter. ''He wanted to be very clear about that, from his standpoint as commander in chief.''

HEADLINE: Move Over, Appliances. Television Matters to G.E.

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
JUST last year, it seemed a good idea to many on Wall Street that General Electric spin off, or otherwise dispose of, NBC Universal.
 Today, if G.E. were not in the media business, it would be in deeper trouble than it already is. Essentially, it would be more dependent on its troublemaking finance unit, GE Capital. 
 Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach, was one of those Wall Street analysts who had been pushing for G.E. to shed NBC Universal, arguing that keeping media with jet engines, dishwashers and finance under the same corporate tent made no sense. 
 In a recent interview, Mr. Heymann said NBC Universal was ''not being viewed as the black sheep anymore. It's a key contributor of cash.''
 He added, ''This is more and more a critical asset, at least in helping to provide cash flow.''
 In the midst of the financial crisis, the shift in perception of NBC Universal has been palpable within the constellation of G.E., not because the media unit has posted eye-popping growth, but because it has been stable relative to the rest of the company. In 2008, when overall profits declined 22 percent, NBC Universal's were up 1 percent.
 And in the broader media universe, NBC Universal appears to be in a stronger position to weather the recession than many of its competitors, owing to its growing cable networks, the most durable corner of big media. 
 Among the handful of big-media conglomerates, NBC Universal suffered the least during the last quarter of 2008, when the economy fell off a cliff, compared with the likes of Time Warner, Disney, Viacom and the News Corporation. NBC Universal's operating profits were down 6 percent, compared with double-digit declines in profits for the aforementioned media companies.
 For this reason, the halls of NBC Universal at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York are brimming with confidence, despite the recession and its flagship broadcast network's being mired in fourth place.
 The confidence arises from what Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, said in his recent letter to shareholders: more than 60 percent of NBC Universal's profits are from cable. This compares with 43 percent in 2006. 
 Part of NBC Universal's problem has been that it is misnamed. Neither NBC, the network, nor Universal, its successful movie unit, is the company's biggest source of value. (Similarly, at Time Warner, its legacy namesake, Time Inc., the big magazine publisher, has been a drag on earnings).
 ''You can't get away from the perspective that we are just a broadcaster when your first three initials are NBC,'' said Jeff Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal. 
 The most valuable asset at the company is the cable channel USA Network; it provides the most to the unit's bottom line. Its other cable channels, Bravo, Sci Fi and Oxygen, are also expected to show revenue and profit gains amid the recession.
 ''Every one of these cable channels is more profitable then they were a year ago,'' said Jeff Gaspin, president and chief operating officer of the Universal Television Group, which oversees the cable networks. ''And they are growing.''
 As broadcast television has faltered and print media has been in free fall, the closest thing to a sure bet in media has been cable channels, especially those like USA, and TNT and TBS, from Time Warner, which seek a broad audience. Cable has been so durable because it continues to bring in new viewers and its business is dependent on fees from cable operators like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, money that flows steadily in good times and bad.
 In October 2007, NBC Universal bought Oxygen, the woman-focused cable channel, for $925 million. Two other attractive acquisition targets are Discovery Communications and Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns the Food Network and Home and Garden Television, but right now seem out of reach because of the economy.
 ''Only when this credit crisis hit did we stop looking at acquisitions,'' Mr. Gaspin said.
 Last year, speculation persisted that G.E. would seek to merge NBC Universal with Time Warner, which has long been interested in such a deal. 
 Publicly, executives always denied there was ever any interest in selling NBC Universal.
 ''I think the best antidote to that kind of speculation is performance, and I think we had a solid performance the last two years, and I think that's clear when you stack us up against our peers,'' Mr. Zucker said.
 It was thought then that the NBC broadcast network would be particularly valuable to Time Warner, because it would be a ready outlet for television shows produced by Warner Brothers. Now, because of broadcast television's deterioration, Time Warner would still covet NBC Universal, but for the cable channels, not the network.
 Back when talk of a Time Warner acquisition of NBC Universal was particularly ripe, it was supposed that Time Warner had no need for MSNBC, then an afterthought in the cable news game. It was even speculated that had Time Warner done the deal, it could have just shut down MSNBC because it has CNN. That was before the 2008 election, and before MSNBC earned an identity as a left-side counterpart to Fox News.
 ''For the first time in its existence, it has found itself and it has a real identity,'' said Mr. Zucker, who related a story about Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat of Florida, recently complaining to him that he could not watch MSNBC at the home of family members near Jacksonville, Fla., because the local cable operator does not carry it. 
 ''He's on me about getting that fixed,'' Mr. Zucker said. ''We never would have gotten a complaint like that before.''

HEADLINE: Trade Barriers Rise as Slump Tightens Grip

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After repeated pledges by world leaders to avoid erecting trade barriers, protectionism is on the march, provoking nasty trade disputes and undermining efforts to plot a coordinated response to the deepest global economic downturn since World War II.
 From a looming battle with China over tariffs on carbon-intensive goods to a spat over Mexican trucks using American roads, barriers are going up around the world. As the recession's grip tightens, these pressures are likely to intensify, several experts said.
 The surge in protectionism is casting a shadow over an economic summit meeting of world leaders scheduled for London on April 2. At the last such gathering, in Washington in November, former President George W. Bush persuaded the Group of 20 members to commit to protecting free trade -- whatever the pressures caused by faltering economies and lost jobs. The members include industrialized and developing nations, and the European Union. 
 ''No sooner was the G-20 statement issued than it was breached,'' said Daniel M. Price, an official in the Bush administration who helped negotiate the agreement. ''Instead of just talking about trade liberalization, countries need to take immediate steps to show they mean it.''
 Far from heeding their pledge not to erect new barriers for 12 months, many countries have raised import duties or passed stimulus measures with trade-distorting subsidies. The World Bank, in a report last week, said that since the Washington meeting, 17 members of the Group of 20 had adopted 47 measures aimed at restricting trade.
 Russia has raised tariffs on used cars. China has tightened import standards on food, banning Irish pork, among other things. India has banned Chinese toys. Argentina has tightened licensing requirements on auto parts, textiles and leather goods. And a dozen countries, from the United States to Australia, are subsidizing embattled automakers or car dealers.
 The most vivid example of that policy is the ''Buy America'' provision in the stimulus package, intended to ensure that only American manufacturers benefited from public-spending projects. The Obama administration persuaded Congress to water it down, and Mr. Obama has taken up Mr. Bush's warnings about the dangers of protectionism.
 But pressures are building on other fronts. Last week, the energy secretary, Steven Chu, said he favored tariffs on Chinese goods if China did not sign on to mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions -- underscoring how the ''green economy'' could be the next trade battleground.
 Mr. Obama signed a $40 billion spending bill that scrapped a program enabling Mexican trucks to haul cargo over long distances on American roads. Mexico retaliated by imposing duties on $2.4 billion worth of American goods -- everything from pencils to toilet paper. The trucking dispute has its roots in the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which guaranteed Mexico, Canada and the United States access to one another's highways for cargo transport by 2000.
 While resistance in Congress to Mexican trucks is long-running, based in part on safety and environmental concerns, American officials worry it will cause broader frictions with Mexico.
 ''It's very worrisome to the Mexicans because it's seen as protectionism,'' said Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, who is working with other officials to devise a new pilot program for trucks that will satisfy critics in Congress.
 Mexico's tariffs affect 90 products from 40 states, accounting for less than 2 percent of American exports. Mr. Shannon said it underscored the breadth of the trading relationship.
 Even without protectionism, the synchronized global downturn is likely to result in the largest annual decline in world trade in 80 years, according to the World Bank. While the bank said it was difficult to quantify the effects of the new barriers, they could aggravate that decline.
 ''It's very easy for this to spin out of control and move to trade wars that could be quite devastating,'' said Richard Newfarmer, who wrote the report and is the bank's special representative to the World Trade Organization.
 The World Bank president, Robert B. Zoellick, warned recently that 2009 could be a ''very dangerous'' year, as leaders faced rising calls for protection from economically insecure populations. He called on the World Trade Organization to monitor protectionist actions and publicize them. But not all the measures violate the body's laws.
 The stimulus plans that the United States is pushing Europe to adopt can also distort trade, depending on how much they rely on subsidies. In November, the Group of 20 agreed to ''refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services,'' regardless of whether the measures complied with trade laws. Mr. Price, the former Bush administration official who is now a trade lawyer with the firm Sidley Austin, said the leaders should go further in London.
 He proposed having the W.T.O. study the impact on trade of stimulus programs, much as the International Monetary Fund has been charged with studying their economic impact.
 Beyond that, he said, the leaders could agree to eliminate tariffs and other barriers on ''clean'' products. So far, the climate debate has brought to the surface potentially divisive issues, like whether countries should impose tariffs on exports with high carbon emissions. Chinese officials said they would view such acts as a violation of World Trade Organization agreements.
 ''A lot of people are worried that U.S. protectionism is going to take a green face,'' said Trevor Houser, an expert in energy and climate issues at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
 Some trade skeptics caution against making too much of the link between the economic crisis and protectionism. Lori Wallach, director of the global trade division at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, noted that many countries had not raised tariffs to the highest levels permissible under trade laws.
 With so much else on the agenda in London, it is not clear how much time the Group of 20 will be able to devote to trade. Mr. Price expressed disappointment that after a preparatory meeting of finance ministers last week in Britain, the Group of 20 did not issue a stronger statement about protecting trade.
 Given Mr. Obama's ambiguous positions on trade during the campaign -- he favored renegotiating Nafta -- economists praise him for holding the fort against protectionism so far. But as stimulus programs begin to take hold, they could encourage consumers to buy more imported goods, further fanning antitrade sentiment.
 ''The U.S. is in such great danger of backing away from free trade,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''The next two years could be a disaster for free trade.''

HEADLINE: For Populism, a Return To Economic Roots

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
In selecting villains, politicians reflect the anxieties of their era. Today's populist uproar reaches far beyond the American International Group -- and may mark a turning point.
 As baby boomers came of age, targets for populist scorn typically tracked fears of social breakdown. At various points, they included the 1960s counterculture, welfare cheats, violent criminals, illegal immigrants and gay men and lesbians.
 Now A.I.G. executives and their bonuses have set off revulsion among lawmakers, and the House last week voted overwhelmingly for tax rates at a level -- 90 percent -- unseen in decades. Amid recession and the troubles on Wall Street, economic populism has displaced social populism as the emotional flash point in American politics. 
 And as baby boomers approach retirement with depleted savings, it may last a while.
 ''I've not seen anything like this,'' said a Republican consultant, Ed Rollins, who was a strategist for presidential bids by Ronald Reagan, Ross Perot and Mike Huckabee. ''They think it's all occurring because of greedy bastards on Wall Street and inept government officials.'' 
 ''If I wanted to run a populist presidential campaign,'' Mr. Rollins added, ''I'd have a lot more tools than I had with Ross Perot.'' 
 Anger over economic change spawned the Populist Party after the Gilded Age in the late 19th century. Championing rural America, the party accused East Coast elites of dividing the country into ''tramps and millionaires.''
 Franklin D. Roosevelt attacked ''economic royalists'' during the Great Depression. ''They are unanimous in their hate for me,'' Roosevelt said, ''and I welcome their hatred.''
 Focus on Social Issues
 That conflict, however, lost its spark with the economic boom after World War II and the advent of the civil rights movement, the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War. ''In the 1960s, the center of gravity of populism shifted to social issues,'' said Jeffrey Bell, a Republican who is the author of ''Populism and Elitism: Politics in the Age of Equality.'' 
 George Wallace attacked ''pointy-headed intellectuals who couldn't park their bicycle straight.'' Richard M. Nixon contrasted the ''silent majority'' of Middle America with unruly protesters, whom his vice president Spiro T. Agnew condemned as ''an effete corps of impudent snobs.''
 Crusading against government excess, Reagan, as a candidate, lampooned a ''Chicago welfare queen'' who received benefits under multiple identities. George Bush used the rapist Willie Horton to cast Democrats as soft on crime.
 In the early 1990s, as worldwide economic integration showcased gaps between rich and poor, economic populism gained force from the voices of Mr. Perot and Bill Clinton. But the free trade policies that Mr. Clinton followed as president frustrated those seeking to place corporate elites in the cross hairs. 
 In 2000, Al Gore's charge that ''powerful interests'' blunted working-class aspirations could not win him the White House. George W. Bush prevailed in two elections while courting ''values voters,'' and in 2004 backed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.
 ''The distribution of income and opportunity is likely to dominate the next stage of American politics,'' Jeff Faux predicted in ''The Global Class War'' in 2006. But opposition to the Iraq war proved more powerful that November, even as Democrats regained control of Congress.
 Anger's Course
 As the 2008 campaign began, Iraq and illegal immigration loomed as the most volatile issues. Then last fall, the financial crisis shoved other concerns aside and began to vindicate Mr. Faux's prediction.
 How long economic anger will persist remains unclear. ''So far we don't have the big political movement that helped stir up class issues in the 1930s,'' said Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia, referring to the populist firebrands Huey P. Long and Father Charles Coughlin who put pressure on Roosevelt.
 Public ire could help President Obama reverse Republican policies on taxes, domestic spending and regulation -- shifts that he argues will curb the inequalities behind the current sense of outrage.
 But it also could threaten Mr. Obama's plan to stabilize the financial system. His temperament and public demeanor run toward cooling that anger rather than stoking it.
 Once the Wall Street crisis eases and economic growth resumes, Mr. Bell predicts, social populism will regain pre-eminence. Others, though, see a continuing search for scapegoats as Washington uses more taxpayer money to cover bad bets by financial executives.
 ''You're just seeing the beginning of this with A.I.G.,'' said Robert Borosage, an adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he ran for president. ''The people making off with all the rewards led the whole economy off a cliff. 
 ''Working Americans are now asked to bail them out. This anger is going to get much worse.''
 Baby boomers nearing retirement have long fretted that government cannot afford their promised Social Security and Medicare benefits. Now fallen housing and stock values have shrunk their savings. Their effort to pin blame could color the political agenda for years. 
 ''You're going to see a lot of elderly people coming up short,'' said Mr. Rollins, the Republican strategist. ''It's not a normal cycle like we've been in. That's the scary part.''

HEADLINE: Financial Policy Despair

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Over the weekend The Times and other newspapers reported leaked details about the Obama administration's bank rescue plan, which is to be officially released this week. If the reports are correct, Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, has persuaded President Obama to recycle Bush administration policy -- specifically, the ''cash for trash'' plan proposed, then abandoned, six months ago by then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. 
 This is more than disappointing. In fact, it fills me with a sense of despair. 
 After all, we've just been through the firestorm over the A.I.G. bonuses, during which administration officials claimed that they knew nothing, couldn't do anything, and anyway it was someone else's fault. Meanwhile, the administration has failed to quell the public's doubts about what banks are doing with taxpayer money.
 And now Mr. Obama has apparently settled on a financial plan that, in essence, assumes that banks are fundamentally sound and that bankers know what they're doing. 
 It's as if the president were determined to confirm the growing perception that he and his economic team are out of touch, that their economic vision is clouded by excessively close ties to Wall Street. And by the time Mr. Obama realizes that he needs to change course, his political capital may be gone.
 Let's talk for a moment about the economics of the situation.
 Right now, our economy is being dragged down by our dysfunctional financial system, which has been crippled by huge losses on mortgage-backed securities and other assets. 
 As economic historians can tell you, this is an old story, not that different from dozens of similar crises over the centuries. And there's a time-honored procedure for dealing with the aftermath of widespread financial failure. It goes like this: the government secures confidence in the system by guaranteeing many (though not necessarily all) bank debts. At the same time, it takes temporary control of truly insolvent banks, in order to clean up their books.
 That's what Sweden did in the early 1990s. It's also what we ourselves did after the savings and loan debacle of the Reagan years. And there's no reason we can't do the same thing now.
 But the Obama administration, like the Bush administration, apparently wants an easier way out. The common element to the Paulson and Geithner plans is the insistence that the bad assets on banks' books are really worth much, much more than anyone is currently willing to pay for them. In fact, their true value is so high that if they were properly priced, banks wouldn't be in trouble.
 And so the plan is to use taxpayer funds to drive the prices of bad assets up to ''fair'' levels. Mr. Paulson proposed having the government buy the assets directly. Mr. Geithner instead proposes a complicated scheme in which the government lends money to private investors, who then use the money to buy the stuff. The idea, says Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, is to use ''the expertise of the market'' to set the value of toxic assets.
 But the Geithner scheme would offer a one-way bet: if asset values go up, the investors profit, but if they go down, the investors can walk away from their debt. So this isn't really about letting markets work. It's just an indirect, disguised way to subsidize purchases of bad assets.
 The likely cost to taxpayers aside, there's something strange going on here. By my count, this is the third time Obama administration officials have floated a scheme that is essentially a rehash of the Paulson plan, each time adding a new set of bells and whistles and claiming that they're doing something completely different. This is starting to look obsessive. 
 But the real problem with this plan is that it won't work. Yes, troubled assets may be somewhat undervalued. But the fact is that financial executives literally bet their banks on the belief that there was no housing bubble, and the related belief that unprecedented levels of household debt were no problem. They lost that bet. And no amount of financial hocus-pocus -- for that is what the Geithner plan amounts to -- will change that fact. 
 You might say, why not try the plan and see what happens? One answer is that time is wasting: every month that we fail to come to grips with the economic crisis another 600,000 jobs are lost. 
 Even more important, however, is the way Mr. Obama is squandering his credibility. If this plan fails -- as it almost surely will -- it's unlikely that he'll be able to persuade Congress to come up with more funds to do what he should have done in the first place.
 All is not lost: the public wants Mr. Obama to succeed, which means that he can still rescue his bank rescue plan. But time is running out.

HEADLINE: In a City of Landmarks, a Court Case Alarms Preservationists

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Carol Mrowka considers her East Village neighborhood here attractive, comfortable -- and ordinary. So when the city deemed the area an official landmark, Ms. Mrowka found it absurd and went to court.
''Sure, it's a nice neighborhood,'' said Ms. Mrowka, a real estate agent who moved 12 years ago to the neighborhood, north and west of the Loop, with its cottages and small, flat buildings that were home to immigrants in the late 1800s. ''The basic style of the buildings is pretty, but this is not a landmark.''
Now her case has been appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, raising alarm among preservationists about the future of scores of such landmark districts and buildings in a city that adores its architectural legacy. 
''The fact is, Chicago could not exist without its landmark ordinance,'' said Jonathan Fine, the executive director of Preservation Chicago, a nonprofit group. ''It's the line that holds us back from the Neanderthals.''
A state appellate court sided with Ms. Mrowka and Al Hanna, a resident of Lincoln Park, another neighborhood where a section has landmark status, finding that Chicago's four-decades-old ordinance for designating landmarks used ''vague, ambiguous and overly broad'' terms to sort out what buildings and neighborhoods should be protected from change or demolition.
The City of Chicago appealed that decision this month, and both sides are waiting to hear if the Illinois Supreme Court will take the case.
City lawyers say that if the ruling stands, any of the city's landmarks -- except perhaps those that are protected through separate federal or state programs -- could have their protected status challenged, said Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city's law department.
Advocates of preservation worry that the ruling might ultimately threaten popular landmarks like Wrigley Field and the works of the architects like Louis Sullivan and Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright. The outcome could also have legal consequences for other Illinois cities with similar ordinances. And while it would set no legal precedent outside the state, the case threatens to embolden opponents with like-minded challenges, given the similarities of many landmark ordinances, advocates say.
Cities and towns across Illinois, as well as preservation advocates from places like Cleveland, New York and Pittsburgh, have filed court documents supporting Chicago's appeal.
''Once the door opens, other people will be making the same argument,'' said Julia H. Miller, special counsel at the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ''The potential for havoc is there.''
This fight began three years ago on a far smaller scale.
Ms. Mrowka and Mr. Hanna, who has lived in Lincoln Park on the North Side of Chicago for more than 50 years, say their neighborhoods simply fail to match the significance of some on this city's most beloved list.
Among the 51 landmark districts in Chicago are a region near the old Water Tower (one of the few public buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1871) and a strip of Michigan Avenue (the city's commercial promenade containing buildings by a virtual who's who of famed architects). Its 277 individual landmarks include Buckingham Fountain, the Biograph Theater and the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company building.
Ms. Mrowka and Mr. Hanna said their neighborhoods were proposed as landmarks merely to manipulate their makeup. Ms. Mrowka said some of her neighbors wanted to avoid allowing the neighborhood to gentrify further. And Mr. Hanna, who has worked for years in commercial mortgage banking and moved to Lincoln Park well before it transformed into an upscale section, said the landmark designation was being used to ''racially cleanse a high income area.''
The Chicago ordinance requires that landmarks meet two of seven criteria, including ''its location as a site of a significant historic event'' and ''its value as an example of the architectural, cultural, economic, historic, social or other aspect of the heritage of the city of Chicago, the state of Illinois or the United States.'' But terms like ''value'' and ''significant,'' the appellate court found, are ambiguous and vague, and it also said that the qualifications of the 10-member commission that recommended landmarks were ''equally vague.''
As the Supreme Court considers the case, the appellate court opinion does not directly affect any of Chicago's landmarks -- not even Ms. Mrowka and Mr. Hanna's neighborhoods. But the appellate court did send the landmark status of those two districts to a lower court for reconsideration, and lawyers on both sides say that judge seems to have little choice but to nullify them.
Thomas J. Ramsdell, a lawyer for Mr. Hanna and Ms. Mrowka, said his clients were never looking to eviscerate efforts to preserve deserving landmarks. Their intent, Mr. Ramsdell said, was to make sure the city's law does what it is meant to do: to save the true treasures of the city, not to create a political tool to ban change in an average neighborhood.
''This is not going to mean a massive wrecking ball or something,'' Mr. Ramsdell said. ''Everybody loves the Civic Opera Building. Everybody loves the Tribune Tower. Everyone loves the Chicago Board of Trade. The truly historic districts will remain.''
Around the country, advocates of preserving architecture say there is a long history of courts upholding landmark protections, leading them to believe that the Supreme Court will follow suit. Still, they said they would be watching the case closely, well aware of all the buildings that might be at risk.
They say they remember the years before Chicago passed its landmark ordinance in 1968, when despite preservation efforts, buildings were razed, like Mr. Sullivan's Garrick Theater in 1961, and others, including Mr. Wright's prairie-inspired Robie House, the Cultural Center and the Chicago Theater, were threatened with destruction. All three are now landmarks.
However the case ends, Mr. Hanna said he was aware that not all of his neighbors appreciated his legal efforts to overturn the ordinance.
Still, he said, ''they haven't broken my windows yet.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Urges Stronger Financial Regulations

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Monday that the economic crisis showed that the American financial system had failed a major test and was in need of an overhaul. 
 Speaking at a conference in Washington, Mr. Geithner said that the Obama administration planned to work with Congress to develop a modernized government regulatory structure for financial institutions.
 He said it was a ''terrible, tragic thing'' that the government did not have better tools, such as the power to take over major firms, when the credit crisis accelerated last fall.
 ''Our system basically failed its most fundamental test,'' Mr. Geithner told the conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal. ''It was too fragile.''
 On Tuesday Mr. Geithner will appear with Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of the Federal Reserve before the House Financial Services Committee, which is examining the government's handling of the bailout of the American International Group.
 In his appearance Monday night, Mr. Geithner said it was critical that the government make reforms.
 ''The world is watching us to see if we have the will and ability to fix this,'' he said.

Consumer psychologists call it hyperopia, the medical term for farsightedness and the opposite of myopia, nearsightedness, because it is a result of people looking too far ahead. PAGE D1

HEADLINE: Union Dissidents Vote to Secede and Realign

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The civil war within Unite Here, the union representing hotel, restaurant, apparel and laundry workers, has reached the secession stage. 
 A splinter group claiming to represent 150,000 of Unite Here's 400,000 members announced Monday that its delegates had voted to break away and merge into the Service Employees International Union. 
 The move, at a weekend meeting in Philadelphia, bolsters the growth ambitions of the 1.8-million-member services employees, the dominant service-sector union.
 Unite Here was formed in 2004 when Unite, representing apparel and laundry workers, merged with the larger Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union, or HERE. The conjoined union's president, Bruce S. Raynor, who previously led Unite, has maintained over the last year that the merger has failed. Mr. Raynor and other former Unite officials have argued for divorce, on the ground that the unification has not realized its goal of increased organizing.
 Officials from the hotel workers' side have opposed any split, saying Mr. Raynor wants to end the merger largely because he has been outvoted on a variety of issues by the union's board. 
 John W. Wilhelm, who is president of Unite Here's hotel and restaurant division and whose allies control the board, denounced the weekend move, saying Unite Here's constitution did not allow for secession. The two sides are already battling in court over that question.
 Tensions were made all the worse Monday because the breakaway group and the service employees announced that they would seek to unionize food service and hotel workers, who have fallen under the jurisdiction of Mr. Wilhelm's division. 
 Edgar Romney, a onetime Unite official who is the newly elected president of the secessionist group, Workers United, defended that strategy. ''Our cultural background has always been to organize low-wage workers, no matter what the industry,'' said Mr. Romney, Unite Here's secretary-treasurer.
 Mr. Romney also said nearly 40,000 former members of the hotel workers were part of the secession move, but Mr. Wilhelm said those workers had been ''kidnapped'' against their wishes by anti-HERE officials of their regional councils.
 Mr. Wilhelm condemned the services employees' president, Andy Stern, calling him Czar Stern and saying his ''attempt to adopt the Raynor splinter group is a transparent ploy to justify his hostile takeover of Unite Here's jurisdiction.''
 Mr. Stern said, ''This affiliation is about applying what was done for sweatshop workers and for janitors for other low-wage workers in the new economy.''
 One thing the two sides did agree on was that Unite Here would continue to own Amalgamated Bank, the nation's only labor-owned bank.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Investors See Returns Of 5 to 10%

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE

 BODY:
Hedge funds are down, but not out. 
 That, anyway, is the conclusion of a closely watched industry survey to be published on Tuesday, which paints a sobering portrait of what was once one of the highest-flying businesses on Wall Street. 
 After years of explosive growth, hedge funds, those sometimes volatile pools of private capital, are undergoing a shakeout. But according to an annual survey of hedge fund investors conducted by Deutsche Bank, things may not be as bleak as many hedge fund managers fear. 
 Despite gaping losses at many funds, most of the investors polled by the German bank said they believed that hedge funds would post returns of 5 to 10 percent for 2009, besting the broader financial markets. 
 That vote of confidence comes at a pivotal time for hedge funds, which could play a role in the bank rescue plan announced by the Treasury Department on Monday. The government hopes some of these funds will buy troubled assets from the nation's banks, helping stabilize the financial system and the economy. 
 Even so, hedge funds -- whose outsize rewards helped to define the era of megapaydays on Wall Street -- are undoubtedly going through a rough period, and the pressure is unlikely to let up soon. According to the Deutsche Bank survey, the industry's assets under management are expected to decline by $200 billion over the next year, to $1.33 trillion. In 2007, near its peak, the industry oversaw more than $2 trillion. 
 Many investors have withdrawn money from these funds recently, and 82 percent of the respondents said such redemptions would be the most challenging issue the industry faced in the next 12 months, according to the Deutsche study. Along with increased regulation and calls for more transparency, the withdrawals are expected to force many smaller funds to shut down or consolidate. 
 ''There is a Darwinian process that has been going on and will continue into this year,'' said Jonathan Hitchon, co-head of global prime finance for Deutsche Bank. ''There are a lot of hedge fund managers that will be left out in the cold.''
 The report surveyed various types of hedge fund investors, including funds of hedge funds, family offices, pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals. The bank polled about 1,000 investors worldwide. 
 Most of the investors are planning to reduce investments in emerging markets in Asia, excluding China, as well as in Russia and Eastern Europe. Sixty-three percent said they planned to add or maintain their investments in the United States and Canada. More investors plan to reduce their allocations to Western Europe than add to them.
 In a big shift from recent years, most hedge fund investors have cut back on the amount of borrowed money used to leverage their bets on particular funds. According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of investors have reduced their exposure to leverage in the last 12 months, and most said they did not plan to increase it this year.
 Transparency and risk management have become major issues for investors after many got burned in hedge funds that invested with Bernard L. Madoff. Investors are demanding that hedge funds, rather than pool all investors' money, place their investments in separately managed accounts that provide daily information on positions and profits.

HEADLINE: 4 Michigan Markets Will Lose Daily Newspapers, as Ailing Industry Tries to Cope

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Daily newspapers will become a thing of the past for readers in four Michigan markets, with issues being printed only three days a week in Flint, Saginaw and Bay City, and twice weekly in Ann Arbor. Advance Publications said it would close the 174-year-old Ann Arbor News in late July, and replace it with two new corporate entities: a primarily Web-based news operation, AnnArbor.com; and a printing company that will publish two days a week. 
 All 272 employees at The News, which has weekday circulation of 45,000, will be laid off and invited to apply for jobs at the two new companies. Their staff size has not been determined, but ''there will be by far fewer positions,'' said Laurel Champion, publisher of The Ann Arbor News.
 AnnArbor.com will have some original reporting, and an emphasis on reader input and community forums. ''This will be a new company built from the ground up,'' said Steven Newhouse, chairman of Advance.net, the Internet arm of the company.
 The changes at The Flint Journal, The Saginaw News and The Bay City Times will be less sweeping, reducing daily publication to Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays only. Executives said those days account for about 80 percent of advertising revenue. The papers, which have combined circulation of 141,000 on weekdays and 176,000 on Sundays, plan to lay off 35 percent of their employees.
 Advance, which is owned by the Newhouse family, announced several other cost-cutting moves, including mandatory unpaid two-week furloughs for employees at most of its newspapers, including The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, The Oregonian of Portland, The Plain Dealer of Cleveland and The Star-Ledger of Newark. Some employees' pay will be cut. 
 Advance also owns Conde Nast, the magazine publisher, which has also been cutting costs, and Bright House Networks, one of the nation's largest cable television providers.
 A small but growing number of papers have reduced printing days in recent months, while preserving the late-week and weekend days that attract the most readers and advertisers. The industry has been hunting for ways to counter a crippling decline in advertising. Among the hardest-hit states has been Michigan, whose economy depends heavily on the wounded auto industry.
 No newspapers in large cities have dropped publishing days yet, but on Monday, The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News will end home delivery four days a week. Both will deliver on Thursdays and Fridays, and The Free Press will do so on Sundays, when The News does not publish. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about cost-cutting efforts by the newspaper publisher Advance Publications misstated the length of the furloughs that will affect employees at The Oregonian of Portland. Full-time employees there will be subject to four days of unpaid furlough -- not two weeks.

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Credit Rating for G.E.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
General Electric lost its top credit rating from Moody's Investors Service on Monday because of higher risks at the conglomerate's struggling GE Capital lending unit. 
 The expected move follows a similar downgrade of G.E. this month by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's. 
 Moody's lowered its ratings for G.E. and GE Capital two notches to Aa2 from Aaa. It said the outlook for both was stable. The downgrades mean G.E. will most likely pay higher costs to borrow money.
 GE Capital, which recently made up nearly half of G.E.'s overall earnings, has been hurt by the financial crisis. G.E. said last week that the finance unit could just break even this year because of higher losses on loans for credit cards, overseas mortgages, big equipment and commercial property.
 General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., had forecast earlier that GE Capital would earn about $5 billion.
 Moody's said that G.E.'s industrial businesses, which include energy equipment, machines for health care and jet engines, would still probably warrant the top credit rating on their own.
 But the lower overall rating was warranted because of the volatility of GE Capital's earnings and questions over its financing, according to Moody's. As a stand-alone entity, GE Capital would have a much lower credit rating.
 G.E. said the downgrade, along with the S.& P. cut, would not have a significant impact on its operations or financing.
 The company said that both ratings agencies gave it a stable outlook, meaning a further downgrade was not likely in the short term.
 Shares of G.E. rose 89 cents, or 9 percent, to $10.43.

HEADLINE: Unexpected Jump in Home Sales in February

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned homes in the United States showed unexpected strength in February, offering a glimmer that the tumbling housing market may be searching for a bottom even as economists brace for another wave of foreclosures driven by rising job losses. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that sales of existing homes rose 5.1 percent in February after a 5 percent decline in January. Home sales in the Northeast, South, West and Midwest all gained ground for February as buyers scooped up foreclosure properties.
 ''We are close to seeing a bottom in both new and existing home sales,'' Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, wrote in a note to clients.
 But all real estate is local, and whether the housing market has begun to finally scrape bottom remains a question of location, location, location.
 Economists and real-estate experts said the worst-hit parts of the country looked like they were starting to emerge from the wreckage of the housing bust and a tide of foreclosures. Other markets like New York or Washington, where prices have not tumbled so starkly, will probably face more stagnant sales and sliding prices in the months ahead.
 In the West, where home prices have dropped 30 percent from last February, homes sales rose 30 percent last month from a year earlier. In the Northeast, where housing prices have only dropped 4.8 percent, to $251,200, over the last year, sales are down 15 percent for the year. ''The areas that fall the fastest are going to recover,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''There's going to be a floor established. Seven hundred thousand dollar houses are $250,000 -- that's what's bringing people back into the markets.''
 The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have introduced aggressive moves to try to lower borrowing costs, keep homeowners out of foreclosure, and stem two years' of losses in the housing market, which lies at the center of the financial crisis.
 Last month, President Obama unveiled a $275 billion plan to help as many as nine million homeowners refinance or avoid foreclosure using a variety of incentives to lenders and homeowners. The administration also included an $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers in the stimulus package. 
 And last week, the Federal Reserve, which has already cut overnight interest rates to nearly zero, announced it would buy some $1 trillion in government debt and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to chip away at mortgage rates. 
 The nationwide average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 5.08 percent compared with 5.62 percent a year ago, according to Bankrate, and many lenders are offering loans with interest rates near 4.75 percent.
 The Realtors' group reported that the median home price in February was $165,400, slightly higher than a revised $164,800 in January, but down 15 percent from a year ago. Median home prices peaked at $230,100 in July 2006.

HEADLINE: N.F.L. Owners Will Vote to Lengthen Season, Goodell Says

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: DANA POINT, Calif. 

 BODY:
National Football League owners could vote in May on plans to lengthen the regular season to 17 or 18 games. The longer regular season, however, is unlikely to begin any earlier than 2011, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday at the N.F.L.'s annual meeting. 
 Adding at least one regular-season game while reducing the preseason schedule is a critical component of what Goodell called ''increasing value'' -- the league's attempt to find new revenue while remaining attractive to fans in the challenging economic climate. There is almost no chance that the regular season will remain at 16 games. 
 But teams are still grappling with changes that will be required for a longer season, among them the possibility of larger rosters. Additional games would have to be negotiated with television networks that broadcast games and with the players union. Owners must decide soon how long the season will be because it is expected to be included in coming negotiations with players on a new collective bargaining agreement. 
 During his opening address to owners and team executives Monday morning, Goodell emphasized that the N.F.L. is facing trying times. 
 ''We have to recognize that after this, things might not be the way they were before,'' said the Houston Texans' owner, Robert McNair. ''People, their habits in the future might not be the same as in the past, their spending. We have the strongest brand going but we have to protect it. People were overleveraged. Businesses were overleveraged. Going forward, they're going to not be spending as much money, saving more. That's going to impact a lot of us.''
 It is difficult to tell whether the N.F.L.'s hand-wringing is because the league is suffering or because it is beginning the posturing that will take place during negotiations with the players. Goodell said owners talked about their priorities for negotiations, and while he did not offer specifics, Goodell said one of the issues was that the players needed to recognize how the costs of operating franchises have increased.
 Owners, though, continue to decline to open their books for the union's review. And in a deal announced Monday, DirecTV will pay about $1 billion a year to extend its rights to carry NFL Sunday Ticket broadcasts through the 2014 season. 
 Still, ticket sales have lagged in other sports and Goodell conceded that he expected season ticket renewals for 2009 to suffer in some markets. That will lead to television blackouts in cities like Detroit, where the economy has been hard hit and where there were blackouts last season. Goodell said the N.F.L. would not change its blackout policy, which requires teams to sell out home games 72 hours before kickoff to avoid a blackout, although teams frequently receive extensions. Extensions were needed to sell out some playoff games in January. 
 And in what could be the clearest sign of hamstrung corporate spending, two of the most high-profile stadiums in the league, the Cowboys' new stadium that will open this season and the new Giants/Jets stadium that is scheduled to open in 2010, have not sold their naming rights. Those rights are an especially important revenue stream for teams that are building new stadiums without municipal financing. 
 ''The risk is entirely on the clubs,'' Goodell said. ''In this environment, people are very cautious about how they spend their money. I do think it's going to have an impact on naming rights.''
 EXTRA POINTS
 Three new investors in the Pittsburgh Steelers were approved by owners Monday, including the Hall of Fame receiver and former Steeler John Stallworth. Six partners have been approved by owners as part of the reorganization that allows Dan Rooney and his son Art Rooney II to maintain ownership of the team. ... Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will make his return from knee surgery on the season opener of Monday Night Football, on Sept. 14 against Terrell Owens and the Buffalo Bills. The Steelers open the regular season Thursday, Sept. 10, against the Tennessee Titans. On Thanksgiving, Detroit will host Green Bay, Dallas will host Oakland, and Denver will host the Giants in the night game.

HEADLINE: Children Are Rejected By Schools Near Home

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
When Jeanne Shapiro received two letters on Saturday from Public School 290 on the Upper East Side, where she always assumed she would send her twin daughters, her husband cracked a joke about the way thin envelopes from college admissions offices tended to bear bad news. Mrs. Shapiro just laughed; P.S. 290 was a block and a half from the family's apartment, she figured, and every New Yorker knows that an address in a good school zone is tantamount to a guaranteed kindergarten seat. 
 But the letters said the 5-year-olds had been placed on a waiting list for the school, on East 82nd Street. 
 ''We were so flabbergasted we missed our stop on our elevator,'' Mrs. Shapiro said. ''We didn't even push the button because we didn't even believe what we were reading.''
 The Shapiro twins were among about three dozen children put on a waiting list at P.S. 290 in what parents and public officials in some of New York's priciest precincts fear will become the first season in which Manhattan children will be turned away from their neighborhood schools. The combination of overcrowded classrooms in neighborhoods newly inundated with young children, a recession that is causing some families to rethink expensive private schools, and a new citywide admissions process that requires people to sign up for kindergarten earlier has spread fear of lotteries and rejections across playgrounds and online discussion groups.
 ''In the past there was anxiety on the part of parents who had a zoned school they considered not desirable,'' said Robin Aronow, who runs a school admissions consulting firm, School Search NYC. ''Now that anxiety has stretched its way to even the families who have a desirable option, about whether that option will be available.''
 Andrew Jacob, a spokesman for the Department of Education, warned that the enrollment picture could change by September. Because the new process required people to sign up for their local schools earlier than in previous years, many who registered for zoned schools may choose to send their children to gifted-and-talented programs -- which will not announce their placements until June -- or to private schools. 
 ''It's far too soon to speculate about which schools will actually be capped in September,'' he said. ''The number of students who are interested in attending a school in the spring is often very different from the number who actually still want to attend the school in the fall.'' 
 Mr. Jacob said families should wait until September, when schools that are oversubscribed make arrangements with the Department of Education to handle the overflow. In the past, he noted, city schools outside Manhattan have capped enrollments, though it has not happened before in Manhattan neighborhoods that are sought after for their schools. This year, 34 schools outside Manhattan have done so.
 ''The bottom line is schools have to accommodate all of their zoned students unless they work out a capping plan with us, and that happens in September,'' he said. ''Even if they get to the point in September where some schools still have more zoned students that want to attend than we have seats, we work with them to see if there is a way to accommodate more students.'' 
 But parents and public officials say that it is not enough to hope that slots free up. On the Upper East Side, City Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin said her office had been inundated with calls from people who received letters from P.S. 290 saying their children were not being offered one of its 125 kindergarten seats ''at this time.'' 
 ''We sincerely hope that we will be able to accommodate all zoned families seeking a seat at P.S. 290 in the 2009-2010 school year,'' wrote the school's principal, Sharon Hill, without offering parents guidance on how to proceed. 
 Ms. Lappin faulted the mayor and the schools chancellor, not individual principals, for the situation. 
 ''How do you send letters to families telling them that their kids are not going to their zoned school and have no plan in place for them?'' she said in an interview. ''That's outrageous.
 ''The whole foundation of this system,'' she added, ''is that you're supposed to, at a local level, be able to send your kid to a school in the neighborhood.'' 
 Other schools may also create waiting lists. At P.S. 87 on the Upper West Side, Mr. Jacob said, 200 children zoned for the school applied for 175 seats. P.S. 59, on East 63rd Street, had 149 applications for 100 seats and P.S. 6 had 163 applicants for 150 seats. While some of the current crunch may be eased by people choosing private schools, public schools could also find themselves having to make room for private school refugees. Dr. Aronow, the consultant, said that just last week, she met with three new clients who were considering pulling their children out of private school for financial reasons. 
 Late last spring, some parents whose children were zoned for P.S. 234, in TriBeCa, and P.S. 89, in Battery Park City, were placed on waiting lists, although the schools ended up admitting all of them. This year, two new schools are opening in Lower Manhattan to help ease the crowding. 
 But the Department of Education did not rezone the neighborhoods to delineate who should attend the existing schools and who should go to the new ones, instead having P.S. 234 and P.S. 89 hold lotteries.
 Faith Paris Aarons, who lives opposite P.S. 234, said she was ''completely outraged'' to learn that her son had not been admitted. 
 ''If I had known this, I don't know if I would have continued to stay here in Manhattan,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Hotel Spas Try to Lure Locals

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
Hotel spas have long been a haven of calm for business travelers seeking to get the kinks out of their backs after a long flight or to unwind before a big meeting. But as the economic downturn hurts the hotel business, the spas are dealing with their own stresses. 
 According to PKF Consulting, spa revenue rose 5 percent from 2006 to 2007, largely because of higher charges for treatments. But since last fall, hotel spas have been dealing with both reduced occupancy and guests who have sharply curbed their discretionary spending. 
 PKF's report on the outlook for hotel spas projected decreased attendance for 2009. To counteract this, hotel spa operators are trying several approaches to increase business and cut costs.
 The spas are looking outside their hotels to cultivate a local and regional clientele. ''Resort spas in particular are trying to attract more drive-in traffic,'' said Lynne McNees, president of the International Spa Association. ''We've seen a lot of resort and destination spas opening up their doors for day guests.'' 
 Hotels like the Ginn Hammock Beach Resort in Palm Coast, Fla., the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn in Sonoma, Calif., have all begun to offer incentives to local residents like reduced admission fees or discounts on treatments. 
 While this strategy may help spas circumvent the challenge of reduced hotel occupancy, it can have undesired effects for business travelers who may find the spa overcrowded or unable to accommodate them. Hotels say they have been trying to avoid spa logjams by being more proactive, contacting guests ahead of time if they anticipate a large volume of local visitors and asking them to book spa treatments in advance. 
 The hotel spas are also shifting toward shorter, less expensive treatments. Ms. McNees, of the spa association, said that many spas offered quicker or cheaper treatments in the past, but now they are marketing them more aggressively. 
 ''Right now, I think where the spas are focused is trying to maintain the customer visits,'' said Jeremy McCarthy, director of spa operations for Starwood Hotels & Resorts. ''The spas are trying to see if they can touch as many people as they normally would.'' Even if hotel guests spend less per visit, more visitors would help make up the difference.
 ''What our members have been reporting is there are more people walking in the spa door,'' said Ms. McNees of the spa association. ''We're capturing more guests, but when they're there, they're spending less.'' 
 Hotels also are trying to increase spa revenue by offering packages in which several services are bundled at a discount, throwing in bonuses like a complimentary manicure when a more expensive service is booked, and issuing credits that guests can use for treatments during their stay. 
 ''We're seeing a lot of instances of spa packages being used as a way to incentivize guests,'' said Bruce Baltin, senior vice president at PKF Consulting, a company that focuses on the hospitality and tourism industries. Mr. Baltin said these kinds of promotions served two purposes. They bring revenue into the spa and they increase bookings of guest rooms without forcing the hotel to lower room rates substantially. 
 Jane Angelich, an entrepreneur in Marin County, Calif., says she recently received spa vouchers as rewards when booking rooms for business trips, both domestically and overseas. But at one hotel, the credit went unused when she could not find an appealing treatment for an amount close to the voucher's $100 price tag.
 ''You really can't get much of anything in the way of treatments for $100,'' she said. ''It gets you in the door and using some service where you pay the difference. Of course, the hope is that you will buy products or go back for additional services.'' 
 Spa packages appear to be catching on, though. At the St. Regis Resort, Monarch Beach, in Dana Point, Calif., a discounted massage and facial that was heavily promoted via the social networking site Facebook has been extended twice due to demand. 
 ''Business travelers are traveling more economically but at the same time you also have, I think, because of the fact that they're feeling more stress, a lot more people recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself,'' said Mr. McCarthy of Starwood.
 Still, if hotel spas are having difficulty attracting business, travelers may notice more equipment sidelined or out of order for extended periods as properties buy lower-end items that break down more easily and cut back on maintenance to save money, said Kurt Broadhag, president of K Allan Consulting. Mr. Broadhag's firm focuses on fitness facilities, which are often combined with spas at hotels. 
 Joe Sokohl says he thinks he has already experienced the down side. As a software designer for PracticeWorks, a company that manufactures dental technology, Mr. Sokohl goes to hotel spas when traveling. In recent weeks, Mr. Sokohl said, he visited two hotels with broken whirlpools that remained out of service for the duration of his stay. 
 ''The problem is from an experience standpoint, it makes a negative experience,'' he said. He said he even stopped booking a hotel he previously had used frequently in the past when the whirlpool was down for six weeks. He switched to a competing property nearby. ''The new hotel was the same rate. The fact that they had an indoor pool and a whirlpool that worked made enough of a difference.''

HEADLINE: One Benefit of Co-op Education: Likelihood of a Job

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The recession could give new life to co-operative education, programs that combine college classes with jobs in related fields that have been around for more than a century. 
 Cautious employers ''increasingly see that hiring a co-op graduate is a good strategy, since they know they are getting someone with experience,'' said Paul Stonely, president of the National Commission for Cooperative Education, a trade organization based in Boston. 
 The popularity of co-operative programs peaked about 15 years ago, before the federal government discontinued financial assistance. Now, colleges must rely on companies and agencies that are able -- and willing -- to take on young, temporary employees. 
 About 400 colleges offer co-operative programs, with the biggest enrollment in about two dozen schools. 
 Nationally, 95 percent of co-op students that participate in co-operative education have a job when they graduate, according to the commission. More than 60 percent accept permanent jobs from the employers for whom they worked while in school. 
 ''Employers have the benefit of trial employment, they have the ability to try these young people out,'' said Peter J. Franks, executive director and associate vice provost of the Steinbright Career Development Center at Drexel University. ''And they're getting people with fresh ideas.'' 
 Drexel, in Philadelphia, has offered co-op education since 1919. As at Kettering University in Flint, Mich., students attend class six months, then work six months. About 1,600 university-approved employers participate in programs that are available in all 73 majors. 
 Co-op education is required in a third of Drexel's courses, and 92 percent of its students, many in business and engineering, take part, Mr. Franks said. 
 Drexel enrollment has grown to 21,537 last year from 12,016 in 1999. and the co-op program ''is one of the main reasons they came here,'' Mr. Franks said. 
 Most Drexel students work in the Philadelphia area, although the trend among co-ops is to offer more options out of state, and even globally. Half the students are expected to be offered permanent jobs by their co-op employers. 
 Companies also save money because co-op employees do not receive health insurance or other benefits. 
 At Pace University in New York, students attend school and voluntarily work up to 20 hours a week during the semester. Seventy-five percent of positions in the cooperative education internship program are paid, including full-time summer jobs. 
 Although the university has placed about 1,000 students in internships annually since 2000, the number of students obtaining positions fell 20 percent last fall compared with two previous semesters, said Jody Queen-Herbert, executive director of co-op and career services at Pace. 
 Part of the decrease has to do with the recession, since Pace is near Wall Street financial markets, and the majority of students are business majors. 
 ''Are we affected by the economy? You bet we are. We are dealing now with the drastic decrease in opportunities in the finance industry,'' Ms. Herbert said.

HEADLINE: New Women's Soccer League Confident Despite Economy

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
As sports leagues in North America retrench during the recession, the soccer business in the United States, although cautious in the current climate, is taking a different course. Last week, the expansion Seattle Sounders F.C. of Major League Soccer played its inaugural game, sandwiched between the announcement of new teams in Vancouver, British Columbia; and Portland, Ore., that will begin play in 2011, increasing the league to 18 teams.
 On Sunday, the new seven-team women's league, Women's Professional Soccer, will try to re-establish a top-tier league from the ashes of the Women's United Soccer Association, which folded after the 2003 season. 
 ''I think they got blinded by the exuberance from the wildly successful 1999 World Cup and believed that would translate to a successful sports league,'' W.P.S. Commissioner Tonya Antonucci said. ''We have recast those expectations, playing in some new, smaller soccer stadiums, and with a business plan that can be sustained with attendances of 4,000 to 6,000.''
 The W.U.S.A. spent about $100 million in its first three years as the biggest stars of the sport, like Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy, tried to build on the success of the Women's World Cup. But some of the league's teams were run by media companies that had little understanding of or relationship to the grass-roots soccer market. The league generally eschewed any notion of working with the more established men's league. Now, for example, the women's team St. Louis Athletica is associated with a local club of more than 6,000 players, and teams in Washington, Chicago and Sky Blue F.C. in New Jersey are affiliated with youth programs.
 W.P.S. games will have a regular time slot on Fox Soccer Channel (6 p.m. Eastern on Sundays), Puma has signed on as an exclusive sponsor of the league, and W.P.S. marketing rights are held by Soccer United Marketing, the marketing arm of M.L.S. 
 The league has attracted the top United States national team players and well-known international stars like Marta (Los Angeles/Brazil) and Kelly Smith (Boston/England). Salaries are capped at $565,000 a team (but top players can earn more through sponsorship deals); the average is $32,000; and United States national team players earn $40,000 for the season, according to Sports Business Journal. 
 According to Peter Wilt, a former executive with the Chicago Fire of M.L.S. who is now running the Chicago Red Stars, perhaps the biggest difference between now and 2000 is the embrace and rush to exploit new media.
 ''When we started the Fire, we spent more than $1 million in traditional ads,'' Wilt said. ''Now, our budgets are smaller, but we don't need as much because there's Twitter and Facebook and other avenues. I have over 500 friends on Facebook, and when I send a message on Twitter, it goes to about 5,000 people, and it's not costing the team a dime.
 ''In the past, we spent a lot of money and were reaching the general sports fan. It was a lot of wasted expense. In the end, we're pioneers, and our only definition of success is survival.''
 The season opens Sunday, when Washington and Abby Wambach visit Marta and the Los Angeles Sol at the Home Depot Center. Late last week, the league decided to allow two players to comment during the match via Twitter posts. General managers of the seven W.P.S. teams have yet to decide if the experiment will continue beyond that game. 
 The league's teams also use the short 140-word blasts to provide updates on Twitter, which is in contrast to the critical reaction in the N.B.A. when Milwaukee's Charlie Villaneuva sent messages during a game. Fans of women's soccer can use Twitter to ''follow'' Antonucci, Wilt, some clubs (like the New Jersey/New York team, Sky Blue F.C.) and players.
 ''I think we've learned to be more nimble and creative on the business side,'' Antonucci said. ''The world's best players are coming here, we've got the top Americans and we think the game has gotten better, more dynamic and creative. There's an opportunity to develop new young stars into household names. The baton has been passed to a new generation, and we see it as a wonderful opportunity.''
 Antonucci added: ''The W.U.S.A. was a stand-alone model, it was on its own. We've partnered with M.L.S., but we're not W.M.L.S. Certainly, it's not going to be easy because of the economic situation, but I don't think anyone believes that sports in this country is going away.''
 The league's season begins in full the weekend of April 4-5, with three more games, including Sky Blue's opener against the visiting Sol.
 Notes
 GolTV, a cable channel devoted to soccer, has extended its deal to carry games from La Liga in Spain through 2012.
 Officials from A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, Chelsea in England and Club America in Mexico will be in New York on Tuesday to announce the details of their summer mini-tournament in the United States.
 Most Brazilian soccer players go by one name -- Ronaldinho, Diego, Fred. It is a convention that also applies to the country's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known simply as Lula. Ever wonder what your nickname might be? Here is a Web site that has generated more than a half-million one-named wonders: minimalsworld.net/BrazilName/brazilian.shtml. For example, entering Barack Obama yields Obamiano.
 WEEK'S NOTABLES
 PLAYER In M.L.S., Landon Donovan, back in the United States after a short-term loan with Bayern Munich, scored twice in the final 10 minutes Sunday, when the Los Angeles Galaxy salvaged a point in a 2-2 tie with visiting D.C. United. Donovan is now seventh on the league's career goal-scoring list with 86.
 CLUB In Spain, Barcelona won its third straight game on Sunday, pummeling Malaga, 6-0, to maintain its 6-point lead over Real Madrid. Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o scored twice, increasing his goal total this season to 25 in La Liga. Real is on a 13-game unbeaten streak; its last loss was Dec. 13, against Barcelona.

HEADLINE: Rally on Banking Plan Propels Wall St. to Best Day in Months

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Details of the government's plans to clean up the nation's banks ignited a blazing stock market rally on Monday, lifting Wall Street to its best one-day performance in five months and tempting some investors to imagine what they would not have dared just a few weeks ago -- that the worst may finally be over.
 The Dow surged nearly 500 points, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose more than 7 percent, in what amounted to a rare cheer from Wall Street for the Obama administration and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. 
 ''This is what the markets wanted,'' said David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist at UBS. 
 In the last two weeks, glimmers of hope for a recovery in the financial industry have pushed the Dow up 19 percent and the S.& P. 500 up 21.5 percent from their bear market lows, the steepest such rally in stocks since 1938. 
 Just last month, major stock markets spiraled to a 12-year low after the administration delivered a rough outline of a public-private partnership to shore up the major banks -- with little substance or detail. 
 But on Monday morning, as the Treasury Department filled in the blanks of a $500 billion to $1 trillion plan to buy up troubled assets, investors started buying early in Europe and did not stop until the closing bell rang on Wall Street. The Dow gained 497.48 points, or 6.84 percent, to close at 7,775.86, while the S.& P. 500 was up 54.38 points, to 822.92. The Nasdaq closed 6.8 percent higher, at 1,555.77.
 The rally was cemented by signs of a possible uptick in the housing market. The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales rose 5.1 percent in February as buyers scooped up foreclosed homes. 
 ''The areas that fall the fastest are going to recover,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''There's going to be a floor established. Seven hundred thousand dollar houses are $250,000 -- that's what's bringing people back into the markets.''
 In New York, the S.& P. financial index surged 18 percent, propelling an updraft that lifted every sector of the stock market. Banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, which could participate in the program, each rose more than 20 percent. Citigroup, whose stock fell below $1 two weeks ago, closed at $3.13. 
 The government is betting its plan will loosen credit markets and restore normal lending conditions by allowing banks to deleverage billions of dollars in mortgage-related debt sitting on their balance sheets. The program would be financed using capital from private investors like hedge funds, and about $75 billion to $100 billion from the $700 billion financial bailout. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- which guarantees the bank accounts of individuals -- would provide most of the financing.
 ''This is the free-money rally,'' said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of Fusion IQ, an investment and research firm. ''Traders like the fact that there's a boatload of cash headed their way.''
 The Financial Services Roundtable, a leading financial services lobby, threw its weight behind the Treasury's plans on Monday morning, saying that the purchase program would keep the troubled assets from bogging down big banks and preventing a recovery in banking and the broader financial system.
 Mark Mobius, the chairman of Templeton Asset Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that a bull market rally was under way. Other analysts have declared that a punishing slide from Dow 14,000 had finally ended, and that the markets had found a floor.
 ''Have we bottomed out?'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''I think so.''
 But others are being much more cautious. The global economy is shrinking fast, the United States is still losing 600,000 jobs every month, and the rally that lifted the S.& P. 500 24 percent from November to early January fell apart. 
 Analysts warn that the recent gains could collapse just as quickly if the administration's asset purchase program hits a snag or housing deteriorates further.
 Underscoring those weaknesses, bond investors are forcing financial companies to pay more to borrow money, expanding the difference between financial bond rates and Treasury rates to 8.5 percent. 
 The report showing a jump in sales of previously owned homes fed hopes that housing was finally scraping bottom, at least in the West and other parts of the country hit badly by the housing bust. Economists and real estate experts said the hardest hit parts of the country, like California, Nevada and Arizona, were starting to emerge from the worst of the housing crisis. 
 But economists said that, despite the increase, a wave of new foreclosures was likely to hit the housing market as people without jobs used up their savings and defaulted on their mortgages. Markets like New York or Washington, where prices have not tumbled so sharply, will probably face more stagnant sales and sliding prices in the months ahead.
 ''We're in for a really difficult 2009,'' said Lance Martin, a real estate broker in Southern California's hard-hit Inland Empire -- mainly Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 6/32, to 100 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.65 percent, from 2.63 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Planning a Colossal Shift on Pollutants

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH and FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency, about to declare heat-trapping gases to be dangerous pollutants, has embarked on one of the most ambitious regulatory challenges in history.
 The move is likely to have a profound effect across the economic spectrum, affecting transportation, power plants, oil refineries, cement plants and other manufacturers.
 It sets the agency on a collision course with carmakers, coal plants and other businesses that rely on fossil fuels, which fear that the finding will impose complex and costly rules. 
 But it may also help the Obama administration's efforts to push through a federal law to curb carbon dioxide emissions by drawing industry support for legislation, which many companies see as less restrictive and more flexible than being monitored by a regulatory agency. And it will lay a basis for the United States in the negotiations leading up to a global climate treaty to be signed in Copenhagen in December. 
 Once made final, the agency's finding will pave the way for federal regulation of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. 
 In practical terms, the finding would allow quick federal regulation of motor vehicle emissions of heat-trapping gases and, if further actions are taken by the E.P.A., it could open the doors for regulatory controls on power plants, oil refineries, cement plants and other factories.
 On Friday, the E.P.A. sent its finding to the Office of Management and Budget for review, according to a Web site that lists pending federal rules. Once the budget office clears the finding, it can be signed by the E.P.A.'s administrator, Lisa P. Jackson. There is also likely to be a public comment period on the proposed finding, but there is wide expectation that it will be put in place. 
 Some policy makers greeted the agency's action as the first step in a new approach to climate change.
 ''This finding will officially end the era of denial on global warming,'' Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who leads a select committee on global warming, said in a statement. 
 But Bill Kovacs, a specialist on global warming issues with the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that an endangerment finding would automatically provoke a tangle of regulatory requirements for businesses large and small. 
 If finalized, the finding by the agency could lead to a vast extension of its reach. Much is unknown about the details of what the E.P.A. is proposing, including how stringently the agency would regulate the emissions and how it would go about doing so.
 But in February, Ms. Jackson indicated she was aware the agency could be stepping into a minefield by issuing such a finding. ''We are poised to be specific on what we regulate and on what schedule,'' she said at the time. ''We don't want people to spin that into a doomsday scenario.'' 
 Experts said Monday that the E.P.A.'s action would put pressure on Congress to pass federal legislation that could supplant the agency's plan or guide how it was carried out. A federal bill is preferred by many environmentalists and policy makers, as well as by industry.
 John D. Walke, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he welcomed the agency's decision but hoped it would ultimately lead to federal legislation. 
 ''For some period we may have parallel efforts of Environmental Protection Agency pursuing or even adopting regulation while the eventual main show will be in Congress,'' Mr. Walke said.
 Still, many doubt that legislation to cap emissions can pass this year, in the midst of a recession and at a time when carbon dioxide emissions are down because production is lower.
 The E.P.A.'s move is the latest in a flurry of proposals that signal its determination to break from the Bush administration, which infuriated environmentalists by sidestepping the issue of regulating heat-trapping gases.
 Earlier this month, the agency proposed creating a greenhouse-gas emissions registry, which would require industries -- including oil refineries and cement makers, as well as utilities and pulp and paper manufacturers -- to report how much pollution they were emitting.
 The endangerment proposal is another step. In 2007, the Supreme Court ordered the E.P.A. to determine whether carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases qualified as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Ms. Jackson, the agency's administrator, suggested to The New York Times in February that she hoped to act on emissions of heat-trapping gases by early April, before the second anniversary of the court's ruling.
 The Bush administration had stalled in complying with the court order, opting for more study of the issue, although there was wide consensus among E.P.A. experts that a determination that carbon dioxide was a danger to the public was supported by scientific research. 
 Asked about the E.P.A.'s move, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, emphasized the importance of going through Congress. ''The way to deal with greenhouse gases,'' Mr. Gibbs said, ''is to work with Congress in order to put together a plan that deals with this and creates a market for renewable energy.''
 There are several reasons that there is a widespread preference for a legislative ''cap-and-trade'' approach to regulating carbon dioxide emissions, as opposed to E.P.A. regulation.
 A central reason, said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, is that Congressional action is less subject to litigation and could not be easily overturned by a new administration. 
 But a deeper concern among the industry is that regulation by the E.P.A. is a blunt tool. The agency's regulatory powers have previously been applied mainly to pollutants that do damage on a regional level, like nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons.
 By contrast, carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases that the E.P.A. proposes to regulate do harm on a global scale. 
 ''The act does not deal well with an emission that's virtually ubiquitous and travels through the atmosphere,'' said Carol Raulston, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, a coal industry group.

HEADLINE: Circus Flies O'er Troubles With Greatest of Ease

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Five minutes into each performance of ''Zing Zang Zoom,'' the new magical menagerie from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, an 8,500-pound elephant named Asia seems to vanish abruptly in a grand illusion. Is it possible this disappearing act presages the future of the circus itself? 
 The down economy has taken its toll on working-class families, the traditional core audience of Ringling, a show-business perennial that offended circus purists by abandoning its classic three rings three years ago. And competitors, both nouveau and non, have proliferated, from Cirque du Soleil to New York's Big Apple Circus. 
 Furthermore when Ringling's 139th edition arrives Thursday at Madison Square Garden, audiences will be leafleted by animal-welfare protesters following a six-week trial in federal court where the circus answered charges that it mistreats the very symbol of the show: its elephants. And even the traditional opening-night postperformance gala has been canceled for the first time in decades. 
 Big Bertha, as circus folk call Ringling, is under siege as never before. Kenneth Feld, the company's 60-year-old producer, dismissed any idea that Ringling is no longer the Greatest Show on Earth. ''We have survived -- and thrived -- through every upheaval, every world war, every election, every economic crisis, and even 9/11,'' he said. ''And now we are the nation's entertainment security blanket.''
 Experts say the show could benefit from the economic meltdown. ''The circus is recession-proof -- or at least, Ringling is,'' said William B. Hall, a 75-year-old circus producer in Churchville, Pa., who has observed it since the 1950s. ''It's about escape and family.'' 
 And value, which is king: McDonald's sales are up, Wal-Mart revenues have bounced, and the movie industry has seen a box office surge in audiences and ticket sales. 
 ''For many families now a trip to Disney World is out of the question, but a drive to Ringling can give the kids a vacation for an afternoon,'' said Thomas J. Crangle, an independent event-marketing consultant in Las Vegas.
 The recession has benefited the circus in other ways: excess railroad capacity and the oil-price collapse have been boons to Mr. Feld's enormous global transportation operations, including both its mile-long circus trains. 
 Nevertheless the future use of Ringling's emblem -- the elephant -- is threatened in United States District Court in Washington, where closing arguments took place last week. The lawsuit turns on whether, under the 1973 Endangered Species Act, it is legal to chain the company's 54 Asian elephants and prod them with pointed bullhooks. (Circus executives call them ''guides.'') 
 ''We don't think a circus is a good environment for animals like elephants,'' said Jonathan R. Lovvorn, counsel for the Fund for Animals, one of four plaintiffs in the case. He said the chaining and hooking amounts to abuse. 
 In court Ringling denied any abuse and marshaled veterinary records, saying that the care exceeded federal regulations. Ringling also cited its $5 million, 200-acre conservation center in Polk City, Fla., where 22 elephants have been born since 1992.
 Mr. Feld said he couldn't discuss the lawsuit (a judge is expected to rule in several months), adding: ''Performers come and go, but the constant factor has been the elephants. They are our most valuable asset, so why would we ever do anything to treat them badly?'' He added that domesticated elephants have been working with humans for centuries. 
 The company has long bested animal-rights challengers in the courts. In 2006 a jury in Fairfax County, Va., found that Ringling did not harm or conspire against the advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The organization had sued, claiming that Mr. Feld and his associates orchestrated a huge conspiracy, sending agents into the organization and other animal-rights groups to monitor their activities. With the latest court case, Mr. Lovvorn said, the narrow issue involved made it different from previous lawsuits.
 Though Ringling's arena crowd pleasers have been disparaged in comparison to Cirque du Soleil's high-end shows in the United States, Europe and South America, the privately held Montreal-based Soleil has always rejected the notion that it competes with Ringling. 
 Mr. Feld agreed that Soleil has ''a different niche, a different experience and a different audience.'' And these days Soleil shows are hard hit in the Las Vegas recession malaise; its higher-priced tickets are, unthinkably, being discounted.
 Ringling benefits from its ''ticket price, which isn't exactly a loss-leader, but it gets people into the tent,'' said David Rosenwasser, director of the Greater St. Charles Convention and Visitors Bureau in Missouri and an experienced arena manager. 
 Mr. Feld said circus attendance is up 12 percent from last year. But with discounting Ringling is charging less for tickets now and is offering, at the Garden, some tickets for $5 with promotional coupons. Mr. Feld acknowledged that average ticket prices were down 7 percent to 8 percent from last year, presenting this as a plus. ''We are the Wal-Mart of the entertainment business, affordable for everyone.'' 
 Drawing in audiences with saturation television coverage, school promotions, shopper deals and ethnically targeted mailings, Ringling ''has made an art of selling their merchandise,'' Mr. Crangle said, pointing to child catchers like the $20 Astro Light Swords. Most event producers hand over 30 to 50 percent of merchandise sales to arenas, but Ringling keeps 100 percent, Mr. Crangle said. The markup can be four times the cost. 
 Though arenas make money on soda, alcohol and parking, they accede to the Ringling contract in order to attract crowds and excitement. ''Some of the arena operators will lose face in their local communities if they don't get Ringling,'' Mr. Rosenwasser said. 
 The prices Mr. Feld charges for concession items have not increased this year, he said, but revenues ''are the same, though my first thought in the recession was that concessions would drop.'' 
 The Ringling cavalcade includes three touring circus shows visiting 120 cities a year; 10 million customers see each new arena show as it travels 30,000 miles during the nearly two-year run.
 But the circus is just a unit of Feld Entertainment, a third-generation family-owned private company started in 1967 that bills itself as the largest live entertainment production company in the world; it is headquartered in Vienna, Va., near Washington. Its many other proliferating entities include ''Disney on Ice'' touring companies, ''Disney Live!'' theatrical shows and a consumer products division that creates the novelty merchandise.
 But the company is no stranger to failure: its ''Three Musketeers'' musical flopped on Broadway in 1984, and its $25-million one-ring tent show, ''Barnum's Kaleidoscape,'' failed in 2001, to be replaced by Ringling's less-costly truck-transported Gold unit, also tented, which visits smaller locales.
 Its newest business, Feld Motor Sports, presents 600 performances a year of truck, motorcycle and drag-racing shows in North America and Europe. In 2007, when the purchase price of the motor-sports businesses was reported as $205 million -- the biggest deal in Feld's 40-year history -- analysts said that annual revenues were more than $150 million and growing. 
 ''People were shocked at the dollar amount,'' said Mr. Crangle, the consultant in Las Vegas. ''But it's a perfect fit for Ringling,'' which intends to promote the business internationally, where audiences can enjoy monster trucks smashing into stock cars sans translators. But like a currency arbitrageur, Mr. Feld lamented that international profits have ''grown more slowly because -- with the euro down 27 percent -- we took a hit.'' 
 As a private company Feld has always been guarded about its financial data, but analysts estimated its pre-recession annual revenues to be more than $600 million, and commercial rating agencies have published profit estimates of $50 million to $60 million. Mr. Feld's personal fortune has been estimated at more than $700 million by Forbes. 
 ''The circus is tremendously lucrative,'' Mr. Rosenwasser said.
 It was puzzling, then, to circus buffs when Ringling canceled its venerable opening-night gala, Mr. Hall, the veteran circus producer, said. 
 The party wasn't canceled because the circus couldn't afford it, Mr. Feld said, but rather because ''it's an extravagance that isn't appropriate at this time.'' 
 He was willing to spend more than $15 million on ''Zing Zang Zoom,'' his most expensive offering. When Ringling axed the three-ring show and enhanced the pyrotechnics and video projections, some critics derided it as the ''ringless brothers circus,'' saying that the show emphasized technology over artistry.
 But sophisticated arena audiences demanded a ''contemporary show,'' Mr. Feld replied, adding: ''Paying customers are not coming to pay for technology. They come for the talent.''
 Some purists, however, take issue. No rings and high technology were ''deplorable -- they just lost their mystique,'' said Buckles Woodcock, 74, a retired elephant trainer who runs Buckles Blog (bucklesw.blogspot.com). ''I understand that times change, but the money Ringling spends on all those pyrotechnics they could spend on hiring more acts.'' 
 He sighed, then added: ''But they're making money. Business is business. And the parade moves on.''

HEADLINE: When Economy Sours, a Tootsie Roll Can Still Soothe the Soul

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Raymond Schneider politely elbowed his way through crowds of customers as he made for the bulk candy bins at Dylan's Candy Bar across from Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. Since he was laid off in December, Mr. Schneider, a 33-year-old interior designer, says he has become a ''gummy junkie,'' stocking up on sweets every time he shops for groceries. 
 ''Sugar is comforting,'' he said as he scooped Red Licorice Scottie Dogs into a plastic bag. ''There's nothing more stressful than growing financial insecurity everywhere.''
 The recession seems to have a sweet tooth. As unemployment has risen and 401(k)'s have shrunk, Americans, particularly adults, have been consuming growing volumes of candy, from Mary Janes and Tootsie Rolls to Gummy Bears and cheap chocolates, say candy makers, store owners and industry experts. 
 Theories vary on exactly why. For many, sugar lifts spirits dragged low by the languishing economy. For others, candy also provides a nostalgic reminder of better times. And not insignificantly, it is relatively cheap. 
 ''People may indulge themselves a little bit more when times are tough,'' said Jack P. Russo, an analyst with the Edward Jones retail brokerage in St. Louis. ''These are low-cost items that people can afford pretty easily.''
 At Candyality, a store in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago, business has jumped by nearly 80 percent compared with this time last year, and the owner, Terese McDonald, said she was struggling to keep up with the demand for Bit-O-Honeys, Swedish Fish and Sour Balls. 
 At the Candy Store in San Francisco, the owner, Diane Campbell, has tripled her orders for nostalgic candies like Necco Wafers and Mallo Cups in recent months. Many of her customers tell her that even though they are living on less, they're setting aside cash for candy. 
 ''They put candy in their actual budget,'' she said.
 Many big candy makers are reporting rising sales and surprising profits even as manufacturers of other products are struggling to stay afloat. Cadbury reported a 30 percent rise in profits for 2008 while Nestle's profits grew by 10.9 percent, according to public filings. Hershey, which struggled for much of 2008, saw profits jump by 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 Lindt & Sprungli, which specializes in more expensive products like Lindt and Ghirardelli chocolate, announced that even though it expects to close some of its luxury retail stores this year, it also expects chocolate sales to remain strong through mainstream retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. 
 ''All is well in candy land,'' said Jamie Hallman, owner of the Sweetdish candy store in the Marina district of San Francisco.
 In Manhattan, at the sweet-smelling confines of Economy Candy on the Lower East Side, the owner, Jerry Cohen, said he increased his orders by 10 percent in January and February to keep up with demand for candies like Sugar Daddies and Sour Razzles. On a recent Sunday, Mr. Cohen had about a dozen workers in the narrow store trying to keep the candy tables and penny candy bins restocked as shoppers -- the vast majority of them adults -- grabbed candy bars and dug their hands into bins of Tootsie Rolls and Bit-O-Honeys.
 ''We have been wiping out of inventory,'' he said. 
 Mr. Cohen's son, Mitchell, 23, who works long hours as a Wall Street investment banker, helps out at the store on some Sundays because, he said, he finds the mood uplifting. He noted that his Wall Street co-workers have also been eating more candy: The 10-pound candy bags he puts on his desk are being devoured in one week instead of the usual two.
 ''That's why I like going to the store on Sundays,'' Mitchell Cohen said. ''Everyone is happy.''
 There may be historic precedent to the recessionary strength of the candy business. During the 1930s, candy companies thrived, introducing an array of confections that remain popular today. Snickers started in 1930. Tootsie Pops appeared in 1931. Mars bars with almonds and Three Musketeers bars followed in 1932. 
 Hershey, the dominant candy brand during the Depression, remained profitable enough through the 1930s for the company to finance its own work program for the unemployed, said Pamela Whitenack, Hershey's community archives director.
 ''Candy companies are relatively recession-proof,'' said Peter Liebhold, chairman of the Smithsonian Institution's work and industry division. ''During the Great Depression, candy companies stayed in business.''
 Candy seems to conjure memories of times before bank collapses and government bailouts. Jackie Hague, vice president of marketing for the New England Confectionery Company in Revere, Mass., which makes Necco wafers and other candies, said the company has received an unusual number of letters, e-mail messages and telephone calls from customers saying their candies had helped them ''flash back to childhood.''
 Indeed, store owners and manufacturers find that the hottest-selling candies these days are cheaper, old-fashioned ones. In addition to strong sales of Necco Wafers and Mary Janes, the New England Confectionery Company said sales of Sweetheart candies jumped 20 percent at Valentine's Day. Eastern Sales and Marketing, a major candy representative for manufacturers, has noticed ''double digit growth'' for Gummy Bears, Violet Gum and Jelly Bellies, according to John Anastasi, the company's senior vice president of the confectionery business unit.
 Not everyone in the industry is benefiting from tighter wallets. Edgar Roesch, a food analyst with Soleil Securities, an investment research firm in New York, predicts that the recession may present more opportunities for more economical, mass-market brands like Hershey than for, say, gourmet truffles.
 Until the fourth quarter of last year, he said, ''Things like Hershey Kisses were losing out to higher-end brands.'' But this year, that trend has reversed. 
 Increased candy consumption may have already taken a toll on the waistlines of many New Yorkers. 
 Liz Josefsberg, who runs four Weight Watchers meetings a week in Manhattan, said talk of stress eating involving candy was taking up an increasing percentage of her meetings. ''I'm hearing a lot about Skittles and Mary Janes,'' she said. 
 Since Piper Gray, 23, arrived in Manhattan from Memphis in September, she has lived on a tiny salary from a journalism internship and tries to remain optimistic about eventually landing permanent work, even though prospects look discouraging. 
 Beside two friends at Economy Candy on a recent Sunday afternoon, she sounded cheerful as she munched on mini Smooth 'N Melty nonpareils, joked about her addiction to Creme Eggs and scoffed at the merits of Swedish Fish. Candy has become her affordable escape.
 ''Apples and oatmeal only go so far,'' she wrote later in an e-mail message. ''It's so tempting to pick up an 88-cent pack of Skittles as a little pick-me-up. So I won't feel so deprived.''

HEADLINE: Democrats See Power Vacuum in Party and Trouble on the Horizon

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and ROSS GOLDBERG

 BODY:
With major elections approaching over the next year and a half, leading New York Democrats are expressing deep concerns that the party has been thrown into turmoil by competing personal agendas, ideological rifts and a leadership void.
 Democratic politicians and strategists warn that the strife threatens to undercut not only any chance of remaining competitive in the race for City Hall this year, but hopes of holding on to the Governor's Mansion and a United States Senate seat in 2010.
 At the heart of the problem, Democrats say, is a party that has been unable to maintain any semblance of cohesiveness (or, more bluntly, discipline) as its most prominent leaders either struggle with their own political misfortunes or stand on the sidelines. They add that the departure of Hillary Rodham Clinton from New York politics has contributed significantly to the leadership void, with party operatives who had been loyal to her scattering to different camps. 
 ''What you have is people exercising their own self-interests in an effort to fill a power vacuum in the party,'' said Scott Levenson, a Democratic political consultant.
 Councilman Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat who is running for mayor, agreed, saying that there was ''a general lack of leadership in the Democratic Party these days.''
 The mayoral race is heightening the frustrations. Rather than serving as a rallying point for Democrats, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign for a third term has become, to many Democrats, a sign of the party's problems.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who is again bankrolling his own campaign, has lured top Democratic strategists, while prominent Democrats like Senator Charles E. Schumer and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, maintain what some say is a nonaggression pact with the mayor, once a Democrat, then a Republican who turned independent in 2007.
 The situation has already led some Democrats to be pessimistic about the party's prospects in the mayoral race, nearly eight months before Election Day.
 ''Frankly, I don't see the party organizing against him,'' Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, a Brooklyn Democrat, said about Mr. Bloomberg. ''I don't see the party committing a lot of its scarce resources to what most would consider an unlikely win.''
 On the surface, at least, Democrats ought to be riding high.
 In November, the party won a majority in the State Senate, giving it control of the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature for the first time since the New Deal.
 Yet, for all the excitement the victory inspired among Democrats, a sobering realization began to set in: They are now responsible for what does or does not happen in Albany. And with the state in the middle of an economic storm, that has raised tensions in the party.
 Just last week, Gov. David A. Paterson and leading Senate Democrats openly skirmished over how best to prevent sharp service cuts in the financially troubled Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 The governor -- who supports tolls on the bridges over the East and Harlem Rivers -- chided the Democrats for proposing an alternative plan that he called inadequate. He even suggested that he might seek Republican support to break the impasse.
 To a large degree, Democrats trace the party's problem to the absence of a compelling leader to pull the disparate factions together.
 As the highest-ranking Democrat in the state, Mr. Paterson ought to be that leader, but some party members say that several factors have weakened Mr. Paterson and left him vulnerable to a primary challenge next year, possibly from Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general.
 First, there were the peculiar circumstances surrounding Mr. Paterson's ascension. As Eliot Spitzer's lieutenant governor, he got the job when Mr. Spitzer resigned over a prostitution scandal. Then there was a series of public missteps, including his clumsy handling of the selection of a senator to replace Mrs. Clinton.
 Whether he can turn things around is a subject of intense speculation -- and concern -- in Democratic circles, given that he will be at the top of the party's ticket in 2010.
 Many Democrats are particularly worried that Mr. Paterson faces the immediate task of trying to put together a budget in a time of economic peril. Already, his proposed cuts have drawn criticism from unions representing public employees and hospital workers, a crucial Democratic constituency.
 ''There's nothing good about it,'' said Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Brooklyn Democrat, referring to the governor's political standing. ''But he has time to right the ship.''
 The appointment of Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a little-known congresswoman from upstate, to replace Mrs. Clinton has also exposed rifts in the party, largely along regional and ideological lines.
 Ms. Gillibrand, who represented a conservative district that wraps around Albany, is viewed warily by liberal Democrats in New York City who have significant sway in the party's nominating process.
 Liberals are troubled by a number of positions she held while in Congress, including her support of gun rights and for cracking down on so-called sanctuary cities like New York that do not enforce all immigration laws.
 While Ms. Gillibrand has softened her stance on these issues, several Democrats from the New York metropolitan region, including two members of Congress, have indicated that they are considering challenging her in next year's primary. That prospect has alarmed some Democrats who believe that an acrimonious primary could leave their party with a weakened candidate heading into the general election.
 Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he believed that Ms. Gillibrand would, indeed, face a primary that would ''serve as a proxy battle for several fault lines.''
 ''There remain significant questions about the very conservative positions that she took during her time as a Congress member that have been unanswered,'' he said.
 What is perhaps most immediately troubling to many Democrats is that the party may be unable to prevent Mr. Bloomberg from winning a third term.
 The most recent sign of their pessimism came last week, when Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens and is known to relish a fight, suggested that he might not run for mayor, after declaring his candidacy.
 Mr. Bloomberg has managed to frustrate opponents like Mr. Weiner by recruiting Democratic operatives, including several who were part of Mrs. Clinton's organization before she became secretary of state.
 If there is any consolation for Democrats, it is that the state Republican Party, after a series of election debacles, might be too feeble to capitalize on the Democrats' troubles, though the possibility of a prominent candidate -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, for example -- running in 2010 has generated some hope in Republican ranks..

HEADLINE: That Big Hole in the Economy, and Who Dug It

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
The makers of ''Ten Trillion and Counting,'' Tuesday's ''Frontline'' on PBS, want to make really, really, really sure that you know that George W. Bush, not Barack Obama, put the country in the economic mess it's in now. More than half the program is devoted to cataloging the Bush administration's economic policies, which, as portrayed here, come across as appallingly reckless, a burden that will grind us down for generations to come.
 Though it may be accurate, it's an emphasis that is unfortunate for two reasons. One is that it leaves the smart-sounding commentators assembled here not much time to talk about what matters now: how we get out of the mire. The other is that it could cause anyone who still has any regard for Mr. Bush to tune out the program as just another exercise in Bush-bashing. This is a program everyone needs to watch if the search for solutions is ever going to get beyond the simplistic, accusatory catchphrases that sometimes seem to pass for economic-policy debate in Washington. 
 The title, of course, refers to the national debt, and the program does a fine job of spelling out just what a daunting situation Mr. Obama has inherited: the federal government was already borrowing huge amounts, and now, as the only entity big enough to revive the gasping economy, it has to borrow more. 
 There is a succinct history lesson on how the Republican ''starve the beast'' economic philosophy -- if you keep taxes low, government spending will automatically be kept low for lack of money -- ran off the rails. And then, the program says, Mr. Bush took things a step further by cutting taxes while starting a war.
 ''We borrowed money from China to give tax cuts to the best-off people in our society and leave our kids paying the bill for a war that we chose to fight,'' says Matt Miller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning research group. ''That was really unprecedented.''
 Perhaps Mr. Bush's main economic failure, based on the evidence here, was that he did not use the attacks of 9/11 to call on Americans to sacrifice, as other wartime presidents had. Instead he expanded spending -- on the Iraq war, on prescriptions for the aging -- without a template of how to pay for it. 
 Now it is Mr. Obama who will have to make the case for sacrifice, though the Iraq war is winding down, and the one in Afghanistan is somewhat murky in the public mind. Good luck. 
 ''It's hard to sell a message of pain to Americans,'' says David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal. ''It's hard to tell them that we have lived beyond our means and we're going to have to spend less money on benefits that you enjoy, and we're going to have to collect more taxes from you than we do now because we overpromised in the past. That's a very hard message to deliver when unemployment is low and everybody's feeling good. It's an impossible message to deliver when people are frightened that they're going to lose their houses, lose their jobs and their kids are going to be out of work.''

HEADLINE: American Eyes on the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Has a 'Katrina Moment' Arrived?,'' by Frank Rich, and ''Toxic R Us,'' by Maureen Dowd (columns, March 22):
 In his first two months in office, President Obama has proposed groundbreaking policy initiatives and legislation in the face of considerable opposition from powerful special interests. His budget and tax proposals alone earn him a seat next to Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 Mean-spirited negativity often pervades the political process. The media, in turn, expect miracles in public discourse. Isn't it enough to do a wonderful job creating public policy, and pushing for its passage in Congress? 
 On the tough shoulders of those considerable achievements, let's congratulate our new president, Barack Obama. 
 Instead of projecting our fear, let's begin to get to know this person in whom we've placed our boundless hope and capacity for love.
 Cal Hoffman New York, March 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I felt sick to my stomach after reading Frank Rich's column. Lawrence H. Summers, director of the president's National Economic Council, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, belong to the same club of men and women who have sent our economy into a tailspin and are still looking for ways to squeeze a profit for themselves and their friends out of what is a calamity for millions of Americans.
 There are many things the president has done right in his first few weeks in office. But surrendering economic policy to those who were the architects of the current crisis will end up being a cancer on his presidency. 
 If the president doesn't stand up to these people, we will know where and with whom he stands: for Wall Street, with Wall Street. It will be a historic betrayal of the trust of the American people.
 Gregg Gonsalves New Haven, March 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Most Americans support high rewards for hard work and great achievement. What drives the outrage over bonuses to the A.I.G. executives is the sense of injustice at rewards for absolute failure and the complete absence of personal responsibility by the many perpetrators in this calamity.
 Simply put, people are losing their jobs and homes, and these guys are getting millions. 
 Americans assume that you get fired for failing. You don't get a bonus.
 People conclude that the system has become so perverse that it should not be supported. The institutions have lost the trust of the people completely. 
 Now the public wants these self-serving gamblers to atone by publicly acknowledging their guilt and apologizing, renouncing ''rewards'' for their gross failure and volunteering a hand to help dig out of this mess, for the good of the country. Then I think the people would move on.
 Stacey Duke San Francisco, March 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Contrary to what David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Obama, thinks, thousands of us are sitting around our kitchen tables thinking about A.I.G.
 I retired from a metro Atlanta school district that opted out of Social Security in the 1980s. Guess where it put its portion of our contributions toward retirement? In a tax-sheltered annuity operated by A.I.G. 
 The tentacles of A.I.G. do, in fact, reach into the lives of ordinary Americans.
 Diane Shearer Tucker, Ga., March 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Are We Home Alone?'' (column, March 22):
 I agree with Thomas L. Friedman about the absence of leadership on the financial crisis from President Obama, his cabinet and Congress. They are following their constituents rather than leading them, allowing priorities to get out of order. They are failing to make important parts of the case as to why our top priority needs to be to rescue the banking system.
 People as a whole don't understand very well the relationship between their concerns about their jobs and homes and the sustenance of the banking system and why if it is allowed to fail, the lower and middle classes are the ones who will suffer most.
 I hear members of Congress say their constituents are concerned about their jobs or the A.I.G. bonuses. The representatives tell them that they'll vote accordingly rather than help them understand the importance of saving the banking system and how it connects to their jobs, loans and so on.
 President Obama is trying to do a lot of things, but he is not telling us that the most important thing on which all others depend is rescuing the banking system. 
 Our leaders need to explain to people that if we are to use what we learned from the Great Depression, and we'd be foolish not to, we need to save the banking system, and if we don't, the recession could become a depression.
 We need to demand this kind of leadership from our leaders, and they need to call us to contribute.
 Cynthia Norton Chautauqua, N.Y., March 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Anger Mismanagement,'' by Charles M. Blow (column, March 21): 
 I think that the media and the Washington elite have misinterpreted the ''Main Street'' anger against the A.I.G. bonuses. 
 Most Americans can rationally understand that a ''mere'' $165 million is a drop in the bucket with regard to the economic crisis we face and that the executives of A.I.G. are self-aggrandizing, untrustworthy individuals; what Americans cannot understand is how an administration that promoted itself as ''the change we can believe in'' could have past administration figures like Lawrence H. Summers and Timothy F. Geithner as point men in its economic recovery program.
 I voted for Barack Obama, and I am severely disappointed, as are many of his supporters.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Car Is the Stuff of 4-Wheel Dreams for Millions of Drivers in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Hari Kumar and Nick Kurczewski contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Six years after the idea was hatched, India's much-hyped Tata Nano was introduced on Monday. 
 The supercheap compact car with a base model selling for about $2,230 is aimed at the developing world's millions of motorcycle owners with four-wheel dreams. It arrives as Tata Motors struggles with production problems and a huge debt load.
 But as the global economy withers and automakers bleed cash and cut employees, global warming continues and oil prices creep back up, even rivals say that tiny, wallet-friendly, fuel-efficient cars like the Nano might be where demand grows worldwide. 
 ''We're quite confident there is going to be huge market for that segment,'' said Ashish Sinharoy, a vice president at Renault India. Renault and Nissan have partnered with Bajaj Auto, an Indian scooter maker, to introduce a small, cheap car of their own, due out in 2011.
 Automakers and car enthusiasts will be following the Nano closely, looking for flaws and gauging consumer reaction. Projects like the Renault-Bajaj alliance, and plans from manufacturers including Honda and Hyundai might be scrapped if the Nano fails. J. D. Power & Associates predicts that Tata will sell 35,000 Nanos this year, because of production constraints. Tata will begin accepting orders next month, charging a fee of $6 to anyone who applies to buy the car. Delivery is expected in July.
 Questions linger about Tata's ability to keep costs down and get production up and about the safety and reliability of the Nano. Several auto analysts say that Tata, which had its first quarterly loss in seven years at the end of January, has been forced to delay payments to its vendors because of a cash squeeze. 
 Indian auto suppliers are not in straits as dire as their peers in America and Europe, but any supplier disruption could be devastating to the Nano, because its parts are custom-made.
 In an e-mailed response to questions about payment delays, Tata Motors said it was ''conducting its business properly, adequately and in full partnership with all its vendors.''
 The company said most of its vendor relationships are covered by a ''bill marketing'' system, where Tata's bank makes payments to the vendors, and Tata Motors pays the bank. ''As sales begin to climb, vendor purchases will also improve, and a positive cycle will once again get created,'' Tata said.
 If the Nano is successful, it will open the market for others, Mr. Sinharoy predicts. He said a car from Renault-Bajaj would be priced at about 150,000 rupees ($3,000) and be even more fuel-efficient than the Nano.
 The four-seater Nano can travel 100 kilometers on 4.2 liters of fuel, getting 55.5 miles per gallon. It has lower emissions than most two-wheelers in India, Tata says.
 With its 11.8-inch dinner-plate-size wheels, an engine the size of a small outboard motor generating 33 horsepower, and a single windshield wiper, the Nano has already drawn some unflattering comparisons to kitchen appliances and garden tools. When the design was unveiled last year, Jalopnik.com, a car lovers' Web site, asked, ''Yes, but will it blend?''
 A few people have driven the car, and were only recently given permission by Tata to talk about the experience.
 ''It feels like a real car,'' said Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, who was one of the early drivers. ''It does not feel like a golf cart.''
 But, he added, it felt like a car that would be used only for city driving. ''You're not going to take this on an intercity highway,'' he said.
 The Nano's fans far outweigh its critics so far. It already has a dedicated Facebook group. More important, it seems to have a number of eager would-be buyers. Despite a vicious land-rights battle that forced Tata to relocate the Nano factory from its West Bengal site, the car is viewed with great pride in India.
 It is ''absolutely critical'' that the Nano goes well, Mr. Sorabjee, said. ''The success of this will change the rules of carmaking in the world,'' he predicted.
 Pawan Goyal, a 35-year-old accountant who lives in Noida, a growing town east of Delhi, said he had been planning to buy the Nano since it introduced a prototype at the Delhi auto show in January 2008.
 ''By spending 50,000 rupees extra, I will move on to a four-wheeler,'' Mr. Goyal, who drives a motorcycle, said. The Nano will allow him to take along his whole family, including two children, ages 10 and 12, and it will be ''more comfortable and safe'' than the motorbike.
 The Nano may attract more than the ''starter'' market because of the economic slowdown. ''In times of crisis, there is a lot of trading down that happens,'' said Arindam K. Bhattacharya, a partner in the New Delhi office of the Boston Consulting Group.
 The Nano is built to safety specifications in India but would not serve all markets. Any additional safety features will mean a increase in costs, and it's unclear whether Tata's plans to sell the Nano in the rest of South Asia and Europe will pan out.
 But consumers in Europe and the United States may demand a Nano of their own. ''Consumer behavior can be stimulated simply by the economic issues we're facing today,'' said Dan Oxyer, a partner with the consulting company A. T. Kearney.
 Some car experts are skeptical about whether the Nano will succeed. ''It goes without saying a good car at a low price will sell well in global markets,'' said John Bonnell, head of Asia forecasting at J. D. Power & Associates.
 The fact that the Nano is here at all, though, proves the Big Three American automakers wrong, Mr. Bhattacharya said. When he made presentations on the Nano to Western car manufacturers a few years ago, ''they would all laugh and say that it couldn't be done,'' he recalled.

HEADLINE: European Carriers Telefonica and Vodafone Will Share Networks in 4 Countries

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Two of the world's largest cellphone operators, the Spanish company Telefonica and the British giant Vodafone, said Monday that they would share infrastructure in several European markets in an effort to cut costs and protect profit margins. 
 The companies said in a statement that they had agreed to share networks in Britain, Germany, Ireland and Spain, and were in ''detailed discussions'' about doing so in the Czech Republic. In practice, the agreement means the companies will jointly build sites or consolidate existing antenna towers and infrastructure for second- and third-generation networks, reducing the total number of cellphone towers in operation and cutting the amount they pay to rent equipment.
 The companies said they would continue to manage their call traffic independently and would still compete to attract and keep clients. There will be no job cuts, they said.
 Matthew Key, the chief executive of Telefonica Europe, said in an interview that the companies did not expect regulators to raise antitrust concerns because the deal would affect only the base stations of their networks. He said that the companies considered the agreement a first step toward greater cooperation, and that ''the natural next stage'' would be to work together on transmission services, the connection of the masts to the core network. 
 But they ''are not talking about a merger,'' Mr. Key said.
 Vodafone, based in Newbury, England, has about 289 million customers worldwide. Its businesses include a 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. Telefonica, based in Madrid, has about 260 million customers for its fixed telephone and broadband networks as well as mobile calling. 
 Margaret Rice-Jones, chief executive of Aircom International, a telecommunications consulting firm, said the partnership was significant because ''these companies have been fierce competitors for the last 20-odd years and now they're talking.''
 In some other markets, including the United States, network sharing is already a fact of life. Two companies, American Tower and Crown Castle International, simplify the operations for many big cellphone operators by leasing access to the base networks they operate.
 ''If two of the biggest players can see the benefit of it, then every player on the planet should,'' Ms. Rice-Jones said.
 The economic slump has raised the pressure on mobile operators to control costs. Financing for the development of services has become more expensive and harder to secure. The European Union is also stepping up its pressure on operators to reduce fees.

HEADLINE: Nafta's Promise, Unfulfilled

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Mexico's former president, Carlos Salinas, used to promise that free trade and foreign investment would jump-start this country's development, empowering a richer and more prosperous Mexico ''to export goods, not people.'' 
 Fifteen years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, only the first part of that promise has been realized. 
 Mexico's exports have exploded under Nafta, quintupling to $292 billion last year, but Mexico is still exporting people too, almost half a million each year, seeking opportunities in the United States that they do not have at home.
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will arrive in Mexico on Wednesday and President Obama will visit next month. Both are expected to emphasize the successes of American-Mexican economic cooperation, but it will be hard to ignore how much in Mexico has not changed under Nafta. 
 Economists here say much of the blame lies with Mexican leaders, unable or unwilling to take on oligarchs and unions controlling key sectors of the economy like energy and telecommunications. But they say some blame goes to the unintended consequences of Nafta.
 In some cases, Nafta produced results that were exactly the opposite of what was promised. 
 For instance, domestic industries were dismantled as multinationals imported parts from their own suppliers. 
 Local farmers were priced out of the market by food imported tariff-free. Many Mexican farmers simply abandoned their land and headed north. 
 Although one-quarter of Mexicans live in the countryside, they account for 44 percent of the migrants to the United States. The contradictions of Nafta are apparent in Guadalajara and the rich farmland around it. 
 On the road from the airport to the city, Mexico's second-largest, a well-worn sign welcomes visitors to Mexico's Silicon Valley. After Nafta went into effect, the comparison seemed ambitious but not out of reach. 
 Global giants spent billions of dollars turning Guadalajara into a manufacturing hub for the information technology industry. The industry boomed, spurred by cheap labor and the sense that Nafta guaranteed investor-friendly policies. Today the city is ringed with low-slung factories that churn out everything from BlackBerrys to digital tape storage libraries for Sun Microsystems. 
 But investors came because the city was already a center of technology. I.B.M, Hewlett-Packard and others had come in the 1960s and 1970s when Mexico's market was closed. 
 After Nafta, the new factories imported parts from their global suppliers, wiping out local companies that had sold printed circuit boards or assembled computers under tariff protection, said Kevin P. Gallagher, a Boston University professor who has written about the Guadalajara information technology industry.
 Things grew worse when the tech bubble burst, the American economy cooled and the companies moved to China, where they could pay even lower wages. Once China entered the World Trade Organization, Mexico lost much of the edge in exporting to the United States that Nafta had given it. Employment in Guadalajara's I.T. factories dropped 37 percent in 2001 and continued to slide for two years.
 ''The agreement could have brought investment with more value here,'' including research, testing and design, said Jesus Palomino, the general manager at Intel's design center in Guadalajara. ''But we did not know how to define or negotiate or take advantage of it.''
 Mr. Palomino argues that attracting multinational manufacturers was too limited a focus. He oversees about 300 young engineers who test future Intel products and carry out research and development. The sophisticated Intel design center is an exception to the city's assembly plants. Those factories mostly hire low-wage labor. 
 ''A new phenomenon has grown up under Nafta -- high-productivity poverty,'' said Harley Shaiken, chairman of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Low wages means low purchasing power. ''It is not a successful strategy for globalization,'' Mr. Shaiken said.
 Even Nafta's greatest success -- exports -- has become a liability, as Mexico feels the full brunt of declining consumption in the United States. The auto industry, for example, which has flourished under Nafta, has ground to a virtual standstill. Over all, Mexican auto exports fell more than 50 percent in the first two months of this year compared with 2008, and production dropped almost 45 percent.
 The central bank forecasts that as many as 340,000 people could lose their jobs this year, and some investment banks predict the economy could contract as much as 5 percent.
 That weakness has driven down the peso, which has lost about a quarter of its value in the last six months. Foreign direct investment fell last year to $18.6 billion from $27.2 billion in 2007.
 Still, economists here say much of the responsibility for the lack of development in the last decade and a half lies largely with Mexican leaders and their unwillingness or inability to enact real reforms. ''We have an economy that has atrophied because of the lack of reform,'' said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de Mexico. 
 Other developing countries benefited from globalization, particularly in Asia. But in Mexico, economic growth has averaged about 3 percent a year since Nafta took effect, far below what is needed to create jobs for the million young people who enter the work force each year and the millions more who barely scrape by. 
 As presidential candidates, both President Obama and Mrs. Clinton promised to renegotiate Nafta. But when Mr. Obama arrives next month, he will find Mexico's leaders reluctant to revisit the agreement. He will also find them seething over his signing of a spending bill that scrapped a pilot program allowing Mexican long-haul trucks to transport cargo throughout the United States. In retaliation, Mexico has imposed punitive tariffs on $2.4 billion worth of American goods.
 Nafta guaranteed Mexico, Canada and the United States access to one another's highways for cargo transport by 2000.
 Perhaps the Mexicans least prepared for globalization were Mexico's small farmers.
 ''It isn't possible for a peasant to make a living from the countryside,'' said Francisco Vargas, president of an association that groups together 2,500 farmers from Etzatlan, about 90 minutes west of Guadalajara. 
 The farmers hold other jobs to subsidize their farming. Mr. Vargas is a teacher. Another of the group's leaders is a retired accountant; a third has a sideline renting out construction equipment. Some farmers continue thanks to money sent by relatives working in the United States. 
 Farmers in the region have survived Nafta by raising corn yields through converting to modern farming techniques. They also lobby for government aid and band together to fight private oligopolies that sell seed and buy corn.
 But their landholdings remain small, sometimes not more than about 10 acres, and they are at the mercy of rising costs and fluctuating prices. Seed is up about 20 percent because of the peso's devaluation, while corn is off the high of last year as global demand drops.
 The farmers say that they have raised their yields to double Mexico's average of three metric tons per hectare, or more. (The average for the United States is more than nine tons per hectare.) Late last year, their high yields caught the attention of the federal government in Mexico City, which has promised new financing for the Etzatlan farmers and other commercial corn farmers.
 ''It's a race against time,'' said Antonio Hernandez, an agronomist who advises the farmers for a coalition of farming associations in Jalisco state. ''We have to demonstrate this before people abandon the land.''
 I.T. industry leaders and the local government in Guadalajara are trying to do the same thing: convince Mexicans that there is opportunity at home. 
 The group representing the industry in Mexico, known by its Spanish initials as Canieti, now promotes Guadalajara's ability to produce customized products for customers in the United States, specialized corporate software and portions of software for operating systems. Canieti officials also promote the advantage for ''pizza products,'' like new cellphones that must be delivered on time. 
 The government and Canieti have put up $4 million to buy equipment and train 150 young people in computer animation, in a bid to attract joint ventures for co-productions and video games.
 But Mr. Palomino, the general manager at the Intel design center, argues that the industry should also promote small local companies and encourage them to establish joint ventures in the United States. Those changes would nourish a culture of entrepreneurship that he believes has yet to emerge.
 Professor Gallagher at Boston University argues that free trade on its own does not bring development. ''Nafta was a great opportunity, but you had to build on it,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about the unintended consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement referred incorrectly to the workers shown at Intel's design center in Guadalajara. They consist mostly of skilled technicians and engineers who have benefited under Nafta, including wage increases and more job opportunities. They are not among the information technology workers in Mexico who hold low-wage assembly jobs and have seen few benefits from the trade agreement. (An accompanying picture showed farmers near Etzatlan, Mexico, who are representative of those who have not benefited much under Nafta.)

HEADLINE: China Urges New Reserve To Replace The Dollar

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
In another indication that China is growing increasingly concerned about holding huge dollar reserves, the head of its central bank has called for the eventual creation of a new international currency reserve to replace the dollar.
 In a paper released Monday, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, said a new currency reserve system controlled by the International Monetary Fund could prove more stable and economically viable.
 A new system is necessary, he said, because the global economic crisis has revealed the ''inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system.'' 
 While few analysts believe that the dollar will be replaced as the world's dominant foreign exchange reserve anytime soon, the proposal suggests that China is preparing to assume a more influential role in the world. Russia recently made a similar proposal.
 China's bold idea, released more than a week before world leaders are to gather in London for an economic summit meeting, also indicates that Beijing is worried that its huge dollar-denominated foreign reserves could lose significant value in coming years.
 China has the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, valued at nearly $2 trillion, with more than half of those holdings estimated to be made up of United States Treasuries and other dollar-denominated bonds.
 On March 13, China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said he was concerned about the safety of those assets, particularly because huge economic stimulus plans could lead to soaring deficits in the United States, which could sink the dollar's value.
 Should China lose its appetite for Treasuries, the United States' borrowing costs could rise, making it more costly for Washington to carry out economic stimulus packages and for Americans to pay off their mortgages.
 Nicholas Lardy, an economist and China specialist at the Peterson Institute in Washington, said that through its proposal, China was indicating that the dollar's long dominance was unfair, allowing the United States to run huge deficits by borrowing from abroad, and that the risks to holders of Treasuries were growing.
 ''Chinese are quite concerned that the large U.S. government deficits will eventually lead to inflation, which will erode the purchasing power of the dollar-denominated financial assets which they hold,'' Mr. Lardy said. ''It is a legitimate concern.''
 The timing of the Chinese announcement, analysts said, could also be aimed at giving Beijing more leverage to negotiate with the United States and other nations in London on trade and on proposals about how to stabilize the global economy.
 But China is cautious when it discusses buying or selling Treasuries, for fear of sending a signal that could significantly affect currency markets. So in a separate announcement on Monday, China said it would continue to buy Treasuries, something the United States has encouraged.
 In Mr. Zhou's essay, published in English and Chinese on the central bank's Web site, he said the international community should consider expanding the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights.
 Such a proposal has been suggested before by developing countries. But the United States has always been wary that this could be inflationary and affect the central role of the dollar.
 Special Drawing Rights are based on the value of the dollar, euro, pound and yen, but have been little used except as an accounting entry by international organizations.
 Mr. Zhou said the goal of reforming the international monetary system was to ''create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Expands Plan to Buy Banks' Troubled Assets

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ERIC DASH; Graham Bowley and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration's new plan to liberate the nation's banks from a toxic stew of bad home loans and mortgage-related securities is bigger and more generous to private investors than expected, but it also puts taxpayers at great risk.
 Taken together, the three programs unveiled on Monday by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, could buy up to $2 trillion in real estate assets that have been weighing down banks, paralyzing credit markets and delaying the economic recovery. 
 Investors reacted ecstatically, with all of the major stock indexes soaring as soon as the markets opened. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up nearly 500 points, or 6.84 percent, to 7,775.86. The thundering response was the mirror opposite of the bitter disappointment by investors when the plan was first vaguely described on Feb. 10. 
 ''For the first time in seven months, I can say they've done it right,'' said T. Timothy Ryan Jr., president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. 
 Despite lingering worries that Congress would add new pay restrictions or make other changes in the rules, several major investment firms, including BlackRock and Pimco, said they would participate as buyers of bank assets. Banks, which would sell mortgage assets in auctions, were less enthusiastic, though no major bank publicly said it would not participate. 
 Administration officials outlined a three-part Public-Private Investment Program that offers private investors vast amounts of cheap, taxpayer-supported financing for every dollar they put up of their own money. In essence, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be offering at least a tablespoon of financial sugar for every teaspoon of risk that investors agree to swallow.
 ''There is no doubt the government is taking a risk,'' Mr. Geithner acknowledged at a briefing for reporters. ''The question is how best to do it.''
 Under one main component of the plan, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would oversee a program in which banks offer bundles of whole mortgages for sale to investors. The F.D.I.C. would set up an auction for each bank portfolio, allowing a bank to sell the mortgages to the investor that offered the highest bid. 
 But the crucial incentive for investors -- traditional fund managers, hedge funds, private equity funds, pension funds and possibly even banks -- is that the government would lend as much as 85 percent of the purchase price for each portfolio of mortgages. 
 On top of that, the Treasury would invest one dollar of taxpayer money for every dollar of private equity capital to cover the remaining 15 percent of the portfolio's purchase price.
 The arrangement is similar to some of the distressed-asset sales arranged by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal agency that was responsible for cleaning up the savings-and-loan debacle of the early 1990s. 
 But the scale of the new program is much bigger.
 In addition to the F.D.I.C.'s program, the Treasury would help finance a series of public-private investment funds to buy up unwanted mortgage-backed securities, or pools of mortgages that have been packaged into bonds with a credit rating.
 Those two programs alone could buy $500 billion to $1 trillion worth of troubled assets, according to Mr. Geithner. The Treasury would kick in $75 billion to $100 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program as equity. 
 But the Treasury could pump almost $1 trillion more into the toxic-asset effort through a program called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, a joint venture with the Federal Reserve. 
 That program, which became operational last week, was originally created to help finance mostly new consumer loans and also some new business lending. 
 But in a major expansion, Treasury and Fed officials said Monday that they would expand the program to finance the purchase of existing troubled mortgage-backed securities, including those backed by commercial real estate loans. 
 The biggest inducement in all the programs is the government's willingness to provide ''nonrecourse'' loans to institutions that buy up the unwanted assets. A nonrecourse loan is secured only by the underlying home or building. 
 If the borrower defaults, the government would only be able to seize the real estate. If the mortgages or the securities generate bigger losses than expected, the government and not the private investors would have to absorb the brunt of those losses. 
 Some analysts and fund managers were surprised that the Treasury was offering to lend up to $6 for every $1 of investors' own money. Several said that those terms appeared more generous than what Merrill Lynch had offered when it sold a portfolio of mortgage securities to Lone Star Funds last July. In that deal, Lone Star bought Merrill's assets for only 22 cents on the dollar and Merrill lent Lone Star only $3 for every $1 the investor put up.
 ''This is a better deal than Lone Star got,'' said Barry Ritholtz, chief executive of FusionIQ, an investment research firm. 
 It is too early to tell whether the inducements amount to a huge taxpayer giveaway or a shrewdly designed package that returns a profit to taxpayers and stimulates the financial system. 
 Taxpayers could profit from the interest paid by the public-private partnerships on the government loans -- the interest rate has not yet been set -- and if the troubled assets rise in value above the prices paid to acquire them. 
 In the short term, the big question is whether the inducements are enough to overcome both rising political anxiety among investors and reluctance by banks to sell mortgages. 
 Mr. Geithner on Monday said there were no restrictions on compensation on the participating investors. Still, investors are worried about incurring the wrath of Congress if they appear to reap big profits.
 Last week, after the Treasury acknowledged that employees at American International Group were getting $165 million in bonuses, the House voted to impose a retroactive 90 percent tax on those bonuses.
 The other potential obstacle could be on the side of the sellers -- the banks. Because banks would probably have to sell their mortgages at a substantial discount to their original value, they would also have to write down the value of the mortgages and book a loss in the process. In turn, that could force many banks to raise more capital.
 Bill Gross, chairman of Pimco, said in a statement that the Treasury plan was a ''win-win-win policy'' and that his firm was ''intrigued by the potential double-digit returns'' that it offered.
 Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive, said his firm would invest in a broad range of mortgages and related securities through the Treasury plan. BlackRock is also exploring ways to set up mutual funds that would allow individual investors to participate. 
 The combined impact of all the Treasury and Fed bailout programs, he added, could start to stabilize the economy sooner than many expect.
 ''I think right now there's so much pessimism that no one is seeing anything beyond their nose,'' Mr. Fink said. ''With all the triage from all different activities from the government, you could say that by the latter part of this year, we could start seeing the economy start restabilizing itself.''

HEADLINE: Rescue Plan, With Fine Print, Dazzles Wall St.

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This time President Obama directed some of the stagecraft. This time Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner fleshed out the substance of their long-anticipated program to remove banks' toxic assets and revive the financial system. And this time the reaction was widely positive, giving the embattled Mr. Geithner a critically needed boost.
 Mr. Geithner had a lot on the line in Monday's announcement, despite Mr. Obama's repeated insistence that his job was safe. The Treasury secretary's highly publicized unveiling six weeks ago of his plan's ''framework'' had been panned for lacking details, hobbling Mr. Geithner as he was trying to build credibility with the financial markets and clout in Washington. 
 He suffered further political harm last week for not stepping in sooner to block the taxpayer-supported American International Group's payment of employee bonuses, and the fallout from that episode -- including a House vote to impose punitive taxes on the recipients of the bonuses -- threatened to scare off the same investors he needed for his plan to work.
 Much still needs to be done to execute the plan. It drew criticism in some quarters for not being aggressive enough in addressing the bad assets weighing down the financial system, and from Republicans on Capitol Hill for leaving taxpayers too much at risk. 
 But the first-day verdict on the Dow Jones average went in the right direction for Mr. Geithner this time, up nearly 7 percent and 500 points, in contrast to the precipitous slide after Mr. Geithner's first effort, when his inability to explain in any detail how the program would work left Wall Street jittery about whether the administration had a workable plan. 
 A Treasury spokeswoman insisted the only difference was that Mr. Geithner had the time to complete details so complicated that they amount to creating a new financial system with global reach. But beyond the substance, the administration also had a more careful plan in place to introduce the proposal, because neither Mr. Geithner nor Mr. Obama could afford another negative review.
 ''Did we do things differently? It's self-evident that we did,'' Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview.
 With selective leaks to the media for the last several days, the administration had time to explain the complexities in advance, preparing the financial markets over the weekend for what was coming. Mr. Geithner and other administration officials spent days briefing crucial people on Wall Street and working to line up endorsements from prominent equity fund managers and other private-sector ''validators,'' in particular two leading global investment management firms, BlackRock and Pimco.
 In a White House meeting late last week, Mr. Obama personally admonished administration officials to join Mr. Geithner in the plan's public marketing. As for the Treasury secretary, instead of speaking awkwardly from teleprompters to an audience of financial V.I.P.'s and 17 television cameras, as he did on Feb. 10, Mr. Geithner banned cameras on Monday when he met with reporters to release the plan and answered questions without notes and at length.
 The administration also paid close attention to the political climate. With the private sector increasingly wary of Congressional intervention in the business of those who participate in government bailout programs, Mr. Obama substantially dialed back the near endorsement he had given late last week to the House vote for a confiscatory 90 percent tax on bonuses like those A.I.G. doled out.
 ''As a general proposition, you don't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals,'' he said in an interview on Sunday night on CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' in what administration officials said was a signal to investors that he understood their concerns about doing business with the government.
 The Treasury Department also increased the amount of equity the government would provide for the public-private financing package, to as much as $100 billion, up from some earlier estimates of as low as $50 billion. ''The private sector stepped up on the day of the announcement saying they wanted to participate, which provided a Good Housekeeping seal,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''And the second thing was that the presentation was organized in a way that the expectations of the program were met by the actual program.''
 For both, he gave credit to Mr. Geithner and his still-small Treasury team. There was even good news by Monday evening on the matter of Treasury's much criticized understaffing. The White House announced the nominations of two Clinton administration veterans to top posts: Neal S. Wolin to be Mr. Geithner's deputy Treasury secretary, and Lael Brainard to be under secretary for international affairs. 
 Yet even as Mr. Geithner tries to focus further on the financial rescue plan, the A.I.G. controversy will dog him for a second week. On Tuesday he will be on Capitol Hill to answer questions from the House Financial Services Committee about his handling of the A.I.G. bailout and bonuses.
 Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of the Federal Reserve and William C. Dudley, Mr. Geithner's successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also will testify. Both have shared jurisdiction over A.I.G. with Treasury since last September, when the government bailed out the global insurance giant to prevent it from collapsing and taking down the major financial institutions that were among its customers. 
 For Mr. Geithner, the A.I.G. controversy was the latest unexpected setback, after the bad reviews of the earlier rescue plan announcement and the disclosure during his Senate confirmation process of some unpaid payroll taxes earlier in the decade. 
 Nonetheless a new CBS News poll found that a majority of the public -- 54 percent -- say they have confidence in his ability to handle the nation's financial crisis. 
 That support masks a partisan divide, as more Democrats express confidence than Republicans do in Mr. Geithner. As it happens, Mr. Geithner used to be a Republican and changed his voter registration -- to Independent -- only in the late 1990s, when he became under secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration.
 The poll found that three-fourths of those surveyed said the government should try to recover the bonus money paid by A.I.G. But the support for recovering the bonus money drops when the method of recovery is taxation.

HEADLINE: The Mexican Evolution

BYLINE: By ENRIQUE KRAUZE. 
Enrique Krauze is the editor of the magazine Letras Libres and the author of ''Mexico: Biography of Power.'' This article was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.

DATELINE: Mexico City 

 BODY:
 AMERICA'S distorted views can have costly consequences, especially for us in Latin America. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's trip to Mexico this week is a good time to examine the misconception that Mexico is, or is on the point of becoming, a ''failed state.'' 
 This notion appears to be increasingly widespread. The Joint Forces Command recently issued a study saying that Mexico -- along with Pakistan -- could be in danger of a rapid and sudden collapse. President Obama is considering sending National Guard troops to the Mexican border to stop the flow of drugs and violence into the United States. The opinion that Mexico is breaking down seems to be shared by much of the American news media, not to mention the Americans I meet by chance and who, at the first opportunity, ask me whether Mexico will ''fall apart.''
 It most assuredly will not. First, let's take a quick inventory of the problems that we don't have. Mexico is a tolerant and secular state, without the religious tensions of Pakistan or Iraq. It is an inclusive society, without the racial hatreds of the Balkans. It has no serious prospects of regional secession or disputed territories, unlike the Middle East. Guerrilla movements have never been a real threat to the state, in stark contrast to Colombia. 
 Most important, Mexico is a young democracy that eliminated an essentially one-party political system, controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, that lasted more than 70 years. And with all its defects, the domination of the party, known as the P.R.I., never even approached the same level of virtually absolute dictatorship as that of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, or even of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. 
 Mexico has demonstrated an institutional continuity unique in Latin America. To be sure, it can be argued that the P.R.I. created a collective monarchy with the electoral forms of a republic. But since 2000, when the opposition National Action Party won the presidency, power has been decentralized. There is much greater independence in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. An autonomous Federal Electoral Institute oversees elections and a transparency law has been passed to combat corruption. We have freedom of expression, and electoral struggles between parties of the right, center and left.
 Our national institutions function. The army is (and long has been) subject to the civilian control of the president; the church continues to be a cohesive force; a powerful business class shows no desire to move to Miami. We have strong labor unions, good universities, important public enterprises and social programs that provide reasonable results.
 Thanks to all this, Mexico has demonstrated an impressive capacity to overcome crises, of which we've had our fair share. They include the government's repression of the student movement of 1968; a currency devaluation in 1976; an economic crisis in 1982; the threefold disaster of 1994 with the Zapatista rebel uprising, the murder of the P.R.I. candidate for president and a devastating collapse of the peso; and the serious post-election conflicts of 2006.
 We have overcome these challenges and drawn meaningful lessons from them. We learned to diversify the economy and reduce the state's financial monopolies, paving the way for the eventual Nafta agreements. Election controversies and the threat of political violence have led to a national acceptance of a peaceful and orderly transition to democracy.
 Now once again, we face enormous problems. The worldwide financial crisis is intensifying our ancient dramas of poverty and inequality. But the most acute problems are the increased power and viciousness of organized crime -- drug trafficking, kidnappings and extortion -- and an upsurge in ordinary street crime.
 This may be the most serious crisis we have faced since the 1910 Mexican Revolution and its immediate aftermath. More than 7,000 people, most of them connected to the drug trade or law enforcement, have died since January 2008. The war against criminality (and especially the drug cartels) is no conventional war. It weighs upon the whole country. It is a war without ideology, rules or a shred of nobility. 
 Is it a war that Mexico can win? Not through the tactics of any conventional war. But there can be progress by restricting the range of the enemy. Since taking power in 2006, President Felipe Calderon has sent more than 40,000 army troops to various Mexican states to combat drug gangs, and has had some victories in drug-related seizures and arrests. Even though Mr. Calderon enjoys a relatively high approval rating, the government has not managed to reassure the general population. Large sectors of Mexican society seem to endure these events as if they were part of a nightmare from which some morning we will awake. But it will not just disappear, and Mexicans must help fight the war by mobilizing public opinion, supplying information to the authorities and vigilantly supervising both elected and appointed officials. This kind of civic participation has already begun to yield some successes in Mexico City.
 THE government, for its part, must continue the huge task of cleaning up the dark corners of its police forces, establishing an efficient intelligence network in order to keep ahead of the cartels. Mexico also needs a secure prison system that will not serve as a sanctuary where sentenced drug bosses can continue conducting their business and recruiting new criminals. It is also vital to speed up the purification of a judicial system that is slow and inefficient in its handling of serious crimes. We could use more political cooperation as well: Mr. Calderon (and his National Action Party) are now fighting this battle without significant support from the opposition parties, the P.R.I. and the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
 The Mexican print media has not been entirely helpful either. Of course, freedom of press is essential for democracy. But our print media has gone beyond the necessary and legitimate communication of information by continually publishing photographs of the most atrocious aspects of the drug war, a practice that some feel verges on a pornography of violence. Press photos of horrors like decapitated heads provide free publicity for the drug cartels. This also helps advance their cause by making ordinary Mexicans feel that they are indeed part of a ''failed state.''
 While we bear responsibility for our problems, the caricature of Mexico being propagated in the United States only increases the despair on both sides of the Rio Grande. It is also profoundly hypocritical. America is the world's largest market for illegal narcotics. The United States is the source for the majority of the guns used in Mexico's drug cartel war, according to law enforcement officials on both sides of the border. 
 Washington should support Mexico's war against the drug lords -- first and foremost by recognizing its complexity. The Obama administration should recognize the considerable American responsibility for Mexico's problems. Then, in keeping with equality and symmetry, the United States must reduce its drug consumption and its weapons trade to Mexico. It will be no easy task, but the United States has at least one advantage: No one thinks of it as a failed state.
 Nor, for that matter, did anyone ever see Al Capone and the criminal gangs of Chicago as representative of the entire country. For Mexico as well, let's leave caricatures where they belong, in the hands of cartoonists.

HEADLINE: Real, Rough Life, in Front of a Lens

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Social realism is a term that makes some people queasy. On the one hand, it evokes propagandistic Soviet films wielded as oppressive motivational tracts; on the other, it can imply a condescending, conflict-denying, family-of-man sentimentality. But ''Amreeka,'' the opening film of the 2009 New Directors/New Films series on Wednesday, reaffirms social realism's validity as humanistic art with an educational frisson.
The feature film debut of Cherien Dabis, a New York director and screenwriter born to Palestinian-Jordanian immigrants, ''Amreeka'' also sets the internationalist tone of the annual series, presented by the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Most of the 25 films in this year's series, which has screenings through April 5 at the museum and at the Walter Reade Theater, were selected from festivals from around the world, with Sundance the most important contributor.
''Amreeka'' follows the odyssey of Muna (Nisreen Faour), a Palestinian woman living on the West Bank who receives a green card and moves to the United States with her teenage son to live with her sister's family in a small town in Illinois. Their troubles begin at a Chicago airport where, after a humiliating interrogation, the tin of cookies in which she had foolishly stored all her money is confiscated. 
Because the movie is set during the onset of the war in Iraq, Muna, her son and her sister's Palestinian-American family must contend with anti-terrorist paranoia manifested in taunts and vandalism. Muna worked in a bank in Ramallah, but the only job she can find in the United States is flipping burgers at a White Castle; meanwhile her son, desperately trying to fit in, grimly makes his way through the American high school jungle.
The film is anchored in Ms. Faour's wonderful portrayal of a warm-hearted, self-reliant woman stretched to the breaking point who perseveres in the face of overwhelming obstacles. If the film offers a little too much rose-colored uplift for comfort, its essential integrity remains intact.
Given the economic vulnerability felt by so many Americans these days, the half-dozen or so films shown during the series's first week that have social- or neo-realist associations have a particular resonance. To New York audiences watching ''Treeless Mountain,'' set in South Korea; ''Ordinary Boys'' (Morocco); ''The Shaft'' (China); ''The Maid'' (Chile); ''Unmade Beds'' (London); and ''The Fly'' (Russia), the characters' survival issues may not seem so remote.
Even the American documentary, James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo's ''Every Little Step,'' which observes the casting of the 2006 Broadway revival of ''A Chorus Line,'' portrays existence as a ferocious Darwinian struggle. The film is a self-reflecting mirror in which the show and the movie about creating the show become one and the same.
A dream of stardom that collides with reality also inspires one of the three connected stories in ''The Shaft,'' Zhang Chi's eloquent movie about a father, a son and a daughter who live in a remote coal-mining town in western China. During this rigorously structured work, in which the camera regularly retreats to show a train bearing coal from the mine where the local men labor, the children's need to flee the nest (the son has pop star ambitions) conflicts with their sense of duty. The father, a stoic fatalist near retirement age, shows signs of terminal lung disease.
''Treeless Mountain,'' So Yong Kim's neo-realist gem, observes the world through the eyes of two sisters, ages 6 and 4, whose mother leaves them with their uncaring, alcoholic aunt while she searches for the husband who abandoned her. For all its poignancy, this study of childhood loneliness and uncertainty is no manipulative tearjerker. The resourceful little girls, whose aunt often forgets to feed them, turn to catching grasshoppers, which they roast and sell for pennies while clinging to the forlorn hope that their mother will return when their piggybank is full.
Daniel Hernandez's ''Ordinary Boys'' observes a group of young men and one woman scuffling for a living in Tetuan, the northern Moroccan hometown of some of the terrorists responsible for the 2004 bombings in Madrid. The characters ponder the excruciating choice of whether to try their luck abroad, where they are not welcome, or remain in Morocco, where employment opportunities, outside of crime, are slim.
Alexis Dos Santos's ''Unmade Beds'' offers a romanticized vision of rootless bohemian youth from various countries converging in an East London squat. In ''The Fly,'' a Russian trucker who has led a roustabout life learns from the deathbed letter of a fly-by-night lover from long ago that he has a teenage daughter. He visits the remote Russian town where she lives, takes a job as a gym teacher and tries to bond with the girl, an angry tomboy who vents her fury at the world through arson.
Three films from different countries with varying connections to social realism are more or less carried by their female lead performances. By far the best is Sebastian Silva's movie ''The Maid.'' Its star, Catalina Saavedra, chosen best actress in the world cinema category at Sundance, plays a repressed, fiercely loyal housekeeper who loses her emotional balance when the middle-class family she has served for 23 years hires a second servant; she reacts to the newcomer like a trapped animal. Just as ''The Maid'' seems about to cross the line into gothic horror, its stormy emotional weather turns sunny.
Gustave de Kervern and Benoit Delepine's absurdist farce, ''Louise-Michel,'' stars the great French actress Yolande Moreau as an illiterate factory worker who appoints herself in charge of killing the boss of her company after it is suddenly shut down and the workers given a piddling severance. As she and the bumbling hit man she employs track their prey to Brussels and then to the Isle of Jersey, their inept campaign of assassination becomes a crude comedy of errors.
The strongest element of ''Barking Water,'' the American Indian filmmaker Sterlin Harjo's two-character story of a dying man being driven to his Oklahoma birthplace by a former lover, is Casey Camp-Horinek's touching portrayal of the woman, whose compassion and forgiveness outweigh the bad blood between them. But ''Barking Water'' eventually chokes on its own nobility.
Laurel Nakadate's oddity, ''Stay the Same Never Change,'' is the most alienating film in the series's first week. Made with amateur actors in Kansas City, Mo., this exploration of anomie among Middle American youth is as unfocused as its subjects.
The most likely art house hit, shown at Sundance, is Sophie Barthes's comedy ''Cold Souls.'' In a movie whose concept is worthy of vintage Woody Allen, Paul Giamatti plays himself as a tormented actor rehearsing a production of ''Uncle Vanya.'' He glimpses salvation from his angst in a New Yorker article about a process that enables people to shed their souls and keep them in storage.
Without thinking, he undergoes the process, which reveals his soul to be the size of a chickpea. Regretting his decision, he tries to reclaim his soul, only to discover that it is missing. ''Cold Souls'' turns into a delicious fable of international metaphysical espionage.
Arriving at a moment when smart, pointed humor in movies is in short supply, ''Cold Souls'' could never be described as social realist. It is simply flat-out funny.
The New Directors/New Films series continues through April 5; (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: Re-Enter Ionesco: Broadway Awaits

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
When the actor Geoffrey Rush was 11 and growing up in Brisbane, Australia, some children on a playground told him one morning that the world was going to end by lunchtime. It was 1962, and they were referring to the Cuban missile crisis's possibly setting off a nuclear war. The geopolitical particulars did not interest Mr. Rush, though.
''I kept thinking, 'What will the world be like when all life ends?' '' he said recently, recalling that day in 1962. ''What is 'nothingness' ''?
Mr. Rush now describes the moment as his first existential awakening to the absurdities of war and power, to the relationship between his own life and worldwide death. He shared the memory during a conversation about his Broadway debut -- which takes place on Thursday night -- in ''Exit the King,'' the Eugene Ionesco play that is a touchstone work in the Theater of the Absurd. 
An Academy Award winner for his portrayal of the disturbed pianist David Helfgott in ''Shine,'' Mr. Rush is perhaps most widely known as the flamboyant Capt. Hector Barbossa in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movies. But none of his roles have been quite as spectacularly addled as King Berenger in ''Exit the King,'' nor as a provocative a symbol of those absurdities of life that first struck Mr. Rush as a boy.
''I like roles that are on the extreme ends of the spectrum, and there's special appeal in exploring these slightly forgotten plays that people might think of as subjects for academic term papers instead of live theater,'' he said recently in an interview in his dressing room at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. ''And when I discovered 'Exit the King,' it just blew me away.''
In a busy Broadway season for original plays -- ''God of Carnage'' opened on Sunday, ''Impressionism'' on Tuesday, and ''Reasons to Be Pretty'' and ''Irena's Vow'' open this week and next -- ''Exit the King,'' infrequently revived in New York, will also be new to many audience members. This production has long been a preoccupation for Mr. Rush, whose film stardom (he also earned Oscar nominations for ''Shakespeare in Love'' and ''Quills'') followed an early career onstage in Australia.
The play centers on a despotic madman who has overseen the slow ruin of his once formidable kingdom. Berenger is about 400, yet his advanced age does not keep him from careering and tumbling around the stage like a circus player in the full spirit of Ionesco.
Mr. Rush, along with the production's director, Neil Armfield, began working on an adaptation of the play in 2006, and he performed the role of Berenger in Melbourne and Sydney before bringing it to Broadway. Mr. Rush also helped recruit Susan Sarandon for one of the play's leading roles: the older of Berenger's two wives, Queen Marguerite. It is her first appearance on Broadway in 37 years. (Lauren Ambrose, of ''Six Feet Under'' on HBO, plays his younger wife, Marie.)
Mr. Rush said he was drawn to the play partly for its echoes of modern politics: Berenger's long reign, with all its attendant decay, reminded him to varying degrees of the long administrations of John Howard in Australia, Tony Blair in Britain, and George W. Bush.
''I had the sense that the West was growing very moribund, and suddenly the resonances of the play just lit up,'' Mr. Rush said.
The recent changes in administration in all three countries do not entirely change things, he added.
''When Obama got elected, I thought maybe we timed this terribly -- everyone will be so sunny now,'' he said. ''But then you have this worldwide economy that aptly reflects the decay in the play.''
Which is not to say that ''Exit the King'' is overly ideological or a downer. While the play traces, in real time, the final two hours of Berenger's life, much of it is pure comedic farce, as the king and his two wives bicker over his personal failings and political legacy as the put-upon servant, Juliette (played by Andrea Martin), injects a slew of saucy, memorable asides.
''What I love most is the play's brazen theatricality -- it was like Ionesco was throwing great gobs of phosphorus and paint at the canvas and dishing up a faux Moliere with wisps of Shakespearian allusion all the way through it,'' Mr. Rush said. ''Not to scare off people -- when they see it, they don't have to have their CliffsNotes with them.''
Nevertheless, Ionesco's absurdist works are not the most accessible of plays, and they are hardly staples of commercial theater. Ionesco, a Romanian-French playwright, had his Broadway debut in 1958 with ''The Chairs'' and ''The Lesson''; ''Exit the King'' and ''Rhinoceros'' had Broadway productions in the 1960s. Since then Ionesco has largely been celebrated off Broadway and in college drama departments; the only major Broadway revival until now was a brief run of ''The Chairs'' in 1998.
Stuart Thompson, one of the lead producers of ''Exit the King,'' and who was among the producers of ''The Chairs'' 11 years ago, said that the appeal of this current revival had everything to do with Mr. Rush.
''It wasn't a matter of sitting around and saying, 'Oh, we must do Ionesco on Broadway' '' Mr. Thompson said. ''Geoffrey found very specific, vibrant ways to bring the play alive to me, to make it fresh, to really bring out the theatricality of the text.''
Mr. Rush and Mr. Armfield began their adaptation with a word-for-word translation from French to English, and Mr. Rush estimates that ''98 percent of our work absolutely honors the original.''
The two men have added a hallucinatory chase sequence, complete with strobe lighting, that has reliably delighted preview audiences, and they have changed several words and phrases with modern theatergoers in mind. (One funny bit involves a reference to antidepressants that are described, in the literal translation, as ''happy pills.'')
Ms. Sarandon said, ''What Geoffrey has done is present this wonderfully complicated ruler in a clownish kind of way, yet also show Berenger's vulnerability and his desire to burn every book and name everyone after him.''
That sort of absolute control, and the loss of it in the face of impending death, are among Ionesco's chief themes in the play -- heady stuff, Mr. Rush acknowledges, yet still accessible because of the humor and the heart that the author threaded through the story of the king's demise.
''I think that Ionesco's greatest weapon is that he's able to make us laugh at the darkest corners of our souls,'' Mr. Rush said. ''When I'm performing the play, I think there's 1,000 people out there who are collectively enjoying the boisterous burlesque of this charade. But I bet there are also 1,000 absolutely distinct human beings having a very private discourse with themselves, thinking, 'I wonder how I'm going to be when I have to make my final exit?' ''

HEADLINE: Gunman Followed Familiar Path in Months Before a Fatal Confrontation

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE and JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Lovelle Mixon walked out of a prison last fall in the remote town of Susanville, Calif., he knew exactly where he was headed: back to Oakland, back to his family and back to his life of dreams and zero prospects.
Less than five months later, Mr. Mixon's life would end in a violent confrontation with Oakland police officers that left five dead -- Mr. Mixon and four officers -- after he turned a routine traffic stop into a shootout. But between his release from prison and his death, Mr. Mixon, 26, had dropped innumerable hints that he had fallen from the straight and narrow path that his friends and family dearly wished for him and embarked on one that led to a nervous phone call from the side of the road.
''He was saying that they were talking on the radio, that they were probably calling for backup, you know how they do,'' the uncle, Curtis Mixon, said of the cellphone call, just before the shootout. ''Then he said he had to go.'' 
The police and witnesses have painted a savage picture of Mr. Mixon as a man who stood over his victims, fatally shooting two officers on a street in midday before fleeing into an apartment building, where two SWAT team members died and another officer was injured. Others have portrayed him as a man failed by an overloaded and flawed California penal system where thousands of former inmates flout the parole law and thousands of others skate by in programs where each agent regularly handles dozens of parolees.
But in the months leading up to the shooting, Mr. Mixon seemed to mix the elements of both the striving and the sinister, struggling to find legitimate employment -- he took a real estate class, for example, a nonstarter in a down economy -- but also buying a gun.
''I told him, 'Man, you're in a no-win situation. You're a parolee. If they catch you, you're going back to prison,' '' said his cousin Jermaine Mixon, who said Mr. Mixon had showed him a gun that he would eventually turn on police officers on Saturday. ''Lovelle said he was going to put the gun away. But I guess he was carrying it with him.''
In recent weeks, Mr. Mixon had started to carry himself with an unexpected swagger, something his cousin said he might have owed to a new profession: pimping, an occupation that paid for the 1995 Buick Park Avenue he was driving when police pulled him over.
''That's not something he wanted to stay in,'' his cousin said, ''but he couldn't find anything else to pay the bills.''
At the same time, he had also begun to chafe under the parole board rules. When released in November, Mr. Mixon seemed to take his parole seriously. Records show he reported for several drug tests and to meetings and a job placement program.
But whatever illegal activities Mr. Mixon was engaged in were easy to hide. Mr. Mixon was supervised by an agent from one of Oakland's three parole units, which have three dozen officers and nearly 2,000 parolees. His agent, who has not been identified, handled 70 parolees.
It is a ratio that even corrections officials lament.
''If there's any one thing I could change with a magic wand, it would be to reduce that caseload,'' said Gordon Hinkle, a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
His agency has 124,000 parolees, according to the latest data, but the whereabouts of 13.5 percent of them are unknown.
Mr. Mixon's grandmother Mary Mixon said her grandson repeatedly tried to make appointments with his parole officer, only to be stood up after hours of waiting. Relatives said the officer often belittled him in front of others, called him a criminal and threatened to revoke his parole a second time.
Mr. Hinkle said he doubted that account. ''In Mr. Mixon's case, his agent did everything by the book,'' he said.
Mr. Mixon was designated a ''high control'' case and was supposed to meet at least twice a month with his parole officer, parole officials said.
Mr. Mixon had also shown disdain for authority before his death, going to Modesto, Calif., without informing his parole officer, in violation of his parole. Once there, he had confided to his father, John A. Mixon, that he fully expected to land back in prison.
''He told me that he was ready to go back to jail just so he could change his parole officer,'' John Mixon said.
Mr. Mixon's first stint in state prison began in 2002, for assault with a deadly weapon in a carjacking in San Francisco. He served a little less than five years with good behavior under California's determinate sentencing program, under which almost all prisoners receive parole, calculated in advance. And while relatives said he had to fight to prove himself because of his size -- he was 5 foot 7 and weighed 150 pounds -- the corrections department has no record of violations.
When he was released, Mr. Mixon established a pattern that would later play out to tragic ends: a couple of months of seemingly good behavior, followed by a descent into trouble. Even if the authorities did not know it, rules were being broken: One picture of his welcome-home party in October 2007 shows a bowl full of marijuana buds.
Still, there were signs Mr. Mixon was trying to behave. He got a job with a janitorial service and made his parole appointments. But in late January 2008, he came under suspicion of a homicide in Alameda County. While Mr. Mixon was never charged in that case, a search revealed a drug scale and stolen laptop computer in his possession. It was enough to send him back to prison for nine months, this time to Susanville, 200 miles from home.
When he walked out of prison on parole in November, Mr. Mixon had spent the better part of six years behind bars. Once again, he behaved for a while, but relatives said they began to worry that he was coming apart several weeks ago. Law enforcement, too, had taken notice, after he missed three appointments, prompting an arrest warrant. According to the Oakland Police Department, Mr. Mixon had also become the main suspect in a February rape, linked by a DNA sample.
Mr. Mixon's uncle, Curtis, said his nephew had become depressed and emotionally withdrawn and was difficult to reach by phone.
Whether it was the warrant or the possible rape charge that played in Mr. Mixon's head when he was pulled over, no one can know. His uncle was the last person to speak to him, on the cellphone, moments before his nephew drew his gun. He was describing the traffic stop and said he would call him back as the police pulled him over.
''But he was probably thinking about that piece he had in the car,'' Mr. Mixon's uncle said, ''and he wasn't about to go back to jail.''
