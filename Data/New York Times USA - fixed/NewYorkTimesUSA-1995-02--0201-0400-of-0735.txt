HEADLINE: U.S. Shift in Calculating Auto Prices

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said today that it would include rebates and other discounts when it calculated average car prices.
United States auto makers have been pressing the agency for months to change the way it calculates car prices, arguing that the Government's numbers make it appear as if car prices are rising sharply. 
 Efforts by the industry were accelerated late last year, when the Government reported that the average vehicle cost more than $20,000. In the first quarter, the Commerce Department said, the average fell slightly, to $19,112.
During a meeting with reporters last month, the chief economist for the Chrysler Corporation, Van Bussmann, said a survey sponsored by the company had come up with a much lower figure, $16,700.
Mr. Bussmann attributed the difference to the failure of the Government to deduct rebates and other option discounts from the average.
A spokesman for the department's bureau of economic analysis, which provides a quarterly average for auto prices in the United States, said today that the agency hoped to include rebates by the end of the year.
"This is something we've known about all along, but we need to have a way to gather the data," said Evert Johnson, a spokesman for the bureau. "We think we know how to do that in terms of rebates, but we need some help from the manufacturers to gather some other data."
For years, the Government has asked Detroit for a detailed account of each transaction. But the auto industry has been reluctant to provide that information because of fears that it would be used by competitors.
The result has been confusing statistics that seem to undermine the contention by Detroit that car prices have kept pace with inflation.
Since 1981 the average provided by the Commerce Department has shown a constant rise in auto prices, while Chrysler's data display a brief period of increases, followed by several years of steady prices.
Officials of the department attributed the difference to averaging techniques spurred by a lack of data from the auto industry.

McDonnell May Halt MD-11 Work

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation may temporarily halt production of its largest airliner, the MD-11, next year because of a severe shortage of orders for the 300-seat plane, the company said today.
The company emphasized that it was working to avert a shutdown, which could mean temporary layoffs for thousands of workers and cast doubt on the future of the MD-11 program. 
 A company spokesman, Tom Williams, said the chances for such a temporary shutdown were slight. "It's something that's very serious, that we don't want to do," he said. "But it's something you have to honestly look at."
He said the company was likely to receive more orders for the MD-11.
Without new orders for the three-engine jet, McDonnell Douglas may deliver as few as 10 next year, industry officials have said.
The MD-11 is made at the company's factory in Long Beach, Calif., where 10,000 workers are employed. That plant also produces the smaller MD-80 and MD-90. The company would not say how many people were employed making each type of jet.
Mr. Williams said a decision on halting MD-11 production for as much as half of 1996 would have to be made within five months.
Other options include slowing production again, a move that would force the company to further increase efficiency or absorb higher per-jet costs. Another option is to persuade some customers to take delivery sooner on MD-11's ordered for later years.
Mr. Williams said unexpected delays in completing a Saudi Arabian order considered pivotal to 1996 production had also contributed to problem.
McDonnell's shares fell $1.125 today, to $52.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
All three global producers of big airliners -- including the Boeing Company, the market leader, and second-ranked Airbus Industrie of Europe -- have made sharp production cuts during the airline recession of the 1990's. Last week, Boeing announced 7,000 job cuts and new production cutbacks because of delivery delays by carriers.

Cold Snap in East Pushes Natural Gas Price Up Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Natural gas prices rose sharply for a fourth consecutive session yesterday, lifted by a cold snap on the East Coast.
But heating oil and crude oil prices weakened as traders took profits after last week's strong gains. The declines helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 0.35 point, to 231.94. Copper prices recovered. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for March delivery surged 5.6 cents, to $1.538 for 1,000 cubic feet, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Jan. 5. The contract has risen 20.1 cents, or 15 percent, since last Tuesday.
Some traders attributed the rally to the East Coast's coldest weather of the season, with freezing temperatures as far south as northern Florida.
"If the traders have to put their wooly mittens on and bundle up for the weather, often times we'll see that reflected on the trading floor," said Tom Knight, manager of East Coast products trading for the Fina Oil and Chemical Company.
Natural gas prices were depressed to near three-year lows by mild weather in December and January.
Heating oil futures ended lower despite the cold, after an early advance. Mr. Knight said traders took profits after a crude oil rally that began last week stalled at $18.93 a barrel.
The March heating oil contract fell 0.24 cent, to 49.20 cents a gallon, and March crude oil fell 19 cents, to $18.59 a barrel. March unleaded gasoline fell 0.05 cent, to 57.30 cents a gallon.
Copper prices rebounded from a 12-week low. On the Commodity Exchange of New York, copper for March delivery fell as low as $1.28 a pound, its lowest since Nov. 16, before recovering to settle 0.55 cent higher at $1.318 a pound.
Copper is heavily used in electronics production and building construction. Economists have lowered their demand forecasts as a result of rising interest rates in the United States, the Japanese earthquake, and other factors likely to slow economic growth.

Dollar Weakens During Day As Wall Street's Rally Cools

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen and slipped from its highs against European currencies yesterday after Friday's rallies in stocks and bonds in the United States cooled.
American stocks and bonds surged on Friday, pulling the dollar higher, after the Government reported that fewer jobs were created in January than most experts had expected, easing investors' concerns about inflation. Strong demand for American securities typically bolsters the dollar because foreign investors need dollars to buy American stocks and bonds. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average did rise yesterday, but only 9.09 points, while Treasury prices fell.
"There was early demand for dollars on expectations of continued gains for stocks and bonds," said Stephen Jury, chief dealer for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. "But bonds came down, and the Dow didn't really do anything. So the interest in dollars -- which was quite strong -- waned."
After reaching a high of 1.5347 German marks early yesterday, the dollar retreated, settling at 1.5308 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5267 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 99.41 Japanese yen from 99.85 yen.
The dollar's decline against the yen stemmed partly from purchases of yen by Japanese companies that are bringing money home from overseas operations before the end of their fiscal year on March 31, currency dealers said. Such year-end yen buying usually starts around the beginning of February, said Belal Khan, chief customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New York.
On Friday, the dollar dipped at first after the weaker-than-expected report on January employment damped speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again soon. Higher rates often help the dollar by making interest-earning deposits in the United States more attractive. But the same news that initially hurt the dollar helped the stock and bond markets, and that then prompted interest in buying dollars.
In other currency trading, the British pound came under pressure yesterday amid concern about the stability of Prime Minister John Major's Government. A growing rift within his Conservative Party over integration within the European Union and a threat by Ulster Unionists to withdraw their support in Parliament has led investors to question how long Mr. Major can hold office.
In New York trading, the pound fell to $1.5590, from $1.5635 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Japan's Builders: Quake Beneficiaries

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 6

 BODY:
As a penalty for bribing public officials, one of Japan's largest construction companies, the Taisei Corporation, was prohibited last month from seeking new business for 18 days. Then on Jan. 17, the great earthquake struck.
Within hours, the suspension was lifted in the emergency and Taisei dispatched 1,100 workers to Kobe to help clear the city's rubble and restore public services. 
 Japanese construction companies like Taisei stand to gain as a result of the earthquake.
Indeed, the biggest beneficiary of the disaster will be Japan's construction industry, which has become generally infamous in recent years for bribery and bid-rigging and which, some evidence suggests, may possibly have contributed to the earthquake's destruction through shoddy construction practices.
Rebuilding Kobe, critics say, could provide a chance to reform Japan's construction system, which has produced some of the world's costliest yet drabbest buildings. It could also offer an opportunity to enhance urban planning, which has been given short shrift in Japan, resulting in cities with jumbles of ill-matched buildings on impassably narrow streets and with few parks and green areas.
Some foreign companies, which feel locked out of the construction market here, hope that the earthquake reconstruction may provide them with a new chance to participate. Imported building materials, foreign construction methods and foreign contractors could help reduce the costs of reconstruction. Owners of Western-style homes say they seemed to hold up relatively well in the quake.
"I would have to say that this event could cause a revolution in people's thinking about housing," said Charlie Barnes, the Japan representative of the Engineered Wood Association, formerly known as the American Plywood Association.
But whether things will really change remains to be seen. While Government officials in the Kobe area are talking about freeing space for wider streets and more parks, it would be a logistical nightmare to buy all the land needed from thousands of property owners. Japan's Cabinet decided a year ago that emergency reconstruction work did not have to be put out to bidding, a decision that conforms to World Trade Organization guidelines. This suggests that foreign companies will not get a chance to compete initially, though rebuilding may be opened up over the longer term.
Yet rebuilding highways, railroads, bridges, ports and tens of thousands of buildings in the Kobe area will be a huge job. The government of Hyogo Prefecture, which encompasses Kobe, estimated on Thursday that the earthquake damage would cost $95 billion. Beyond the spending in the Kobe area, the earthquake will almost certainly cause Japan's building codes to be stiffened, resulting in other construction work to strengthen highways, bridges and buildings around the country.
In anticipation of a bonanza for construction companies, investors have been bidding up some Japanese construction stocks furiously, even as the stock market has sunk since the earthquake. Shares of Fudo Construction, which is strong in the Kobe area, have more than doubled from 510 yen before the quake to 1,350 yen today.
But some analysts doubt that the windfall will be that great. Toshiyuki Johno of CS First Boston estimated that about $20 billion to $30 billion a year would be spent on earthquake reconstruction for the next two years. That is about 2.5 to 4 percent of Japan's total spending on construction, which amounts to about $800 billion a year.
In addition, construction companies will be under pressure not to charge too much for earthquake-related work, because of its humanitarian aspect. And shortages of lumber, steel and other material may drive up their prices, cutting the construction industry's profits.
"What is open to question is how much money they will be making," said Mark Brown, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo.
The industry could use a boost. With Japan's economic slump, orders received by the top 50 construction companies have dropped three years in a row. The figure for orders last year, 19.2 trillion yen, or $192 billion, was 2.7 percent below the 1993 figure and 26.3 percent below the 1991 peak of 26.05 trillion yen.
But construction companies also hope to use the earthquake to repair their own tarnished images. Some have pitched in on the cleanup without discussing as yet how much they will be paid.
Some companies also donated food and other supplies. "We recognize the construction companies' social mission," said Hiroyuki Asano, a spokesman for Taisei, which shipped five truckloads of food to the disaster area.
Five Taisei executives were convicted last year of bribing mayors and governors to win public works contracts. In all, more than 22 construction industry executives from seven companies have been prosecuted for bribery in the last couple of years.
Collusion among companies on winning bids is acknowledged as a widespread practice. And the construction industry is sometimes reported to pay off yakuza, or gangsters, to avoid disruptions at the workplace. Some smaller companies involved in such tasks as hauling gravel and disposing of rubble are controlled by organized crime, said Raisuke Miyawaki, a former director of the criminal investigation bureau of the National Police Agency. Mr. Miyawaki said that "1 to 3 percent of the public works budget may go to the yakuza."
But the industry's image might be sullied further if it is proved that any shoddy work worsened the destruction caused by the quake.
Despite the reputation for engaging in shady practices, the Japanese construction industry has generally enjoyed a reputation for good quality workmanship once it wins the bids.
The finger-pointing since the earthquake has mostly been directed at Japan's building codes, which are criticized as inadequate. Less attention has focused on the possibility that construction companies may have skirted the codes.
"I can't conceive of it at all in Japan," said Masafumi Fukuda, senior officer for construction management in the Ministry of Construction. Some industry officials say that the fact that contractors win bids through bribes or collusion rather than by offering a low price removes some of the incentive to cut corners.
Still, disturbing questions have been raised by investigators as they sift through the rubble. Pieces of wood were found in some damaged pillars that hold up elevated tracks of Japan's bullet train. Experts said the wood could have weakened the columns. Other experts asserted that welds were done in the wrong places in the pillars of the collapsed Hanshin Expressway.
What is in little dispute is that construction costs in Japan are very high. Even the Construction Ministry, which generally protects the industry, has embarked on a program to cut costs, which it estimates run 13 to 40 percent higher than in the United States and Britain.
Others say the disparity is even greater. Yuji Noga, a Tokyo architect who designs Western-style homes, estimates that a 1,420-square-foot home that can be built in the United States for $84,000 will cost $200,000 to construct in Japan.
High costs of material in Japan are one factor. But if imported materials were used, costs here would still be more than twice as high as in the United States because of different construction practices, said Mr. Noga, who is vice chairman of the U.S.-Japan Housing Industry Roundtable, a group of Japanese and American companies that promotes the sale of imported homes in Japan.
But numerous regulations still hinder such building imports. American companies have difficulty getting visas to allow construction workers to come to Japan. American plumbing fixtures are routinely rejected.
Boosters of imported housing say that American-style construction, known here as 2-by-4 construction because of the size of the lumber used, is more resistant to earthquakes than the traditional Japanese homes..
But Dr. Fumio Kamiya, head of the timber structures group at the Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, said he found no difference in Kobe between the sturdiness of 2-by-4 buildings and modern Japanese-style houses. "Almost all the timber buildings that collapsed were built 30 to 40 years ago," he said.

HEADLINE: $1.6 Trillion Clinton Budget Received With Tepid Praise

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton sent his $1.6 trillion budget to a skeptical Congress today, vowing to control, if not reduce, the Federal deficit and challenging the new Republican majority to show how it would pay for its own deeper cuts in taxes and spending and keep its pledge to balance the budget by 2002.
"Republicans are saying we took a walk on the deficit, but none of them voted for the President's plan that got us where we are," said the President's budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, defending the Administration's decision to hold the budget deficit steady at about $200 billion a year into the next century, after reducing it for three years running. "And we will see as time unfolds what they intend to do to bring the deficit down. We haven't seen anything yet." 
 Mr. Clinton proposes to save $144 billion over the next five years -- about $63 billion to finance his proposed tax breaks for families with children and for college education, and the rest to reduce the deficit. He would eliminate 130 mostly small programs, for savings of about $2 billion, and consolidate 270 others in the first of what are likely to be far deeper cuts adopted by Congress.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans generally offered tepid praise for Mr. Clinton's direction but dismissed his plan as too timid.
"While the President has taken some positive steps as far as discretionary spending is concerned, he has shown no interest in doing the heavy lifting needed to eliminate our budget deficits," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee. "This budget lacks courage. It takes no action to control the growth of entitlement spending, which must be done if we are to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002."
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Clinton's plan "raises the white flag of surrender at the red ink of Government spending."
The majority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, said the President's budget would lend momentum to Republican efforts in the Senate to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, as the House of Representatives already has.
Some Democrats were not much more supportive. Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, said the budget would satisfy neither side of the aisle and "falls short, way short, of the deficit reduction we need."
"He has dropped the ball." Mr. Exon said.
And Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who recently headed a bipartisan commission on how to overhaul spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, said both parties were avoiding hard choices because the budgeting procedure only calls for making estimates five years into the future.
Indeed, curtailing the growth in entitlement spending, which rises automatically every year, has been one of the most difficult issues facing the Government. Mr. Kerrey's commission could not agree on how to do it and Mr. Clinton has punted as well.
Last year, the President proposed deep shifts in Medicare spending to help finance his health care proposals, and his aides said he remains committed to that goal. But the President opposes cutting Medicare to finance tax cuts, and today he sought to put the onus for any such decisions squarely on the Republicans.
"My budget cuts spending, cuts taxes, cuts the deficit, and does not cut education or Social Security or Medicare," Mr. Clinton said in unveiling it this morning. "That is a good budget. It continues to reduce the deficit without undermining the things that I believe the Federal Government should be doing. And I wish to work with the new Congress to achieve these objectives. I hope that they will submit budgets which do the same."
In fact, Mr. Clinton would eliminate some education programs in order to help finance his larger goal of new tax deductions for post high-school education. And while he would cut the deficit as a percentage of the domestic economy -- and in relation to how it was anticipated to grow before he took office -- in absolute terms it would remain about the same.
Over and over today, Administration officials sought both to defend that reality and to put it in context.
"When we got here, the deficit was out of control," Ms. Rivlin said. "It was nearly $300 billion and headed up, confidently predicted to go over $400 billion by the end of the decade. We had to get the deficit under control, and we did. It is now under $200 billion, $100 billion lower than in 1992, and this budget keeps that control and keeps the budget headed down as a percent of Gross Domestic Product. It was 4.9 percent in 1992; it is 2.7 percent of G.D.P. now. It will be 2.1, or less than half what it was in 1992 by the end of the decade."
Ms. Rivlin has long been one of the Administration's biggest deficit hawks. In a confidential memo to the President that caused an uproar when it became public last fall, she pointed out that the price of dramatic deficit reduction or increased spending on the President's domestic agenda would be cuts in other programs, like entitlements. Almost alone among the President's senior advisers, she argued in favor of deeper deficit reduction as the budget was being drafted in December, but she lost out to political advisers who urged the President to press ahead with his 1992 campaign pledge -- initially deferred in favor of deficit reduction -- of tax breaks for the middle class.
Today, Ms. Rivlin stoutly defended Mr. Clinton's efforts to encourage investment in education as worthy social and budgetary goals. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reflected mordantly on how little public or political credit the Administration has received for its success in reducing the deficit to date, but insisted that if the question came under serious scrutiny by the public, Mr. Clinton would still have the upper hand.
"If the elections in '96 were decided on whether the President fulfilled his promise to get the deficit under control," Mr. Rubin said, "I don't think the Republicans would get a single electoral vote."
Mr. Clinton proposed generally modest increases in spending for crime control, for stepped-up border patrols to deter illegal immigration, for high-priority environmental programs and for his national service program. He would save money by restructuring five departments, consolidating some functions and eliminating others, and by extending into the turn of the century caps on discretionary domestic spending that had been scheduled to expire in 1998.
The Administration is expected to outline the specifics of additional spending cuts this spring when Vice President Al Gore completes his second round of studies aimed at "re-inventing" government.
For their part, the Republicans said they would spell out specific prescriptions for cutting spending, in Mr. Kasich's words, "When we get it ready." Mr. Domenici said that meant late April or early May.

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: How Some Programs Would Fare"
 President Clinton proposes spending $1.612 trillion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, with a deficit of $192.5 billion. The pie slices represent the percentage of the total budget devoted to each spending category.
 
AGRICULTURE 3.9%
 Remains at $62.3 billion next year, sparing farm subsidies from the budget ax, at least for now. Several programs would receive increased financing, including the food stamp program and a nutrition program for children and pregnant women.
 
MILITARY 16.0%
 A slight cut, by $6 billion to $258 billion, but maintains financing for training and higher troop salaries at the expense of buying fewer new warships and fighter jets than at any other time in decades. Republicans vow to reverse the proposed reduction in the coming fiscal year and add perhaps another $6 billion.
 
ENERGY 1.1%
 An increase of $300 million to $17.8 billion despite Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary's boast that the Energy Department is making the biggest "contribution to deficit reduction" of any Federal agency. One increase is $90 million to accelerate the American-Russian program to improve security for nuclear materials.
 
ENVIRONMENT 0.5%
An increase about $138 million, to nearly $7.37 billion. More than half the money would be spent on local projects, mostly financing water treatment or the cleaning up of toxic waste sites. But the agency's research and regulatory activities would grwo by more than $400 million and at $3.4 billion it would be almost twice as costly as it was in 1989.
 
HOUSING 1.6%
 A decrease of $600 million to $26.3 billion. Future savings are expected from a massive consilidation of grants and services into just three programs.
 
JUSTICE 1.0%
 A 20 percent increase over last year to $16.5 billion, mainly to finance the Administration's anti-crime law. About $4 billion of the new money would be used to help cities hire more neighborhood police; $370 million would be added to help cover expenses for states with large numbers of illegal aliens. The Immigraiton and Naturalization Service's budget would increase 27 percent to $2.6 billion.
 
MEIDCARE, MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY 39.0%
 No policy changes were proposed in these mandatory spending programs.
 
TRANSPORTATION 2.3%
 A cut of $700 million to $37.3 billion. A reorganization over five years is projected to save about $6.4 billion. The independent Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates portions of the rail, bus and truck industries, would be eliminated.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Promoted a Company That Has Employed His Wife

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The wife of Speaker Newt Gingrich has been earning $2,500 a month plus commissions by working for a company to which her husband has lent his support.
The business, the Israel Export Development Company, is backed by American investors and is trying to establish a free-trade zone in Israel. Marianne Gingrich, a former county planner in Ohio, was hired by the investors to find American commercial tenants for the trade zone, which is to operate free of most taxes. 
 Mrs. Gingrich was hired last September, while her husband, a Georgia Republican, was the minority whip in the House, The Baltimore Sun reported on Saturday. The Wall Street Journal reported today that she was hired after Mr. Gingrich told Israeli officials that he supported the free-trade zone.
Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, said today that the job did not involve any dealings with the United States Government and therefore did not pose a conflict for the couple. The Sun said that the company's investors included prominent business executives like the president of CBS, Laurence Tisch, the clothing magnate Sy Syms and the real estate developer Robert V. Tishman.
"There is no conflict of interest," Mr. Blankley said. "She's gone halfway around the world to avoid one."
Mr. Blankley said Mr. Gingrich was always a strong supporter of free trade. "He was giving advice to a friendly Government about what their policy should be," Mr. Blankley said. "He wasn't acting in an official capacity. There is no conflict with his Congressional responsibilities. No one can describe even in theory what the conflict is because there isn't one."
The Journal reported that Mr. Gingrich said he was first informed of the proposal for a free-trade zone in 1993 by his friend, former Representative Vin Weber, and Jack Kemp, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
"I lobbied him," Mr. Weber, who worked for the company until about eight months ago, was quoted by The Journal as saying. Mr. Gingrich then met with supporters of the free-trade zone when he and his wife visited Israel in August 1993.

HEADLINE: Whitman Tax-Cut Plan Faces Problem

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In calling for the swift enactment of the remainder of her proposed 30 percent income tax cut, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said a new round of cuts were possible because her tax reductions had helped accelerate the state's economic growth.
But New Jersey's recovery, like that of most of the Northeast, remains a sluggish, uphill grind. That fact was underscored on Friday, less than two weeks after Mrs. Whitman announced her tax cut proposal, with a Federal employment report that showed New Jersey had lost 40,000 jobs in January and that its unemployment rate had jumped by a full percentage point, to 7.2 percent. 
 Although its economy has performed better than those of neighboring states for most of the last year, experts say the reason is not something special about New Jersey but rather a vibrant recovery nationwide generally. And like her counterparts in neighboring states, Mrs. Whitman must contend with deeply rooted economic problems.
"When you look at the industries that dominate this region, there is a cap on growth," said David Hensley, a regional economic analyst for Salomon Brothers. "New Jersey is part of that story."
In her 1995 budget message, Mrs. Whitman proudly contrasted New Jersey's growth to that of other states in the region. In recent months, employment in New Jersey has been expanding at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, double the nine-tenths of 1 percent expansion in New York, and triple the six-tenths of 1 percent expansion in Connecticut.
But the comparison obscures more telling data, indicating New Jersey has been left in the dust of brisk national expansion. Even before its downturn in January, New Jersey's rate of job growth had ranked 33d among the states, while New York and Connecticut were close to the bottom of the list, ranking 45th and 48th, respectively.
Since the employment report on Friday covered only the nation's 11 largest industrial states, a revised ranking of the states for January is not yet available. But among the 11 states, New Jersey's 7.2 percent unemployment was the second worst, with California, at 8.8 percent unemployment, coming in last.
Several of New Jersey's biggest industries have been hurt by broad economic shifts that are not expected to reverse course, even as the national economy grows more robust. With their vast markets in health care, the state's pharmaceutical makers and insurance companies have been squeezed -- and laid off thousands of workers -- because of the growing ability of health maintenance organizations and hospital buying groups to drive down costs.
In New Jersey, like other states across the Northeast, manufacturing is afflicted by relatively high wages and outmoded factories, even while thousands of auto plants, steel mills, plastics makers and other manufacturers in the Midwest and South are straining to keep up with rising demand for their goods.
Nor is New Jersey immune to the problems confronting the rest of the region, particularly among the banks and brokerage houses of Manhattan, which have slashed jobs and salaries because of higher interest rates and a weak stock market. Several of the largest Wall Street firms operate satellite data processing offices in New Jersey, and many of New Jersey's most highly paid residents commute to Wall Street jobs.
Although Mrs. Whitman calls her state "the pocket of hope for the region," even her top advisers acknowledge that the tax cuts she proposes -- a 15 percent cut in income tax rates by next January, coming on top of the 15 percent cut already in place -- are meant more to redistribute the state's tax burden and pave the way for long-term growth than to fuel an immediate upturn in the state's economy.
Indeed, Mrs. Whitman's budget and tax-cutting proposal has so far satisfied many analysts as economically viable, if politically difficult.
"There is nothing wildly optimistic in these changes," said Steven Hochman, assistant director of state ratings for Moody's Investors Service, one of the rating agencies that will judge Mrs. Whitman's fiscal proposals in determining the state's standing in the credit markets.
Although Moody's had not yet assessed every detail as of yesterday, or met with Mrs. Whitman's staff, Mr. Hochman said his firm was impressed by revisions they had made in forecasts of economic growth made last July. The revisions reflect lower expectations for growth during the next two years.
New Jersey officials now project job growth in their state of 1.8 percent this year, and 1.5 percent in 1996, compared to their earlier growth forecasts of 2 percent and 1.8 percent, he said. Forecasts of income growth in the state have also been scaled back.
Since they have taken into account the prospect of continued sluggishness, even with a reduced income tax rate, Mr. Hochman said Mrs. Whitman's plans "seem realistic."
One of the most difficult questions facing the New Jersey Governor and her counterparts in New York and Connecticut is whether tax cuts will lead to an immediate economic stimulus, as people seize on the lower deductions from their paychecks to spend more money. Will that spurt in spending offset the economic blow of layoffs, particularly among state agencies, where Mrs. Whitman plans to cut 3,350 jobs?
Such uncertainties have troubled economists across the nation. They contend that economic performance, something that is influenced by a complex array of variables, from interest rates to international trade competition as well as tax policy.
Nonetheless, some advisers to Mrs. Whitman assert that New Jersey's economy is stronger than those in neighboring states because of the first 15 percent cut in income taxes, and that the additional 15 percent reduction was bound to help.
"We've seen a clear increase in consumer confidence, and confidence in New Jersey's future," said Peter J. Calderone, the Labor Commissioner. He said the strongest increase in the state's employment in the last year had been in retail sales jobs, reflecting higher spending.
Another robust sector of the state's labor market is in business services, a broad category of employment that includes jobs in computer processing, printing, and consulting. Mr. Calderone said New Jersey, far more than its neighbors, had benefitted from the growth of small businesses that are filling the void of corporate layoffs.
No one can be sure what the short-term impact of Mrs. Whitman's proposal will be. But Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University and chairman of Mrs. Whitman's council of economic advisers, said it was the state's long-term prospects that mattered most.
"Disentangling all the causal factors is impossible," he said. "But the long-term strategy is to lower costs in New Jersey and make it more competitive, and to that extent this proposal is right on target."

HEADLINE: Care at Most Child Day Centers Rated as Poor

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
The care provided by most American child-care centers is so poor that it threatens children's intellectual and emotional development, according to a four-state study of hundreds of such centers made public yesterday.
The study, conducted by child psychologists and economists at four universities, concluded that infants and toddlers -- the group researchers say most need security and stimulation to thrive later on in life -- were worst off. As many as 40 percent of infant and toddler rooms provided poor care. 
 Over all, 12 percent of the centers studied were actually unsafe or unsanitary, and only 1 in 7 offered the kind of warm relationships that teach children how to trust adults and the intellectual stimulation that helps children become ready for school.
"I think the most important finding," said Barbara Reisman, executive director of Child Care Action Campaign, an advocacy group based in New York City, "is that in 76 percent of the centers, safety and health needs were being met, but the need to grow and develop were not."
The study, "Cost, Quality and Child Outcomes in Child Care Centers," was conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado at Denver, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of North Carolina and Yale University.
The researchers examined 400 care centers in California, Colorado, Connecticut and North Carolina in the spring of 1993, and tested 826 children from those centers to see what impact their child-care experience had on their intellectual and emotional development.
The study is the latest of several condemning the quality of American child care, whether in centers or in family day care, where one adult cares for a small group of children in a home.
"What used to be the best-kept secret in America keeps getting rediscovered: the quality of child care in America is mediocre at best," said Jay Belsky, a professor of human development at Pennsylvania State University who was not part of the study. "The mistake would be concluding that only parents can care for young children and that day care is inherently problematical. When high-quality stable care is provided, there is good evidence that children thrive."
The problem, Professor Belsky and others said, is that good care is so scarce.
The study was made public as debates intensify over whether the Federal Government should contribute to child care at all, and as Congress considers proposals to force welfare mothers to work, which would increase demand for child care.
In 1991, according to the Department of Labor, 58 percent of mothers with children under 6 were working, mostly full time. Among employed mothers with children under 5, 28 percent placed their children in child-care centers and a third used family day-care homes.
Last April, a study of family day care by the Families and Work Institute, a private research organization, also concluded that quality was so poor that in more than a third of the cases, children's development might suffer.
That study and this latest one found examples of high-quality child care when centers had more adults taking care of children, paid better wages and hired employees with training in how to care for children.
The study released yesterday also found that the highest-quality centers were those with access to extra money from Federal or state governments, universities or employers providing care at a work site. The study concluded that to provide higher quality care, centers had to spend about 10 percent more than those that provided mediocre care.
"What's new about this study is that it was done by economists as well as child psychologists, and what it says is that we know what to do with the money -- those centers that have more resources use them well," Ms. Reisman said.
But the study also noted that many parents either did not recognize quality child care or did not demand it. Ninety percent of the parents interviewed rated their child care as good, while the researchers found most poor or mediocre. Intense economic competition among centers means that most charge similar fees, regardless of quality.
The researchers found that states with stricter child-care regulations had more centers of higher quality.
To measure quality, the study used standards set by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. These include staffing ratios of 1 adult for every 3 to 4 infants, 1 adult for 4 or 5 2-year-olds and 1 adult for 8 to 10 4-year-olds. The Washington-based organization also calls on child-care providers to have a child-development certificate, which usually means a provider has had nine months of training.
The researchers recommended teaching parents how to evaluate quality child care, setting higher state child-care standards and providing more Federal and state money for child care.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
A Contract and a Job, But Very Little to Cheer

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J.

 BODY:
THE moment the 250 men had anticipated for a year and three months finally arrived Friday night.
"The time is 7:04," Luis Ginorio announced, as if for posterity. "We have a contract." 
 A contract! But no one cheered or clapped. It was so quiet in the smoke-choked union hall that you could hear someone squish a cigarette on the cracked linoleum tile. The workers who had their jobs back slowly filed out.
"The union is intact, and stronger," said Mr. Ginorio, a union administrator. But members of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union Locals 1733 and 1932 were tired. They had fought for one of the great unions, in the city that spawned the American labor movement. And they had paid for it.
Some members almost lost their houses. Marriages were strained, savings exhausted, holidays left uncelebrated.
They had been out on strike for only two months. Then they had been locked out of their jobs at 10 textile companies in Paterson and its surrounding towns for more than a year. When the union voted to return, unconditionally, management said no. Replacement workers had been hired for less pay. And some union members had given in and gone back as scabs.
To some people, it would seem the workers are back to square one. The contract they agreed to is almost the same as the one they had before. They were making approximately $13 an hour; now management has the option of cutting that by 80 cents. And they waived the right to sue for back pay.
BUT what they won was the right to keep their union, said Vince Falone, one of the die-hards. "Now they have to bargain with us as a group," he said.
CP Associates, the management bargaining group, began negotiating as it faced a Federal court injunction that would have required the 10 companies to take back the workers and pay millions in back pay, said a union lawyer, Joseph Fine.
"I don't think the employers were willing to bet the farm on that," Mr. Fine said. "I also think they were surprised at how resolute the unions were."
Mr. Falone was obviously proud. "Me? I was raised with unions. It's in my blood," he said. He began working in the textile dye houses in 1950. His father had worked in them in the 1930's. "My father used to take me to meetings when I was a kid," he said. "He was shot at during a strike."
His father had told him inspiring stories about "The Big One," the 1913 Paterson silk strike, and how it made labor and unions a celebrated cause.
"The union was family," Mr. Falone said. "I went to Korea and came back to work in the dye houses. It was coming home."
Mr. Falone applied for his pension during the strike, but continued to picket, he said. "They were trying to break us," he said. "They couldn't do it."
COMPANY bosses had been fighting Local 1733's leaders. Last February, the local's president and vice president, Joseph and Raymond LaBarck, were found guilty of extorting about $400,000 from employers to ensure labor peace. The LaBarck brothers, company lawyers said, called the October 1993 strike when their extortion demands went unmet.
But union members say the lockout never had to happen. When the strike began, union workers from 20 companies walked out. The workers, all represented by Locals 1733 and 1932, came from companies represented by two bargaining units, the Silk and Rayon Association and CP Associates. Within six weeks, the union negotiated a contract with the Silk and Rayon Association and its members returned to work.
CP Associates counts 300 workers who crossed the picket lines. Union representatives count about 250.
The National Labor Relations Board had determined that CP Associates had intimidated workers by threatening to fire them if they didn't resign from the union.
Most workers who crossed, Mr. Fine said, simply could not make ends meet. The union was able to give temporary jobs to between 40 and 70 of the locked-out workers, at $4 to $5 less an hour than they made at the textile companies. Some members collected unemployment.
Domingo Garcia, who began working for the dye houses in 1954, said he collected unemployment checks for about six months, then supported his wife and three children with savings. "Of course, that's gone now, too," he said with a chuckle. "I might celebrate what has happened now, but I don't have the means to celebrate. So I'll just go home."
The union would probably celebrate victory once workers returned to their jobs within the next 20 days, said Corrado Meola, a shop steward at Trio Dye in Paterson. "It was a struggle and a sacrifice," he said. "But in the end, we're all happy."

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Port Authority Problem

 BODY:
The commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are growing uneasy about Gov. George Pataki's choice of George Marlin, a Conservative Party leader with no significant managerial experience, to be the agency's executive director. Their doubts are not misplaced. The commissioners should resist whatever pressure Mr. Pataki brings to bear and insist on a more obviously qualified nominee.
Of the 12 commissioners, 6 from each state, only 2 -- both appointed by former Gov. Mario Cuomo -- have said they will vote for Mr. Marlin. The others remain publicly uncommitted, though several have told The Times privately that they are troubled by Mr. Marlin's inexperience and by his narrow political focus. 
 With a budget of $2.7 billion, the Port Authority plays a critical role in the regional economy. It operates the three major metropolitan airports as well as bridges, tunnels, the PATH commuter trains, the World Trade Center and the seaport. Mr. Marlin's selection is a political payback to the Conservative Party, whose endorsement was crucial to Mr. Pataki's victory. The appointment may help him politically but it is not good government.
Mr. Pataki has done some worthy things since taking office, but doling out a large number of jobs on the basis of kinship or political ties is not one of them. The choice of Mr. Marlin is a particularly offensive act of patronage. The Port Authority needs a seasoned administrator who will approach controversial issues, like selling some of its major assets, with an open mind.
Mr. Pataki violated Port Authority etiquette by not consulting New Jersey's Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, before settling on Mr. Marlin. Although Mr. Pataki has since apologized, Ms. Whitman has yet to throw her support behind Mr. Marlin or to say whether she will urge her commissioners to support him. Her voice will count for a lot; she should raise it in opposition.
Both Governors have a lot on their plates. They do not need the distraction of a fight over Mr. Marlin. An important test of leadership is the willingness to admit a mistake. Mr. Pataki can meet that test by withdrawing Mr. Marlin's name and joining Ms. Whitman in a search for a demonstrably superior candidate.

HEADLINE: Poland: Frustrations of Democracy

 BODY:
For President Lech Walesa of Poland, leading a constitutional state has proved more frustrating than leading a revolution. He has been fighting with the elected parliamentary majority, a coalition of parties descended from the old Communist dictatorship, and now threatens to exercise his power to dissolve Parliament and force new legislative elections.
Though Mr. Walesa portrays himself as a beleaguered defender of market reform and democracy, many Poles see him as a clumsy and sometimes undemocratic maneuverer primarily seeking his own re-election this November. Winning will not be easy. The former electrician and Nobel laureate, who led the Solidarity union movement to power in the 1980's, must overcome abysmal poll numbers that reflect a reputation for erratic leadership. 
 Poland's bold economic reforms of the early 1990's are now producing impressive growth statistics. But ironically, the political heirs of the old Communist dictatorship, not Mr. Walesa, could become the main beneficiaries.
Mr. Walesa accuses the governing parties of endangering reform by delaying privatization and proposing an unsound budget. He warns that they tried to turn back the clock with a repressive press law and proposed an anti-Western ideologue as defense minister. These charges have some truth, and Mr. Walesa did, in fact, skillfully use his presidential powers to turn back the press law.
But most of his interventions have been inept. While faulting the government's economic program, he offers no clear alternative and has alarmed many with his own authoritarian tendencies. Last fall he supported a group of generals trying to undermine the civilian Defense Minister.
The electoral gains of the old left in Poland in 1993 are part of a trend in Eastern Europe. Voters exhausted by high inflation and unemployment have turned to reformed leftist parties promising fewer shocks and higher social welfare benefits. Similar platforms have brought leftists back to power in Lithuania, Hungary and Bulgaria. Delivering on these promises has proved harder than making them, and reforms have suffered.
It will take time for voters in these countries to sort out what they really want and who is capable of delivering it. Meanwhile, America's interest is in maintaining the possibility of democratic choices and respecting the choices the voters make as they gain experience in democratic life, sometimes finding their way through trial and error. Mr. Walesa would be wise to do the same. Constant confrontation is not always the best way to serve democracy.

HEADLINE: The President's Sensible Budget

 BODY:
The budget President Clinton released yesterday might seem tame by comparison with the government-gutting promises of Republicans. The President would wipe out no department or major program. He would not balance the budget, but instead projects $200 billion deficits as far as his budget officials can see. He barely nicks entitlement programs and achieves savings through hundreds of reasonable, though unexciting, spending reductions.
But the Administration's plan exudes common sense. The deficit would fall as a percentage of economic activity -- the best gauge of the Government's tug on private capital. By avoiding a mindless rush to balance, the President preserves valuable investments in education, training and research. His budget provides a worthy alternative to an expected Republican onslaught on government. 
 Goaded by the G.O.P., the President made his task harder by proposing tax credits, as previously announced, of up to $500 per child and up to $10,000 per family for education and job training. He exempted Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and defense -- more than half the budget -- from sizable cuts, forcing bigger cuts on everything else. The budget plan calls for spending over the next five years about $130 billion less than what it would cost to continue this year's Federal programs. Most of the service cuts would come out of housing, transportation, energy and other discretionary programs. Mr. Clinton would eliminate 131 mostly small programs, consolidate 271 others and cut the Federal payroll to the lowest level in 30 years.
The G.O.P. is likely to embrace nearly every one of Mr. Clinton's cuts and impose even more. The Administration will fight to preserve its national service, training and education initiatives. The President proposes "skill grants" for unemployed and low-paid workers to buy vocational training. He would spend more on early childhood education and nutrition, tuition grants for low-income families and a variety of programs to stimulate commercial technology. Investment in civilian infrastructure, research, education and training would rise from $136.6 billion this year to $137.8 billion next -- an increase that does not make up for inflation and that pales next to Mr. Clinton's election-year promise to boost investment by $50 billion a year. Yet he will be lucky to push even measly increases past Congress.
The President backed off from cutting Medicare and Medicaid, even though the two programs are projected to rise over 9 percent a year and account for about 40 percent of the increase in Federal spending over the next several years. Burned by last year's debacle over reform of private health insurance, he seems content to let the G.O.P. take on popular entitlements.
Some critics ridicule the Administration for a weak-kneed attack on the deficit. But lowering the deficit to 2 percent of domestic output, half its recent level, while preserving a modicum of public investment is a responsible turnabout.

HEADLINE: Orange County Offers Plan To Repay 77% to Investors

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif. Feb. 7

 BODY:
Officials of Orange County, Calif., offered today to give municipalities that had put money into the county's ill-fated investment pool 77 percent of their money back immediately, plus notes and liens that could result in full repayment within 15 years.
The settlement was approved by the county's five-member Board of Supervisors. It represents a first step toward resolving the conflicting demands of the 186 municipalities that invested in the county-run pool, which lost more than $1.7 billion through a risky investment strategy that failed. 
 Under the plan, the county would issue $255 million in 15-year recovery notes to cities, water and school districts and other public agencies invested in the pool. In addition, all investors would receive 77 cents for every dollar they had put into the pool. The county, since filing for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 6, has liquidated the pool.
Any settlement will have to be approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court judge, John E. Ryan. In addition, approval is needed from 80 percent of pool participants, excluding the county, said Orange County's bankruptcy lawyer, Bruce Bennett.
"We really do need a broad consensus to make this agreement work," Mr. Bennett said.
The proposed settlement gives preferential treatment to school districts, most of which were required by law to invest in the pool. They would receive recovery notes representing 13 percent of their investment -- 13 cents on the dollar -- along with the immediate cash and a claim against future proceeds from any litigation relating to the bankruptcy. Orange County is seeking $2 billion from Merrill Lynch & Company, which sold it the investments.
Other pool participants would get a different package. A greater percentage of the returns to these participants would come from future litigation proceeds.
In theory, all pool participants could eventually receive 100 percent of their investment back.
The settlement plan depends on whether investors will buy the county's recovery notes, which are taxable securities backed by Orange County's full faith and credit.
The notes' face value will specify a low rate of interest similar to that on many short-term securities. But the county said it would have the option of switching to a long-term rate. The notes pay interest only for eight years, then both principal and interest for a further seven years, according to the settlement plan.

HEADLINE: Clinton Rescue Plan Buoys The Price of Mexican Bonds

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Foreign and domestic investors showed signs of new-found confidence in Mexico's battered financial markets today as the Government succeeded in selling its first Treasury bonds since a new international rescue package was announced last week.
The interest rate on the 91-day bond, though still much higher than comparable rates in the United States, plunged nearly 10 percentage points in today's auction, to a yield of 15.40 percent, reflecting strong demand. Officials at the Mexican central bank said it was the largest one-time drop in percentage points ever for the Treasury bonds, which are called tesobonos. 
 Financial analysts in the United States and Mexico saw the steep drop in rates, and the rise in bond prices, as an indication that the international rescue package of about $50 billion announced by President Clinton last Tuesday was calming the market.
On Monday, the first $7.8 billion in funds from the package was deposited at the Mexican central bank. That raised the bank's international currency reserves to more than $11 billion and greatly eased worries that Mexico might not be able to pay off its short-term debts, especially for the tesobonos, which are indexed to the value of the dollar.
Mexico has more than $20 billion of the bonds falling due this year.
"This is the kind of positive signal the Mexican Government was looking for," said Luis R. Luis, chief of emerging-markets research at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in Boston. "Interest rates have an important role as a signal of confidence in Mexico."
Mr. Luis, however, was reluctant to read too much significance into today's auction. He said the Government was extremely conservative in offering only $240 million worth of bonds, about half what had been offered at recent weekly auctions. In addition, last week's auction was canceled because market conditions were so depressed before the international package was announced.
"They wanted to have a manageable auction this week that would be highly successful because that was what the market expected," Mr. Luis said.
Interest rates for the 182-day Treasury bond also dipped about 10 percentage points. But the yield on the 364-day bond did not vary much, remaining slightly above 20 percent.
Stephen P. Dexter, a portfolio manager at the Kemper International Fund in Chicago, said that the high rates for the longer bonds indicated that many investors continued to be wary of the Mexican market.
"Investors may be willing to creep back in for above-average yields on the short end, but they are not that confident yet to go for 364-day paper," Mr. Dexter said. "You still could easily see rates go back up at future auctions if, politically, things look less stable than they are now."
Mr. Dexter noted that many United States investors continued to stay out of Mexican stocks, as well, worried about the effect of the devaluation of the peso on company earnings and the Government's ability to control inflation. The Mexican stock market drifted again today, with its main index slipping 1.72 points -- just under one-tenth of 1 percent -- to close at 1,962.26.
The peso held steady, at 5.335 to the dollar.
Analysts said it appeared that European investors had led the charge to buy the Mexican bonds today, with United States investors preferring to stay on the sidelines.
Alexander Anderson, research director at Abaco, a Mexico City brokerage firm, expressed optimism that today's bond auction marked a clear turnaround in Mexico's financial markets.
"Obtaining the $50 billion meant that Mexico's problems are probably over," Mr. Anderson said. "I know that's not the perception on Wall Street. But I think that all we have now is a problem of perception, not of economic or financial reality."

Copper Drops on Worries About a Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper prices tumbled yesterday as traders saw demand for the metal easing with slowing economic growth.
Natural gas and cotton prices also fell sharply, dragging the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 0.43 point, to 231.51. Lumber prices rose strongly. 
 Wheat prices surged on signs of stronger export demand. The White House announced that the Agriculture Department would soon offer China new export subsidies for purchases of American wheat despite a trade dispute between the two countries. On the Chicago Board of Trade, March wheat rose 3.5 cents, to $3.7325 a bushel.
On the Commodity Exchange of New York, copper for March delivery fell 2.35 cents, to $1.2945 a pound.
Copper prices peaked last month, but since then higher interest rates in the United States and dimmer prospects in China have put pressure on prices.
"The reason for the copper rally was strength in North America and China, so the market is quite soberly looking at its two bulwarks being cut down a little bit," said James Steel of Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based commodities brokerage firm.
March natural gas deliveries fell 11.7 cents, to $1.421 for 1,000 cubic feet, on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders took profits from a four-day rally that had raised prices 20.1 cents, or 15 percent.
In other energy trading, the March crude oil contract fell 13 cents, to $18.46 a barrel, and March heating oil slipped 0.07 cent, to 49.13 cents a gallon. March unleaded gasoline fell 0.31 cent, to 56.99 cents a gallon.
March cotton plunged 1.64 cents, to 90.28 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange, continuing its pattern of working lower in violent lurches since reaching a 14-year high of 94.7 cents Jan. 30.
Lumber prices jumped the permitted daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, possibly reflecting fears of a possible rail strike in Canada. Spruce 2-by-4's for March delivery jumped $10, to $325 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Sell China More Wheat Despite Trade Rift

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Three days after imposing record sanctions on China for its piracy of American-made movies and software, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would expand subsidized wheat sales to Beijing, rather than let European farmers win a bigger share of the Chinese market.
The move points up the complexity of trying to punish a major trading partner even as the Government grapples with protecting the interests of American businesses that are trying to gain a larger foothold there. 
 Indeed, the decision was approved by Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, who imposed the sanctions against China on Saturday. It means that China will pay about $20 million less for its new purchases of one million metric tons than it would if it bought the wheat on the commercial market.
"It may sound strange but this is for the benefit of U.S. farmers, not for the Chinese," Mr. Kantor said. "We want to build our market share in China. So you have to go after them with a scalpel, not a hatchet."
In fact, when Mr. Kantor announced more than $1 billion in sanctions against China on Saturday, he carefully excluded a number of Chinese-made products from punitive tariffs, for fear of hurting American companies. There was no punitive tariff placed on toys, for example, so that American retailers would not be harmed. There was no tariff placed on electronic components, because American computer makers feared they would be put at a disadvantage to their Japanese competitors.
But the wheat subsidy for China is bound to raise questions among those who have contended that American policy is inconsistent. They contend that the penalties announced with such fanfare on Saturday are being eroded by tariff cuts and trade concessions in other areas. On Jan. 1, for example, the United States included China in a list of nations that would no longer have to pay tariffs on a range of goods imported to the United States, including toys. By some estimates, China's savings from those cuts will amount to $2 billion, or twice the size of the sanctions imposed last week.
Under the conventions of trade law, the United States had no choice but to cut those tariffs, because of President Clinton's decision last year to extend "most favored nation" trade status to China. That status means that China receives all trade benefits accorded to any other American trading partner.
Australia's Ambassador to the United States, Don Russell, was among the first to criticize the Administration's decision today. "It seems a bit strange if you are trying to be a bit stiff with the Chinese that you offer them cheaper-than-cheap wheat," Mr. Russell said. "It is a big gift to the recipient."
Mr. Russell was speaking from considerable self-interest: Australia does not subsidize its wheat sales, and has argued that its farmers are badly harmed by the subsidy war between the United States and Europe. American officials, however, said Australia had no more wheat left to sell to China this year.
Since July 1, the United States has subsidized the purchase of three million metric tons of wheat by China and has agreed to finance additional amounts after that.
The Agriculture Department is authorized to spend up to $800 million on the wheat subsidy in the current fiscal year. Under President Clinton's new budget that figure would rise to $959 million.
For years, farm groups, legislators from farm states and the Agriculture Department have contended that the export subsidies are needed as long as other nations subsidize their own grain sales. The amount of the subsidies will be kept in check, however, under the new version of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was passed by Congress last year. The agreement, which will be supervised by the new World Trade Organization, calls for subsidies to decline gradually.
Moreover, the value of the subsidies has fallen significantly in the last year because the market for wheat has been quite tight -- meaning that farmers have less of a need for government help. Still, some economists say that American consumers are the biggest losers from the program, because the subsidies, by expanding the market for wheat, have the effect of raising the price of grain on the American market.
Over the last year, the unified political front put forth to defend the subsidies has begun to crack. The North American Grain Export Association, a trade group for companies that sell American grain abroad, called last year for an end to the program. The export companies contend that the subsidies actually hamper the effort of American farmers to prepare for tougher competition as markets are made freer.
Mr. Kantor, in an interview today, said that the apparent contradiction in the Government's trade policy was no contradiction at all. The reality of the marketplace, he said, is that "you have to pick your punitive actions with surgical precision."
"In this business, you have to walk and chew gum at the same time," he said. "You can't be a slave to a false notion of consistency that is not in our interest."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Rise On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of United States Treasury securities ended slightly higher yesterday, as the Government embarked on the first leg of its big quarterly auction with the sale of $17 billion in new three-year notes.
The 30-year bond was up 1/32 , to a price of 9812/32 for a yield of 7.64 percent, unchanged from Monday. Rates on shorter-maturity bills improved an average three basis points, with the rate for a three-month bill at 5.78 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The credit for keeping investors bullish went to comments from a Fed official who said that the economy was nearing the slower growth that the central bank has been aiming for by raising interest rates. Traders said those comments helped to lift the market early, lending credence to the view of some that the Fed may be near the end of its interest raising cycle.
A Federal Reserve Board governor, John P. LaWare, speaking before the Washington Community Reinvestment Association in Everett, Wash., late Monday afternoon, said, "We may be at the cusp of what we're trying to accomplish." His comments were made too late Monday to have an impact on the New York Treasuries market.
Mr. LaWare also said that it was too early to tell if the Fed was through raising rates and that coming economic data would be the key in helping the Fed decide if and when to raise rates again. But, some analysts said, these remarks may have been ignored.
"Believe it or not, there are actually people out there who think the Fed is done tightening," said James Hale, fixed-income analyst for MMS International in San Francisco. But, he added, there have been several times since the Fed began raising interest rates a year ago when the market has misinterpreted Fed comments.
At the three-year note auction, the yield was 7.34 percent, about where everyone had expected it would be, up from the last three-year note auction. The decline in prices after the auction, Mr. Hale said, was merely the result of dealers selling in an effort to push down prices ahead of today's auction of 10-year notes and tomorrow's 30-year bond sale.
The Treasury also announced plans to sell $9 billion of previously announced cash management bills this Thursday to meet short-term borrowing needs beyond the cash raised through securities sold at the Government's regularly scheduled auctions. The minimum denomination for the sale is $1 million.
Today's $12 billion auction of 10-year notes should do well, Mr. Hale said, because the market is "decidedly bullish." He said he believed that many fund managers had a lot of cash on hand and may put the money to work this week.
Traders said a positive nonfarm productivity report also helped to underpin market strength, but only marginally.
Productivity rose by 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1994, a big gain by any standard, but especially good considering their stage of the business cycle, accordinbg to Christopher A. Low, senior economist for the HSBC Group in New York. "It's certainly a good sign that this far into the business cycle you continue to see such large gains in productivity," Mr. Low said. "It indicates that business is keeping costs down and avoiding inflation."
In the municipal market, prices rose for the third consecutive day, pushing yields to their lowest level in five months, as supply fell short of demand.
Yesterday's largest scheduled negotiated offering, a $186 million sale of hospital and nursing home mortgage revenue bonds by the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency, went well.
The scarcity of new issues allowed the New York bonds' yields to be lowered at least 10 basis points, instead of having to raise yields to attract investors.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: U.S. Productivity Grows For Fifth Year in Row

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
American business productivity improved in 1994 for the fifth consecutive year, pushed up by the largest growth in output since 1984, the Labor Department reported today. At the same time, businesses held labor costs to the smallest gain in 30 years.
The Government also reported that consumer credit grew in December at its slowest pace in five months. 
 Productivity -- defined as output per number of hours worked -- jumped 2.2 percent last year, faster than the 1.5 percent advance in 1993, the Labor Department said. It was the fifth straight annual gain since productivity fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in 1989.
Businesses held growth in unit labor costs, which typically account for two-thirds of the cost of a product, to nine-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest increase since an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in 1964. Costs have tapered off each year since 1990, when they rose 5.1 percent.
"It says there is very little risk of inflationary pressures building," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company.
Economists watch growth in productivity for clues regarding long-term economic trends. Productivity is an indicator of the nation's living standards and the competitiveness of its products overseas. Strong productivity is likely to hold off inflationary pressures.
Some analysts maintain that growth in productivity will slow and possibly decline as companies continue to add workers and the current business cycle continues.
Others, like Mr. Roach, disagree.
"Employers are getting more out of their workers by re-engineering existing manufacturing and service processes, by using more information technology and by outsourcing," Mr. Roach said.
"It's all part and parcel of the productivity revolution of 1990's," he added, "and I believe it's ongoing."
Growth in productivity slowed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 percent in the final three months of 1994, from a strong 3.2 percent in the previous quarter.
Output jumped 5.2 percent last year, compared with a 4.1 percent increase in 1993. It was the largest increase since an 8.2 percent surge in 1984, when the Government began keeping output records.
Manufacturing productivity rose 4.9 percent in 1994, compared with a 3.2 percent advance in 1993.
Total business productivity, including farming, increased 2.3 percent, up from 1.5 percent in 1993. Business productivity rose 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
Separately, the Federal Reserve said today that outstanding consumer credit rose $7.4 billion in December to $911.2 billion.
The Fed said installment debt climbed at an annual rate of 9.8 percent in December, the slowest rate in five months, compared with 16.5 percent in the previous month and 15.9 percent in October.
Analysts are predicting a slowdown in consumer spending and debt this year, but the sharp drop-off in December was not expected by economists.
Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real estate. The totals are adjusted for seasonal variations.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances as Traders React to Rise in Bond Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar gained against most leading currencies yesterday, helped by an early rally in the American bond market.
"The bond market is showing constructive gains, and as long as that happens the dollar will hang in there," said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
 Bond prices retreated later in the day, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond ending the day unchanged at 7.64 percent. Yields and prices move in opposite directions. Strong demand for United States securities often helps the dollar because foreign investors buy them with dollars. The dollar also backed off earlier gains.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5378 German marks yesterday, its highest level since Jan. 17. In New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.5365 marks, up from 1.5308 marks on Monday. The dollar edged up to 99.44 Japanese yen from 99.41 and rose to 1.3025 Swiss francs from 1.2944 francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5565 from $1.5590.
Bond prices surged in early trading on a growing belief that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates again soon with inflation under control. Traders and analysts said this perception was confirmed by comments from a Fed official.
John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, told a conference in Everett, Wash., late Monday that the Fed "may be at the cusp of what we're trying to accomplish" by raising rates to control inflation.
Mr. LaWare said that while he could not rule out the possibility of more rate increases, the Fed was wary of pushing the economy into recession.
Mr. Lawrie at Mellon Bank said: "We used to think rate increases helped the dollar. Now the prospect of no increases helps the bonds, and that helps the dollar."
The dollar's recent gains have been pronounced against the German mark as investors see less need to use the mark as a safe haven from riskier markets, analysts said.
Many investors flocked to the mark last month as the financial crisis in Mexico deepened, raising concern about the fate of other emerging markets. The Mexican peso, stable yesterday at 5.335 pesos to the dollar, has fallen 35 percent since the Government devalued the currency in December.
"We're continuing to see a flow out of the Deutsche mark against other European currencies," and that has benefited the dollar, said Jim Raphael, a currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Everybody Is Shut Out at the White House Talks

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
At the end of the White House night game, it was Players 2, Owners 1. Except there were no winners -- not the players, not the owners, not the President.
By the time player and ownership groups left the White House, where they had waded through the most unusual negotiating session in baseball labor history, they had no agreement because the two ideas the players agreed to the owners rejected and the one idea the owners accepted the players rejected. 
 Neither was happy about the other's actions, and their departure left the talks in chaos and confusion. No one knew where they were headed next. The players didn't say what their immediate plans were, but the owners' negotiating team was planning to leave Wednesday.
No one knew either if Bill Usery Jr. would remain the mediator of the impossible dispute. It seemed highly unlikely.
Asked whether Usery had outlived his usefulness, Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said at a late-night news conference: "I will make no comments. I will speak to him tomorrow."
But a few moments earlier, Fehr said that the owners' disclosure of some of the details of Usery's suggestions was damaging.
"The clubs knew that by disclosing these ideas," Fehr said, "it becomes very difficult for Mr. Usery to remain involved."
Usery's status was in doubt because he had enraged the players by making a series of suggestions or proposals or recommendations that they felt were far closer to the owners' positions than theirs. That, the players believed, was why the owners agreed to accept the mediator's ideas, including a 50 percent tax on portions of payrolls above $40 million.
The players, on the other hand, accepted the idea of binding arbitration that was put forward by Vice President Gore and that President Clinton plans to send to Congress Wednesday. They also were prepared to play the 1995 season, another Administration suggestion, while a Presidential fact-finding commission developed matters to be used for negotiations for a new agreement following the season.
The clubs, Fehr said, did say they would agree to binding arbitration on the level of a payroll tax if the players agreed to the remainder of Usery's suggestions. The players rejected that idea, saying they wanted to submit all of the issues to binding arbitration.
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, who has spent little time in the talks but arrived here Monday and led the management contingent to the White House, and others among his group explained that the parties should negotiate their own agreement and not have one imposed by Congress or an arbitrator.
"Binding arbitration is not the solution to this dispute and we reject the idea," Selig said. "For one thing, Congress has made it clear it is not prepared to consider the necessary legislation." He added that the clubs did not want to "put the future of Major League Baseball and its 28 franchises at risk under such a precedure."
The clubs rejected the fact-finding idea, they said, because baseball has had enough studies performed on it and another commission would uncover nothing new. On the other hand, they said, Usery had been involved in the strike for four months and knew the issues intimately.
If anyone knew how to arrive at a reasonable and fair compromise, it was Usery, they said.
But Fehr vehemently disagreed, citing Usery's responses to questions about his payroll tax proposal.
"We asked him how much would be raised by the tax, who gets it, what does it do to players' salaries," Fehr said. "He said: 'I don't know. I'm not an expert in economics and I don't understand the stuff.' "
Union officials said Usery's 50 percent tax would cost the players $1 billion in salaries over the six years of the proposed agreement.
Among the Usery ideas the players objected to was the plan to grant service credit for the 52 days of the strike but the credit would be limited for 24 players whose service status in terms of years would change. In other words, Jack McDowell, who needs 19 days to become a free agent, would not be granted that status.
"We were mystified by the one-sidedness of the proposals and felt somebody was playing politics," Lauren Rich, a union lawyer, said. "If this is a balanced proposal, the owners ought to be prepared to support it in binding arbitration. We think it's totally unsupportable. Usery could not give us justification for the proposals."
Selig said that by not accepting the mediator's suggestions, the union showed it was not interested in compromise.
"The proposal is far from perfect," he said. "It's generous to the players; it requires clubs to make concessions. This compromise proposal is a step in the right direction."
Usery proposed that the 1995 season be played under the system, except for the pension plan, that had been in effect before the clubs implemented a salary cap Dec. 23.
In 1996, he said, salary arbitration should be eliminated for players with four and five years of major league service and they be made unrestricted free agents instead. In 1997, salary arbitration would be eliminated for three-year players and the 17 percent of the two-year class that qualifies now. Those players would not be granted free agency.
Fehr said he was surprised by the mediator's suggestions, although he said Usery told the players they were not final or formal.
David Cone, one of five players who attended the White House evening, said the players would be prepared to campaign for Clinton's binding-arbitration bill.
"If the American people call their representatives and they want this," the Kansas City pitcher said, "and Congress wants to do the right thing, the players can put the uniforms back on and we can let the lawyers and experts take this case over because that's what really should happen here. We're baseball players. We want to play baseball. We want to put the uniforms on. If this issue is so damn complicated, maybe the lawyers should be in binding arbitration and the players should be on the field."

HEADLINE: Paroled Rapist Is Charged In Sex Attacks in Bronx

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
A string of sexual attacks in the Bronx was carried out by a man who was paroled from prison a year ago after serving 13 years for rape, the police said yesterday.
At the time he carried out the attacks, they said, the man was dutifully checking in with his parole officer and even attending required rape counseling sessions. 
 Parole officers had told the police that the suspect, Johnny Rosado, lived in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, near the Parkchester complex, where several attacks took place. But the police did not connect him to the assaults until last weekend.
When he was questioned on Sunday, he was released because investigators lacked probable cause for his arrest. It was not until Monday, when two private security guards saw him trying to get into an apartment building by pushing several buzzers, that he was finally arrested, the police said.
The police said Mr. Rosado, 40, who is unemployed and lives at 1936 East Tremont Avenue, would typically corner women inside apartment building elevators and force them at knife-point onto the roof, where he would rape or sodomize them.
The suspect, who had been in prison since 1980 on a rape and sodomy conviction, was released on parole in January 1994, and had been checking in weekly with his parole officer, said David Ernst, a spokesman for the State Division of Parole. According to the terms of his release, he was also regularly attending counseling for sex offenders.
"Under law, he was held as long as he could be held," Mr. Ernst said, adding that Mr. Rosado had been released early for good behavior.
The police said that even though parole officials notified them of his presence in the neighborhood, Mr. Rosado was not caught earlier because victims' descriptions of the rapist did not fit the suspect's profile closely enough.
After his arrest on Monday, victims in three of the eight Bronx attacks picked him out of a lineup and photo array, said Detective Kim Royster, a police spokeswoman, who added that the victims, all women, ranged in age from 16 to 28. She said investigators had evidence linking Mr. Rosado to all eight incidents, which she said occurred between Jan. 8 and Feb. 5.
Imprisoned in 1980 on charges that carried a sentence of 9 to 18 years, Mr. Rosado became eligible for parole in 1988 but was denied release four times before he accumulated enough "good behavior" time to earn his release, Mr. Ernst said.
Prisoners in New York state prisons earn a day of good-behavior time for every two days spent in prison if they stay out of trouble, Mr. Ernst said. The accumulated time is deducted from prisoners' maximum sentences, though they are placed on parole after release.
On Monday, the two plainclothes security guards approached Mr. Rosado after they spotted him pressing doorbells at random in what was apparently an attempt to gain entrance to 1430 Parkchester Road, one of 172 brown-brick apartment buildings that house some 40,000 people in the sprawling Parkchester Condominium complex just north of the Cross Bronx Expressway.
"It seemed he was just waiting for an opportunity," said Dennis Cowan, director of security at the Parkchester Condominiums, describing how the two guards watched Mr. Rosado enter the apartment building and stand in the foyer. "He told the security officers that he was waiting for a friend. At that point they asked what apartment, and he couldn't answer."
Mr. Rosado tried to flee when the security officers escorted him from the building, Mr. Cowan said. "My guys grabbed him and brought him down," he said. "The Police Department came in and assisted us at that point."
Detective Royster said Mr. Rosado was charged with three counts of sodomy and two counts of rape, as well as sexual abuse, robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal trespass.
"His method of operation was to follow his female victims into elevators," she said. "Once the elevator reached an upper floor, he would force his victims out of the elevator at knife-point or by choking them from behind to the roof top. There he would engage in sexual or deviate sexual intercourse."
"Money and jewelry were taken in several incidents," the detective said, adding that the arresting officers did not find a knife in Mr. Rosado's possession when he was arrested.
Residents at Parkchester Condominiums expressed dismay that neither the police nor the complex's management notified them of the rapes.
"I didn't hear anything," said 17-year-old Rose Clair, a high school student at the Bronx Outreach Center who lives at 1430 Parkchester Road and was visibly shaken when she heard that the suspect was seized just inside the doorway to her building. "I'm angry," she said. "It's wrong, but I'm glad they caught the guy."
Mr. Cowan said Parkchester managers were considering posting notices about the rapes on the day Mr. Rosado was arrested.
"Rape has not been a serious problem here," said Mr. Cowan, adding that the Police Department informed him only on Friday that they were pursuing a serial rapist in the area.

HEADLINE: United Nations Reports Serbian Helicopter Sorties in Bosnia, a Violation of Flight Ban

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Serbian helicopters flew a large number of sorties into eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina last week in violation of a United Nations ban, the Security Council was told today.
A total of 62 helicopters flying too low for aerial surveillance were spotted by United Nations observers on the ground on Wednesday through Saturday north of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, a representative of the United Nations Secretary General told the Council. The representative, Undersecretary General Chinmaya Gharekhan, said that one large contingent was flying in military formation. 
 The westward flight of 15 helicopters in formation from Serbia into Bosnia was reported by Dutch observers over the weekend; the fuller tally was collected since then.
Those flights, along with sporadic helicopter sorties into northwestern Bosnia from Serb-held areas of Croatia, have raised concerns here that the Bosnian Serbs are being resupplied with ammunition and spare parts during a four-month truce in their war with Bosnian Government forces.
The United States, already exasperated by the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to accept an international peace plan while the truce is in force, is pressing Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a thorough investigation into the flights.
The flights near Srebrenica are thought to have originated at Surcin or other military airfields in Serbia under the control of the Yugoslav Army. Mr. Gharekhan told reporters that there was no absolute proof that the flights originated in Serbia, in part because United Nations observers were barred from monitoring radar at airfields near the border last week.
"But the fact that there were a large number of helicopter flights, that is an established fact," he said.
If the helicopter flights into eastern Bosnia are traced to fields in Serbia, they could place the Belgrade Government in clear violation of a United Nations ban on military flights over Bosnia. The sorties would also violate a promise by the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, to prevent all supplies except relief goods from reaching Bosnian Serbs across his border.
A formal report from the Secretary General confirming any violation of Serbia's pledge could lead to the automatic reimposition of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia for its role in aiding the Bosnian Serb combatants.
In September, the Security Council eased sanctions involving cultural exchanges, participation in international sports events and access to the Belgrade airport and the port of Bar to reward Mr. Milosevic for his willingness to cut supply lines to the Bosnian Serbs.
The United States is demanding to know why United Nations observers were barred from Serbian airfields at a critical time.
Washington is reported to have some unspecified independent evidence, officials here say, that the flights originated in Serbia, which with Montenegro makes up what is left of Yugoslavia.
Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, left for a meeting at the White House today after hearing the report from the Secretary General's representative.
The stepped-up American activity in the Security Council comes as the Clinton Administration, making another turn in its Bosnia policy, said it would end official contacts with the Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his associates because of their continuing refusal to accept the internationally brokered peace proposal.
"There is no point in shuttling up the hill from Sarajevo to Pale to listen to the kind of crap which is dished out by Karadzic," Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke said in an interview Monday with the National Public Radio program "All Things Considered."
He added that Dr. Karadzic would not be invited to a conference of Balkan leaders being planned by France, unless the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace proposal. The peace plan, intended as a foundation for negotiations, would reduce the territory captured by the Serbs to 49 percent from 70 percent.
In a statement issued in Belgrade, the Yugoslav Army General Staff called the reports of flights "primitive fabrications" and denied any violation of the no-flight zone in Bosnia.
In the Security Council, President Milosevic is getting some support from Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs. The Russian position that has emerged over the last day or two is that there is no reason to act precipitously on incomplete evidence against Serbia.
On the matter of barring United Nations monitors from radar sites and bases, the Russians say that President Milosevic never promised free access and allowed it only as a gesture of good will.
Although the truce, negotiated in December by former President Jimmy Carter, has been holding in much of Bosnia, the situation around the northwestern Muslim enclave of Bihac has remained tense, United Nations officials said today.
The area's 180,000 people are running desperately short of food supplies, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said today in Geneva.
Food shipments are being restricted because Fikret Abdic, a rebel Muslim leader opposing the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, has demanded 50 percent of the aid cargoes, a demand the United Nations has rejected. Troops loyal to Mr. Abdic, along with armed Serbs from Croatia, are also barring relief convoys from some of the safest roads, forcing them to take more perilous routes.
The impunity with which Serbs have crossed from areas under United Nations protection in Croatia to join in fighting against Bosnian Government forces has also angered the Croatian Government. Last month Croatia asked United Nations forces to leave its territory, arguing that the peacekeepers were only making life easier for Croatian Serbs and thereby enabling them to defy both the Croatian and Bosnian governments.
Today the Security Council formally called on Croatia to reconsider its request. Many diplomats here fear that the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Croatia will lead to a widening of war in the former Yugoslavia. Reports that helicopters may be ferrying arms for coming battles have only deepened such concern.
"We're in a very ironic situation," Mr. Holbrooke said on Monday. "Things have not been as peaceful in the Balkans in years as they are today, and yet we are one spark away from a much wider war, and that spark could come in either Croatia or Bosnia."

HEADLINE: The New Volunteers -- A special report.;
Program With 60's Spirit Butts Against 95's

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 1

 BODY:
On New Year's Eve, Kerri Goncher packed up her 1987 Toyota Supra in Chicago and drove here in 34 hours straight to begin teaching the severely emotionally disturbed and sometimes violent children who end up at the Little Canyon Center run by the Arizona Baptist Children's Services. She will earn $4.50 an hour plus an annual $4,725 educational grant.
Ms. Goncher's bouncy enthusiasm for a low-wage public service job may be just what President Clinton had in mind for the Americorps public service program.
In its first five months of operation, the program has placed 20,000 Americans like Ms. Goncher, a recent University of Wisconsin graduate who hopes to become a teacher, in a wide variety of public service jobs tutoring children, serving as police cadets, repairing housing projects and monitoring contamination of rivers in 350 programs around the country. 
 Mr. Clinton has hailed the program as perhaps his proudest achievement and one that is already "changing the way that government works." In his proposed budget for the fiscal year 1996, he is asking $812.5 million out of a $1.6 trillion budget to finance 47,000 Americorps members.
Congressional Republicans are threatening to kill Americorps, calling it a costly throwback to an era of big government. Some say that it will make it harder to recruit volunteers without incentives and that it is unnecessary because many participants will just get government assistance to do what they would have done anyway.
And instead of Mr. Clinton's hope that Americorps would evoke the spirit of the Kennedy years, when the Peace Corps drew instinctive support, Americorps has come to reflect the opposite: the anti-government ethic and budget roadblocks now facing almost any new Federal program.
With its self-consciously businesslike name as the Corporation for National Service, its bottom-up structure controlled by state commissions appointed by mostly Republican governors, and its scaled-down stipend, the program was designed as a public service program for an anti-government era.
"I like to think of our role as an investment banker investing in local communities, rewarding the programs doing well with growth possibilities and making sure those not working are not refunded," said Eli Segal, who heads the program and has the title of chief executive. "This is a like a start-up business, designed with the support of moderate Republicans, which believes that delivery systems as close as possible to the customer will bear fruit in terms of quality."
But, businesslike oratory aside, Congressional Republicans say Americorps is just another government program at a time the nation needs fewer of them.
"If you're going to get to a balanced budget and your choice is having a nice little government bureaucracy that runs people around the country doing nice things or taking care of people with severe disabilities," Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, said in a recent interview, "where is each one on the priority list?
"It just strikes me that on any reasonable list that gets to a balanced budget, this is a long way below the line of what doesn't survive."
In his Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton advertised his proposal for a national service program as a way to help students pay for their education while serving their country and being imbued with the spirit of service to others. Interviews with Americorps members and organizations that employ them indicate that the program is already creating extraordinary interest among young people and tapping into a nascent spirit of public service on college campuses.
But they also indicate that it could be difficult for the program to meet the most exacting standards for selfless activism that some will hold it to and that the timing of the program could not be worse, given the budget realities in Washington.
"I really think that as long as the government is going to play some role, this is the best way they can do it, and that you can use a program like this to jump start a lot of positive activity for very little money," said H. Daniels Duncan, president of the United Way in nearby Mesa, where six Americorps workers are putting together what organizers hope will be a network of 3,000 community volunteer workers. "The issue is, Is a little money too much money right now?"
 
The Beginning
A Network Of Activists

Americorps formally began last September with a $376 million budget for 20,000 participants. The budget for the fiscal year 1995 is $580 million for 33,000 members.
Participants receive a small living allowance, approximately the minimum wage, limited health care coverage and child care, plus a $4,725 tuition grant for each year of service -- about 1,700 hours of work. People can serve for two years and get a maximum tuition grant of $9,450, which can be used for current or future college costs or to repay existing loans.
Americorps incorporates some existing programs like Vista. It is separate from the Job Corps, which provides job training ever year for about 65,000 disadvantaged young people.
Americorps is producing an enormous variety of public service work, much of it historical social service activity, some of it reflecting current conservative trends.
In New Orleans, the Youth Action Corps founded by Americorps works on projects as diverse as wetlands preservation and tutoring in low-income areas. The South Carolina Victim Assistance Network works with crime victims and advocates for victims rights in law-enforcement centers, shelters and crisis centers around the state.
At what is called the SalmonCore program, students from the Yakima Indian Nation in Washington State are cleaning out polluted settling ponds at a former Department of Energy site to grow fish to help replenish the dwindling salmon run in the Columbia River.
In the New York area, activities include tutoring and mentoring disadvantaged young people through the I Have A Dream Foundation and working as cadets in the Police Cadet Program of the New York City Police Department.
In Iowa, Sarah and Rebekah Swan, 19-year-old twins, are members, Sarah working at a Family Violence Center in Des Moines, Rebekah at the Alzheimers Association of America in Cedar Rapids.
Donald Davis, 45, a carpenter and painter, decided after 14 years in the Army that he wanted to work with young people. He is now working at two elementary schools in Florence, S.C., organizing social service projects for youngsters.
Michael Davis, a student at Eastern Michigan University, and Michelle Cooper, a student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, tutor as part of the program. In Boulder, Colo., Pakou Cha, a University of Colorado student who speaks Hmong, Spanish and English, tutors children, many of whom speak little or no English, at the San Juan del Centro Family Learning Center.
The program's goal has been to provide opportunities for as diverse a group as possible, from the Ivy League graduates who once might have joined the Peace Corps to high school dropouts working on their general equivalency degree and trying to stay out of trouble.
"I had thought of being an architect, but it was like a fading dream," said Timothy Moore, an 18-year-old high school dropout and former gang member in New Orleans. "Americorps really changed my life. It gave me good things to think about."
 
The Mechanics
Conservatism And Public Service

The program in Arizona reflects Americorp's structure and scope -- from working on environmental issues with Navajo elders to passing out condoms and pamphlets about sexually transmitted diseases in Tucson's red-light district.
Programs are selected by a 25-member board appointed by Gov. Fife Symington, a conservative Republican, and headed by Lieut. Col. Gary Smith, who works in the anti-drug program of the National Guard.
Most participants, like Ms. Goncher, augment existing operations. The most ambitious new project spawned by Americorps is the Border Volunteer Corps, a $2.6 million program with 103 Americorps members working in 25 projects along the border.
Richard H. Carter, the program's director, said, "There is a new park now, immunized children, trained migrant farm workers, people working in environmental programs, community gardens, new homes in the Indian nations, restored homes."
But Republican critics in Washington say that its incentives will draw people from other volunteer activity, that it is more expensive than the government is saying and that in the end it is not true volunteerism but a government job.
"All those volunteer programs that have been working so beautifully cannot compete with this type of program," said Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who is the new head of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. "You really kill volunteerism with a program like this."
Social service organizations here and elsewhere scoff at the idea that Americorps will have a negative impact on volunteerism.
"We've had a lot of volunteers, but most don't last more than a day or two," said Maggi Castagna, education coordinator at Little Canyon Center, which has about 36 emotionally disturbed students ranging in age from 6 to 17, and where Ms. Goncher augments the three teachers and three technicians. "They just find that these kids are out of their league."
On the other hand, it is less clear how much Americorps is creating new public service workers and how much it is just creating a more attractive environment for people who would be doing similar work.
In Arizona, Jennifer Larkin, 25, was holding down three part-time positions with the Y.M.C.A., working with children before and after school and in the 118-degree heat at summer camp. "I really felt I was being used," she said.
Now she gets her health care covered and the educational grant helping to organize volunteer programs for Parents Anonymous, which works to prevent child abuse and neglect.
Dorothy Cuppernell, 20, whose husband is with the United States Army in South Korea, originally got into the Americorps program in North Carolina because it was one of the few options available to a young mother that provided day care.
She said her first position was at a school where she barely felt needed. Now, in Phoenix, she is at Tumbleweed, a small social service agency that runs shelters and group homes for teen-age runaways. And the program pays $75 of the $99-a-week child care cost for her 3-year-old daughter.
Barbara Tenes, 27, who works at another Tumbleweed shelter, was previously a youth-care worker for another social service agency and joined Americorps partly because of the opportunity for child care for her four children. Americorps has a maximum amount it will pay for child care and she is still waiting to find out how much the state will pick up to see if she can afford to stay in the program.
"I'm doing basically what I was doing before," she said.
The majority of Americorps members are young people without children or with minimal interest in health insurance.
"There's not enough money in this to do it unless you really want to serve," Ms. Goncher said.
But, in the current budget-cutting environment, critics say, it is likely that unless the program can document that it is increasing the volunteer pool, it could run into problems in Congress.
 
The Future
Productivity Vs. Priorities

Americorps' future may depend at least as much on how people in power view government as how they view the program.
Mr. Gingrich says he has no great criticisms with the way the program has been run, but he still thinks it is not needed.
"I'm glad that Americorps vaguely resembles the Peace Corps," he said. "I'm willing to bet money 20 years from now it won't. If you looked at HUD, at the Model Cities Program, the Appalachian Commission, you'll find they will gradually be politicized, they will have a few scandals, they will then adopt more rules and regulations, and presently they will be a mess."
So far almost all the criticism of the program has come from Washington. In the states and among those in academia who study volunteerism, there is general agreement that the Federal Government can play a positive role in fostering public service and volunteerism and that the current moment is a propitious one for doing it.
Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College of Columbia University, who has studied volunteerism on campus, said the nation was seeing a resurgence of public service on campuses and that a recent study showed that 64 percent of college students took part in some form of public service.
What is needed, Dr. Levine said, are structures and incentives that allow that service to be sustained. In its ability to foster a broad-based ethic of community service, he said, Americorps is admirable and right for the times.
"The last Administration talked about a thousand points of light," Dr. Levine said, "but that hasn't produced the kinds of programs that America needs. This is real, it's tangible, it's worth doing well.
"This isn't recruitment for national activity. It's making things better at the local level, which seems consistent with everything that's happening in the country."
Whether it is consistent with current budget realities is another issue.
"Show me the priority list that keeps this alive and show me what what you kill in order to keep this alive," Mr. Gingrich said. "The President's answer is, 'Don't have a balanced budget, and your grandchildren will be glad that you borrowed the money from them to do this in your lifetime.'
"I think, frankly, that's wrong."

HEADLINE: District of Columbia Cuts Business Taxes Over Mayor's Protest

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
One day after learning that the city, amid a financial crisis, had maintained the appearance of having a balanced budget only through accounting tricks, the Washington City Council voted to give businesses a $ 41 million tax cut on commercial and residential property.
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. reacted immediately, attacking the bill as "unconscionable" and vowing to veto the measure, which passed on a 7-to-5 vote. 
 The action comes shortly after the Mayor proposed ceding significant parts of city government responsibilities, including the public welfare, court and corrections systems, to the Federal Government in order to reduce a projected $ 722 million deficit in the budget.
It also comes hard on the heels of a statement by the city's chief financial officer, Robert Pohlman, that the municipal government balanced its budget for the last three years only through accounting sleight of hand, according to an article in today's Washington Post.
Mr. Pohlman said the maneuvers used during the administration of former Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly included counting 15 months of income as coming within one budget year and carrying uncollectable debts as loans.
Mr. Pohlman, who also was a ranking member of the financial staff for Ms. Kelly, said all the individual policies he mentioned had been disclosed as they were used.
However, he said that as a whole they had undermined the city's financial status, leaving it with a debt that will cost it more than $ 60 million in interest this year.
He added that the actions could have been useful if they had won the city time to bring its spending under control. But, he said, no management controls were started to stop the spending.
In attacking the business tax cut, Mr. Barry, who has typically enjoyed a good relationship with business in the city, criticized business people for pushing for the rebate in the current financial crisis.
"The business community, which is a very important community and I support that community, wants to contribute nothing," he said. "The citizens in Washington are going to contribute and have services reduced by $ 224 million."
But business leaders praised the bill's passage.
"The Council woke up today to the economic reality that tax increases kill job growth," said John McDaniel, chairman of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. "For the future of the region, let's hope that this is the start of a new trend."
Councilman Harold Brazil, the bill's proponent, said the Mayor could make further cuts in spending and employees to restore the money the city would lose.
But Mr. Barry said the city had cut all it could, and the bill's passage effectively added $ 41 million to the deficit.
In another effort to deal with the financial situation, Mr. Barry said he would support a Council member's bill to create a financial review board that would develop a four-year financial plan to guide the city out of its budget morass.
The review board would have no taxing authority, the Mayor said, but it would review the city's annual budget.
"This is a way for us to get ahead of our finances," said the Council member, Kevin Chavous.
The seven-member panel would consist of two mayoral appointees, two appointed by the Council and one each by the district's delegate to Congress and the two chairmen of House committees that oversee city affairs, Mr. Barry said.

HEADLINE: Hard Queries For Director About Savings In the Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton's budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, was besieged today with questions from members of Congress in both parties who wanted to know why Mr. Clinton had not proposed more substantial measures to reduce the Federal budget deficit or to control the growth of benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Ms. Rivlin argued within the Administration for more aggressive steps to reduce the deficit, but she defended the President's new budget request in testimony today before the House Budget Committee. 
 She said it would have served "no useful purpose" for the Administration to propose specific ways of saving money in Medicare. "As a tactical matter," she said, "it seemed more advisable to work with Congress" on a bipartisan approach.
Representative Wayne Allard, Republican of Colorado, called Mr. Clinton's request "a status quo budget." Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said: "This is a very timid budget. The President has abdicated his leadership responsibility and said to Congress, 'You do the job.' We will."
Democratic Representatives like Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, Bill Orton of Utah and Glen Browder of Alabama joined the Republicans in criticizing the President's budget on the ground that it did not do enough to reduce the deficit. Under Mr. Clinton's request, the deficit would rise to $196.7 billion next year, from the $192.5 billion projected for this year and it would remain around $190 billion a year through 2005.
That is substantially less than the record deficit of $290 billion in 1992, but it falls far short of the commitment made by Mr. Clinton as a Presidential candidate. In his campaign book, "Putting People First," Mr. Clinton said his economic plan would "cut the deficit in half within four years and assure that it continues to fall each year after that."
Some Republicans, like some moderate Democrats, said they placed a higher priority on deficit reduction than on strict party loyalty. They said that to prevent big increases in the deficit, they would consider scaling back the tax cuts proposed in the party's election manifesto, the Contract With America.
Representative David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio, said, "More important than a tax cut is to get the deficit under control." He said the size of the tax cut might need to be re-examined. And he asserted that Ms. Rivlin "obviously isn't excited" about the budget she was defending. "It was hard for her to defend," Mr. Hobson said. "Her heart is not in it."
Republicans pointed out that the deficits envisioned in Mr. Clinton's budget would require the Treasury to borrow large amounts of money. Government debt held by the public would rise to $4.8 trillion in the year 2000, up from $3.4 trillion last year, and interest payments on that debt would rise 53 percent, to $310 billion in 2000 from $203 billion last year.
Ms. Rivlin said that Federal spending should not exceed Federal receipts over the course of a business cycle, but she opposed rigid requirements to balance the budget every year. "It would be self-defeating to get to balance by cutting the public investment we need to make the economy grow faster," she said.

HEADLINE: In America;
Marina Madness In Jersey

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Soon after winning election on a promise to cut taxes, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey asked the public to submit ideas on how she could cut spending. A real estate broker suggested she unload the state-owned marinas, which offer picnic and recreation areas and low-cost docking facilities for small pleasure boats.
Mrs. Whitman thought that was a great idea and promptly announced that two of the four state marinas would go on the market for $7 million. Besides needing all the cash she could get her hands on to pay for her tax cuts, Mrs. Whitman had a philosophical problem with the marinas. She argued that the state had no business being in a business that competed with private business. 
 A hitch developed when state officials learned that one of the targeted marinas, the Leonardo State Marina on Raritan Bay in Monmouth County, could not legally be sold. Back in 1947, when private owners deeded the marina to the state, they were aware of the possibility that politicians and developers might try to exploit the property. They insisted on a clause that read: "In the event the state will no longer use the marina as a public facility, the marina reverts back to the original deed owners or heirs."
When Larry MacPhee, the grandson of one of the owners, heard that the marina was to be sold, he erupted angrily. "The state is stealing the land from its citizens," he said.
Mrs. Whitman reconsidered. Only one marina would be sold, the Forked River Marina in Ocean County. As it turned out, it would have been wise to reconsider that sale as well.
Despite an aggressive marketing campaign, there was no rush to purchase the marina. By October, Mrs. Whitman's asking price of $7 million for two marinas had tumbled to $1.7 million for one.
Still no takers.
An auction was scheduled for Dec. 15. According to Fred Rudkin, the state's Supervisor of Marina Services, a single bidder showed up just minutes before the auction was to begin. As there were no other buyers in sight, the minimum bid of $900,000 was offered.
"SOLD!" said the State of New Jersey.
"It seemed unusual," Mr. Rudkin noted, "but I've never been involved in one of these before. Most auctions, I always figured you have more than one person."
Workers at the marina were stunned and disbelieving when they heard that the facility had gone so cheaply. In fact, the sale (which will not be finalized for several months) was a much worse deal than they thought. Out of the $900,000 sale price, the state has to pay back $608,000 that had been drawn from a Green Acres fund over the past few years to purchase two additional acres of land for the marina.
The Green Acres program uses money from bond issues to preserve open spaces. When land purchased with Green Acres money is sold to private interests, the original expenditure has to be returned to the fund. The state also determined that even though it is selling the marina, it will still need to use a maintenance building it put up on the property. According to legislators, the state plans to pay the new owner $279,000 for the use of the building. Thus the net that the state will realize from the sale of its marina is an embarrassing $13,000.
Thirteen thousand dollars! For an entire marina, Mrs. Whitman netted the price of a used Volvo.
Even the $13,000 net, which is the best face you can put on the deal, is not real. Over the past five years, $1.6 million in capital improvements, paid for by taxpayers, were made at the marina. That money, if the sale is finalized, will be lost.
The smoke and mirrors of "Whitmanomics" is starting to haunt New Jersey. The Forked River Marina debacle did not involve huge sums of money, but it is symptomatic of economic policies that are as ineffective as they are incoherent. New Jersey lost 40,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent. Property taxes are surging. And two new analyses of Mrs. Whitman's income tax cuts show that they are weighted heavily in favor of the rich over the middle class.
Mrs. Whitman's example is being followed by Republicans across the country. They come in, they cut taxes willy-nilly, and then their entire budgetary policy becomes a scramble to fill up the gaping holes where the tax revenues used to be.
It's an extremely destructive way to run a government.

HEADLINE: Stop the Dishonest Debate on Social Security;
Dr. Townsend's Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
James Gollin (Op-Ed, Feb. 1) pays tribute to the perspicacity of Dr. Francis E. Townsend without naming him. Truth is, Dr. Townsend's name is usually skipped, even though President Franklin D. Roosevelt acknowledged his role in the passage of the Social Security Act. 
 Among the unsung advantages of Social Security on Mr. Gollin's list are creation of millions of jobs by easing older people out of the work force; and generation of a huge amount of economic activity by the $292 billion in benefits.
On Sept. 30, 1933, Dr. Townsend, a penniless country doctor in Long Beach, Calif., wrote a letter to his hometown newspaper after watching in horror three elderly women rooting through his garbage can. In his letter he outlined what became known as the Townsend Plan, a unique idea to use old-age payments as a Depression buster.
"I suggest," he wrote, "that the national government retire all those who reach (the age) of 60 on a monthly pension of $200, on condition they spend the money as they get it."
In an economy with 25 percent unemployment, he figured this would create 12 million jobs for younger workers and circulate "two to three billion in fresh money each month."
In less than two years Dr. Townsend's letter had erupted into a club membership of almost three million. The club was powerful enough to attract harsh criticism from leading economists, including Paul Douglas (later a Senator) and even Winston Churchill, who observed archly in Colliers magazine: "The Townsend Plan is an attempt to mint the moonlight into silver and coin the sunshine into gold."
In August 1935 Congress hurriedly passed the Social Security bill proposed by F.D.R. It was the Townsend Plan on the cheap: $10 a month to people 70 and over.
Frances Perkins, then Secretary of Labor, wrote later that President Roosevelt had told her: "We have to have it. The Congress can't stand the pressure of the Townsend Plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system."
Mr. Gollin validates the two premises in the 60-year-old letter by Dr. Townsend, who has earned one of those slots in history reserved for myopic visionaries whose ideas live long after their creators' names have been forgotten.

HEADLINE: Two Leaders Seek Laurels Along Peru-Ecuador Border

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Over the last half-century, a border dispute with Peru has inspired Ecuadoreans to produce 500 books on the subject -- about 10 volumes for each of the 48 miles of Amazon jungle now being contested.
So two weeks ago, when President Sixto Duran Ballen ordered troops to resist Peruvian attacks, the 73-year-old leader seemed reborn, invigorated by a burgeoning nationalism. 
 Gone were memories of an infirm politician who spent most of November in a Washington hospital, which prompted his enemies back home to plant stories of his death on local radio stations.
Instead Mr. Duran Ballen could be seen daily on the whitewashed balcony of the Spanish-colonial Presidential Palace, pumping the air with his right fist, and leading crowds in chants of "Not One Step Back!"
Gone were the tear-gas-tainted memories of opposition to his free-market changes of the last two years -- a national protest by Indians, three general strikes and recurrent strikes by state oil, telephone and electricity workers determined to block sale of their industries to non-state companies.
On Tuesday night, flag-waving crowds welcomed Mr. Duran Ballen home from a diplomatic tour of South America. It was hard to remember that only six weeks ago, "Sixto" dolls were the hottest sellers among the effigies that Ecuadoreans burn on New Year's Eve in a traditional protest against politicians.
"Physically and politically, Sixto has revived," said Benjamin Ortiz Brennan, editor of Hoy, an influential newspaper. "At the beginning of December it seemed that he was going to die or resign. But Ecuador is a nation wounded in its dignity. It is a nation with a defeat complex."
On Tuesday night, a $500 million war-tax bill sailed through Ecuador's Congress, normally one of Latin America's most divided legislatures. Controlling only 9 congressional seats out of 77, the President has watched Congress impeach or force the resignation of four Cabinet ministers since September.
With a chance to restore the national honor, few Ecuadoreans worried, at least publicly, that the border conflict between two poor countries is costing each side $10 million a day. From islanders on the Galapagos to Indian tribes in the Amazon, thousands of Ecuadoreans suddenly have been unified by the challenge of redeeming national honor.
Standing up to Peru seems to offer collective therapy for the national psychic damage caused by the loss of half of Ecuador's territory to Peru in a 1941 war. Though only a small fraction of this nation of 11 million people is old enough to actually remember the war, it still resonates in this normally placid nation.
Over the last two years Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, has visited Ecuador three times in an effort to mend fences. But the idea of Mr. Duran Ballen making the two-hour flight to Lima became such a traumatic issue that one congressman proposed a national referendum on the issue.
In March Peru's Ambassador to Ecuador was nearly expelled. His error? He commissioned an opinion poll on the border question, which showed that about half the Ecuadoreans thought Ecuador should end the conflict through negotiations.
"This poll and the Ambassador's comments are unacceptable interference by a foreign diplomat in the internal affairs of a country," Ecuador's Foreign Ministry declared.
Today, having bathed in the nationalist fountain of youth, Mr. Duran Ballen may now be its political prisoner. Across the border, President Fujimori is equally determined to declare victory and is seeking re-election in two months.
There are some parallels with South America's last border war, which began when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982.
Although Ecuador has cut inflation in half and has increased economic growth, a battlefield defeat could cut short Mr. Duran Ballen's mandate and shake Ecuador's 15-year-old democracy.
"If Ecuador is defeated, it would be disastrous," an Ecuadorean journalist said. "Sixto would not be able to survive the Galtieri effect," a reference to the resignation and brief imprisonment of Argentina's President, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, after Britain triumphed in the Falklands. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Peace Talks to Resume
 BRASILIA, Feb. 8 (Reuters) -- Ecuador and Peru will resume talks to end their border conflict with the help of three Latin American countries and the United States, the Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister, Jose Ponce Vivanco, said today.
Mr. Ponce told reporters that Argentina, Brazil and Chile had agreed to send high-level diplomats to a new round of talks, in Brasilia. The United States will be represented by its Ambassador in Brazil, he said.
 Mr. Ponce said the diplomats would be arriving in Brasilia tonight and Thursday and talks would begin immediately. Face-to-face talks between Ecuador and Peru broke down on Sunday after six days of negotiations when Ecuador requested more time to study a cease-fire proposal put forward by mediators.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Banks: A Weak Link in the Rescue Plan

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Even with an international rescue plan worth about $50 billion in place, Mexico's efforts to revive the economy appear threatened by the nation's weakened banking system.
Before the peso was devalued on Dec. 20, Mexican banks were already burdened with too many bad loans and too little in capital reserves. Now with the peso worth 36 percent less against the dollar than it was seven weeks ago, many Mexican companies are faced with loan payments they cannot meet. 
 If they were to default on their loans, the banks would not have enough money left to help the nation's industries expand exports and help generate sufficient economic growth to sustain a recovery.
And if weaker banks went under, the Government would have to prop up the banking system. The result, some analysts say, is that Mexico's recession could worsen and the current-account deficit could grow, despite the financial-assistance plan announced last week in Washington.
"The weak links in this whole chain of support for the economy are the Mexican banks," said Chip Brown, an analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. "We just don't know how capable they are of meeting their obligations."
The decline of the Mexican peso from 28.9 cents on Dec. 20 to a little over 18.4 cents today has made it harder for businesses, homeowners and farmers to make loan payments. And the bank portfolios of overdue loans have expanded ominously, according to Government reports and analysts' studies.
Another problem looming for the banks involves $8 billion in certificates of deposit, redeemable in dollars, that are about to fall due. Analysts think that many of the investors -- including Americans -- who hold the certificates will pull their money out of this country, leaving the banks even shorter on funds.
With some frightened investors already putting their money elsewhere, financial analysts fear that the banks will have increasing trouble retaining enough funds to meet the Government's minimum requirement that capital equal 8 percent of assets. And, in a country where the rate of savings is even lower than in the United States, a recession from the peso's devaluation would leave many Mexicans with even less to save.
Industrial and other companies serving a shrinking domestic market would not give banks much new loan business, and some banks would struggle just to stay solvent. A number of banks already hard pressed to meet the capital-to-assets requirement have been so weakened by the peso crisis that banking analysts and Government officials doubt they can survive more difficult times ahead.
A study of Mexican banks prepared by Moody's Investors Service concluded last month that the peso's devaluation would "accentuate pre-existing weaknesses -- in particular, very poor asset quality and very poor reserve coverage," while also limiting the banks' ability "to withstand deregulation and increased competition."
The largest banks -- Banamex, Bancomer and Serfin -- are considered too well established to fail, though they have also been hurt by the peso's devaluation, analysts say. But many smaller ones are on the edge. Banpais, Mercantil Probursa and Bancrecer are viewed as particularly weak.
Last month, the Government rushed through two laws to prevent a widespread collapse in the banking system. One lets troubled banks increase their capital by selling bonds that can be converted into shares.
The Bank Protection Fund, a Government program supported by monthly payments from the banks, announced that it would buy such bonds. Government officials insist this is not intended as a step toward renationalization of the banks.
The second new law allows foreign banks to gain 100 percent control of existing Mexican banks. Financial analysts expect American and Spanish banks already established here, like Citibank and Banco Santander, to bid for some of the troubled Mexican financial institutions.
Last October, the Government allowed 18 foreign banks, half of them from the United States, to set up in Mexico. The prospect of American bankers controlling Mexican capital has raised nationalist protests, but Government officials say that Mexico cannot recover from its financial crisis without an infusion of capital. Even Mexican bankers acknowledge that the damage to their industry has been so great that there may be few alternatives but to allow foreigners into the country.
"It is preferable to have a national bank managed efficiently by foreigners," Ricardo Guajardo Touche, the director of Bancomer, said recently, "than to have a national bank managed by Mexicans but inefficiently."
That was a rare public statement by a Mexican banker acknowledging any sense of crisis. The Mexican Government has established a regulatory system that is considered tougher than those of countries like Venezuela, where 19 banks in trouble were recently nationalized, but analysts and economists here say it is nearly impossible to get the banks to openly discuss their condition.
Previous currency devaluations also strained the Mexican banking system. After a devaluation in 1982, the President at the time, Jose Lopez Portillo, accused bankers of pulling billions of dollars out of Mexico and plunging the nation into economic chaos. Without warning, he nationalized all banks except Citibank, which continued to operate independently.
A decade later, the Government sold the banks back to private investors, who for the most part were not bankers but industrialists, stock market investors and speculators. A Mexican shrimp exporter, Carlos Cabal Peniche, ended up owning two of the banks. Last September, he was charged with fraudulently lending himself $700 million of the banks' money, and has been hiding from the authorities since.
As the nation's economy slowed down in 1993 and the first half of 1994, Mexican banks were hit by a large increase in the number of loans that fell past due. According to documents from the National Banking Commission, Banpais saw its portfolio of overdue loans increase 150 percent last year.
Requests for representatives of the Mexican banks to discuss their problems were rebuffed. Jose Ortiz Izquierdo Cruz, a spokesman for Banamex, the country's largest bank, said, "There is no one in the bank who can talk to the newspapers or give any information."
Several attempts to reach the president of the Association of Mexican Bankers, Jose Madariaga Lomelin, were also unsuccessful. A statement provided from one of the association's vice presidents, Antonio Del Valle, called the current situation "supremely positive."
An American banker working in Mexico, who asked not to be identified by name, explained that Mexican bankers feared that talking too much about weaknesses in the system would make such problems inevitable. "If responsible people don't want it to happen, a run on deposits won't happen," he said.
Cynthia A. Harlow, a vice president of CS First Boston in New York, said the situation in Mexican banks was quite serious. "The degree to which we see a severe crisis depends on how long interest rates stay at current levels," she said.
Mexico's key overnight interest rate between banks, which was 10 percent in January 1994, has soared to more than 50 percent now, taking most other rates with it. Credit-card issuers charge more than 80 percent annual interest, while variable-rate mortgages -- nearly all mortgages in Mexico -- can top 40 percent.
A senior Mexican official said that the first banks likely to be sold were Banco Union and Banca Cremi, which had been owned by Mr. Cabal Peniche and are now being run by Government administrators. Several smaller regional banks also look likely to be acquired by larger Mexican or foreign banks. Banco Santander is known to be interested in entering retail banking here.
An American banker here said that several American institutions had expressed interest in the smaller banks, but that he did not expect to see "anybody rushing to do it in the next month."

HEADLINE: Germans, Too, May Trim Public TV

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Most politicians have a love-hate relationship with television, loving it when it fawns and hating it when it sneers. Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to be tilting toward the latter.
For days now, Germany's political debate has been speckled with the fallout from Mr. Kohl's threat to curb the public television network, which has become a vast institution since it was set up by the Western allies after World War II but which has been losing viewers lately as commercial stations have grown. 
 Such has been the furor in Germany that one critic has labeled the Chancellor "Berluskohl," drawing a comparison to the attempts by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy to control the public broadcasting systems that compete with his own private networks.
As in other European countries, Government-supported television has dominated the airwaves in Germany, and privately owned stations have begun to grow only since the mid-1980's.
From a wider perspective, the debate seems part of the soul-searching in the United States as well as in Europe over the role of publicly financed television in a rough-and-tumble era of free-market values, galloping technological advance and competition with growing private networks.
Just last weekend, John Birt, the director general of the venerable British Broadcasting Corporation, publicly challenged British television and other journalists to re-examine their professional ethics. The European Union in Brussels is in the middle of a heated discussion over regulations governing the ownership of commercial television. And in the United States, the new Republican leadership in Congress has raised the possibility of curbing publicly supported broadcasting.
In Germany, the issue came to a boil when Mr. Kohl's close relationship with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia became the butt of satire on the Cologne-based West German Broadcasting, the biggest and most powerful of the 11 separate, publicly financed stations in Germany's federal states that are grouped together in the ARD network, widely known as the First Channel.
An angry Mr. Kohl supported calls for an overhaul of the bloated and supposedly independent First Channel, whose staff totals 24,000 people. The network is financed in part by advertising and in part by the $15 compulsory license fees that Germans pay every month if they own a television set. Five of the 11 member stations lose money and are supported by the six others.
The network is widely held to be both corrupt -- with freelancers complaining that they must bribe officials to get work -- and, as in Italy, closely tied to the political parties that govern the states where the individual stations are based.
The Cologne station, for instance, is seen as close to the opposition Social Democrats. Adversaries of the left-leaning Radio Bremen station call it Radio Hanoi. Most of the criticism is coming from the only two German states run by Mr. Kohl's allies -- his Christian Democrats in Saxony and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria.
The Chancellor's attack, however, unleashed a flurry of other concerns over freedom of information, the future political slant of public broadcasting and the financial prospects of private television. Germany's advertising market is Europe's biggest, worth some $3.2 billion a year. It has drawn in major publishing houses, including the conservative Springer group, as owners of private stations.
One of the biggest private networks, Sat-1, is run by a Bavarian, Leo Kirch, who is a friend of Mr. Kohl.
The commercial stations, moreover, have generally been friendlier to Mr. Kohl than the Cologne station and some of the others in the public network, which he and his allies accuse of wielding disproportionate political influence. The Cologne station earns more in license fees than any other First Channel station, makes a quarter of all the programs shown nationally on the network and produces one-third of its political documentaries.
"What makes the Chancellor mad is that there is a broadcaster here, namely WDR, that has the nerve to have its own opinions and publishes opinions that are not identical with the Chancellor's," said Friedrich Nowottny, the director of the Cologne affiliate. The station took Mr. Kohl to task for his stand on the Chechnya crisis, implying that his response was too feeble and concerned only with public relations.
Michael Glockner, a spokesman for the small Radio Bremen station, said, "the whole issue is about political control and influence" over the network.
Mr. Kohl contends instead that the issue is economic, and he has supported the position of the two principal crusaders against the public network, Prime Ministers Kurt Biedenkopf of Saxony and Edmund Stoiber of Bavaria. They threatened to pull their stations out of the network unless the system is reformed to save money and to reduce the number of stations in the network, thereby possibly rooting out some of its most troublesome components.
The idea of saving money strikes a chord with many Germans who, already laboring under increased taxes to finance German unification, have seen their monthly fees for the public system increase by almost 50 percent over the last seven years.
The percentage of Germans watching the stodgy programming of the two state channels has fallen to less than one-half since the inception of private broadcasting 10 years ago.
Advertising is another central issue. By law, neither public network may run advertisements after 8 P.M., while the private channels face no such restrictions.
In supporting a reform of the working group, Mr. Kohl has opposed both more advertising on the publicly financed channels and higher fees for viewers, meaning that the squeeze would be on the network to cut personnel and the number of regional stations.
At the back of most politicians' minds is the effort to frame a new law to govern the ownership of private television, which might end the current limit of 49.9 percent on a company's stake in a private television station.
Once a new law is enacted, many commentators expect private television to proliferate as publicly financed television recedes, heralding a new era of market-driven choices for German television viewers.

HEADLINE: Some Familiar Faces Return to Power in Panama

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Ernesto Perez Balladares took office here last September promising to "close the Noriega chapter" of Panamanian history. But his first five months as President have witnessed a systematic rehabilitation of dozens of figures from the 20 years of corruption and brutal military rule that preceded the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega by American troops in 1989.
At the same time, Mr. Perez Balladares, an American-educated banker and economist popularly known as El Toro, for his burly build and aggressiveness, has not hesitated to tweak the United States when there is political gain to be had. The message is clear: the Democratic Revolutionary Party, founded by Gen. Omar Torrijos as the political arm of the Panamanian military and inherited by General Noriega, is back in power and intent on settling old scores. 
 As his Housing Minister, Mr. Perez Balladares chose a doctor who has been accused by human rights and medical groups of aiding soldiers who tortured political prisoners. One former military officer nicknamed Captain Blood has been put in charge of a prison, while others with what diplomats delicately call "checkered pasts" have been given jobs as ambassadors or as advisers to Government officials.
"In some respects, it has been a return to the good old days," said one Latin American diplomat here. "You don't see the brutality of the Noriega era, but El Toro has had to make many appointments to satisfy the P.R.D.'s political base."
Shortly after taking office, Mr. Perez Balladares pardoned more than 200 people accused or convicted of crimes ranging from corruption to the murder of an American teacher on the night of the 1989 invasion, saying they were victims of political persecution. Those who benefited included General Noriega's puppet President, the head of the chief paramilitary group of the Noriega period and a colonel who led a coup attempt in 1990, as well as Mr. Perez Balladares' own first Vice President, Tomas Altamirano Duque.
Gerardo Gonzalez, president of the governing party and a member of the National Assembly, defended the President's actions, saying they were a necessary step toward "national reconciliation and harmony" and noting that several members of opposition groups had also benefitted from the amnesty decree.
"We are trying to normalize the situation without falling into the trap of new persecutions," Mr. Gonzalez said, adding there are "thousands of people with cases still pending" who should probably also be pardoned.
In its recently published annual report for 1994, however, the Panamanian Human Rights Committee described the amnesty decree as "a measure to favor political associates of those who govern" and that "encourages impunity and impedes the full clarification of responsibilities" for crimes committed in the Noriega era.
Drug trafficking and money laundering also continue to be problems, though diplomats here say the situation has improved markedly since the Noriega era and is probably no worse than it was under Mr. Perez Balladares' predecessor. There are now rules intended to prevent large flows of cash into the country, like the currency declarations all arriving passengers are required to fill out. But Panama's use of the American dollar as its own currency makes it an attractive target for cash-rich cocaine cartels in neighboring Colombia.
When the fifth anniversary of the American invasion came around in December, the new Government decreed a "day of national mourning," staged a re-enactment of the initial attack on the neighborhood of El Chorrillo and ordered Panamanian flags lowered to half-staff. The issue of flags and where they fly has always been an explosive one here, since it was just such a dispute 30 years ago that sparked the riots that led to the negotiation of the Panama Canal Treaties.
By custom, the American military bases from which the attack on Dec. 20, 1989, was launched should also have brought their American flags down to the same level. But irritated American authorities refused to comply, and the standards of the two countries flew in the former Panama Canal Zone at different heights.
Thus far, the United States has not made much of a fuss, at least in public, about the re-emergence of figures from the Noriega era that it once criticized as crooks and thugs. Members of the opposition say that is out of gratitude for Mr. Perez Balladares's decisions to offer temporary safe haven to 8,600 Cubans at the height of last summer's refugee crisis and later to allow Gen. Raoul Cedras to come here as an exile as part of the settlement that restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti.
But the Cuban refugees are now being sent back to the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Panamanian politicians and journalists predict that American skepticism about Mr. Perez Balladares will grow as other issues come to the fore.
Leading the list of problems that could sour the relationship is the case of an American soldier who was killed here in 1992, one day before a visit by President Bush. Based on evidence that included eyewitness testimony, the Panama Government quickly ordered the arrest of three suspects, one of whom was Pedro Miguel Gonzalez, a son of the leader of the ruling party.
The younger Mr. Gonzalez promptly disappeared for the next two-and-a-half years, only surfacing again late last month, when he surrendered directly to Mr. Perez Balladares. An indictment against Mr. Gonzalez and another suspect was unsealed in the United States on Monday, adding to the discomfiture of Mr. Perez Balladares.
The elder Mr. Gonzalez said his son "was arrested only because he was a militant of our party." Opposition leaders predict that the Government will do all it can to assure an acquittal, pointing to the dismissal this week of the prosecutor in the case as a sign of things to come.
The Government has also been unsettled by what is officially described as either a coup attempt or assassination plot against Mr. Perez Balladares in mid-January. More than a dozen low-ranking police officers and former military officers have been arrested in the incident, but their motives remain unclear.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Bid for Journal of Commerce By British Company Is Seen

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The British company that publishes The Economist magazine has offered to buy The Journal of Commerce, the New York-based financial daily, according to people familiar with the details of the offer.
Publishing executives speculated that if the paper was sold by its current owner, Knight-Ridder Inc., it could be a vehicle for a large-scale expansion in the United States by the Economist Newspaper Ltd., the company that owns the widely respected Economist magazine. 
 The Economist's offer for The Journal of Commerce was said to be worth about $90 million to $100 million. After negotiations among senior executives of both companies in recent months, Knight-Ridder was said to have set $130 million as the asking price for the newspaper, whose full name is The Journal of Commerce and Commercial.
The publication has a circulation of about 21,000, so the purchase price would likely be in the range of $5,000 a subscriber. While that would be a very high price, it is not known whether the deal would include other information services related to the newspaper.
Even at that price, the deal could also represent a significant expansion for Pearson P.L.C., which owns 50 percent of the shares of Economist Newspapers. Pearson is the publisher of The Financial Times of London, the salmon-pink chronicle that is considered to be a bible for international financiers.
The Journal of Commerce is a staid 168-year-old publication that focuses largely on international trade and transportation issues. Published five days a week, it has always focused much of its coverage on maritime news, though it has been expanding its scope in recent years.
For many years, executives at Knight-Ridder, one of the country's largest newspaper companies, have toyed with proposals to expand the paper. But it has long been understood that it would take an investment of tens of millions of dollars to compete more aggressively with other American business publications like The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune and Business Week.
The Journal of Commerce has about 70 news employees, people there said, while The Wall Street Journal has a total news staff of about 470 people.
The Economist also owns Roll Call, a twice-weekly newspaper published in Washington.
Spokesmen for Knight-Ridder and Pearson declined to comment when asked about the possible sale yesterday. Marjorie M. Scardino, the chief executive for The Economist in London, was traveling yesterday and could not be reached, her office said.
Don C. Becker, publisher of The Journal of Commerce, did not respond to telephone calls to his office.
The Journal of Commerce could provide a buyer with a springboard for an expansion in the United States, but people familiar with the newspaper said there would be substantial hurdles as well.
The publication is widely respected and is believed to be modestly profitable, but it derives much of its revenue from shipping advertising. A new publisher who tried to broaden the reach of the newspaper, therefore, could risk the loss of a main source of revenue. If shipping companies came to feel that the publication was no longer directed at their industry, for example, they could abandon the newspaper before it established a new advertiser base.
Some newspaper executives, however, said the paper's specialization in world trade could position it to appeal to the kinds of influential readers who buy The Financial Times. Although The Financial Times has American readers, the newspaper's executives have said they have not been able to compete for American advertising because most Financial Times readers are in Britain and Europe, and American advertisers have more efficient ways of reaching financial and business readers in the United States.
Publishing executives say Knight-Ridder has been ambivalent about The Journal of Commerce for a long time. Some analysts have argued that in recent years The Journal of Commerce did not quite fit into any of the businesses that interested corporate executives at Knight-Ridder's headquarters in Miami.
The company has been sharply expanding its various businesses that provide financial information, especially through electronic data services. But most of Knight-Ridder's newspapers are traditional metropolitan dailies, including The Miami Herald, The Detroit Free Press and The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Reports of The Economist's interest in The Journal of Commerce may help solve a recent mystery in New York news media circles. On Jan. 1 Pearson began leasing the famous "zipper" billboard in Times Square in Manhattan. The sign, which displays electronic news headlines, had been leased by Newsday since 1986.

HEADLINE: Suspect in Subway Firebombing Pleads Not Guilty

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
Looking gaunt and hobbling in pain from burns over 40 percent of his body, Edward Leary made his first appearance in a courtroom yesterday and pleaded not guilty in connection with the Dec. 21 subway firebombing that injured him and 47 other people.
The 49-year-old unemployed computer technician from Scotch Plains, N.J., slowly entered the courtroom in sneakers and appeared to have difficulty as he took his seat in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. With a scruffy beard and disheveled appearance, he looked starkly different from the earlier photographs of a healthy-looking, clean-cut man that were taken before the explosion. 
 His lawyer, Stephen J. Murphy, agreed to allow a television cameraman and still photographer in the courtroom to humanize his client. "I felt that it was in his interest," Mr. Murphy said, "that the public see he's not the monster that the police and public officials have portrayed him to be in their initial rush to condemn him."
At the hearing, Mr. Leary was arraigned on a 39-count indictment that charges him with attempted murder, assault, weapons possession and attempted grand larceny, all as part of the Dec. 21 firebombing. The authorities have said that the bombing was part of a scheme to extort money, but that the crude device accidently ignited in Mr. Leary's hands as he carried it on a crowded southbound No. 4 train in the Fulton Street station in lower Manhattan.
The indictment also charges him in connection with a Dec. 15 incident on a subway train in Harlem in which a teen-age girl's backpack suddenly caught fire, injuring her and burning a 13-year-old boy.
As Mr. Leary was appearing in court, five other people who were injured in the blast remained in the burn unit at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said a spokeswoman, Kathy Robinson. A 60-year-old patient, Reufield Edey, who was burned over two-thirds of his body, is still in critical condition, she said.
Mr. Murphy said his client, who has been undergoing skin grafts on the lower part of his body and legs, was still "in a substantial amount of pain."
"This is his first time coming in front of the media, in which he has been vilified," the lawyer said, explaining that Mr. Leary had been nervous before coming to court. "He is a very frail man. He is a very mild man. He's not a violent, aggressive person."
Mr. Leary's wife, who has often spoken publicly in his defense since the bombing, did not appear in court because she was at work, Mr. Murphy said.
Mr. Leary was moved from the New York Hospital to a locked ward at Bellevue Hospital last Friday. After his appearance yesterday, he was transferred to a medical ward on Riker's Island, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the city's Department of Correction.
Mr. Murphy promised in court yesterday to allow the prosecution to take a handwriting sample from Mr. Leary. Prosecutors declined to say why a sample was needed.
The authorities have said that they found six pages of notes in Mr. Leary's house indicating that he planned to detonate bombs with motion-sensing devices and remote controls and to shoot people in the subway system.
But Mr. Murphy has contended that the notes were actually for a science-fiction novel Mr. Leary was planning to write. Yesterday, Mr. Murphy gave more details of the novel, saying it involved "a box that would cost about $ 10 million to $ 12 million, that has to be wheeled into Grand Central station by 6 or 10 people, that has C.I.A. codes in it that can't be broken."
He added that in the novel, the box would be used in a scheme "to help the homeless."
"Also, the box can't go off," Mr. Murphy said in explaining the novel. "That is the theory in the novel. It is a deterrent, not a weapon."
He said the notes were the work of a creative mind, not someone bent on careless destruction. "It shows a much more complex mind than would put two bottles of gasoline" in the subway, he said.
The bespectacled Mr. Leary did not speak during the brief arraignment, instead staring blankly around him.
Mr. Murphy said that while his client was badly hurt in the blast, the most harmful effects had been suffered by the Learys' 9-year old son, whose friends and schoolmates have "made fun of him."

HEADLINE: Directors May Hasten Agee's Departure

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Confronting what is perhaps the worst financial crisis in the company's 82-year history, the directors of Morrison Knudsen Corporation plan to meet here Thursday to debate whether William J. Agee, the chairman and chief executive, should be forced to leave immediately.
Only last week, as the company disclosed that it would report a substantial loss for 1994, it offered a vague timetable for Mr. Agee to leave the company later this year. Its official plan was for a search committee, which includes Mr. Agee, to seek a chief executive officer to lead a turnaround of the giant construction and transit equipment manufacturer. Mr. Agee, who has held his posts since 1988, planned to hold on to the chairmanship until 1998, when he turns 60. 
 But now some members of the board are resisting Mr. Agee's gradual exit. That resistance reflects concern that Mr. Agee has allowed the company's employee morale and business to deteriorate, that he has not kept directors and shareholders adequately informed about its problems and that he has been remiss in attempting to cope with the troubles of the company -- which is based in Boise, Idaho -- from his seaside estate in Pebble Beach, Calif.
"Succession is the key issue, and that has been accelerated," one individual close to the board said. He added that several directors believed that the company must act quickly to reassure its bank lenders and its employees -- "all its constituents, really" -- that new leadership was in place to cope with the emergency.
According to several people close to the board, opposition to Mr. Agee is led by two notable newcomers to the board, William P. Clark, a national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who held the same job under President Jimmy Carter.
Both joined the board last year, and have been known to have pressed Mr. Agee and senior Morrison Knudsen executives for better information about the company's mounting troubles.
A spokesman for Mr. Agee said today that he was not available for interviews.
On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Morrison Knudsen stock closed today at $9.875 a share, unchanged. The stock plummeted 24 percent on Feb. 1 when the company first projected a loss and disclosed Mr. Agee's plans.
At that time Morrison Knudsen also said its financial picture had eroded to the point where it no longer complied with terms set by its banks who have extended more than $300 million in unsecured credit. Its default on those terms gives the banks the right to press for repayment, a demand that the company cannot now meet. Thus its continued access to credit hinges on its ability to persuade its lenders, led by J. P. Morgan & Company, that it is putting its affairs in order.
In addition, for Morrison Knudsen to obtain new business, it must demonstrate sufficient financial strength to obtain the surety bonds that are required of contractors who bid on large construction projects. Bonding companies that issue these bonds guarantee that the company will complete the work it has agreed to do and they therefore must be satisfied that Morrison Knudsen has the financial wherewithal to do so.
Apparently at Mr. Clark's insistence, the New York law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett has been hired to advise the independent directors, and lawyers from the firm will be present at Thursday's meeting. In addition, several directors have informed the board that they have retained individual counsel as the company's troubles have mounted.
The company is already facing lawsuits filed in United States District Court in Boise by five law firms representing shareholders who contend that the company misrepresented its financial health and that of one of its subsidiaries, MK Rail Inc. The company sold a portion of MK Rail, which makes and remanufactures locomotives, to the public last April. After selling initially at $16 a share, the stock closed unchanged today at $9.875 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Clark, reached at his office this evening in Paso Robles, Calif., refused to discuss the agenda for Thursday's session. "Going into such a meeting, it is not appropriate for me to comment," he said.
His board ally and longtime friend, Mr. Brzezinski, also declined to comment on what the board would deal with. However, asked today whether the board still expected Mr. Agee to remain as chairman for up to three more years, Mr. Brzezinski said, "I don't think that is the case." He added, "It is possible that will change, but I don't want to prejudge the board."
If Mr. Agee is forced to leave Morrison Knudsen, it would be his second unceremonious departure from a troubled company. In 1982, after launching a corporate takeover that backfired on him, he left the Bendix Corporation as chairman and chief executive after it was acquired by the Allied Corporation, now Allied Signal Inc.
Among other members of the board are Peter Lynch, the former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund and the chairman of the Morrison Knudsen audit committee; John W. Rogers Jr., the president of Ariel Capital Management, a money management firm in Chicago; Gerard R. Roche, the chairman of the Heidrick & Struggles executive search firm in New York; Robert A. McCabe, the president of the Pilot Capital Corporation in New York, and Irene C. Peden, an accounting professor in Seattle.

HEADLINE: Paris Journal;
Homeless Man Finds Niche: The Cars' Caretaker

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Philippe Hermand wants everyone to know that he is not one of the clochards, the scraggly outcasts who sleep on the streets or under the bridges of the Seine when the river is not overflowing its banks.
"I sleep in the street, but I get up every morning, wash and shave and take care of myself," he said. "I just happen to live in the zone, that's all." 
 "The zone" is limbo, where thousands of men and women have ended up after being forced out of their apartments by rising rents and unemployment, now running over 12 percent in France.
Paris has never been without its clochards. But the Paris municipal authorities estimate that 5,000 to 7,000 homeless people now live on the streets of the capital. Associations for the homeless say there are more, and perhaps as many as 400,000 in the country as a whole.
Mr. Hermand believes the French may be on the verge of a social or political explosion, like the 1968 riots that ultimately brought down de Gaulle.
"If there's a blowup, I'll be out there with them," he said. "But it isn't just France -- it's a worldwide crisis."
Mr. Hermand may be homeless, but he is not faceless. By making himself useful to neighbors fortunate enough to have a roof over their heads, he has even become a little famous.
What he does is help people avoid parking fees, a favorite Parisian pastime. On the Rue de Sontay in the fashionable 16th arrondissement, where he lives, people can park legally only two hours a day between 9 A.M. and 7 P.M.; their cars are required to display recent parking receipts for 10 francs, or about $2, an hour, obtainable from dispensers midway down the block.
Needless to say, Parisians will do almost anything to avoid paying. They will even give their car keys to Mr. Hermand, 48, a former convict who served 13 1/2 years for armed robbery before he landed on the street four and a half years ago.
He invented the job himself, keeping one step ahead of the parking agents who swoop down on the block three or four times a day. The agents are called "contractuels" because they are not police officers but civilians paid by the city to make sure the parking fees are paid, and they are about as well liked as tax inspectors.
So Mr. Hermand is constantly on the move, a short figure dressed in black, with a Chicago Bulls cap and headphones he uses to listen to Diana Ross as he runs up and down the street slipping meter receipts under the windshield wipers just before the ticketers get there.
"I made the mistake on a rainy day just after New Year's of thinking that they wouldn't come, and all the cars got a fine," he said. He told residents that the $15 tickets were a little New Year's present for the city, but promised not to let his guard down again.
"The people here on the street are family to me," he said, "and if your car is towed away it's an 800-franc fine," or $160.
Mr. Hermand lives off the tips his well-dressed and well-housed middle-class neighbors pass on to him.
"I'd miss him if he left," said Jean Clavero, a cobbler who lets Mr. Hermand bathe and shave in his shop every morning. "He brings me my coffee every day."
Robert Giovannoni, a physical therapist who met him in the cafe that Mr. Hermand uses as his office, said he had treated him for broken bones in one hand suffered in a fight with a car thief.
"If we had more guys like him, the streets would be a little safer," Mr. Giovannoni said, "But I wouldn't give him my car keys -- he used to be a stunt driver," he joked. .
Mr. Hermand said he had been looking desperately for a room to rent ever since one of his parking clients offered to pay his rent for a year. "I can't find anyone who'll rent to me," he said, "even though I know there are rooms available. It's really a war between us and society."
Philippe Chavance, co-founder of a tenants' rights group, called Right to Housing, said the housing market in Paris was in a crisis, with rents having risen faster since they were deregulated in 1986 than incomes have. High unemployment even leaves some middle-class families unable to afford housing, he noted.
The tenants' group recently occupied a former school in the Rue du Dragon on the Left Bank that a developer wanted to turn into luxury apartments.
"We have been trying to get the city administration to recognize that when there are people living in the streets at the same time as there are apartment owners hanging onto vacant apartments they don't want to sell, there is a housing crisis," Mr. Chavance said.
With France now in a presidential election campaign, the homeless problem is as political as unemployment is. The Rue du Dragon occupation has attracted much attention from people eager to embarrass Mayor Jacques Chirac, who is one of the candidates.
The tenants' group claimed victory when Mayor Chirac finally requisitioned several hundred vacant apartments for the homeless, promising the owners to find other housing for them if the buildings were renovated.
But there is widespread public cynicism about whether the candidates, now led in public opinion polls by the conservative Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, will do anything meaningful about the homeless problem after the elections this spring.
"Politicians are all no good," Mr. Hermand said. "In this life, you have to fend for yourself."

HEADLINE: Ketchum Inc. Has Plan To Close Later This Year

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Ketchum Inc., for many years the nation's largest fund-raising counseling company, has begun to wind down operations and will close later this year, Robert Carter, its president, said last night.
"While we are fully booked with fund-raising commitments throughout the country, the firm's inability to make a reasonable profit in the foreseeable future made this difficult decision a prudent business move," Mr. Carter said. Word of the company's plan began circulating in fund-raising circles yesterday after it started notifying clients that it would fulfill its contracts but would not extend them. 
 Ketchum Communications, the worldwide advertising and public relations group that was spun off from the fund-raising operation years ago, will not be affected by Ketchum Inc.'s closing. A related partnership, Ketchum Canada Inc., will also be unaffected, Mr. Carter said.
Mr. Carter said the company, which is privately held and based in Pittsburgh, fell victim to a failed expansion into Britain, too much debt resulting from a 1986 purchase of a Pittsburgh office building and a slowdown in fund-raising drives by nonprofit hospitals unsure about the future of health-care financing.
He said the company was also hurt by its emphasis on full-time employees, instead of consultants paid by the project. Ketchum Inc. has 70 employees, down from 200 employees five years ago, in Pittsburgh, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and other cities.
The decision to close Ketchum Inc. comes at a time of intense competition for charitable dollars. Data gathered by the National Center for Charitable Statistics indicate total giving, adjusted for inflation, has been declining since 1989.
In campaigns for major gifts "the market has matured and many, many colleges and hospitals and other institutions that in the early days hired a firm like Ketchum and paid them a healthy retainer to have a manager on-site for a year or two years now have their own staff to run their campaigns," said Russ Reid, president of Russ Reid, Inc., a prominent fund-raising firm for direct mail and television campaigns, based in Pasadena, Calif.
"The old-line firms are going to have to adapt to a new market if they want to survive," Mr. Reid said.
Since its founding in 1919, Ketchum Inc. has raised billions of dollars for hospitals, youth and social services organizations and religious charities. Mr. Carter said that in the past decade it raised more than $1 billion just for higher education, including campaigns for St. John's University, Georgetown University and Northeastern University.
"This is very sad because they were for years the biggest and one of the best," said Jack Schwartz, the retired president of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel Inc., a trade association. "This shows that the field of professional fund raising is much more difficult today, with much greater competition for the philanthropic dollar and with many organizations relying on their own staff and using professional firms primarily as consultants, which makes it very hard to make a profit."
Carlton G. Ketchum, one of the company's founders, helped start the trade association in 1935 to raise standards among professional fund-raisers. Mr. Ketchum, who died in 1984 at age 92, served as the association's first president.

HEADLINE: Walesa Suggests He Will Accept New Premier

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Easing concerns about a political stalemate, President Lech Walesa suggested today that he would accept the nomination of the Speaker of Parliament, Jozef Oleksy, as Poland's new Prime Minister.
But it was not clear how long it would take Mr. Oleksy to form a new Cabinet, and in particular to find a Defense Minister and a Foreign Minister acceptable to Mr. Walesa. Both posts are vacant and have been a source of serious friction between Mr. Walesa and Poland's leftist coalition Government. 
 Mr. Oleksy, a former senior member of the old Communist Party, was chosen on Tuesday as the new Prime Minister by the coalition after Mr. Walesa forced the ouster of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.
Mr. Walesa's spokesman said the President was "not opposed" to Mr. Oleksy and that the two men would probably meet on Thursday. But some analysts suggested that while Mr. Walesa would accept Mr. Oleksy, he might not stop his attacks against the coalition, a fragile grouping of two parties rooted in the Communist past. It could be weeks, those analysts suggested, before a new Government line-up is in place.
Mr. Walesa had pressed the 16-month-old coalition Government to remove Mr. Pawlak on the ground that he stalled economic changes introduced by former governments. But his intervention also seems to be aimed at improving his own weak standing in the opinion polls. Once the national hero considered most responsible for bringing about the end of Communism, Mr. Walesa is trailing all the other potential candidates in the presidential election, which is to be held sometime before the end of year.
The choice of 48-year-old Mr. Oleksy to replace Mr. Pawlak, a 36-year-old politician from the Polish Peasants' Party, was welcomed as an improvement even by newspapers ideologically opposed to Mr. Oleksy and his party of former Communists, the Democratic Left Alliance.
Mr. Oleksy would be the first Prime Minister since the collapse of Communism in Poland to have come directly from the former Communist Party.
He was a minister in the last Communist Government and at one point served in the department of ideology of the Communist Party. In an interview in 1993, Mr. Oleksy said he "took care of the economic branch of the ideology department in a period when the party was looking for ways to make the economic transition."
Since he became Speaker, Mr. Oleksy has generally been considered a pragmatic politician. He has told American businessmen that he is in favor of a market economy and recently expressed frustration with the policies of the slow-moving Mr. Pawlak.
Mr. Oleksy, who has never visited the United States, told European Union lawmakers at a meeting last month that he wanted Poland to join NATO as soon as possible, a much firmer stance than the one expressed in vaguer statements he made 18 months ago.

HEADLINE: West European Companies Head East for Labor

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
Political leaders of the 15 nations in the European Union keep warning their electorates that high unemployment won't go down until rigid high labor costs do -- jobs will just flow east to central Europe, where it's cheaper to hire people.
Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., is a company that proves the point. Dr. Eberhard von Koerber, who heads its European operations, says the multinational engineering and electrical giant began shifting some of its operations eastward when Communism collapsed in 1989. 
 Today, Dr. von Koerber said, "it's like a shot of adrenaline to sit in Berlin and realize that one hour away by car, in a country where you no longer need a visa to travel, labor costs are only 5 to 10 percent of what they are in Germany."
The emergence of a low-cost, highly trained labor market in central Europe is one reason why, despite the economic recovery, unemployment in the western part of the Continent remains high: 10 percent in Germany, 12.6 percent in France and more than 20 percent in Spain.
Despite higher productivity and much lower unemployment in the United States, even a few American jobs are moving east as American and other investors seek a foothold in central Europe.
Since 1990, A.B.B. has eliminated 40,000 jobs from North America and Western Europe, and created 21,150 jobs in the newly capitalist countries to the east. It now owns 45 companies there that generated well over $2 billion in orders over the last two years.
The realignment has benefited the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate, which reported net profit of $444 million for the first nine months of 1994, compared with just $187 million for the comparable period in 1993. The complete earnings for last year will not be available for another month.
"The opening of central and Eastern Europe is really a unique opportunity for improving European competitiveness and re-engineering our very sclerotic economic structure," Dr. von Koerber, 56, said during an interview here.
"In Poland, we bought turbine manufacturing plants and restructured the companies by injecting our latest technology, standards of management and incentives to increase productivity," Dr. von Koerber said. "Once this was established, we focused on moving labor-intensive processes from operations in Western Europe."
At the 4,000-worker Zamek plant near Gdansk, Poland, the company now makes some kinds of turbines that it used to produce in Switzerland and Germany. A.B.B. employs a total of 8,000 people in Poland and almost as many in the Czech Republic, where it has boiler and chemical plants.
On the average, its employees in central Europe work 400 more hours a year than the company's workers in Western Germany do. Each hour a Polish worker spends on the job costs A.B.B. an average of $2.58, compared with $30.33 in Germany, according to the company.
A.B.B. is now exploring the possibility of using satellite telecommunications technology to move power plant engineering control operations from Mannheim, Germany, where engineers cost nearly $50 an hour, to Poland and Russia, where they cost only a fraction of that amount.
"With satellites, you can have them on line with computer operations in the West," Dr. von Koerber said, "and in time there could be fewer engineers in Mannheim and more in Poland and Russia."
Like other European companies, A.B.B. has been required to work out protection for its Western workers who lose their jobs. "Retraining an engineer from one kind of engineering to another is not such a problem," Dr. von Koerber said. "Retraining a welder to be a systems analyst, or even a waiter, is more difficult."
Most A.B.B. employees whose jobs were eliminated in Western Europe preferred to take union-negotiated buyout packages and generous unemployment benefits rather than undergo retraining for service jobs, he said. Many business executives contend that the social safety nets in most Western European countries encourage chronic unemployment rather than job creation.
Revising European social policies to encourage more job creation was one of the top priorities agreed on by leaders of the European Union nations in their meeting in Essen, Germany, in December. Dr. von Koerber doubts that it will happen soon.
"I don't think it will come voluntarily from the top, and I don't see the politicians really having the will to attack this on a scale that costs them votes," he said. "The issue is dropping from the agenda. The economy is recovering, and when the sun is shining you don't buy umbrellas."
Western investment in the most dynamic central European market economies -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- is still only a fraction of what those countries say they need to make the transition from Communism successfully.
In the Czech Republic, foreign investment has amounted to about $3 billion since 1991, Karel Dyba, the Czech Economics Minister, said recently. It has been on a comparable scale in Poland and Hungary, and money has continued to flow eastward for manufacturing plants despite the resurgence of former Communist parties that now govern both of those countries.
"The question is not whether they're moving back to Communism -- that won't happen," Dr. von Koerber said. "But there have been signs of slowdown and delay in the privatization and reform process which we don't like. As long as they're just being cautious about the speed of moving towards a market economy, it doesn't worry us. But we are concerned that some day they could change direction, not just speed."
Russia is a bigger worry for A.B.B., which is one of the largest European investors there, with more than 1,350 employees in more than a dozen Russian companies. President Boris N. Yeltsin's control over Government policies, including the commitment to continued movement toward democracy and a market economy, has been questioned since he ordered the army's destructive invasion of the secessionist province of Chechnya.
But most officials believe that investment capital will inexorably just keep moving east as long as labor costs remain high in the West -- leapfrogging Russia if conditions look uncertain there.
International bankers say that foreign investors have been sinking about $1 billion a year into Russia, but put $35 billion into China last year alone.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
With New Year, Clinton Finds Himself Mired in Old Ways

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
This was to have been the week that President Clinton laid out his own vision of a smaller Federal budget. Instead, it has become the week that Mr. Clinton fumbled another high-profile nomination and failed in a no-holds-barred bid to settle the major league baseball strike.
The White House has repeatedly vowed to break that self-destructive pattern of allowing problems of its own making to overshadow initiatives. But with a Surgeon General-designate who is being portrayed as an abortionist, and in a baseball dispute thrown into the hands of a reluctant Congress, Mr. Clinton has presented his Republican rivals on Capitol Hill with two easy ways to attack his principles and cast doubt on his leadership. 
 Today, the White House said the President did not regret having tried to save baseball from the money squabble between players and owners, even though it exposed him in the end as powerless to do anything about the dispute. Mr. Clinton's aides held out hope that the Congress might yet come to see the fate of the national pastime as its legitimate business.
But as Republican leaders on Capitol Hill made plain that they did not see settling the six-month-old strike as their problem, White House officials acknowledged that the President's decision to wade into baseball's messiness might, at least in the short term, make Mr. Clinton appear weak.
And as it mounted a full-scale effort to save Mr. Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr., the White House conceded that it had made a substantial mistake in announcing that an obstetrician-gynecologist was Mr. Clinton's choice to become the next Surgeon General while it had been unprepared or unwilling to give complete answers about abortions he had performed.
"There is no one on the staff who would say that we have served the President and the nominee as well as we could," Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said today. "We should have done a better job."
For more than a year, aides to Mr. Clinton have told themselves that even if things were not going their way, the President would be in fair shape if he and the aides could only avoid making what they consider stupid mistakes. With Republicans holding sway in Congress, Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledge that they have even less hope of scoring the kinds of successes, like the passage in 1993 of the President's economic plan, that have helped compensate for public relations gaffes like the Presidential haircut aboard Air Force One.
Now the Republicans are poised to override Mr. Clinton's objections in pushing for a balanced-budget amendment and a harder-edged crime bills. And some Administration officials say the ultimate effect of self-made failures on issues like baseball and nominations may be to convey the same sense of Presidential impotence as last year's foreign-policy breakdowns.
It was Leon E. Panetta, who took over last summer as Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, who vowed to cure the White House of its penchant for stumbling, and for a time he appeared to have succeeded. Just as Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team put together triumphs in Haiti, North Korea and the Middle East that quieted complaints about past flip-flops and indirection, Mr. Panetta imposed a sense of discipline over even the President, who agreed to be more careful about what he said in public.
But today, White House officials said that Mr. Panetta stood aside last month when Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, and Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel, persuaded Mr. Clinton to start the quest that ended in failure late Tuesday night when baseball's players and owners rejected hours of his personal entreaties.
Mr. Panetta was also among the Presidential aides who pushed hardest last week for Mr. Clinton to go forward in announcing Dr. Foster's nomination, the White House said. They said that Mr. Panetta and others had been aware at the time that Dr. Foster had performed abortions, but conceded that the White House had not taken time then to prepare a strong defense of that record.
A senior White House official tonight blamed that failure on a blindness to the prospect that opponents of abortion would choose Dr. Foster's nomination to pick a fight over the issue. But some officials also said the timing of the announcement had been driven in part by Mr. Panetta's determination to head off complaints that the White House had been too slow to fill what at the time were four high-level vacancies.
Because Dr. Foster had won acclaim for leading a campaign against teen-age pregnancy, the White House also hoped to use his appointment to send a signal of Mr. Clinton's commitment to that effort. The President's aides regard the fight against teen-age pregnancy as the kind of controversy-free quest to which he should devote time in a Republican-dominated atmosphere in which he must be cautious about confrontation.
But the failure to prepare for a showdown left the Administration to issue incomplete accounts of Dr. Foster's abortion record, which even advocates of abortion rights have denounced as misleading.
Had abortion and the baseball strike not interceded, this week still would not have been smooth sailing for the White House. While it spelled out a vision of a smaller Government, the budget that Mr. Clinton sent to Congress on Monday would have in any case become the focus of prominent Republican complaints that it did too little to cut the Federal deficit.
Aides to Mr. Clinton were not pretending that the last few days had been their most successful.
"One of the things you learn at the White House is that even the smallest mistakes are magnified," a senior White House official said tonight. "You can't afford to make any."

HEADLINE: Robert Mier, 52, Dies; Taught Urban Planning

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Robert Mier, a professor of urban planning and public administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a leading expert on economic and social issues facing American cities, died on Sunday at his home. He was 52 and lived in Chicago.
His family said he died of a form of lymphoma that resulted from his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. 
 Mr. Mier's wife, Joan Fitzgerald, said her husband had applied for disability connected with his exposure and had received a letter granting his claim two days before he died.
Mr. Mier was the architect and chief proponent of Chicago's highly regarded 1984 development plan, which he created as the city's director of economic development. Known as Chicago Works Together, the plan became a national model for other large cities struggling to retain their industrial and economic base while making neighborhoods easier to live in.
Some of his major accomplishments included a new $175 million public library, an export program for small businesses and a community-based general delivery system. Over all, he led efforts to keep factories open and to help neighborhoods control their own economic development.
At the University of Chicago, he founded the Center for Urban Economic Development in 1978. During its 17 years, the center has helped communities help themselves with technical assistance and research.
Mr. Mier also served as a consultant to cities here and abroad. In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, he was asked by the American Planning Association to conduct seminars for planning directors in Southern California.
Born in St. Louis, he graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in civil engineering in 1965. He received a doctorate in city and regional planning at Cornell University in 1974.
He served as a Navy lieutenant in Vietnam, but later resigned his commission because of opposition to the war.
Besides his wife, Mr. Mier is survived by two sons, Brian and Brendan, both of Chicago; two daughters, Lian Mier, of Huntsville, Ala., and Shelly Fitzgerald, of Chicago; a sister, Nell Newton, of Washington; a brother, Fred Boehm, of St. Louis, and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: Victorville Journal;
Boom to Bust in the Distant Suburbs

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VICTORVILLE, Calif., Jan. 5

 BODY:
There is not a lot for teen-agers to do in this windswept high-desert town, where the bleak gray landscape is broken by swaths of tract houses with tall television antennas.
Most weekends, a handful of students from Victor Valley High School are out on empty street corners, dressed as clowns or cartoon characters and hired by desperate realtors to wave the few passing cars toward houses that have been on the market for months. 
 Wearing a bright-red cowboy hat almost as tall as she is, Shanna Page, 17, earns $30 a day by wiggling an oversized foam-rubber hand toward Century Homes, a cluster of new houses that is nestled, like almost everything else here, along the edge of Interstate 15.
But few passers-by are interested in buying a house, Shanna said; more often they stop to ask about places to eat as they travel through on their way to Las Vegas.
Victorville and the other towns in Victor Valley -- Hesperia, Apple Valley and Adelanto -- are about 100 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. They were fed by the economic boom of the 1980's when people were willing to drive two hours or more over the mountains to their jobs in exchange for a modest home with a lawn and a two-car garage.
The recession of the 1990's left the towns stranded here in the Mojave Desert, with many residents ready to flee farther east, out of California altogether, but they are burdened with homes they cannot sell. As many as 300 houses are put up for sale every week in Victor Valley, said Gene Binsbachar, executive vice president of the Victor Valley Association of Realtors. The backlog of unsold houses is now up to 3,500 in the valley, still home to about 250,000 people.
The local economy suffered an added blow with the closing two years ago of George Air Force Base on the edge of town, with the loss of 5,000 jobs. Political wrangling has delayed redevelopment of the base, with plans for a prison, a civilian airport and small industries still on the drawing board.
In recent months, economic statistics indicate that the area has felt the first warm breath of the upturn that has tentatively begun in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. But few people here said they had noticed. "For Sale" signs still swing in the breeze on nearly every street, almost as numerous as the spiky Joshua trees that are the flora of the high desert.
Leaning back behind a desk inside a tiny model home, Bill Johnson, an agent for an investment company, said the houses that are selling these days are going for 25 percent below their assessed valuation. The prices have been driven to these artificially low levels, Mr. Johnson said, by developers who need cash for other projects. People selling their own houses in order to avoid agents' fees and the banks selling repossessed houses have no choice but to sell at cut rates.
Mr. Johnson said the two-bedroom 1,031-square-foot house he was trying to sell that day was on the market for $69,900, though it had been recently appraised at $86,800. A four-bedroom 1,700-square-foot house appraised at $117,800 was for sale for $94,900.
More than three dozen repossessed houses are for sale by the Veterans Administration and the Federal Housing Authority after the buyers walked away from low-interest mortgages, losing their down payments. On his desk, Mr. Johnson had lists showing the F.H.A. had 30 houses for sale and the V.A. had another 14.
Standing in his open garage on the other side of the Interstate, with a welding torch in one hand, Gordon Leisgang talked of the bind that people are in here if they want to leave.
"If I lose my job, I'm heading back east to my family," said Mr. Leisgang, 34, who works for a trucking company that he said has been swept by rumors of cutbacks. "But how can I move? The most I could get out of my house is about three-quarters of what I paid for it."
The happiest people are those who have found ways to avoid the freeways. "I made the commute to L.A. for over a year, easily over two hours each way," said Mr. Bins bachar of the realtors' association. "I just couldn't hold up to it any more."
In the 1980's, the population of the Victor Valley increased by 250 percent, said Brad Kilger, economic development director for the city of Apple Valley. A child of that boom, Apple Valley was incorporated in 1988 and now has 50,000 residents.
But the bust followed the buildup almost immediately. From a high of 1,100 building permits issued in Apple Valley in 1990, Mr. Kilger said, the number fell to 250 last year.
On streets where families gather on Sundays to relax in the shade of their open garages, the empty and unsold houses create a forlorn air.
"The whole attitude of this area has changed," said Jeff Sheeler, a mechanic whose house, surrounded by the carcasses of broken cars, is for sale. "A lot of people I know have moved out toward Las Vegas, and a lot of others wish they could."

Treasury Issues Mixed In Uneventful Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in what many traders called an uneventful session.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 1/32 , to 9811/32, for a yield of 7.64 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. Shorter-maturity bill rates, reflecting an increase in investor demand, dropped as much as 6 basis points for a three-month bill, to 5.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 The Treasury is halfway through its quarterly sales of new debt.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said yesterday's auction of 10-year notes went as well as could be expected, with most of the interest coming from dealers.
The 10-year notes at auction came in at an average yield of 7.54 percent, in line with market expectations.
The Treasury will sell $11 billion of 30-year bonds today. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the new long bond was being offered at a price to yield 7.60 percent, up a basis point from the day before.
"One thing is for sure," Mr. Burtnick said, "the market is already beginning to focus on Friday's January producer price data."
"But many economists have already begun to lower their P.P.I. estimates, and that has elminated some of the market's anxiety about owning longer maturities." Investors were concerned that if the Producer Price Index comes in strong tomorrow, it would be bad for long bonds, raising expectations of another Fed interest rate increase coming sooner, rather than later, and causing prices to fall.
Estimates call for an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for January, analysts said. The only economic data released yesterday was the Commerce Department's wholesale inventory for December, up two-tenths of 1 percent, down from a revised gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in November. The slower rise in the wholesalers' inventory was accompanied by a 2.2 perrcent jump in sales in December, suggesting that the Fed's seven interest rate increases over the span of a year have not sapped consumer demand.
While the numbers are not considered important by dealers, they are useful to economists who forecast gross domestic product data.
In the municipal bond market, yields dropped for the first time in three days as some investors began to find the price of some issues a little expensive compared with other fixed-income investment like Treasury or corporate securities.
The price of municipal debt has increased rapidly, with the lack of supply not being able to satisfy demand. General obligation bonds maturing in 20 years are yielding about 78.6 percent of comparable government securities, according to Bloomberg Fair Value analytics. In mid-December the ratio was 85.8 pecent. Traders generally consider municipal bonds expensive when they yield less that 82 percent of comparable government securities.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, the Walt Disney Company sold $400 million of notes in Europe due in 2000, with interest linked to the performance of a portfolio of live-action films.
The lead manager, CS First Boston, said the notes paid 2 percent interest semiannually, plus an additional amount of interest based on the revenues generated by the portfolio. The issue is priced at par and will be available in the United States under Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow Eurobonds to be sold.
According to London bankers, the studio has used this method of borrowing twice before.
The bond is likely to appeal to smaller fund managers with a good understanding of the risk, and could be linked to 24 or 25 films.
Walt Disney last issued a similar seven-year bond in October 1992. The interest rate, 7.5 percent for the first 18 months, fell to 1.5 percent thereafter.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Four-Wheeling No Longer Just a Fad

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Why, oh why, do city folk and suburbanites keep buying four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicles?
They are clunky, they are pricey and they get the same gas mileage as a giant Cadillac Fleetwood. On the freeway, they whistle in the wind. And don't even ask what an alignment costs. 
 Sweeping such cavils aside, auto companies are betting hundreds of millions of dollars that car buyers' tastes have permanently shifted toward the beefy vehicles with the inelegant name. In the next few years, everyone from Mercedes-Benz to Ford to Toyota plans to offer new types of sport utility vehicles. They cite marketing surveys, common sense and even anthropological studies to explain why they think buyers will pounce on every vehicle they make.
While many motivations are no doubt herding buyers to sport utilities, perhaps the most important, and certainly the most primal, is fear. Hence, the radio advertisements some Jeep dealers have been running this winter in New York and several other cities.
The scene: With wind howling in the background, a phone rings.
Sleepy Woman: "Hello?"
Man: "They've taken mom to emergency."
Announcer: "So what would you rather see in your driveway on a night like this? A car . . . or a Jeep Grand Cherokee?"
Of course, the combination of a huge snowstorm and a hospitalized mother may occur only rarely. But buyers say they feel safer knowing that they can send power to all four wheels, should they ever need to. Most never do. In fact, the predominant use for four-by-fours is for commuting.
"It's more insurance or security than a necessity," said Steve R. Yoder of Peoria, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix. Though he said he very rarely used the four-wheel-drive capability of his vehicles -- a Ford Explorer and Chevrolet Suburban -- Mr. Yoder said he was delighted with both of them. Only one thing disappointed him: the gas mileage, which he said was about 14 miles a gallon for the Explorer and 9 miles a gallon for the Suburban.
Mr. Yoder said his local gasoline station allowed customers to pump up to $50 of fuel after one swipe of a credit card through the pump. To fill up the Suburban, he said, he often had to swipe his card through twice.
"You get these extra perks you weren't expecting when you buy the beast," Mr. Yoder said. "But it's our choosing."
This year the auto makers plan to produce up to 400,000 more such beasts than they did in 1994, when they sold 1.556 million. That would be an increase of 26 percent.
"Are there going to be that many more buyers?" said Christopher W. Cedergren, senior vice president of the Autopacific Group, a consultant in Santa Ana, Calif.
The auto companies certainly think so. Women in particular like the sturdiness of trucks, and they like sitting high in traffic. Combined with those truck attributes, four-wheel drive helps people feel more in control at a time when their lives seem more chaotic. At least, that's what auto executives say.
"If you talk to the anthropologists we deal with, people want more and more to control their lives," said Jim Perkins, general manager of the Chevrolet division of the General Motors Corporation. "You don't carry a gun, necessarily. But you try to stay above your problems."
Chevrolet contracted with an anthropologist last year to determine whether the passion for "sport utes," as they are sometimes known, was a fleeting fancy or a durable trend. After interviewing owners, the anthropologist emphatically concluded that the shift to sport utilities would last.
Bombing down a freeway in a jumbo Suburban, watching blinkers flare to life on puny sedans as they skitter out of the way, one gets a sense of, well, mastery. Watching the digits flip past as one fills the 42-gallon gas tank, however, provides a less pleasant frisson.
Still, as more people buy trucks and crown themselves kings and queens of the road, those left in sedans may feel compelled to join them, if only to see ahead in traffic.
For sociological reasons besides rising anxiety, Mr. Perkins predicted that the sport utility segment would continue to grow. He cited the same rebellious compulsion believed to have spurred the sales of mini-vans. Baby boomers picked mini-vans over the station wagons in which they rode as children, according to a widely held industry theory, in part because they could not stand the thought of becoming like their parents.
Future growth in sport utility sales, Mr. Perkins predicted, will "be fueled by these people who grew up in a van and now wouldn't touch a van."
G.M. offers the broadest line of sport utilities. And Chevrolet is now shipping to dealers yet another contender, a chunky sport utility called the Tahoe that is slotted between the compact Blazer and big Suburban. The price of the base two-door version of the Tahoe starts at $22,640, while the four-door, four-wheel-drive version starts at $29,195.
From less than 8 percent of the light-truck market in 1980, sport utilities rose to 24.4 percent in 1993, then dipped to 24.2 percent last year, according to an analysis by the Ford Motor Company. The share slipped last year, because Ford and G.M. shut down some production to prepare for new sport utility models.
Drawing some of the most affluent new-vehicle customers, sport utilities have become one of the most profitable lines for the Big Three auto makers. Auto analysts estimate that the Chrysler Corporation makes at least $6,000, and perhaps as much as $8,000, for every Jeep Grand Cherokee it sells.
The vast majority of sport utilities are sold with four-wheel drive. The question is, why? It is a cliche of the industry that most buyers never use the four-wheel capability, which they can generally switch on and off. "Nine out of 10 customers don't use it," said Lloyd Johnson, fleet manager of Fletcher Jones Toyota in Las Vegas, Nev.
Indeed, a study by Ford found that 63 percent of people said they primarily used their compact sport utility vehicles for commuting to work; 1 percent primarily for hunting, camping, or fishing, and none for driving "off road." Only 20 percent said they used their vehicles off road.
And in focus groups with customers, Chevrolet learned some surprising definitions of "off road." In Chicago, one buyer firmly said he had gone off-roading in his vehicle, said Kurt Ritter, Chevrolet's manager of truck marketing.
"He said, 'Yeah, there was an accident on the Eisenhower, and I had to go over the curb to avoid a stranded motorist,' " Mr. Ritter recalled with a laugh.
Dealers say owners are perfectly happy using their four-wheel drive only rarely. Ron Miller, general sales manager of a Ford dealership in Cherry Hill, N.J., said he frequently had customers tell him that they used their four-wheel drive only twice -- and then went ahead and traded in their old four-wheel-drive Explorers for new ones. "They get it because of the security of knowing that it's there," he said.
Such peace of mind has its price. Four-wheel-drive capability can drive up the price of a new vehicle by $1,000 to $2,650. Then buyers pay a penalty in fuel economy of 10 percent or more, even if they never use the four-wheel drive. The reason is that the equipment needed for the capability, including a heavy transfer case, easily weighs more than 200 pounds. That also inhibits the performance of a vehicle.
"It's like running with ankle weights on," said Csaba Csere, the editor in chief of Car and Driver magazine. Mr. Csere said most people who bought four-wheel drive could get by with front-wheel drive, and the less expensive option of traction control.
He added, "It's ironic that today's yuppies, who generally regard themselves as having greater environmental consciousness than their parents, wind up driving vehicles that are no more fuel efficient than their parents' were."

Comes the Devolution

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A quick insight to illuminate the political landscape: China, Russia and the United States -- all in their own ways -- are sending power long concentrated in their capital cities out to the boondocks.
Curiously, when Americans see this happening in China, we tut-tut about "warlordism." After Beijing-centric Deng dies, political power in China will probably devolve to centrifugalmen in a half-dozen regions, thereby reflecting economic reality. 
 Beijing's central grip will be broken because it has raised government-army-business corruption to a national scale -- but such corruption works best, mafia-style, in alliances among regional "families."
Meanwhile, devolution continues apace in Russia, which is down to 150 million people; its hope of gaining back population is in the immigration to the motherland of Russian-speaking "near abroad," unhappy in the broken-off states.
Chechnya's bid for independence, brutally repressed, reminds the varied peoples of the unmanageably farflung Russian Federation that Moscow rules by force. But the successor to Boris Yeltsin will have to submit to the stronger centrifugal force, recognizing that ever-greater autonomy within each republic is the way to maintain sovereignty over all.
The American tut-tutters at this trend call the coming devolution "dismemberment." They foresee nothing but Balkan-like trouble in breakups, and pose a legitimate question about the control of nuclear weaponry in China or Russia if either nation sinks into anarchy.
But is anarchy the necessary result of the flow of power to the people? Would not downsizing benefit nations that have over-conglomerated? Even Europe, after a decade of rhetoric about continental integration, is now finding new respect for local culture and national identity.
On devolution, it ain't what you do, it's the way you do it. The U.S. is pointing the way to the orderly dispersion of political power. By striking down "unfunded mandates" beyond safety and civil rights, the new Congress is taking burdens of taxation off states. By turning the administration of welfare, Medicaid and ultimately Medicare to states, the nation is allowing for diversity and encouraging competition.
That's the new direction in our democracy. You might think that by our example, we could influence this historic devolution in countries that we want to see turn democratic.
But U.S. policy works toward the opposite goal. Clinton diplomats and most of the foreign policy establishment fear the new direction and seek "stability" above all.
In China, Mr. Clinton at first ties trade advantages to human rights, then abjectly caves in. Beijing, having taken our President's measure, participates in the most brazen piracy of U.S. intellectual property. But when the trade negotiator Mickey Kantor huffs and puffs about retaliation, his house is blown down by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who announces a junket this month of 50 American oil men to Beijing.
As a result, hard-line Beijing centrists claim victory: Li Peng can argue that only a strong national government can continue to humble the U.S. in trade.
In the same way, by putting all our diplomatic chips on the continuance of the current regime in Moscow, we take the side of the two men -- the shrewd authoritarian Yeltsin and the nutty authoritarian Zhirinovsky -- who stand for an all-powerful central government against the forces of devolutionary change.
Time to open our eyes. What's good for our democracy could be good for nascent democracy in Russia and the un-Communist devolvers in China. We should stop touting order imposed from the center for others even as we come to reject that course for ourselves. On the contrary, we should encourage others to go with the flow of centrifugal political forces all over the world.
Nobody denies that the U.S. national interest is in responsible control of nuclear arsenals. We should invest heavily in incentives to dismantle, subsidize non-weaponry work by nuclear scientists and put in place a space shield to deter secessionist blackmailers.
But today we should face up to the likelihood of some dispersion of control, and stop our wishful thinking that a small circle of leaders in China and Russia will be calling the shots tomorrow.

Baseball Outlook Appears Gloomy

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
From the bargaining table to the mediator's office to the White House to Congress, the strike that defies settlement continued gathering potential outlets for failure today.
While President Clinton sent his binding-arbitration legislation to Capitol Hill and Labor Secretary Robert Reich began campaigning publicly for it, negotiators for striking baseball players and owners left town. They will be back to lobby for and against the bill, which is opposed by Congressional leaders, but their travel plans do not include any visits to the bargaining table. 
 The parting comments of high-ranking people drew a stark outline of how far apart the two sides were after a failed week in Washington.
"It's regrettable that the two opportunities we had to try and call a truce last night did not prove productive," Donald Fehr, the players union chief, said before leaving the Mayflower Hotel this afternoon.
John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, chairman of the owners' negotiating committee, left early this morning, saying as he headed for the door, "I believe the next move is for consideration to be given to Mr. Usery's report."
Harrington referred to the suggestions for a settlement presented to each side Tuesday by Bill Usery Jr., the mediator. The owners accepted them; the players rejected them, bitterly showing that the suggestions were closer to the owners' positions than theirs.
Fehr was talking about the two Administration ideas that the players accepted and the owners rejected: binding arbitration or the return to work for the 1995 season under the existing agreement while a Presidential fact-finding commission developed points of negotiation for after the season.
It came as no surprise that the two sides could not agree on anything generated by the mediator or the White House; nothing else has induced agreement. The two sides may now disagree on something else: Usery's future in the talks.
Given Tuesday's developments, it seemed highly unlikely that the union would continue to have faith in Usery's ability to mediate the dispute. Fehr said he would not comment on that issue until he spoke with Usery. The mediator, who visited Capitol Hill today to brief the Congressional leaders, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, stood ready to continue.
Asked if Usery's effectiveness had been damaged, Reich said at a news briefing: "I don't know. That's for the players and the owners to decide. Mr. Usery said to the President last night that he is perfectly happy to continue serving as long as the players and the owners want him to continue."
Clinton has received mixed reviews for his efforts. Harrington, for one, said, "I think the President found out that he shouldn't have been involved."
Therein lay yet another difference between the two sides. The players emerged from the White House with glowing praise for Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. In fact, one person with the union, who did not attend the Tuesday evening meeting at the White House, suggested today that Gore "could be a big help on this."
It is not very likely, though, that the Vice President will be asked to help. Nor is it very likely that any other would-be mediator would be willing to jump into the once-more broken-down talks.
In conversations with reporters today, Reich related an observation Usery offered at the White House Tuesday night, quoting him as saying, "In my decades of dealing with labor-management disputes, I have never dealt with a dispute that had so much rancor and bitterness and distrust."
Reich commented that he has seen it, too, saying, "I have never seen this degree of animus."
Strong feeling exists among nonparticipants, Reich added. "The fans are getting fed up," he said. "The President is exasperated. I'm at the end of my tether."
But the strike goes on. Fehr said he was returning to New York to set up a series of meetings with players and agents. He also said he would attempt to hold "a series of background press conferences so people can begin to understand the new and different era we're in."
With spring training scheduled to begin next Thursday, the clubs will continue to plan for their teams of strikebreaking players. It is not a prospect that will gain the Administration's endorsement.
"The Administration is opposed to the permanent replacement of striking workers," Reich said. "This is a policy, a management decision, that has had very negative results wherever it's been tried. It undermines worker-management relations. It undermines trust with a lot of negative connotations for the industry itself. So I would very much stand by the public interest and public policy that the owners do not pick permanent replacements."
The striking players are soon expected to complete details for their own games. They have been putting together a plan to have 100 to 150 of the sport's best players participate in weekend games throughout the country under Reebok sponsorship.
Today was calm and serene compared with the bizarre nature of the Administration's initiative on Tuesday.
The players were particularly puzzled by one development. During one of their meetings with Usery's staff, union officials said, one of the other mediators told them that the clubs had been given completely different suggestions from those the union had received from Usery.
For the next several hours, the union people thought Usery's suggestions to them were a ruse.
"We now know that was not correct," one union lawyer said.
What they learned was correct, among other things, was the Usery suggestion that the two sides agree, beginning in 1996, to a 50 percent tax on the portion of payrolls over $40 million. The union contended that such a tax would cost the players $1 billion over the six-year term of a possible agreement; the clubs said their computations showed only $215 million.
The union cited Usery's tax as evidence that despite his four months in the talks, he didn't know what he had been hearing.
"We asked him how much would be raised by the tax, who gets it, what does it do to players' salaries," Fehr said. "He said, 'I don't know. I'm not an expert in economics and I don't understand the stuff.' "
Richard Conn, Usery's spokesman, said the mediator was not available for comment on any matter today.
With no talks planned and no chance for a negotiated agreement in sight, the National Labor Relations Board becomes a focal point of the dispute. The board is investigating a new union charge, against the clubs' decision not to sign players.
Would the players return to work if the board acted against the clubs?
"We would have to evaluate that when it happens and look at the situation at the time," Fehr said. "If the owners had restored the status quo, as they said they would, we'd be in a position to consider those things, but obviously we're not."

One Fan to Congress: Just Do It, Pass the Bill

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
WHEN baseball was the national pastime instead of the national joke, the President always threw out the first ball. But now baseball has thrown out the first President.
The first President caring enough to try to solve one of its labor disputes. 
 "It's just a few hundred folks trying to figure out how to divide nearly $2 billion," President Clinton said Monday. "They ought to be able to figure that out in time for the rest of America to enjoy this baseball season."
But after six months and a White House meeting, those few hundred folks, meaning the owners and players, still haven't figured it out.
At the White House meeting Tuesday night, the President suggested binding arbitration. Labor agreed; Donald Fehr acknowledged that the union was "prepared to arbitrate everything." Management disagreed; Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, asserted that binding arbitration was "not the solution," adding that the owners "reject" it.
"Clearly," the President would say of the owners and players, "they are not capable of resolving this strike without an umpire."
That umpire is the legislation the President will ask Congress to enact that would create binding arbitration by a three-person board. All Congress has to do is pass the bill, not settle the dispute. Just do it. But this Republican Congress doesn't seem inclined to consent to this left-handed Democrat's wishes.
If the President's participation were rated in a scouting report, he showed he wasn't able to hit with power. He had no authority to order binding arbitration. But at least the Prez cares about baseball, at least he's trying.
To those who argue the President has more important problems, he does. Budget, deficit, welfare, Bosnia, Haiti, Mexico. But if he could invest an hour or two Tuesday night in a White House dinner for new members of Congress, who surely represent the fabric of America, he could invest an hour or two the same night in trying to settle a dispute that had ripped another area of that fabric.
Baseball is a small part of America's economic fabric. Especially in Florida and Arizona where spring training is a rite of income. Especially in the major league cities where thousands of jobs depend on the teams and the games.
Yes, the President surely was hoping to get some votes in 1996 from baseball fans if he had succeeded in hastening a solution. He also risked losing votes from those who think either the President is too important to be concerned about baseball, or that baseball isn't important enough for the President to be concerned.
But baseball's continuity has twice concerned other Presidents who were shouldering much more serious issues.
Not long after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was asked by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for guidance now that the nation was involved in World War II. In a Jan. 15, 1942, letter, the President wrote:
"I honestly think it would be best for the country to keep baseball going."
During World War I, the nation's Provost Marshal, Major Gen. Enoch Crowder, surely with President Woodrow Wilson's blessing, issued in June 1918 a "work or fight" order: all men of draft age who were deferred for one reason or another should apply for war-essential employment. Motion-picture actors and opera singers were exempt, but baseball players weren't.
Newton Baker, then the Secretary of War, asked that the 1918 baseball season be curtailed. It ended on Labor Day, with the teams playing anywhere from 122 to 129 games instead of the scheduled 154 games. In the World Series, the Boston Red Sox, with a left-hander named Babe Ruth winning twice, defeated the Chicago Cubs, 4 games to 2. Two months later the war was over.
But now the Congress and President Clinton aren't the only people in Washington involved in the baseball mess.
The National Labor Relations Board has warned the owners of the "peril" of having imposed a signing freeze on players last Monday. The owners might be subject to the N.L.R.B.'s issuing another unfair labor practice ruling, another sad sign of baseball's times.
To a baseball fan, N.L. always meant National League. Now it's merely the first two initials of a governmental agency.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Usery Meets a Dispute Even He Can't Settle

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Garment workers and mine workers have turned to Bill Usery Jr. So have General Motors, the Chicago school system and Toyota. All had a desire to see if Usery could step in and settle long, intractable and sometimes violent disputes.
The Federal Government still turns to Usery during the most dire national crises, and more often than not, Usery, a Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration, does what he is asked. 
 Then came the major league baseball strike, as big a conundrum as there is in labor relations these days. And now, because of the fractious dispute that Usery was drawn into last fall, the ticker-tape parade of automatic success may have stopped for the nation's most notable mediator.
The 71-year-old Usery stepped into the dispute Oct. 4 at the urging of President Clinton. Four months later, his efforts have not proved successful. And the fight not only between owners and players, but also over him, has become so ugly that Usery's future in the process is now in question.
No one has asked Usery to resign in the wake of the failure to reach agreement after five hours of negotiations Tuesday night at the White House. Clinton, disappointed as he was, still asked Usery to continue to seek a settlement.
Today, a Clinton spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, described Usery's work as "courageous and historic." Usery was also praised by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, who called Usery in to settle a violence-marred seven-month coal strike in 1993, a dispute that involved 17,000 workers and led to one death. "He has an extraordinary record of settling strikes and settling disputes," Reich said. "He is the best mediator in the country."
No matter. Speculation reigned today that angry players -- who split the cost of Usery's $120,000-a-month mediation fee with the clubs -- may try to force Usery out because of some settlement suggestions Usery made.
Donald Fehr, executive director of the Players Association, would not discuss his views of Usery or what he planned to say in a conversation he hoped to have with the mediator today. But the night before, a genuinely perturbed Fehr picked at Usery's presentation, questioning the mediator's inability to answer specific economic and financial ramifications of his suggestions.
"When we ask an individual, 'Can you tell me why you made this recommendation, what is your rationale, how do you write the numbers, what are your assumptions, how much money do the players lose or gain, how much money do the clubs lose or gain?' and the answer is, 'I don't know, Don,' it is not possible to take it seriously," Fehr said. "And it is very regrettable that that happened."
"I think Bill Usery, in many respects, has done everything that he could," Fehr added. "But, as I suggested to him the first day I met him, this would be far and away the hardest mediation he'd ever have to do. He agrees with that tonight."
Fehr also added that because the owners had revealed some of Usery's suggestions, "it becomes very difficult for Mr. Usery to stay involved."
Usery declined to meet with the news media today. Reich said Usery had told the President he would stay on if both sides wanted.
But the union's dissatisfaction with Usery may put the mediator in an untenable position. Indeed, even though the club owners were very supportive of Usery on Tuesday night, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox said he did not know what the clubs would do if the players fought to force the mediator out.
"If they're going to fight against him, it's not going to be very productive," Harrington, the owners' chief negotiator, said.
The owners have endorsed many of the informal recommendations made by Usery. And they reserved their anger for the fact that the process in which Usery's recommendations would be enforced did not unfold, hinting that it did not because of intense player opposition.
The raw feelings between the parties are nothing new, of course. But the venom sent Usery's way by one side is equally stunning. And the troubles Usery has found in baseball are likely as bitter as any he has ever experienced.
Even before Tuesday's White House initiatives failed, Usery told reporters how the strike had become the toughest case he had faced in three decades.
"The parties were very, very far apart," Usery said. "And trying to narrow those issues in a single recommendation that had any hope of bringing them together is almost impossible."
Still, Usery has yet to surrender hope that good-faith bargaining will prevail. "He would so much prefer to have both sides settle this themselves because he feels that the bargaining table is the ultimate expression of democracy in the work place," Usery's associate, Richard Conn, said earlier this week.
The question is, will Usery be around to see it?
That probably won't be known until it is determined what can be salvaged of the working relationship between the union and Usery. Salvaging may not be possible, unless the players can put aside their anger over the mediator's informal recommendations.
"He got into some historical areas that were absolutely no-nos without any knowledge of the history or the consequences, which absolutely blew the union's mind," Tom Reich, a lawyer who represents players and who participated in some negotiating sessions here, said today.
"Second, he did not have a good handle on what the economic consequences are. The third thing is, he made representations to them that he did not keep, such as there was not going to be a proposal presented to the President as his final proposal. So, with all due respect to Mr. Usery's distinguished past, I am totally in accord with the union's negative response to Mr. Usery's activities in the last few days."
Such statements underscore the gulf within a gulf that has developed, making it more than understandable why even a Bill Usery can call this the toughest challenge of his career.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts in New York Will Give Small Businesses a Real Boost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Cut, but Be Fair to the City" (editorial, Feb. 2) on Gov. George E. Pataki's budget for New York State, was a reasonably fair description of the plan, the politics that surround it and the policy implications of the whole matter. Reasonably fair, that is, until you start again with that old politics-of-envy refrain that infects so many of your editorials. 
 Why, when the budget relieves 400,000 people from any state tax burden at all, must you carp about cuts that apply to families making more than $100,000 a year? Is their wealth so fabulous that they should get no relief from New York's burdensome tax structure?
Most households with that income have two wage earners, and many are small-business owners for whom the personal income tax is the tax they pay on their business's profits. Do you know there are more than one million such enterprises in New York State? If they earn $100,000 in a year, they earn it with 60-hour work
weeks, sweat, toil, sometimes tears.
Higher income families are the most likely to take their tax saving and start a new small business. Most small businesses start that way, and that's the best reason for supporting Governor Pataki's tax cuts.
Because they are a flat, across-the-board reduction and not progressive, the tax cuts may stimulate the new business start-ups New York so seriously needs.
You refer to "the rewards of the tax breaks" as if they were some political payoff, a reward of the kind New York City is accustomed to receiving from its Democratic legislators in Albany. But that's wrong. The tax cuts are policy, designed to stimulate the economy into creating jobs. They are not a cash version of political pork.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against the Yen After Data on Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday after a report showed that Japan's chronically large trade surplus persisted in 1994.
The report, issued during overnight trading in Tokyo, showed that Japan's trade surplus swelled to $145.82 billion in 1994 from $141.51 billion in 1993. Its trade surplus with the United States grew to $55 billion in 1994, which means that Japanese exporters have a wealth of dollars to sell when they take revenues home. In addition, dollar selling by Japanese companies often picks up before the end of their fiscal year on March 31. 
 The trade report "kind of blew away the theory that a stronger yen would would erode the trade surplus," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 98.90 yen from 99.44 yen on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 1.5305 German marks, from 1.5365 marks on Tuesday, and to 1.2955 Swiss francs from 1.3025 francs.
But the weakness of the dollar failed to drive it below the tight currency ranges that have dominated trading in recent weeks.
In other currency trading, the British pound again came under pressure. Dealers have been concerned about the ability of Prime Minister John Major to stop a growing rift within the ruling Conservative Party over increased economic integration within the European Union. Dealers were selling pounds to buy marks yesterday, and the pound fell to a five-month low of 2.3756 marks before recovering in New York to 2.3814 marks.
The pound's weakness spilled over into dollar trading. The pound fell to a one-month low of $1.5502 in New York before recovering to settle at $1.5534, down from $1.5565 in New York on Tuesday.
Separately, the Federal Reserve confirmed yesterday that it bought $2.6 billion worth of dollars in November to prop up the value of the dollar. The Fed said it spent German marks to purchase $800 million in dollars and spent yen to purchase another $800 million in dollars on Nov. 2, in one of the largest one-day interventions in recent years.
The following day, the Fed spent more yen and marks to buy an additional $1 billion in dollars. The Fed bought an equal amount of dollars with the yen and marks it spent, said Peter R. Fisher, executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at a quarterly briefing on the Fed's foreign exchange dealings yesterday.
In both interventions, one other foreign central bank -- which the Fed declined to name -- participated in the yen sales, Mr. Fisher said.

HEADLINE: A Troubled Orchestra Faces Radical Surgery

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The Louisville Orchestra, an ensemble long renowned for its adventurous recording series and its festivals devoted to contemporary music, is facing the fight of its life. And musicians and orchestra managers elsewhere in the country are watching with concern, since a proposed restructuring of the orchestra may have ramifications for other ensembles as well.
The management and board, fretting over a $710,000 accumulated deficit, a projected deficit of $410,000 for next season and an expected drop in income, are demanding that the players abandon the three-year contract they negotiated in 1993 and accept a radical makeover. Under their plan, only 45 of the orchestra's 67 musicians would keep their full-time positions; the other 22 would become part-time players. 
 The proposed new contract also calls for salary cuts and a shrinking of the orchestra's season to 40 weeks from 45. All told, the budget for salaries would be reduced to $1.93 million from $2.41 million.
The board has given the players until March 7 to accept its terms, and has raised the stakes by announcing that subscription marketing and fund-raising events for next season will be suspended until an agreement is reached. Moreover, the Greater Louisville Fund for the Arts, which has several board members in common with the orchestra, has said that the orchestra's annual $1 million grant -- about one-fifth of its budget -- may be in peril. By starving itself of ticket income and contributions, the board is preparing to invoke a clause of the 1993 contract that allows it to dissolve the orchestra for lack of operating funds.
The musicians, who have already made staff and salary concessions totaling $300,000 this season, were stunned by the restructuring proposal, which may cost some players as much as half their incomes. Base pay in Louisville is just under $24,000, low by regional-orchestra standards and roughly one-third the salary New York Philharmonic players earn in a 52-week season.
"This is a proposal designed to encourage the orchestra's bargaining unit to cannibalize itself," said Liza Hirsch Du Brul, the lawyer representing the musicians. "It sets up the expectation that some players will be betting with themselves that they'll be among the 45, and that if the majority will be O.K., they can outvote the minority. This orchestra has already seen cut and betrayal after cut and betrayal, but it will probably not cannibalize itself."
It is not only among Louisville's musicians that the plan is playing badly. Although financial strains have led other orchestras to adopt multiple-tier arrangements of full-time, part-time and occasional freelance players -- the Kansas City Symphony, the Syracuse Symphony and the Columbus Symphony, among them -- none are as prominent as Louisville. And musicians elsewhere fear that if the plan goes through, their own managements will pursue similar restructuring in future negotiations.
"A two-tier system is something a lot of us had hoped we'd gotten rid of," said Robert Levine, the principal violist of the Milwaukee Symphony and the editor of Senza Sordino, the newsletter of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians. "My first job was in an orchestra with a three-tier system. It takes a toll on musical cohesiveness. And it creates tensions between the full-time and part-time players. The idea has been floated here, not formally, in contract negotiations, but I've heard management fantasize about it."
For the Louisville musicians, all this could not come at a worse time. The orchestra's last music director, Lawrence Leighton Smith, retired in July, and the players worry that experienced conductors will be wary of working with a two-tier ensemble.
Right now a war of numbers is raging in Louisville. The musicians have hired two consultants, Ron Bauers of the University of Nebraska and William Thompson, a former associate director of the conservatory at the University of Missouri, to produce their own audit.
Instead of a $410,000 deficit next season, Mr. Bauers and Mr. Thompson project a $96,000 surplus. They point out that the orchestra's endowment of more than $9 million is among the highest in the country for an orchestra of its size, and that other orchestras with similar budgets -- the New Jersey Symphony and the Florida Orchestra of Tampa -- have larger deficits but have not resorted to the draconian measures proposed in Louisville.
Mr. Bauers and Mr. Thompson also say that management's pessimism runs against recent trends. They say, for example, that although subscription sales have dipped, single-ticket sales have risen, accounting for a $3,300 weekly increase in box office income between 1992 and 1994. They point to a nearly 400 percent increase in corporate donations and an 82 percent increase in private giving between 1990 and 1994. The management budget predicts drops in all those areas.
"If the board and management want to abandon the obligations to the musicians," Ms. Du Brul said, "the onus is on them to prove that there's a financial crisis. Not only haven't they done that, but they make these demands in the context of not having honored anything in the 1993 contract."
The board, not surprisingly, sees a very different financial picture.
"Mr. Bauers's report does not take certain critical factors into account," said Ted Rosky, a member of the board, who sees the contribution trend figures as flawed because they include one-time gifts and income from special, nonrecurring events. He also said that changes in the market had kept the endowment from generating as much interest income as the orchestra had expected. Like all arts organizations, the orchestra is also fearing cuts in government support, which this year totals about $270,000. And competition from Louisville's other cultural assets -- including a theater, a museum and a newly renovated theater used for pop concerts -- has cut into the orchestra's audience at a rate of 6 percent a year.
"Many people in the community believe that when the orchestra went full time in 1981, it went too far, too fast," Mr. Rosky said. "At the time, the arts economy was booming, and it was envisioned that the opera and ballet would make extensive use of the orchestra, but those organizations have been financially pressed as well. In fact, the orchestra has been losing about $300,000 a year."
But Ms. Du Brul contends that the proposed restructuring has "an ideological purpose," and musicians both in Louisville and around the country agree. They regard the move as rooted in the 1992 Wolf Report. Commissioned by the American Symphony Orchestra League, a management organization, the report suggested that there were too many full-time, salaried orchestras for the American arts market to bear.
Wayne S. Brown, the orchestra's executive director, is also on the board of the league, but vehemently rejects the players' suggestion that the Louisville Orchestra is a crucible in which the league's agenda is being tested.
"What I think this all boils down to," Mr. Brown said, "is that the operation cannot continue to expand in scale. We have an orchestra with a $4.6 million budget in a community of less than a million people, and that's probably as far as we can go. So the question we face is, how can we reposition the orchestra in the market available to us? It's vital that we and the players find common ground for the sake of the institution, and that we do it before it's too late."
Management is holding a trump card. If it does dismiss the orchestra after the March 7 deadline, the institution and its board will continue to exist, and could reconstitute the Louisville Orchestra on its own terms.
"Long term," said Mr. Rosky, the board member, "there will be an orchestra in Louisville. Short term? That's a good question."

HEADLINE: In a Mixed Session, Dow Slips 2.02 Points

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive session, stock prices closed mixed but little changed yesterday, except for a modest rally among Nasdaq issues, where two stocks accounted for much of the rise.
A weak dollar, hobbled by a report of a widening Japanese trade surplus with the United States, helped drag down stock prices. 
 After rising nearly 16 points, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.02 points, to 3,935.37, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.38 point, to 481.19. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.80 points, to 783.77.
Much of the rise in Nasdaq stocks came from the Intel Corporation and Amgen Inc.
Shares of Intel, the semiconductor maker, hit a 52-week high of 7615/16 before closing at 76 5/8, up 3 5/8. A Merrill Lynch analyst said Intel, a favorite of institutional investors, seemed to be selling more Pentium microprocessors than expected, despite a widely publicized flaw.
Shares of Amgen, a biotechnology company, also set a 52-week high, of 76 1/8, before closing at 70 3/4, up 5 3/8. Traders speculated that Amgen might be bought by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, but neither company would comment.
Almost as many stocks fell as gained on the New York Stock Exchange, rising stocks outnumbering decliners, 1,134 to 1,054.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.03 point, to 261.67, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.80 points, to 445.94.
Stock traders are likely to be on the sidelines today in advance of tonmorrow's important Producer Price Index, a measure of wholesale inflation that often moves markets. And the Treasury Department completes its $40 billion quarterly refunding today by selling about $11 billion of benchmark 30-year bonds. Bond traders are often reluctant to buy other kinds of bonds while the Government is selling its bonds, a hesitancy that often influences the stock market, too.
Corporate earnings for many stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the stock gauge most widely followed by market professionals, have come in at surprisingly high levels helping to support stock prices, however modestly.
Bloomberg Business News reported that nearly 60 percent, or 225 of 390 reporting stocks of the S.& P. 500, reported positive surprises. And the median for positive earnings surprises was 7.7 percent.
Shares of International Cabletel, a provider of telecommunications services, rose 2 1/2, to 33 1/2, in part because a Salomon Brothers analyst recommended the stock. And shares of the Cablevision Systems Corporation rose after Dan Dorfman reported a rumor on the CNBC cable channel that the AT&T Corporation might

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senator Lays Out Pain of Balanced Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Democrats like to note that Republicans keep promising to balance the Federal budget but never seem to get around to saying how they plan to do it, much less who will suffer as a result. But one Republican with a substantial say in the matter has detailed notions about how to eliminate the deficit, and now he is laying them out -- suffering and all.
He is Senator Judd Gregg, a conservative freshman from New Hampshire whose personal fiscal views, like those of other first-termers, might ordinarily inspire yawns. But Mr. Gregg is different: this winter the majority leader, Bob Dole, designated him to comb through the Federal budget's $850 billion in mandatory spending programs, like Medicare and Federal pensions, in search of savings to apply to the deficit. 
 So, Mr. Gregg's views on deficit-cutting carry weight. And as it turns out, they include something to offend just about everybody.
Mr. Gregg jokes that this job is unpleasant enough that his working group meets in a phone booth, which is nearly true: only 5 of the 53 Republicans senators have been regulars at its meetings. Perhaps a dozen more have dropped by once or twice.
In an interview last week, Mr. Gregg, who turns 48 on Tuesday, spent an hour describing cuts and shifts in spending on Federal benefit programs that he said would save at least $350 billion through the end of the decade, and much more after that. These programs include freezing most Federal welfare spending for five years, as Republican leaders proposed today; lowering cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients and Federal pensioners; overhauling the generous retirement system for Federal workers, and raising Medicare premiums for the well-off elderly.
He would also raise the retirement age for the baby-boom generation and its successors and encourage workers to leave the Social Security system for private pension plans -- both moves, he says, that are necessary to keep Social Security from busting the bank in the next century.
Congress has ruled out altering Social Security; whether the rest will make it into Mr. Gregg's formal budget-cutting proposal later this month is unclear. But if the Republican Senate does not produce a serious plan to reduce the explosive growth of Federal benefit programs, he said he would not hesitate to offer his own.
"In New Hampshire, people respect you if you tell them what the problem is and tell them what the solution is," he said.
His solution is open to challenge by doubters who call some of its savings illusory and by critics who assert that it would neglect society's neediest. But it would be hard to call it the easy way out of the deficit morass. Its main elements shrink programs, like health care and retirement, that millions of voters and scores of lobbies guard jealously.
"Unless you really get into health care accounts and pension accounts, you do not solve the short-term issue," Mr. Gregg said. "And you cannot solve the long-term issue unless you solve the short-term issue."
Mr. Gregg calls some of those lobbies, especially those representing the elderly, "outrageous scaremongers." The real threat to economic security, he said, is a deficit that promises to bankrupt the Government within a few decades.
Still, some of Mr. Gregg's proposals seem to have a streak of ideological purity that belies the complexity of both the deficit and of national politics.
While House Republicans would attach certain Federal strings to welfare block grants, for example, like limiting payments to unwed mothers, Mr. Gregg would simply let the states run them as they choose. Indeed, he would eventually end Federal welfare grants, lower Federal tax rates to reflect that and tell the states to pay for the programs by raising taxes themselves.
Such straightforward logic troubles some in Congress who note that many states -- like New Hampshire, which does not even have an income tax -- have little appetite for a tax increase, and might cut support for the poor to unacceptable levels. Mr. Gregg agreed that was a problem -- but with state control, he said, comes state responsibility.
"He's one of the most conservative men in the Senate," said a top aide to a Democratic senator. "The difference between Judd Gregg and us soft, pudgy liberals is that I don't have the stomach for that gamble. And it's a big gamble."
True enough, but not all of Mr. Gregg's allies are ideological conservatives. Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who is a paragon of moderation, has sat in on Mr. Gregg's budget meetings and says his ideas have much merit.
"I think the moderates are deficit hawks," Mr. Chafee said. "They are willing to take some serious steps to do something about it."
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for many of the programs Mr. Gregg wants to trim, said he not only agreed with many of Mr. Gregg's views, but also might even go farther in some areas.
"I don't find the public unwilling to sacrifice if they think the sacrifice is fairly shared and we explain why," Mr. Packwood said.

HEADLINE: Delta Limits Commissions, Stirring Outrage of Agents

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
In the most dramatic escalation yet of a simmering dispute between Delta Air Lines and travel agents, the airline imposed a limit yesterday on commissions for domestic air fares, and agents reacted with the fury of partners scorned.
Their anger was stoked by fear that if Delta succeeded, the other major carriers -- all of which are also looking to cut costs -- might soon follow suit. 
 "If the other airlines go along, it will put about 10,000 agencies out of business," said Blake Fleetwood, head of the Planetarium/American Express agency in Manhattan.
Jeanne Epping, chairman and president of the American Society of Travel Agents, said she was "shocked and outraged" by Delta's decision.
Agents also smarted at Delta's statement that the upper limit was effective immediately, not giving the trade group time to complain again to the Justice Department, as it did last fall when Delta lowered commissions on international fares to 8 percent from 10 percent.
Until yesterday, Delta had continued paying 10 percent on domestic bookings. Now, though, it will pay a maximum of $50 for any round-trip domestic ticket with a base fare above $500, and $25 for any one-way domestic ticket with a base fare above $250. The caps, which the carrier estimated would affect about 20 percent of its tickets issued by travel agents, apply to all tickets issued for travel in and between the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.
Consumers will not realize any savings on ticket prices as a result of the move. Indeed, some travel agents noted that they would have less incentive to book clients on Delta than on competing carriers that would pay them higher commissions.
Robert W. Coggin, senior vice president for marketing at Delta, argued that the realities of today's marketplace required substantial changes if the airline was to compete successfully. Delta has a goal of lowering annual operating costs $2 billion by mid-1997.
"It is no longer economically feasible to pay a fixed 10 percent commission for the distribution of all Delta tickets," Mr. Coggin said.
In the four quarters ending in June 1994, the airline paid $870 million in domestic commissions.
An industry analyst, Robert A. Moss, president of Travel Intelligence Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said, "I have to assume Delta made its decision yesterday because it wasn't bloodied after lowering the commission on international fares."
Carlson Wagons-Lits Travel, with more than 4,000 travel agencies worldwide, criticized Delta as "shortsighted."
"It doesn't cut costs; it just transfers them onto the backs of consumers via the travel agent," said Doug Cody, a spokesman for Carlson Wagons-Lits, which is one of Delta's most important customers.
Ivan Michael Schaeffer, president and chief executive of the Woodside Travel Trust of Bethesda, Md., with more than 130 agencies, described Delta's action as "inequitable and unfair." It fails to recognize that agents are not adequately compensated for their work when they write tickets for the Delta Shuttle or during fare wars, he said.
Mr. Coggin of Delta said the carrier realized that agents were not making a profit on every ticketing transaction. But commissions paid on high-revenue tickets, he said, "should not be used to subsidize the costs of a travel agent's other business transactions."
Delta said it decided on the commission limit, rather than reducing the base commission rate on all its domestic tickets, after considering its cost-reduction program and the specific costs that travel agents incur in writing tickets.
It said that to address "the legitimate business needs of travel agents who have contractual relationships with corporate customers," it would allow agents to continue collecting commissions up to 10 percent on that part of their business through March 31.
To do so, an agent must submit an affidavit to Delta stating that the agency has contractual obligations with one or more corporate accounts that need to be renegotiated as a result of the action taken yesterday.

HEADLINE: The Welfare Enigma

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
If anyone knew for sure how to lift people out of poverty, Americans would embrace the solution eagerly. It would make everyone's life safer and more prosperous.
But no one does know, and no one has known since people first started thinking and talking about the problem in biblical times. 
 Every plan to overhaul the nation's welfare system that has been proposed for the last 25 years has died on the vine, unable to resolve contradictions that are endemic to the debate.
The problem is not that anyone defends the existing system: politicians and scholars from all points on the political compass agree it is a mess, a costly hodgepodge of conflicting Federal and state programs that, as Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. said today, have "destroyed responsibility, diminished personal dignity and created economic disincentives that bar people from success."
Nor is there disagreement over goals. The welfare reform proposals of Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan and Clinton approached the matter from different perspectives, but their goals were the same: to get as many people as possible off welfare and onto payrolls and somehow to break the chain of dysfunction that keeps some families on relief for generation after generation.
The plan outlined today by Mr. Shaw, a Florida Republican, has the same goals but is grounded on three new principles: tough love for poor people, less cost for the Federal Government and more flexibility for the states.
But however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles, it will probably not become law either unless its Republican sponsors come to grips with the seemingly intractable contradictions that bedeviled all the other proposals of the last quarter century.
For instance, the least expensive and most efficient welfare system would simply give poor people cash, no strings attached. That would eliminate the bureaucracy that is one of the system's most costly and despised aspects. But simple handouts go against the grain. Most Americans believe that people who can work ought to. And getting people to work costs money.
The difficulty is that jobs are scarce in the inner cities and rural communities where welfare beneficiaries generally live. Many people on welfare are uneducated and have few skills. Job-training programs are expensive and often fruitless.
The Republican plan would require that, after two years on welfare, people take jobs or become part of some work program. But what jobs? What programs? Who would pay for them? So far, those questions have not been addressed.
The Government has succeeded in bringing only one group of Americans out of poverty: the elderly.
Thirty years ago, a third of the aged lived in poverty, and tens of millions of others avoided destitution only by living with their children. Now, mostly because of expanded Social Security benefits and the advent of Medicare, the poverty rate among the elderly is substantially lower than it is for other Americans, and the vast majority of older people are financially self-sufficient.
Federal assistance to the elderly has been universally accepted. Why? Because the aged are not expected to work. So the trade-off between work and benefits does not arise.
Another contradiction is what to do about people's welfare checks after they go to work. If they are going to be cut off from public assistance, there is little incentive for welfare beneficiaries to take low-paying jobs. But if Government payments continue after they go work, they will have more income than those they are working with side-by-side who have never been on welfare.
And what about those on welfare who simply cannot work because they are mentally or emotionally unstable or physically disabled? By some estimates, 20 percent or more of welfare recipients fit into this category. Theoretically, they could be covered by a Government program called Supplemental Security Income, which used to be called aid to the aged, blind and disabled, or their children could be placed in foster care.
But the S.S.I. program has been rife with fraud, and the Republicans have promised to crack down. Furthermore, it would cost considerably more to put adults on S.S.I. and children in foster homes than to make welfare payments.
The architects of welfare programs have also never resolved what to do about the root of most welfare cases -- unwed mothers. All politicians from Senator Phil Gramm of Texas to the Rev. Jesse Jackson want to discourage teen-age pregnancies, but hard as they have tried over the years, the problem has become worse.
Still, few politicians if any advocate mandatory abortions for women on welfare who become pregnant, and few would require women on welfare to use implanted contraceptives to prevent further pregnancies.
The Republican solution is to disallow welfare payments to unmarried mothers under 18 and to prohibit additional payments to women who have children while they are on welfare.
Liberals object to this idea because they think it punishes innocent children, and many conservatives are opposed because they fear it would encourage abortions.
Most social workers who have spent time with poor, young women doubt that changes in welfare policy would prevent pregnancies. In a paper published in this year's Rockefeller Institute Bulletin, Jan L. Hagen and Liane V. Davis, both professors of social work, described their interviews with mothers on welfare.
One woman who they said was typical told them: "You're young, you're madly in love with this guy and you go and have this baby. Welfare doesn't have nothing to do with your having babies. Nothing. Nothing whatsoever."
A final contradiction upon which previous efforts to change the welfare system have become snagged involved the relationship between Federal and state requirements.
No one disputes Mr. Shaw's assessment that "the welfare problems of the South Bronx are not the same as the welfare problems of South Dakota."
But many experts question the Republican solution to turn the matter over to the states and to freeze for the next five years the amount of Federal money spent in each state.
Isabel V. Sawhill, an academic specialist in welfare policy who recently left a top position in the Office of Management and Budget to take an endowed chair at the Urban Institute, a research organization here, said she could not understand why some governors had embraced the Republican plan.
"I think they're kidding themselves about how much they can save through administrative efficiency," she said. "I'm afraid they're either going to pass the burden on to local governments or they're going to leave people homeless and have to take the blame for it."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Kohl Criticize Chechnya Assault but Stress Support for Yeltson

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany today criticized Russia's assault on Chechnya but said it was nonetheless vital to continue supporting President Boris N. Yeltsin, warning that anti-democratic forces could take power in Moscow if the West abandoned him.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl -- the two Western leaders who are closest to Mr. Yeltsin -- faulted Russia for using such heavy force and urged it to end the war in the breakaway region of Chechnya as quickly as possible even as they gave the Russian leader their strongest embrace since Moscow first attacked Chechnya in December. 
 At a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Kohl said, "If we were to push the forces of reform and the President into a corner, isolate them, and say, 'We give up on you -- there's nothing we can do here,' then this will immediately bring us back to the old, bad structures of the past."
Mr. Kohl is in Washington for one day to discuss Chechnya, Bosnia, expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other issues with Mr. Clinton and to meet the new Republican leaders in Congress.
To demonstrate concern about the crisis in Chechnya, Mr. Clinton announced today that the United States would provide $20 million in emergency aid to Chechnya to provide food, medicine and shelter.
Although many members of Congress have faulted the Administration for standing by Mr. Yeltsin despite Russia's offensive in Chechnya, Mr. Clinton said it was important not to let disagreements over the issue derail Washington's overarching strategy of improving ties with Moscow and encouraging reform there.
"You have to be willing to deal with the rough spots in the road, say where you disagree and stay on course," Mr. Clinton said, urging Russia to negotiate a peace settlement with the Chechens.
Mr. Clinton said he and Mr. Kohl had told Mr. Yeltsin that they feared that the conflict in Chechnya would undermine Russia's moves toward democracy and free markets. At the news conference, where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl boasted of their own and their countries' strong ties, the two leaders warned Mr. Yeltsin that foreign aid could be threatened if he reverses his moves toward democracy and capitalism.
"Today the Chancellor and I remained determined to stick to our course of patient, responsible support for Russian reform," Mr. Clinton said. "But help can only be extended if Russia stays on the course and continues the hard work of building democratic institutions and implementing market-oriented reforms."
Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl asserted that notwithstanding his role in invading Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin could still be trusted. Noting that the Russian leader kept his word by withdrawing all Russian troops from East Germany as promised, Mr. Kohl said, "I personally have experienced Boris Yeltsin as a man on whom one can rely absolutely."
While Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl were reaffirming support for Mr. Yeltsin, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told a Congressional subcommittee that the Administration's strategy was to concentrate on supporting specific policies, rather than specific personalities.
At the hearing, Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who heads the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, criticized the Administration for cozying up to Mr. Yeltsin despite his role in Chechnya and his closer ties with opponents of economic reform.
Mr. McConnell told Mr. Talbott, "Instead of being champions for democracy, we have become cheerleaders for Yeltsin, a President that is at this point virtually indistinguishable in practice from politicians you suggest we should dread."
Mr. Talbott denied that the Administration was focusing all its attention on Mr. Yeltsin, saying it was trying to maintain contacts with a range of reformers in Russia.
But he, too, urged Mr. Yeltsin not to veer from the road toward democracy and free markets.
"Chechnya has raised questions old and new about where Russia is going and what kind of state it will be in the next century," Mr. Talbott said.
At their news conference, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl dwelt upon a concern that sent Mr. Yeltsin into a rage in December at a conference in Budapest: expanding NATO. The two leaders said the alliance would definitely expand eastward, but sought to reassure Russia that this would not pose a threat.
"We agreed that the inevitable process of NATO expansion will be gradual and open, that there will be no surprises," Mr. Clinton said.
The two leaders sought to reassure nations of the former Warsaw Pact that adding new countries to NATO is in no way intended to create new divisions in Europe.
Mr. Kohl said, "The extension of NATO is part of an overall security concept, which is intended to make sure that we do not get new boundaries within Europe, and that is why a close partnership with Russia and Ukraine is especially important."

HEADLINE: Record Lows Afflict the South, But Little Crop Damage Is Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Temperatures across the Southeast fell to record lows yesterday, the third consecutive day of abnormally cold weather brought by a high-pressure system.
Orlando, Fla., a tourist center in Central Florida, had a record low of 30 degrees for the date. Other cities posting record lows: Greer, S.C., 9 degrees; Bristol, Tenn., 1,; Huntsville, Ala., 14, and Columbus, Ga., 18. Key West, Fla., the southernmost part of the continental United States, tied its record of 49 degrees, set on Feb., 9, 1895. 
 In Georgia, 12 counties kept their schools closed after the State Department of Transportation warned that roads were still icy from the snow that fell early on Wednesday. More snow was forecast for last night in some areas. There were also school closings in other Southern states as well.
In Florida, crops mostly avoided frost damage because of low humidity. A National Weather Service meteorologist, Scott Carroll, said, "Farmers don't want to see freezing temperatures at the ground, which is what frost is. It didn't get a chance to form." Many farmers also sprayed crops with water to protect them from the cold.
Florida Citrus Mutual, the big growers' cooperative, said the economic effect of the cold on the Central Florida citrus belt would not be severe. Still, fruit pickers have been scurrying to harvest as much fruit as possible, and processing plants have been running around the clock.
In South Florida, the cold meant a banner sales day for Beach True Value hardware in Fort Lauderdale. "If I had more space heaters, I'd be selling them, but I can't seem to find any more," said Sandy Sadar, the store's co-owner.
At Myrtle Beach, S.C., two kayakers drew stares as they paddled through the 47-degree water of the Atlantic. "I guess it does take some insanity," said Chris Jensen, a Coastal Carolina University student. "It's pretty cold, but it's exercise."

HEADLINE: Dow Dips by 2.69 as Stocks Close Mixed

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday with many investors on the sidelines ahead of today's report on producer prices for January.
It was the third consecutive session in which stocks were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 2.69 points to close at 3,932.68, while the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1 point, to 480.19. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.67 points, to 785.44, led by strong gains in computer chip issues. 
 The market was weighed down by worries that today's Labor Department report on producer prices would show a pickup in inflation. Many traders were waiting to see if the inflation numbers confirm Wall Street's view that the economy was slowing enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates again.
 "If we get worse-than-expected numbers, look out," said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management, "There's definitely a lot of complacency with regard to future interest rate rises."
 Stocks rallied sharply last Friday after the Government's employment report for January suggested that the economy was slowing to a pace at which the Federal Reserve could curb its policy of raising short-term interest rates. Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies, cutting into earnings.
"The consensus is now that the Fed has done enough with the rates," said Bill Allyn, head of trading at Jefferies & Company. "Maybe Friday will just fortify that consensus, or it could maybe create a crack in the armor of that camp."
Semiconductor stocks led the rise in technology shares amid speculation that the industry's monthly book-to-bill report would show strong demand.
"The chips are up on the book-to-bill, and it's pulling the computer and systems up with it because you have to put those chips in something," said Thomas Schlesinger, an equity strategist at A. G. Edwards.
After the market closed, the Semiconductor Industry Association said the seasonally adjusted book-to-bill ratio rose to 1.10 in January from a seasonally adjusted ratio of 1.07 in December. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.10 indicates that for every $100 worth of products shipped, or billed, manufacturers received $110 of new orders, or bookings.
Shares of the Intel Corporation rose 7/8, to 77 1/2; Micron Technology Inc. gained 2 1/4, to 50 1/8; Hewlett-Packard added 2 7/8, to 106 1/8, and Apple Computer ended up 15/16 at 43 5/8.
AST Research Inc.'s AST Computer and Texas Instruments Inc. said they had reached a cross-license agreement covering personal computer patents, settling litigation between the two companies. Texas Instruments gained 3 3/8, to 78 3/8 ,and AST added 7/16 , to15 7/16 .
Amgen Inc. fell 4, to 66 3/4, after the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said it was not in acquisition talks with Amgen. Amgen surged 5 3/8 Wednesday on rumors of a deal. An initial public offering of Information Storage Devices Inc., a maker of circuits for voice recording and playback, jumped 12 1/4 from its starting price at $15.
America Online Inc. leaped 3 1/8, to 65 7/8, after reporting Wednesday that its fiscal second-quarter revenues more than tripled.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.39, to 446.33.
The N.Y.S.E. Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.46, to 261.21. The average share was down 5 cents.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
A Street Conservative -- George John Marlin

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
As the new executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, George J. Marlin, a self-described "street-corner conservative" from Queens, now faces a fundamental philosophical challenge: running the kind of expansive governmental agency whose very agenda he might otherwise oppose.
The Port Authority's mission from its inception has been to use its quasi-governmental powers, coupled with its ability to issue bonds and condemn property, to promote the economies of the two states, something very much at odds with the beliefs of free-market conservatives like Mr. Marlin. 
 Indeed, the new Republican Governors of the two states have made it clear that some of the Port Authority's responsibilities, like managing the region's airports, may be better left to the private sector, and Mr. Marlin may be just the person to carry out that transformation.
Last month, Gov. George E. Pataki recommended Mr. Marlin for the $170,000-a-year post, which technically is filled by the Port Authority board but in fact has for two decades been subject to nomination by New York's governor with the consent of New Jersey's. This week, after expressing reservations about Mr. Marlin's lack of administrative experience, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman told Mr. Pataki that she would go along with his recommendation.
The son and grandson of New York City police officers, George John Marlin, 42, is an investment banker, amateur historian and editor of anthologies of the English writer G. K. Chesterton's wit. Unlike his predecessors at the Port Authority, all of whom were steeped in public sector administration and crisis management, Mr. Marlin has never served in government.
Nor, in his previous attempt at public office, did he even come close.
As the mayoral candidate of the Conservative and the Right-to-Life parties in 1993, he received 15,912 votes, or less than 1 percent of the total. During the campaign, Mr. Marlin portrayed himself as the lone conservative champion of the city's forgotten neighborhoods, a philosophical son of Archie Bunker's Queens running against Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, he said were both liberals.
"Whoever said there's no Democratic or Republican way of picking up the garbage was wrong," Mr. Marlin said, referring to the comment by former Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, a Republican. "You have to have an underlying philosophy, principles that are built on that, and from there you establish public policy. I have a world view: government is fundamentally failing the city."
"We have to make government small," he said in an interview last year. "It's government that drives business out."
Mr. Marlin has given few clues as to how he would reconcile his aversion to big government with his new job. In earlier interviews, though, he said he favored selling the land beneath the region's three major airports to private investors and exploring the sale of the World Trade Center, too -- asset sales that, once bondholders are paid, might prove less of a windfall.
Some maintain that Mr. Marlin, a true outsider, is a natural for the job.
"George Marlin is a highly intelligent guy, a very thoughtful person and a very caring person," said Michael Long, the state Conservative Party chairman. "While he has a strong point of view, he's also a very logical individual who knows you have to work within the system."
Mr. Marlin, a lanky 6-foot-6 look-a-like for the actor Edward Herrman, was born Dec. 9, 1952, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to a family of what he calls "Al Smith Democrats." He attended Monsignor Clancy High School in Jackson Heights, Queens, and graduated from Iona College with a degree in political science and philosophy. He then went to work for Marine Midland Bank in Buffalo, where he met his wife, Barbara.
But a few Buffalo winters brought the Marlins back to New York City, where they Marlins bought a 90-year-old row house in Glendale. Mr. Marlin joined United States Trust Company as a portfolio manager and specialist in public finance. Barbara Marlin is an executive secretary at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment banking firm.
Mr. Marlin was the first enrolled Republican in his family. As a 13-year-old, he distributed campaign leaflets for William F. Buckley Jr., the Conservative candidate for mayor in 1965. Later, he forged links with political leaders and elected officials as the representative of a coalition of police officers who were laid off during the city's 1975 fiscal crisis.
But it was the dispute over condom availability in the public schools that propelled him into politics a generation later, and helped earn him the nomination of the Conservative Party in the 1993 mayoral race. (He flatly opposed the Board of Education's condom plan as pre-empting parental prerogatives.) His effect on the mayoral campaign was marginal, though, and largely nonideological: All three major candidates never debated together because Mr. Dinkins demanded that Mr. Marlin be included -- to help undermine Mr. Giuliani's conservative support.
Mr. Marlin's mayoral campaign slogan was "It's our city, fight back," by which he meant, he said, that all of the city's neighborhoods needed to fend off "social engineers" employed by the government who had abrogated power and arrogantly exercised it.
He acknowledged that his predominantly white ethnic neighborhood might no longer be representative of the city. But he described it as emblematic of the bootstrap spirit among immigrants that is revitalizing other neighborhoods.
"This is a formula that worked," he said then. "These neighborhoods, when they thrive, the city thrived. But they've been hurt and government has hurt them."
The Marlin home looks much like it might have a century ago, the drawing room crammed with the New York and political memorabilia and books by and about Chesterton that constitute Mr. Marlin's avocation. One anthology, which Mr. Marlin edited with two friends, includes two relevant quotations:
"What we need, as the ancients understood, is not a politician who is a business man, but a king who is a philosopher," Chesterton wrote. He also said, "He is a very shallow critic who cannot see an eternal rebel in the heart of the conservative."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Seeking stability, Wells Rich Greene BDDP sets up a satellite shop.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ONE of Madison Avenue's best-known creative teams will run a satellite shop spun off from Wells Rich Greene BDDP.
Charlie Moss, the agency's vice chairman and corporate creative director, and Stan Dragoti, the Hollywood director who has collaborated with him on advertising campaigns since 1968, have become chairman and president of a creatively focused spinoff named Moss/Dragoti. The embryonic agency will be based in space adjacent to the Wells Rich office in midtown Manhattan. 
 The satellite, indicative of a growing trend for larger agencies to set up such spinoffs, is part of ambitious efforts by Wells Rich to regain its footing after two years of problems caused by the loss or resignation of important accounts like Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine, Continental Airlines, I.B.M., Reckitt & Colman and Seagram's spirits brands.
"We've gone through a lot of restructuring and changing people at the top," said Kenneth S. Olshan, chairman and chief executive at Wells Rich Greene BDDP Communications, the parent of Wells Rich, which is owned by BDDP Worldwide in Paris.
"We hope what we're doing is evolving the agency into something with a different configuration that will be very competitive for the future," he added.
Moss/Dragoti embodies that, Mr. Olshan said, because it is aimed at a pressing client need: to hire the "very senior people" at agencies who "have the ability to work very quickly to solve problems."
"Don't fire your agency," he added, as if talking to a potential client of Moss/Dragoti. "When you run into a corner and you can't solve a problem, here are two great guys -- who are grown-ups -- to solve it for you."
Adweek has called Mr. Moss, 56, a copywriter, the "creative soul" of Wells Rich; he was the first creative staff member hired in 1966 by Mary Wells Lawrence, the agency's co-founder. Mr. Dragoti, 60, joined Wells Rich to head the art department in 1968 after stints as an art director at Compton Advertising and Young & Rubicam.
The pair was responsible for a popular series of humorous commercials for the American Motors Corporation, featuring actors like Robert De Niro, Richard Dreyfuss and Herb Edelman pitching oddball car models like the Matador and the Rebel. There are many agency executives, and not a few consumers, who can still recall the catch phrase "Hey, Javelin!" from one spot.
Mr. Dragoti left Wells Rich in 1971 for a film career that has included directing the hit comedies "Mr. Mom" and "Love at First Bite." But for the last two decades, the duo has continued to work together on a transcontinentally commuting basis, producing campaigns like "I <heart> New York" for the New York State Department of Economic Development, "Midasize" for the Midas International Corporation and "Hertz. Exactly" for the Hertz Corporation.
"A strategic creative resource -- that's the way we see ourselves," Mr. Moss said, adding, "We enjoy working together so much, and have wanted to work together full time for such a long time, this is a natural thing to happen."
Mr. Dragoti said: "I guess I'm an ad junkie. I'd rather do a big idea on the small screen than a small idea on the big screen."
Mr. Moss said spinoffs like Moss/ Dragoti; Amster Yard, from McCann-Erickson Worldwide, and Castle Underwood, from TBWA Advertising, "really speak to getting back to working more directly with clients, being more hands-on about the work and ideas being what really drive the business -- ideas that solve problems."
Moss/Dragoti will work for Wells Rich clients and seek its own accounts; for instance, the spinoff will handle the creative portion of the Hertz account while Wells Rich will continue handling account management and other services. Moss/Dragoti has also landed the account of Parallel Communications, a paging systems company in New York, for which the billings were not disclosed.
Moss/Dragoti will be owned by Wells Rich Greene BDDP Communications; Mr. Moss and Mr. Dragoti have been granted undisclosed stakes that Mr. Moss described as "a healthy participation." They also plan to make nontraditional compensation arrangements with clients such as taking equity interests.
"We feel we've made a lot of money for people over the years," Mr. Moss said, "and we think we can do it again. Why not share in that?"
There will be no successor to Mr. Moss at Wells Rich. Mr. Olshan said Linda Kaplan Thaler, who left J. Walter Thompson New York in June to join Wells Rich as executive vice president and executive creative director, would now become the senior creative executive. Two advertisers that have worked with her, Clairol and Toys "R" Us, recently awarded Wells Rich an account and an assignment, respectively.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Journal of Commerce Is Sold for $115 Million

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The British company that publishes The Economist magazine will pay $115 million to buy The Journal of Commerce from Knight-Ridder Inc., the companies said yesterday.
The Economist Group will buy The Journal of Commerce Inc., the New York-based company that includes the 21,000-circulation daily financial newspaper and its foreign editions, shipping magazines, industry directories and electronic data services that provide specialized trade and tariff information. 
 The sale must be approved by the boards of both companies.
Marjorie M. Scardino, the chief executive of the Economist Group, said yesterday that the international trade specialization of The Journal of Commerce Inc.'s products made it an attractive growth vehicle for The Economist Group in the United States and internationally.
Some analysts said the price was toward the upper end of prices recently paid for newspaper companies. Tod A. Jacobs, a newspaper analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated the price at 13 times the cash flow of the Journal of Commerce company and double its annual revenue, which he estimated at $55 million to $60 million.
Mrs. Scardino acknowledged that "it's not a bargain price."
"We paid partly for the brand name because we believe in quality," she said.
When asked her plans for the newspaper, Mrs. Scardino said, "We intend definitely to grow it." But she said sharp circulation increases were not necessarily the key to success for a publication like The Journal. She added that it was unlikely that there would be any substantial change in the newspaper's focus on international trade.
The newspaper's publisher, Don C. Becker, said it now accounts for about 35 percent of the company's revenue. Mr. Becker will remain as the newspaper's publisher and the president of the company.
James K. Batten, the chairman of Knight-Ridder, said in a statement that his company, which owns 29 daily and nondaily newspapers and financial data information services, was "developing a strategy that moves us away fom the specialized market The Journal of Commerce serves."
Knight-Ridder said it would use the proceeds of the sale to reduce debt and buy shares. Shares of Knight-Ridder were unchanged at $51.125 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The 168-year-old Journal of Commerce was bought in 1927 by Ridder Publications, one of the companies that merged to become Knight-Ridder in 1974.
The Economist magazine's corporate parent is the Economist Newspaper Ltd., a private company of which Mrs. Scardino, who is American, is the chief executive. The company's formal name includes the word newspaper because The Economist, which has always been bound like a magazine, used to refer to itself as a newspaper and was published on newsprint. The company calls itself the Economist Group.
Half the stock of the Economist Newspaper Ltd. is owned by Pearson P.L.C., the British company that publishes The Financial Times of London and owns, among other businesses, Madame Tussaud's wax museums. The Economist Newspaper Ltd. has its own board and is not controlled by Pearson.
In addition to The Economist, the weekly news and business magazine, the Economist Group publishes other magazines including CFO, a magazine for financial executives, and sells analyses and forecasts on countries and businesses to business clients. It also publishes Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.

HEADLINE: Bradley Switches to Offense;
A Senator Seeks to Fill a Leadership Void in Washington

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In the last two weeks, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has suggested on a radio show that President Clinton could face a primary election challenge in 1996 and issued a press release attacking the President's budget. He also delivered a nearly two-hour speech on the Senate floor, denouncing what he called Mr. Clinton's failure to adequately slash the deficit or address the enormous problems facing cities and children.
"That's not thinking about tomorrow," he said repeatedly in the Senate speech Tuesday, playing off Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign theme song, "Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow.)" 
 Today, he delivered another major address, at the National Press Club, where he outlined proposals for promoting parental responsibility and campaign reform -- drawing questions, as he so often does these days, about a possible Presidential candidacy.
But a more likely explanation of Mr. Bradley's recent actions is that he is simply stepping into a void in the Senate's Democratic leadership, trying as best he can to influence the President on fiscal and urban policy -- and speaking his mind because he feels he can.
In 1990, he said, he was forever changed -- "liberated," as he puts it -- by the near-death experience of almost losing his Senate seat to Christine Todd Whitman, who went on to become Governor of New Jersey, chiefly because he was respectfully silent on the tax policy of his fellow Democrat, Gov. Jim Florio, with which he disagreed.
"For 12 years, I was very cautious and I spoke primarily from my mind, and after '90, I decided to speak from my heart as well as my mind, and decided to as much as possible be candid with people and tell the truth," he said in an interview in his office earlier this week. "After the narrow win, when I hadn't spoken out on how I felt in terms of the Florio tax increase, I decided that was never going to happen again.
"I decided I would no longer be restrained from saying what I really felt about issues, that there was a role in American politics for a truth teller and that I was going to try as much as possible to fill that role, because it was essential and because it actually fit my personality, and I had kind of been suppressing that part of my personality for a long time."
In more than 30 years in public life, there has never been a hint of scandal involving Mr. Bradley, a former Rhodes scholar and New York Knick, who seems ideally suited for this self-appointed role.
Mr. Bradley said he does not feel his criticism of the President constitutes a betrayal. "I think frankly he should benefit from having people tell him the truth," he said.
And while it may be frustrating for the President to be undercut by a member of his own party, Senator Bradley is not seen as malicious by the White House, but merely excessively candid.
George Stephanopoulos, senior advisor to the President, said: "Bill Bradley is a well-respected Senator with a lot of strong views on a lot of subjects. And I believe we agree on more than we disagree on, but that doesn't mean there won't be differences at times."
In the Senate, Mr. Bradley is something of a loner and a charmingly idiosyncratic figure, who on a recent afternoon loped into his office, where a plant had been potted in a sawed-off basketball, and produced a piece of fruit from his pocket. "Hi, would you like an apple?" he said by way of introduction.
Seated at his desk, surrounded by modern art and family photos, Mr. Bradley said he chiefly wanted to prod the President to further reduce the deficit and to speak out more about race and diversity.
However uncalculated the effect, distancing himself from the President could well help Mr. Bradley in his increasingly Republican home state as he campaigns for a fourth term, which he said he would seek in 1996.
Meanwhile, as a member of the Senate minority, Mr. Bradley said he must rely on a defensive strategy to block passage of some legislation, like the repeal of parts of the crime bill.
In the 1965 basketball biography about Mr. Bradley, "A Sense of Where You Are," the author John McPhee wrote, "The depth of Bradley's game is most discernible when he doesn't have the ball."
There is some evidence that as a legislator, Mr. Bradley is actually most effective then, too. While in the minority from 1980 to 1986, he invented a strategy to cut tax rates and do away with many special provisions and tax shelters. Even while remaining largely behind the scenes, he became a chief engineer of the 1986 tax reform.
In today's speech, he advocated equally sweeping changes, and further challenged assumptions about political allegiances, saying:
"Never in American history has a new vision begun in Washington; never has it been the sole property of either political party. In fact, to initiate a frank discussion of our current American condition requires us to throw off many of the barnacle-encrusted categories with which we are accustomed to talking about this nation's problems.
"This could seriously disrupt the respective moral allegiances and political turfs of both the Democratic and Republican parties."
He added, "I would like to start making that disruption happen" because neither the market approach favored by Republicans nor the governmental solutions often offered by Democrats can work without the communal ties, the human connections, that he said are increasingly rare.
After reeling off statistics about the soaring rate of illegitimate births, he suggested that parental responsibility should be enforced.
"Policy should send a very clear message," he told the audience. "If you have sex with someone and she becomes pregnant, be prepared to have 15 percent of your wages for 18 years to go to support the mother and child."
He also suggested that campaign finance reform be accomplished by allowing taxpayers to contribute up to $200 for Congressional campaigns for Congress by checking a box on their tax returns, with all the money equally divided among candidates.
And when asked, inevitably, about his Presidential intentions, he did not entirely dismiss the possibility, though it seems remote, since he has done no fund-raising.
"For 16 years, I kept issuing Shermanesque statements" denying any interest in running, "and nobody believed them," the Senator said, grinning. "So now, as a change of pace, I've decided to be ambiguously definitive, or is it definitively ambiguous?"

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bradley's Speech to the Press Club

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Here are excerpts from a speech delivered to the National Press Club by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company.
Today, I will suggest that any prescription for America must understand the advantages and limits of both the market and government, but, more importantly, how neither is equipped to solve America's central problems, which are the deterioration of our civil society and the need to revitalize our democratic process. 
 Civil society is the place where Americans make their homes, sustain their marriages, raise their families, hang out with their friends, meet their neighbors, educate their children, worship their God. It's in churches, schools, fraternities, community centers, labor unions, synagogues, sports leagues, P.T.A.'s, libraries, and barbershops. It's where opinions are expressed and refined, where views are exchanged and agreements made, where a sense of common purpose and consensus are forged. It lies apart from the realms of the market and the Government, and it possesses a different ethic.
The market is governed by the logic of economic self-interest, while the Government is the domain of laws with all their course of authority. Civil society, on the other hand, is the sphere of our most basic humanity -- the personal, everyday realm that is governed by values such as responsibility, trust, fraternity, solidarity and love. . . .
What both Democrats and Republicans fail to see is that the Government and the market are not enough to make a civilization. There must be a healthy, robust civic sector, a space in which the bonds of community can flourish. Government and the market are similar to two legs on a three-legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society, the stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital America. . . .
Public policy . . . can help facilitate the revitalization of democracy and civil society, but it cannot create civil society. We can insist that fathers support their children financially, but fathers have to see the importance of spending time with their children. We can figure out ways, such as parental leave, to provide parents with more time with their children, but parents have to use that time to raise their children. We can create community schools, but communities have to use them. We can provide mothers and fathers with the tools they need to influence the storytelling of the mass media, but they ultimately must exercise that control. We can take special interests out of elections, but only people can vote. We can provide opportunities for more deliberative citizenship, at both the national and the local level, but citizens have to seize these opportunities and take individual responsibility.
We also have to give the distinctive moral language of civil society a more permanent place in our public conversation. The language of the marketplace says, "Get as much as you can for yourself." The language of government says, "Legislate for others what is good for them." But the language of community, family, citizenship, at its core, is about receiving undeserved gifts. What this nation needs to promote is the spirit of giving something freely without measuring it out precisely or demanding something in return. . . .
Above all, we need to understand that a true civil society in which citizens interact on a regular basis to grapple with common problems will not occur because of the arrival of a hero. Rebuilding civil society requires people talking and listening to each other, not blindly following a hero. I was reminded of that a few weeks ago, the temptation of the knight in shining armor, when a cover of a national magazine had General Colin Powell's picture on it and the caption was something like, "Will He Be the Answer to Our Problems?" If the problem is a deteriorating civic culture, then a charismatic leader, be he the President or a general, is not the answer. He or she might make us feel better momentarily. But then if we are only spectators thrilled by the performance, how have we progressed collectively?
A character in Bertolt Brecht's "Galileo" says, "Pity the nation that has no heroes," to which Galileo responds, "Pity the nation that needs them." All of us have to go out in the public square, and all of us have to assume our citizenship responsibilities. For me, that means trying to tell the truth as I see it to both parties and to the American people without regard for consequences. In a vibrant civil society, real leadership at the top is made possible by the understanding and evolution of leaders of awareness at the bottom and the middle; that is, citizens engaged in a deliberative discussion about our common future.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Drops Slightly Ahead of Price Data Today

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly against leading currencies in quiet, directionless trading yesterday as dealers awaited January producer price data for indications on the direction of the United States economy and interest rates.
"The dollar has been locked in a tight range," said Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York. "We haven't had any substantive information on the economy all week. The market is marking time." 
 In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5286 German marks from 1.5305 marks on Wednesday and to 1.2927 Swiss francs from 1.2955 francs. The dollar was unchanged at 98.90 Japanese yen. The British pound, which had touched a one-month low of $1.5502 on Wednesday, rose yesterday to $1.5575 from $1.5534.
In early trading in New York, the dollar followed the bond market lower as fixed-income traders braced for yesterday's sale of $11 billion in 30-year bonds, the last part of the Treasury's $40 billion quarterly debt sales. Bond traders were also worried that a report on producer prices due today will show higher inflation.
But stronger-than-expected demand at the Treasury auction helped lift the dollar. Increased interest in American bonds tends to bolster the currency, as foreign investors and United States interests leaving overseas markets must first buy dollars to purchase the securities.
Still, the dollar's gains were capped by weakness in the secondary market for bonds, where investors were selling in anticipation of a rise in producer prices. Inflation erodes the value of securities that pay a fixed rate of return.
While inflation is at the lowest level in decades, many dealers and analysts expect that current strong economic growth will force prices higher.
John Rothfield, an international economist at Nationsbank in Chicago, said he expected a jump of five-tenths of a percent in the Producer Price Index for January. "I don't think the bond market would digest that very well," he added. A slump in United States bonds would hurt the dollar.
But higher inflation could help prod the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again. The Fed has raised rates seven times since last February in an effort to cool the economy and forestall inflation.
Higher United States rates mean better returns on dollar deposits and thus tend to attract capital flows into the currency.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The $20 Billion Inquiry

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
This Clinton-Mexico affair reminds me of the time a fellow editor came up to my desk in the newsroom, put a piece of paper in front of me and told me to sign it. When I asked why, he said I was to be his co-signer on a loan.
You can understand I did not want to be crude but I did ask how much as I was writing my fool name. He looked at me, coolness trembling on disdain, and then picked up the signed paper. As he walked away he said over his shoulder: "Bad form, old boy, bad form." Well, I was ashamed of myself and didn't get up and snatch the paper back. 
 The bailout loan from the Clinton Administration to Mexico is a done deal and can't be snatched away. Maybe we ought to shut up now and be nice -- grateful that Americans got away with billions less in risk than Mr. Clinton first demanded.
Certainly most members of Congress seem terrified of being vulgar enough to press questions -- who knew what when and who benefited how much.
But here's happy news: At least some senators are promising to demand accounting and explanation from the Administration. Alfonse D'Amato, Republican of New York, promises hearings in the Banking Committee, which he heads.
Senator Connie Mack of Florida and four other Republicans -- I seem to be writing a lot about Republicans -- have asked the Treasury to produce the documents that may show why the Administration did not warn the public until Mexico's default was days away.
President Clinton apparently was surprised when members of Congress and the public showed the bad form to protest when he suddenly came up and said here, sign a $40 billion bailout loan guarantee for Mexico.
So, faced with impudent objections, he went over the heads of Congress and public and issued a loan by executive power. But he did cut the check to $20 billion, a straight loan.
That is even riskier than a loan guarantee. And when we figure in how much American money is involved in the package of international loans, we are in the pot for at least $8 billion more. But who's counting?
Senator D'Amato for one. On the Senate floor Wednesday he broke company with the Republican leaders who had cried "Good show, old boy" when the President stepped over them. Senator D'Amato does not know from good show or old boy.
He denounced Mr. Clinton for "economic blackmail": the warnings that Mexico would crumble without the bailout, stock markets around the world would crash and veritable hordes of Mexicans would flood across the borders. As for the oil-revenue "collateral," said the Senator, we would have to send in the 82d Airborne to collect.
The Administration's line is that without the loan Mexico would become a falling domino that would bring down the whole investment network.
Strange, but America's European allies, who have quite a few marks, pounds and francs invested abroad, do not buy it. They made no direct loans to Mexico and had to be pushed by Washington into accepting the international part of the bailout.
Among other loan skeptics, I understand Mexico's great importance to the U.S. But Americans should not be offered just an aid deal for Mexico, but a square one -- with information, notice and inquiry. They are essential to U.S. democracy, not to be surrendered whenever bureaucrats or investors get panicky.
The U.S. had political capital invested in Mexico -- one reason decent notice was not given of a coming disaster. As for investors, the financial guru Henry Kaufman wrote in The Wall Street Journal that many analysts and economists had become part of a broad marketing, underwriting and distribution network that compromised their own objectivity. That is scary.
Maybe the D'Amato inquiries will tell us how many billions Mexico's top families have salted away abroad and whether anything was done to get that money back home to help their own country. Or which American and Mexican investment companies profited most and how close they are to their governments.
The hearings won't make the U.S.-Mexico botch-up more acceptable. But it could help avoid another last-minute bailout, maybe. At least senate hearings will make us feel we are not complete idiots, which we certainly would be if we silently signed the papers on the desk, with a silly smile on our faces.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
Poked, Prodded, Timed and Tested

BYLINE: By Thomas George 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
When running back Garrison Hearst arrived here at the National Football League scouting combine two years ago, he was eager, hopeful and full of promise. And it was here where Hearst's knee injury was discovered and where several teams teams became cool toward him. He was fortunate. He survived, slipping from the favorite to be the No. 1 pick to being chosen No. 3 by the Arizona Cardinals in the 1993 N.F.L. draft.
When safety Eric Turner arrived at the combine four years ago, he was a top prospect but several other defensive backs had caught more of the pro scouts' fancy. Turner, however, ran the 40-yard sprint in under 4.4 seconds. Run under 4.4 and you turn heads. And Turner certainly did, vaulting himself into a higher draft spot, all the way to the second pick, owned by the Cleveland Browns, in the 1991 draft. 
 Welcome to the N.F.L. scouting combine. You can fall. You can rise. You can discourage. You can impress.
And you do so before more than 900 N.F.L. personnel, including owners and coaches and trainers and physicians and even psychiatrists. It is here each year in early February where the best college football players are poked and prodded, timed and tested. This year's session opened yesterday and concludes on Monday.
It is a major stepping stone for the N.F.L. draft on April 22.
All season long, pro scouts have scoured the nation scrutinizing the best that college football has to offer. Some scouts say that as much as 70 percent of their evaluation of players' abilities comes from their seasonlong look. Here at the combine, they gain the chance to reaffirm their beliefs -- or create new ones.
"I don't see a lot of guys rise from these workouts but quite a few of them fall," said Steve Trimble, a defensive assistant coach with the Jets last season who has since joined the New Orleans Saints in a similar role.
"One important thing you look at is how a guy runs here," said Jon Kingdon, the Los Angeles Raiders' director of player personnel. "But even if you run badly, you can make that up in a private workout later. The players have built-in excuses. It's the middle of winter even though they are running in a domed stadium. They haven't had a lot of work since their season was over. So, you can fall but you can get right back up. What we've seen more of over the years is an increase in size. These players just keep getting bigger and bigger, and it's not steroids, because we test for that. The steroids and the other drug tests have come back with more negatives in recent years. That is also a good sign."
Some view this event as a huge meat market with more than 300 players attending. The players are grouped in three categories: offensive and defensive linemen; quarterbacks, receivers and running backs, and linebackers, tight ends and defensive backs. Among the activities are the 40-yard sprint, weight lifting, various skill drills, intelligence and personality questionnaires and medical examinations. Among the popular players here this weekend are Miami defensive lineman Warren Sapp, Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair and Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins.
Some college stars come but refuse to work out. They know they are not in their best shape and save their workouts for later, private dates on their campuses. It is the personality aspect of this combine that makes it most worthwhile, Kingdon said.
"Because of the money you are investing, you have to know as much about the player off the field as you do on the field," Kingdon said. "Here you get to look the guy in the eye and find out something about him, so the interview process here has sort of exploded. And you get to watch him compete against the best from around the country."
It is a coaching convention, of sorts. Long-time friends in the coaching fraternity meet and new friendships are made. Unemployed coaches come with resumes in hand. Ideas are shared.
So, with everyone looking at the same thing, how can so many mistakes be made in the draft? How does a team with two picks in the first round pass over a guy who becomes an All-Pro for someone else? It happens because scouting is such an inexact science. You can measure someone's time in the 40 and the weight they can bench press. Measuring heart and dedication is another matter.
The combine began in 1982 and was held in several other cities, including Dallas, New Orleans and Seattle, before settling here in the mid 1980's. Some of the top performances ever? Well, Deion Sanders, now the flashy cornerback from the San Francisco 49ers, arrived and ran close to a 4.3 in the 40. Chris Spielman of the Detroit Lions ran a horrible 40 but then excelled in the 20-yard shuttle, showing his lateral movement and many of the quick reaction traits that have made him one of the game's best linebackers.
The exceptional this year? A good place to look is among offensive linemen. Scouts here say that position is the deepest among all groups.
The most successful N.F.L. teams use a combination of three areas -- the draft, free agency and trades -- to build their strongest rosters. Most N.F.L. teams, however, still yearn to build from within, to obtain their own players from the start and to train them from Day One in that team's particular system. Free agency has altered that formula but has not destroyed it.
Thus, here, in part, is where Super Bowls are won.

HEADLINE: New Claims by Jobless Fall

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off Americans filing claims for jobless benefits dropped by 8,000 last week to the lowest level in more than two months.
The Labor Department reported today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 318,000, down from 326,000 in the week that ended on Jan. 28. 
 It was the smallest number of new claims since 316,000 were filed in the week that ended on Nov. 26. Many analysts had expected little change from the previous week.
Except for a two-week period at the beginning of the year, claims have been about the 325,000 level since last summer. This level, analysts contend, reflects a strong job market.

HEADLINE: Republicans Advance Proposal To Replace the Welfare System

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
House Republican leaders moved today to undo more than a half-century of social welfare policy by proposing to eliminate the right of poor women and children to receive cash assistance from the Government.
In place of the welfare program established 60 years ago as part of the Social Security Act, Republicans said they wanted to make a lump sum payment of $15.3 billion a year, which the states could use "in any manner reasonably calculated" to assist needy families with children. This represents the amount spent in 1994; there would be no allowance for inflation. Benefits would no longer be automatically available to people who met certain criteria. 
 Republican leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the most hotly debated features of their proposal, which would deny cash assistance to hundreds of thousands of unmarried teen-age mothers and to most immigrants, including legal aliens.
These provisions, fleshed out today with new detail by Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, immediately encountered a barrage of criticism from some Republicans, from opponents of abortion and from liberal defenders of child welfare programs.
In a speech at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Shaw, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said the Republican proposal embodied "tough love," using hard measures to save poor people from a life of dependence on the dole.
The subcommittee will begin voting on welfare legislation next week. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, has promised a floor vote on the bill by mid-April, as part of the Contract With America. The Senate appears likely to support major changes to require welfare recipients to work. But Senator Bob Dole, the Republican floor leader, predicted last month that neither teen-age mothers nor legal immigrants would be cut from the rolls.
In a confidential memorandum to President Clinton on Jan. 19, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, harshly criticized the Republican proposal to abolish the individual entitlement to welfare benefits and replace it with a "block grant" to the states.
But the White House has taken a much more ambiguous position. Indeed, some Administration officials say President Clinton has sent subtle signals to Congress that he will not oppose converting the main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, into a block grant to the states.
At a news conference today, Mr. Clinton shied away from explicit criticism of the Republican proposal. The President, a former governor, said he was "willing to go a long way" toward letting the states design their own welfare programs, as governors have demanded.
Mr. Clinton spoke in general terms, saying: "There is a national interest in making sure that the food, the nutrition, the health care of the children of this country are protected."
Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Treasury and the Labor Department have said they want the White House to take a firm stand in favor of preserving the entitlement status of Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Mr. Clinton has so far avoided a confrontation with Republicans, saying only that the Federal Government should set national standards to protect poor children.
Under current law, poor people can file suit to get welfare benefits to which they are entitled. Mr. Shaw's bill would abolish "all entitlement of individuals to benefits" under Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
The Federal Government and the states now share the cost of this program. Mr. Shaw's proposal would eliminate any requirement for states to continue spending their own money, though Republicans said they hoped the states would do so. The Federal Government expects to spend $12.5 billion, or 1 percent of the Federal budget, on the program this year, while the states are expected to spend $10.3 billion.
Breaking with his party, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, denounced the proposal to deny cash assistance to children born out of wedlock to women under 18. In an interview today, Mr. Hyde said it was unfair to punish children for parents' behavior. "The children need clothing, shelter and nurture," Mr. Hyde said. "You don't want to reward promiscuous pregnancy, but on the other hand, you don't want to make the children suffer for the transgressions of the parents."
The Roman Catholic Church and the National Right to Life Committee also oppose this part of the Republican bill, saying it would probably increase abortions. "Many pregnant teen-agers will feel compelled to have abortions if they feel they cannot provide for their children or get A.F.D.C.," said Douglas D. Johnson, chief lobbyist of the National Right to Life Committee.
Mr. Shaw's bill would prohibit states from using Federal money to give extra welfare benefits to women who had additional children while they were on welfare. Many opponents of abortion object to this provision too.
Some Republicans also denounced the proposed denial of benefits for legal immigrants. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican whose Miami district includes many Cuban emigres, said the proposal would cut off aid to "many permanent resident aliens who have paid taxes and are willing to get drafted and fight for the United States."
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, described the prevailing view of his party. He said the Republican bill was "strong on punishing children and weak on getting their parents to work." Representative Harold E. Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, said, "This proposal is tough and mean, and it's directed at our most vulnerable citizens."
In June 1994, Mr. Clinton sent Congress a bill "to end welfare as we know it." Under his proposal, welfare would remain a right, and the bill would not cut off benefits for unmarried teen-agers. It would allow states to cap the amount of payments so there would be no extra allowance for children born to women already on welfare.
The Clinton bill would provide welfare recipients up to two years of education and training and would guarantee publicly financed jobs for people who could not find jobs in the private market. Under Mr. Shaw's bill, welfare recipients would have to work to get cash payments after two years, and in no event could they get assistance for more than five years.
Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for most welfare benefits, but legal immigrants have long been eligible for such assistance.
Mr. Shaw said he and his Republican colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee were planning a radical change. "Our bill will cut off most welfare benefits for most legal immigrants," he said. "Those age 75 and older will continue to receive welfare, and so too will legally recognized refugees."
In addition, a summary of Mr. Shaw's bill, prepared by his staff, says that noncitizens could qualify for some education and training programs, so they could obtain jobs and become productive citizens. Mr. Shaw said: "There will be some flexibility for the states. The details are still being worked out."
Mr. Clinton would permit legal aliens to get benefits, but he would tighten the eligibility rules. He would require American citizens to take greater financial responsibility for the immigrants they sponsored.

Chart: "IN THEIR OWN WORDS: From the G.O.P. Welfare Proposal"
 
Cash Grants
Spending on cash welfare will be capped for five years, saving taxpayers $7.6 billion.
States will be prohibited from using Federal tax dollars to:
--pay cash welfare to mothers under 18 who have children out of wedlock
--give extra payments to families that have more kids while on welfare
--pay cash welfare to a single family for more than five years.
 
Child Care
About a dozen current Federal child care progams will be merged into a block grant.
States will be given enormous flexibility to better serve their residents, simplify programs and save taxpayers money. We will at last do away with the old canard that more Federal spending equals more compassion.
 
Reducing the Rolls
Drug addicts and alcoholics will no longer be considered disabled.
Non-citizens will no longer be eligible for most welfare programs. (pg. A16)

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Backed by Business, G.O.P. Takes Steps To Overhaul Environmental Regulations

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Emboldened by their recent legislative victories and urged on by a powerful coalition of business groups, Republican lawmakers are taking the first steps toward redefining the basic premises of many environmental regulations.
Legislation moving rapidly through the House of Representatives would substitute economic calculations for health considerations as the determining factor in writing regulations governing air pollution, water quality, hazardous wastes and the like. 
 Two House committees late Wednesday night approved the legislation, which would subject every major new health, safety and environmental regulation to an elaborate process of scientific review to quantify the targeted risks. At the same time, the legislation would forbid any new regulation from being issued without a demonstration that its expected costs would be justified by its benefits.
"We took the first steps toward bringing the Federal regulatory monster under control," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who heads one of the committees that approved the bill.
The proposal, intended to roll back regulations that businesses consider unnecessarily costly, is part of the House Republicans' Contract With America, and the House is expected to take it up in two weeks. Companion bills have been introduced in the Senate, including one sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader. Three bills that are part of the contract have already sailed through the House, and two of them have passed the Senate.
While the Clinton Administration supports some elements of the Republican agenda, its senior officials have expressed alarm over the bill on regulations.
"What this does is undermine every single environmental and public health standard in the country," said Carol M. Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Although risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis are commonly used to examine proposed regulations issued under existing laws, they are arcane and often hotly disputed methods. So environmental laws often direct agencies to base their regulatory decisions primarily on broad health goals and on judgments of what pollution control methods are most suitable to help protect health and safety.
In drafting the new legislation, House Republicans this week turned those precedents upside down, just as they have been up-ending old assumptions across the political landscape ever since the election.
The bill's opponents said changes in the fine print of the bill had vastly expanded its scope, affecting not only how bureaucrats write regulations but also reversing fundamental decisions made by previous Congresses.
For example, Ms. Browner said, the Clean Air Act requires the agency to provide an "adequate margin of safety" in protecting the public's health by limiting the emissions of toxic pollutants, which can cause cancer, miscarriages and other medical problems. The new law, she said, would supersede this requirement and many others like it, requiring a calculation whether preventing these illnesses was worth the price of controlling the pollution.
A powerful alliance of industry groups is pushing the legislation hard, saying that it is only reasonable to insure that the costs of regulations do not exceed the benefits. The National Association of Manufacturers and trade associations representing plastics, electric utilities, food manufacturing and other industries are lobbying for the bill.
Environmental groups have assailed the measure, saying it is designed to wrap regulators in the red tape of risk assessments, studies, and litigation.
Ellen K. Silbergeld, a toxicologist affiliated with the Environmental Defense Fund, said the bill would "encourage use of junk science and hamstring programs designed to protect health, safety and the environment." The environmental group testified at the Commerce Committee's hearings on the legislation last week.
Until shortly before the Commerce and Science committees met on Wednesday, however, it was not clear that the proposals under consideration would explicitly supersede the existing criteria for making regulatory decisions.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of law," the bill approved by the committees said, "the requirements of this section shall supplement and, to the extent there is a conflict, supersede the decisional criteria for rule-making otherwise applicable under the statute pursuant to which the rule is promulgated."
Ronald White, the director of environmental health at the American Lung Association, said this change would make it much harder for the non-profit health organization to lobby for tougher air pollution regulations. The group, for example, is seeking tougher air quality standards for small particulate matter, which health studies show causes tens of thousands of deaths each year, and for sulfur dioxide, which can provoke asthma attacks.
Under existing law, those standards are set purely on the basis of what is healthy, Mr. White said, not on the basis of how much it would cost to clean the air. "There is a basic premise that people have a right to breath air that is not going to make them sick," he said. JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

HEADLINE: Let's Get Government Out of the Tractor Seat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 6 front-page article on the coming political fight over farm subsidies overlooks a key part of the policy debate. At issue is not just the cost of subsidies to the Treasury, but also the huge, indirect costs of misguided agricultural policies to rural communities, farmers and other links in the food chain of industries. 
 Perhaps the Government's chief policy error is the futile attempt to prop up crop prices by taking cropland out of production. During the past decade land retirement schemes have idled an annual average of 60 million acres -- 15 percent of total cropland -- in a failed attempt to manipulate prices by limiting supplies. These supply-management programs no longer work in a global economy where foreign competitors increase production in response to United States "set asides" and go after our customers.
During the same decade world demand for grains grew 18 percent, and global demand for oilseed crops grew by 28 percent, but United States production levels were flat, and foreign growers captured additional market share at the expense of American growers.
Acreage idling has a devastating effect up and down the chain of food and agribusiness industries. Government subsidies don't fully compensate farmers for the lost production and income opportunities.
Meanwhile, rural communities suffer because acreage cutbacks limit sales by agrichemical retailers, seed suppliers, tractor dealers and other Main Street businesses.
Lower crop volumes hurt grain elevators and merchants, barge operators, railroads and food processors. Even beef, dairy, hog and poultry growers are negatively affected by the limited supply of feed grains. All of this adds to the cost of food at home and subtracts from competitiveness abroad.
Compounding the problem is the lack of planting freedom. Growers are encouraged to plant subsidized "program crops" (such as wheat, corn feed grains, cotton and rice), even when the market is signaling for alternative crops, because diversification will jeopardize the acreage base upon which future Government payments are determined.
In other words, programs cause producers to grow for the program rather than for the market.
The food and agricultural system -- stretching from input suppliers and farmers to processors and retailers -- employs 21 million people and generates 16 percent of the nation's income.
The system has served consumers well by providing the world's most varied and least expensive retail food supply.
But it's time to get government out of the tractor seat and free up the food and agricultural system to compete in the new era of liberalized trade. That's why the Coalition for a Competitive Food and Agriculture System, consisting of more than 80 companies and trade associations representing all sectors of the food industry, have come together to work for market-oriented reforms in the 1995 farm bill.

HEADLINE: Sweden's Social Policies Put Us to Shame

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Deficit Reins In Sweden's Welfare State" (front page, Feb. 2) portrays Sweden's social and economic policies and its citizens as childishly naive. By leaving out information, you give a conservative American bias against Sweden's government-intensive economic and social approach and add fuel to American anti-government hysteria. 
 You mention that the Swedish Government has been forced to reduce the $100-a-child monthly payment it provides to families regardless of need. Sweden has been experiencing population decline for more than a decade, and this subsidy is designed to encourage population growth. It has shown success and is an example of effective social policy, not wasteful big government.
You conclude with a Swedish woman's suggestion that the Government develop a program wherein one of Sweden's 13 percent unemployed could take her job while she took off a paid year or two.
Since unemployed Swedish workers receive almost full compensation, this woman was not suggesting some new expensive social program but a way to spread the available work around that would help to keep the unemployed productive.
You make it seem as if Sweden is being forced to wake up to the reality the United States has figured out: big government and high taxes are wasteful and must be scaled back.
For more than half a century Sweden has been a potent example of how effective governmental economic and social involvement can be. It has provided its people with one of the highest standards of living in the world, along with amazingly low poverty and crime rates.
Compare the United States with Sweden in any negative social indicator, from drug use to teen-age pregnancy to domestic violence: Sweden puts us to shame. Sweden does not need to take a lesson from the United States.

HEADLINE: Give Lower West Side A Green Waterfront

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 4 news article on Roland W. Betts, the developer of the Chelsea Piers, on the Hudson River between 17th and 23d Streets in Manhattan, makes for an entertaining read. Unfortunately, it misses the point, which is not personalities but the future of the waterfront.
The waterfront is the last open space in Manhattan. It is on one of the great rivers of the world. To use this precious space for a glorified gym and shopping mall is shortsighted. There are many places in our city to build gyms and malls. There is only one waterfront.
One hundred fifty years ago, when New York had another large open space, it was not developed. Instead, a great park was built. Not only did Central Park become one of our cherished landmarks, a green sanctuary for millions of New Yorkers and visitors, but its presence also served as the engine for the development of the Upper East and West Sides for the next 100 years.
An all-green waterfront park with views of the Hudson would make the Lower West Side bloom and provide far more permanent jobs than dozens of Chelsea Piers. Like Central Park it would be an esthetic, social, environmental and economic boon. It would be real and lasting urban planning.

BYLINE: By Donald G. McNeil Jr. 

 BODY:

'Nunsense' Closing
"I don't know if we've just nunned everybody in New York to death or if it's just that everyone's suffered in the past year," says Dan Goggin, the author, director and producer of "Nunsense" and "Nunsense II." "But it's better to go out while you're hot than to run out of steam in the summer and have to sneak out of town."
Thus endeth the run. On Feb. 26, after more than nine years, the singing, dancing, wisecracking, habit-wearing kick line of Mount St. Helens High is leaving town. The cast and the "Nunsense II" set are going to Ford's Theater in Washington for what they hope will be 22 weeks. The "Nunsense I" set will winter in Maui and Las Vegas, picking up casts. 
 Financially, the show has "run real close to the line for the last year or so," Mr. Goggin said. Adding "Nunsense II" in October rejuvenated sales somewhat, but when Ford's asked for the New York cast, it made more sense to move lock, stock and rosary than to spend the money for a new cast and set at the John Houseman Theater.
However, there may be new orders. Mr. Goggin has ideas of bringing the show back in late fall to assay a brief, lucrative run at a Broadway house, if he can find a big-name star who can do for a wimple what Glenn Close does for a turban. "There are people who only want to go to a Broadway show, and we can play that game for a little bit," he said. "Or I may do something like 'Sister Mary Amnesia's Country Jamboree' at Town Hall for the holiday season."
And, he said, "Nunsense" the television series is looking closer to reality too. Ora pro nobis.
 
'Big' Too Big For Broadway
 When is a show too big to find a home? When it's "Big." It's the musical version of the Tom Hanks movie about a boy who gets his wish to be adult-sized and stumbles into the takeover of a toy company. It's in pre-production now for July previews in Boston.
Its problem? With 30-odd cast members directed by Mike Ockrent and dancing to Susan Stroman's choreography on hefty sets by Robin Wagner, there are few theaters that can hold it. The really big ones are locked up by well-dug-in shows, from graybeards like "Cats" to new hits like "Sunset Boulevard." James Freydberg, one of the "Big" producers, is hoping for an Oct. 12 opening date -- somewhere. " 'Victor/Victoria' has a deposit on the Marquis," he said. "The Neil Simon isn't exactly a musical house, but it has 'Shlemiel the First.' When 'Tommy' goes, the St. James is supposed to get 'Busker Alley.' The Shubert has 'Crazy for You' -- and even if it has some bad weeks, it has a rich producer, and besides, our creative team worked on 'Crazy' and they're taking cuts in royalties to keep it open. That's the ultimate Catch-22.
"So here we are: a $ 10 million musical, everything ready and no place to go."
 
Chic Fades Into Mystique
 The play is set in the 1960's in a Greenwich Village apartment, where two best friends are holding the social event of the season, a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. Sound familiar? "Radical Chic" was the title when the Manhattan Theater Club announced last summer that the Arthur Laurents play would be the last show of its season in May. Then Tom Wolfe, author of the famous book by that name about a Black Panther fund-raiser at Leonard Bernstein's apartment, objected. Titles can't be copyrighted, but public fights are ugly anyway. For a while, some listings had "Unconditional Sex" as the title of the Manhattan Theater Club's play (offering no explanation); the theater was saying only "a new Arthur Laurents work." Now there's a new title, and at least it rhymes with chic: "The Radical Mystique."
Mr. Laurents, in Seattle this week to open another new work, "Jolson Sings Again," declined to return telephone messages. But he left word that he'd decided his title was "too narrow and too limiting" and renamed it for his own reasons.
 
A Handout for the Little Guy
 Everyone knows that magazine with the yellow logo that the usher thrusts into your hand. But go to a small theater and you may get just a sheet of construction paper with nary a trivia column in sight. You may even have to go find it yourself in a pile in the lobby. This is the business that Encore magazine is fighting for. It serves 37 theaters with names like Cucaracha, Tada!, WPA and Irondale Ensemble. Editorial space is in the $ 125-a-page vicinity, depending on how many copies a theater needs; it also sells ads. Its publisher, Tom Holmes, has just overseen a redesign and transition to color.
Mr. Holmes, who bankrolled the business with his unemployment check and laid out the first issues on the floor of his studio apartment, loves little theaters and is exasperatingly modest for an entrepreneur. He has to be forced to admit that he'd like to whip the competition or turn a profit. He all too quickly confesses second thoughts even about his own redesign. The new, smaller typeface is cleaner looking, he said, but "there's kind of a controversy over how it reads in a darkened theater."
His gossip columnist, whose nom de smear is Addison DeWitt, the critic in "All About Eve," threw a fit about the loss of his 1940's-style logo -- an ingenue whipering in a rake's ear -- even though it clashed with the magazine's other logos.
"I think I'll bring it back," Mr. Holmes says, soldiering on. All he needs now in those theaters: ushers.
 
Footlights
 *The Shakespeare marathon forges on. Coming to Central Park's Delacorte Theater this summer: "The Tempest," directed by George C. Wolfe and opening on June 15. "Troilus and Cressida," directed by Mark Wing-Davey, opens Aug. 3. No casts yet. The last time the New York Shakespeare Festival did "Tempest" was in 1962, with Karen Black and Charles Durning; it did "Troilus" in 1965.
*The Theater Guild is sending a musical version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "State Fair" screenplay on a 20-city tour this August. And where will it open? In Des Moines, at the Iowa State Fair.
*It doesn't happen often. "Beauty and the Beast" will open in Los Angeles on March 21 with most of the original New York cast, including Terrence Mann, Susan Egan and Tom Bosley.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 11, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in the On Stage, and Off column in Weekend yesterday about the closing of "Nunsense" on Feb. 26 misstated the theater at which the musical is playing. It is the Douglas Fairbanks Theater, not the John Houseman.
Another brief report in the column, about New York Shakespeare Festival productions, gave incorrect dates, provided by the festival, for previous shows. The festival last staged "The Tempest" in Spanish in 1991 and in English in 1981, not in 1962. It last staged "Troilus and Cressida" in 1974, not in 1965.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Irish Repertory" -- Miriam Healy-Louie has acted in works by only two playwrights since arriving from Ireland in 1984: Shakespeare, of course, and Brian Friel. She leaped about the kitchen in Mr. Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa," above, and broke an expatriate-to-be's heart in "Philadelphia, Here I Come!," in the fall. In Mr. Friel's "Translations," about the British suppression of Gaelic in 1833, she will be Ballybeg's carefree town gossip. It opens on March 19. (Tom Lawlor)

HEADLINE: When Art Puts on a Party Hat: A Guide to Gallery Openings

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
PAINTERS and sculptors create, for the most part, in solitude and silence. Ideally, their works are contemplated in the same way. But that is not how they are thrust upon an unsuspecting world. In late-20th-century New York, art takes its first bow in a room as loud and crowded as a commodities trading pit and as smoke-filled as an off-track betting parlor. The fruits of genius are toasted with Chilean chardonnay and honored with offerings of suspect cheese. For a mad two hours, artists, critics, hangers-on, insiders, befuddled outsiders and outright scroungers mingle, collide, preen, dish, fawn, toady, snub and, as a last resort, take a fleeting glance at the art on the wall.
This ritual, played out hundreds of nights a year in galleries great and small, uptown and downtown, is known as an art opening. It is held, as a rule, the night before a show officially opens, or at the end of the show's first day. It is given as a courtesy to the artist who, after toiling long and lonely hours in his studio, has earned a chance to stand in the spotlight and bask in semi-sincere praise. For a brief, intoxicating moment, the heavens will align properly and move the artist to his or her rightful place: the center of the universe. 
 It's a funny little ritual, with all sorts of hidden rules, taboos and stylistic quirks. Uptown openings are very different from SoHo openings, though not always. Some galleries roll out a full bar. Others offer soda water and call it a day.
The form has evolved from the jug wine, paper cups and fistfights of the 1950's to the Champagne and celebrity openings of the 80's to the increasingly no-frills gatherings of the 90's.
Some SoHo galleries have given up on openings entirely -- the gallery-hopping of the 80's simply became too popular, and some gallery owners no longer feel up to giving a party for several hundred strangers. Others limit admission to invited guests, and no longer mention anything about the opening on the cards they mail out. But the form survives because, like birthday parties, weddings, and the bishop's annual blessing of the animals, it serves a cultural purpose.
"It's something you do for the artists and the community," said Jay Gorney, a SoHo dealer. "Real business is done before or after. Openings are about the artist having a chance to greet colleagues, friends, enemies."
It can make for a peculiar spectacle. Hollywood films have tried to satirize New York openings, but without much success. Applying the same logic that allows a secretary to live in a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment, film makers present the typical opening as two dozen Armani-clad poseurs circulating quietly with a glass of Chablis in hand.
If it takes place downtown, people wear crazy color combinations and huge earrings. The art is never ridiculous enough.
A real opening looks more like a casting call for six unrelated films and free lunch at Joe's Bar. On a recent Saturday night at the Cristinerose gallery, the following human specimens rubbed shoulders in the space of a few square feet: a tall man in black, with a long pigtail and a broad-brimmed deacon's hat; an Alpinist with climbing boots and gnarled stick; innumerable men and women with shaved heads; lots of young men in Army surplus gear; a young woman wearing a neatly pressed Keebler elf hat with tassel; a Morticia Addams look-alike in a floor-length tight black velvet coat and a crushed velvet Cat in the Hat chapeau. There were fashion plates, fashion victims and fashion disasters. There was lots of black, but lots of everything else too.
Go to enough openings, and you will inevitably encounter the German couple, both bald, who wear matching vinyl dresses and high heels. You will mingle with the celebrated group of moochers (their doings were recently chronicled in New York magazine) known as "gallery bums." You will also see, these days, especially downtown, lots of babies and dogs.
For their supposed beneficiaries, the artists, openings are equal parts agony and ecstasy. On the plus side, there's praise, attention and an opportunity to see the work -- and have it seen -- outside the studio. On the minus side, the work and the artist are painfully exposed.
 
A Duty One Can't Shirk
 The satirical painter Jack Levine, who is 80, has been exhibiting for well over half a century. He attends to support friends when they have a show. He shows up for his own openings only because he can't avoid it.
"The idea of being there and meeting this one and that one, whose names I'll never keep straight, of trying not to make waves and even, at times, be gallante -- I'm not trained for it," he said. "Of course, a lot of artists are hogs for it."
Most aren't. The word "dread" comes up a lot. "I had one artist who insisted that I provide a stash in the back room, a bottle in a bag," said Mr. Gorney.
Lauren Wittels, the former director of Luhring Augustine Gallery in SoHo, said, "You feel you're up there on a big stick and people can say anything and throw anything." Tonight, Ms. Wittels opens her own SoHo gallery. It will have a public opening. Carl Fudge, a British painter, will be the figure on the stick.
The fear is well founded. The excited buzz of conversation at an opening, when it actually turns to the art on the wall, is often a cocktail of malicious witticisms, snide remarks and put-downs that later evolve, in post-opening gab sessions over dinner or drinks, into full-length scorching critiques.
 
Warming Up Adjectives
 First, though, the artist must be congratulated. This is the touchiest part of the ritual. It is important for friends and acquaintances to establish physical contact with the artist and make it clear that they have done their duty by showing up. (To make doubly sure, interested parties sign the guest book at the gallery's main desk, which the artist and the dealer will scrutinize the next day.) It is bad form, however, to cut in while the artist is doing a snow job on a potential buyer, buttonholing a critic or curator or licking the shoes of a more important artist.
The minimum acceptable burnt offering is "Congratulations." But this is also the formula when you hate the work but can't leave without saying something. "The show looks great" suggests that you don't actually despise the work. Good friends will elaborate a bit and single out a painting or two for more specific praise, which the artist often interprets as an implied criticism of the rest of the work.
Worst of all are the well-meaning souls who start out with warm congratulations and proceed to explain, in great detail, why the composition falls apart in several paintings.
If the congratulators sometimes falter, perhaps it's because they sense that the clock is ticking.
"I don't want to spend 30 minutes talking to someone about their lower-back problem," said Joe DiGiorgio, a landscape painter. "Both people's eyes are traveling around the room anyway, looking for someone they should be talking to or making contact with."
Often, the encounter between artist and congratulator becomes a test to see who can be ruder to whom, thereby clarifying status relations. No wonder everybody needs a drink.
Laura Nash, who makes illuminated Fiberglas sculptures, recently got a creepy feeling of deja-vu when a race of aliens appeared on a repeat episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation."
"They had dark, severe suits, baggy but tapered at the ankles," she said. "They were very tall and thin and had a look of cold disdain. I thought, 'Gee, this looks just like the art world.'"
 
Food for the Eye Alone
 For everyone but the artist, openings can be great fun, a chance to meet, greet, look, listen and network. Early in the 80's, when the art market was booming and not only artists but their dealers assumed celebrity status, the custom developed of making the rounds and moving from one gallery opening to another.
"The word spreads very quickly about where to go," said Walter Robinson, an editor at Art in America and a producer of the cable program "Gallery Beat." "There's always one person in a group who knows where the openings are. It's sort of a sign of being on the inside, because this isn't published anywhere."
Some of the fizz has gone out of the Champagne, however. Pinched by tougher economic times, many galleries have cut back on the food and drink or eliminated refreshments entirely. "The days of waiters and tuxedos and silver trays, with rare exceptions, are gone," said Craig Cornelius, a dealer who recently began exhibiting and selling out of his Greenwich Village loft.
 
Fielding the Uninvited
 The cutbacks also solve a growing problem in SoHo: growing numbers of unwanted visitors.
"We used to do them religiously on Saturdays from 4 to 7, serving white wine to anyone and everyone," said Susan Brundage, the director of the Leo Castelli Gallery. "But as they became parties for people off the street, we switched nights and locations."
For the neo-primitivist painter and sculptor James Brown, for example, the gallery held an opening from 5 to 6 P.M. and gave the artist and his friends a cocktail party at a restaurant from 6 to 8.
"That way, the party becomes more focused on the artist and the exhibition rather than being a free-for-all," Ms. Brundage said.
John Post Lee, of Bravin Post Lee, said that he used to serve bottled beer at openings but that the gallery, which opened in 1990, had to give it up. "There was a certain contingent of aggressively frugal alcoholics," he said. "I'm not talking about a class of people, but a group of identifiable faces and names who'd use the openings as a way of drinking."
The old circuit has also frayed as galleries have experimented with new ways of presenting work, new hours, and more private gatherings, limited to the artists and an invited group of collectors and writers.
It doesn't take much for the old embers to burst into flame, though. When galleries have openings that fall on the same Saturday (as many will, just before the Whitney Biennial on March 15), the gallery-crawl resumes at full strength. When three new galleries on West 22d Street in Chelsea held their first openings last Saturday, their walls could barely contain the crowds.
Besides, a little austerity goes a long way. "The openings were toned down tremendously last year," said Jack Tilton, a SoHo dealer. "In a way it was hip not to go to an opening. But this year, it's O.K. again."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Governor Signs Bill Overhauling Welfare

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts today signed into law a measure establishing one of the most restrictive welfare systems in the nation, legislation that cuts benefits, stops payments after two years and requires many recipients to work or perform community service.
While dozens of states have enacted some of these principles in one form or another, Massachusetts is the first to incorporate all three into an overhaul of its welfare system. 
 Under the new law, which must still be approved by the Federal Government before it can go into effect, parents already on welfare will no longer receive increased benefits if they have more children.
"We are obliterating, today, the mistakes of welfare as it has existed for decades," said Governor Weld, a 49-year-old Republican, after he signed the measure into law.
Critics warned that the law would make the poorest people in Massachusetts even poorer.
"Homeless shelters and foster care systems are going to be flooded with people," said Betsy Wright, the executive director of the Massachusetts Human Services Coalition, a nonprofit agency that studies poverty. "And those are much more expensive programs than sending welfare checks to people."
The law's many substantive changes are reflected by a semantic change: it renames the state's Department of Welfare the Department of Transitional Assistance.
Governor Weld, who is sometimes mentioned as a candidate for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination, has made overhauling the state's welfare system one of his priorities. "This is not a political victory so much as it is a triumph for families and children who have been trapped on welfare," he said.
Able-bodied welfare recipients with school-age children will be entitled to 60 days of benefits if the new law is approved. After that they will be required to get a job or perform community service at homeless shelters, hospitals, nursing homes and similar places.
About half of the state's 105,000 welfare recipients are considered to be able-bodied as defined by the new law; of those, about 20,000 have school-age children and will be eligible for 60 days of benefits.
Ms. Wright maintained that businesses and industries did not have enough jobs for 20,000 untrained workers, and that community service would not give welfare recipients the skills necessary to find good-paying jobs. "It keeps people from getting job training and going to school," she said of the new law, "so it traps people in the low-wage end of the economy."
The new law would also cut welfare benefits by 2.75 percent across the board and would requires teen-aged parents to live at home or in an approved setting, and to finish high-school in order to receive benefits. After two years, benefits would be cut off altogether.
Donna Gikes, a 34-year-old mother of three in Lowell, Mass., was one of several hundred women on welfare who protested the new law on Thursday, just before the bill won final legislative approval.
Ms. Gikes said that she would love to have a new job but that finding one was not easy. "I need to get a job," she said, "but I also need day care, and I need training."
Ms. Gikes also worried about seeing her benefits cut. She now gets $579 a month, $450 of which pays her rent. "There isn't much left if you add it up," she said.
Some critics find it paradoxical that Massachusetts, which had one of the most liberal governances and national politics of any state in the country in the 1970's and 80's, plans to enact the nation's strictest welfare overhaul law. In the elections last November, when the Republicans were being swept to power across the country, Massachusetts re-elected a liberal incumbent, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. In the 1972 Presidential election it was the only state to vote for George McGovern over Richard M. Nixon.
But its political climate has changed since 1990, when Mr. Weld, a former United States Attorney, was elected as a fiscally conservative but socially liberal governor. He was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term last November.
The new law is scheduled to take effect on July 1, the start of the next fiscal year in Massachusetts. The state must first apply for a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services to change the rules governing Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the primary state-Federal welfare program.
The Clinton Administration's policy has been to approve waiver requests for new welfare programs as long as they are constitutional, protect the interests of children and cost no more than the current programs.
 
 
 
AROUND THE NATION: How Other States Have Overhauled Welfare
 Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts signed a new law today that stands to give his state one of the most restrictive welfare systems in the country. Massachusetts is not alone in its efforts to overhaul the welfare system. Many states are changing the rules that govern Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the large welfare system operated as a partnership between the states and the Federal Government. Some states no longer increase benefits to families that have more children while on welfare; some now require welfare recipients to work or perform community service, and some place time limits on benefits. (Massachusetts plans to do all three.) Here is a look at what some other states are doing with their welfare systems:
 
CAPS ON BENEFITS RELATING TO FAMILY SIZE
 
ARKANSAS: does not increase welfare benefits to a families that have more children while on welfare.
 
GEORGIA: does not increase benefits for children born to families that have been on welfare for two years.
 
INDIANA: does not increase benefits for children conceived while their families are on welfare.
 
NEW JERSEY: does not increase benefits for children born to a families on welfare.
 
WISCONSIN: in most cases does not increase benefits to families that have more children while on welfare
 
TIME LIMITS OR WORK REQUIREMENTS:
 
COLORADO: in five counties, parents able to work or join training programs must do so after two years of welfare benefits.
 
CONNECTICUT: recipients in New Haven and Manchester must work 15 hours a week after two years; 25 hours a week after three years; and 35 hours a week after four years.
 
FLORIDA: most families limited to two years of benefits in any five-year period; after two years they are guaranteed the opportunity to work at a job paying more than their welfare benefits.
 
GEORGIA: recipients without children under 14 years old who refuse to work or leave employment without good cause lose their benefits.
 
INDIANA: up to 12,000 recipients considered ready to work will get help finding jobs and have their benefits cut off after two years.
 
IOWA: most parents will be required to get training or they will lose their benefits for six months.
 
MICHIGAN: recipients are required to seek employment or get job training.
 
SOUTH CAROLINA: recipients are trained and given 60 days to find a private sector job; if they cannot find work they are required to perform community service.
 
SOUTH DAKOTA: recipients who get job training can receive benits for two years before they are required to get a job or perform community service; recipients who go to school can receive benefits for five years before they must get a job or perform community service.
 
VERMONT: most recipients must do community or public service jobs after two-and-a-half years of benefits.
 
WISCONSIN: benefits are limited to two out of four years, with some exceptions. after recipients have exhausted their benefits they cannot go back on welfare for three years.

HEADLINE: Arafat Asks U.S. to Rescue Israeli Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Frustrated by the lack of progress in Middle East peace talks, the P.L.O. leader, Yasir Arafat, called for United States intervention today to rescue his negotiations with Israel from stalemate.
Mr. Arafat, who heads the Palestinian self-rule authority in the Gaza Strip, made a similar appeal to Russia and Norway, both of which have been brokers in getting the long-struggling enemies to talk to one another. 
 But the true focus of his plea was the Americans. Dr. Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to the Palestinian leader, said the immediate goal was to have Washington press Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to ease a border closing that has kept Gaza and West Bank Arabs from badly needed jobs in Israel.
"The United States should tell Israel to lift the siege, first of all, and also to release prisoners," Dr. Tibi said. "If Rabin can't make a courageous decision by himself, then someone should help him, and the Americans are the ones to do it."
Shaken by a series of Islamic suicide bombings and wanting to restore a sense of security among its people, Israel has for the last three weeks kept out virtually all Palestinians, notably more than 50,000 low-paid day laborers.
A new poll suggests that Israelis overwhelmingly want the territorial closing to last. So even though Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today that he knew the restrictions were inflicting serious harm, and hoped they would be lifted "very soon," there was no sign of when that might happen.
The twin issues of Israeli security and Palestinian economic needs have fully eclipsed what the two sides are supposed to be discussing: how to expand Palestinian self-rule beyond Gaza and Jericho, on the West Bank.
After talks between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin broke down on Thursday, a senior Palestinian official said the two sides were in a crisis. While playing down such talk, Mr. Rabin acknowledged that "there were differences" that had to be worked out before he meets the Palestinian leader again next week. Whatever the preferred language, there is little question that negotiations are deadlocked, with no obvious way out.
Israel did not react formally to the call for United States intervention, but officials gave it an icy reception, one of them waving it off as "posturing" by Mr. Arafat. Based on the record thus far, it seemed unlikely that the Clinton Administration would plunge into a dispute between two parties that for the most part have worked out agreements on their own.
A clearer sense of American intentions may emerge on Sunday when Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to meet with Mr. Peres and with his counterparts from the Palestine Liberation Organization and the only two Arab countries to have signed peace treaties with Israel -- Egypt and Jordan.
On a visit to Japan before he heads to Washington, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt warned today that peace talks were "almost at the phase of make or break."
The stalemate also shows graphically how, despite the heralded peace agreement signed by their leaders in 1993, Israelis and Palestinians still talk to each other from behind walls of mistrust and misperceptions.
Israeli officials say they understand the Palestinians' economic plight and resentment of what they see as collective punishment. But they add that their security needs come first, and insist that the Palestinian Authority in Gaza work harder to block Islamic radicals.
In turn, Mr. Arafat says he understands Israel's safety fears. But he adds that the Israelis must understand his need to appear strong, and when Israel seals off his territory at will, he hardly looks to other Palestinians as though he is in command.
Although he himself has not publicly said so, some of his aides assert that Israel is using the security issue as an excuse to freeze the peace agreement in Gaza and Jericho. Israeli officials say that is not so.
But the newspaper Maariv warns of "a vicious circle" that neither side seems able to break. "If Rabin doesn't help Arafat prove to the Palestinians that peace pays off, Arafat will not be able to gain control over the opponents of peace," the Israeli daily said in an editorial this week. "But if Arafat will not succeed in overcoming the terrorist organizations, Rabin will not be able to help him."

HEADLINE: Democrats Call Republicans Too Lenient on Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
House Democrats today criticized the work requirement in the Republicans' latest welfare proposal as too lenient, and they said the plan should put more emphasis on finding jobs for poor people.
But the House Democratic Caucus refused to take a stand on one of the most important issues in the debate: whether poor people should have a right to cash assistance as an entitlement. 
 That right has been embedded in the welfare program for 60 years, guaranteeing benefits to all who meet certain eligibility criteria. This feature of the program automatically injects Federal money into states suffering severe economic problems, but it makes the total cost difficult to control.
House Republicans and many Republican governors say the money should be distributed to the states in a lump sum, or block grant. The House Republican bill would provide $15.4 billion a year, the amount the Federal Government spent in 1994 on cash assistance, with no allowance for inflation or increased need.
States could use the money in any way they wanted to help indigent families with children or to discourage childbearing outside marriage.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said the Republican proposal did "nothing, absolutely nothing" to replace welfare with work and to prepare recipients for jobs.
Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said the Republican proposal contained virtually "no work requirement" for welfare recipients. Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, said: "Welfare reform needs to be tough but fair. Individuals should be provided with the opportunity to work, and if they do not want to work, then their benefits should be denied."
Nearly five million adults get benefits under the main cash assistance program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children; about 7 percent of them work. The Republican bill would require states to raise this proportion to 20 percent by 2003.
When asked whether the program should remain an entitlement, Mr. Gephardt, like President Clinton, seemed to waver.
"It's an interesting question, but frankly it's irrelevant to what we're talking about today," Mr. Gephardt said at a news conference with 18 other House Democrats. "What we are talking about is requiring work. You can do that if you retain welfare as an entitlement, and you can do it if you go to a block grant."
Republicans said they would welcome Democratic amendments to establish more stringent requirements for welfare recipients to work. They also said they were pleasantly surprised that the Democratic Caucus had so far not taken a firm stand in favor of preserving the entitlement status of Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a longtime student of social welfare policy, was critical of both the Republican proposal and the response by Mr. Clinton, who said on Thursday that he might support the Republican bill "if it promotes work and family and protects children."
"You cannot abandon children," said Mr. Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. "You just cannot do it. The White House had better be a lot clearer in this regard than it was yesterday.
"To abolish the A.F.D.C. program 60 years after it was enacted would be a retrograde and cruel measure directed at children. I can't imagine it coming out of the Senate Committee on Finance."
Noting the President's comment, Mr. Moynihan asked, "Promotes work and family by turning children out into the street?"
He said he wondered what people elsewhere would think of the United States, adding, "We used to stand for social progress in the world."
The Republican bill would require welfare recipients to participate in some type of "work program" after they had received cash assistance for two years. States would design the work programs, and the requirements would vary from state to state. But no family could receive Federal welfare benefits for more than five years.

HEADLINE: A Family Spirals Downward In Waiting for Agency to Act

SERIES: Bias Agency Adrift: A periodic report.

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
On Aug. 19, 1992, Al B. Tatum called in sick and took his bottled-up fury over co-workers' taunts and slurs to the Milwaukee office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mr. Tatum, who is black, filled out Charge No. 260920645, alleging racial discrimination by his employer, Cooper Power Systems.
The torrent of slurs was so unrelenting, he has said, that he eventually quit his job. 
 Almost two and a half years have passed since Mr. Tatum filed his complaint with the agency that Congress created to enforce civil rights laws in the workplace, and his case has still not been resolved. But in that time, the Tatum family, like thousands of others enmeshed in the E.E.O.C.'s complaint process, has spiraled from crisis to crisis.
Mr. Tatum, 33, said in a recent interview at his new home in Kansas City, Mo., that he could not find work paying even half of the $12 an hour he had earned at Cooper Power Systems. So he took his $15,000 in savings and started a restaurant in Milwaukee. It failed. The Tatums then slipped from the cusp of the middle class, losing the $41,000 ranch house they had been buying.
Late last year they moved to Kansas City, to a $360-a-month apartment and jobs, but earning only two-thirds of what they were when Mr. Tatum was at Cooper Power and his wife, Debra, 37, was an insurance claims processor.
The files of the E.E.O.C. teem with Al Tatums: about 100,000 unresolved cases at the end of 1994, double the backlog of just two years ago.
The commission's new chairman, Gilbert F. Casellas, has acknowledged inefficiencies in its procedures and said he found the headquarters overstaffed. He said he wanted to dispatch some of those people to field offices, where processing delays were most acute. But the big problem, he said, is a woefully inadequate budget.
Civil rights lawyers and the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, raise questions about the commission's procedures and competence. But even they say that its budget -- $233 million this year -- leaves it ill-equipped to do what it is supposed to do.
The result is that with the exception of emergencies -- cases involving people with terminal diseases or facing physical assault at work, for example -- complainants typically wait nine months to a year in a "pending stage" before an investigator even starts gathering evidence. It is normally another six months to a year before their claims are rejected or resolved. "The agency is supposed to be there to give ordinary citizens an effective way to enforce their civil rights," said Patrick O. Patterson, whose Milwaukee firm, Hall, Patterson & Charne, represents Mr. Tatum. "But it functions as a sort of obstacle."
Congress further burdens the agency by increasing the number of workers it must protect, recently adding workers with disabilities. From Oct. 1, 1992, to Oct. 1, 1994, the cases the agency received jumped 54 percent; its budget grew only 9 percent.
Responding to the budgetary crunch, the agency has reduced the number of investigators to 732 from 762. Still, with salaries consuming 78 percent of the agency's budget, there is little left to spend on equipment that could help fewer investigators work faster.
The toll of the resulting delays, complainants say, goes beyond the frustration of waiting. Like all crime, illegal discrimination is best tackled fast, when evidence and memories are fresh. But at the commission, investigations can become archeological digs.
"Documents get lost or destroyed," said Mr. Patterson, a former lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. "Evidence gets stale. Witnesses move or die or they forget what happened."
Many complainants just give up. They change jobs, move and get on with their lives while the bias or bigotry they challenged persists to become fodder for new cases.
A breakthrough in Mr. Tatum's case came on Jan. 3, 1995. The agency notified his lawyer, Gretchen Miller, that it had found merit in his accusations. It said it would invite Cooper Power Systems, a manufacturer of big electrical transformers, to negotiate a voluntary settlement and payment to Mr. Tatum. "It was about time," he said.
Cooper Power, a division of Cooper Industries Inc. of Houston, has denied Mr. Tatum's accusations, saying the company acts fast to stop discrimination. It may refuse to negotiate, so there might still be a lawsuit and more delay.
 
The Problem
Seeking Help, Finding Hurt
 Al Tatum, 6 feet 4 inches, trim and soft-spoken, was the last of 15 children of a General Motors worker and a part-time maid.
He went to work at Cooper Power, 18 miles from Milwaukee in Waukesha, in 1988 after nine years with an airline maintenance company that closed. In various jobs at Cooper Power, running a press, driving a forklift, going on the road to repaint customers' transformers, he sometimes worked solely with whites. He said the harassment at Cooper Power, which he never encountered in his first job and has not faced in his Kansas City one, began almost immediately.
The materials Ms. Miller submitted to the Federal commission are a recitation of slurs and epithets that support Mr. Tatum's accusations. Mr. Tatum said the epithets remained on the restroom walls for weeks despite his complaints to supervisors.
In November 1989, Mr. Tatum and his lawyer wrote: "Mr. Tatum's work name tag appeared on one of the stalls in the men's room. When he complained about this to a supervisor, he was told that it was just a matter of his co-workers 'having fun.' "
On May 24, 1990, a fake "Application Form for Mike McGee's Militia" was put on Mr. Tatum's desk in the warehouse. Michael McGee, a black Milwaukee Alderman, had threatened violence against the city unless it spent $100 million to improve economic conditions for blacks. The form, a part of Mr. Tatum's file with the commission, asked:
"Yo Mamma's name:
"Yo Daddy's name (if known):
"Yo auto: Cadillac. Lincoln. Financed. Stolen.
"Yo marital status: Common law. Shacked up. Gay.
"Yo place of birth: Free clinic. Alley. Zoo. Colonel Sanders. Unknown.
"Yo prior experience: Govt worker. Evangelist. Dope dealer. Postmaster. Pimp.
"Note," it said at the bottom, "No photo is necessary since yo all look alike anyway."
Four months later, The Milwaukee Journal began an article about racial tensions in the city with an anecdote about Mr. Tatum's finding the form.
Harassment escalated after the article, Mr. Tatum said.
After repeated complaints to supervisors and to their supervisors, he said, he was sent on the road for six months, removing rust and repainting transformers. A co-worker who Mr. Tatum said had been slighting him was sent along and subjected him to almost constant taunts, he said
David H. Watson, a division vice president for employee relations at Cooper Power, said the company acted immediately to find the source of the militia form. He said it also investigated Mr. Tatum's other accusations.
"We don't take these matters lightly," Mr. Watson said. "Tatum I know because I have a log. He has filed a discrimination charge. We have strongly denied any and all allegations or charges of racial discrimination that have been made by Mr. Tatum."
Mr. Watson said he would not discuss the charges in detail while the case was before the bias commission. But, he added, "we obviously feel the allegations he has made are not supported by circumstances or events."
 
The Time
Twisting Turns Of Complaint
 His first dealings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission were reassuring, Mr. Tatum said. Three weeks after he filed, he said, the Milwaukee office called to say he would be assigned an investigator.
At the same time, Miriam R. Katzman, a lawyer specializing in workers compensation, was developing a a claim for Mr. Tatum separate from his bias case. Ms. Katzman maintained that Mr. Tatum had suffered psychological injury on the job.
A doctor, Crain H. Bliwas, examined Mr. Tatum in November 1992. In a letter to Ms. Katzman, a copy of which Ms. Miller submitted to the bias commission, Dr. Bliwas said that Mr. Tatum "has experienced extreme work-related stress and that this stress has been a substantial and material cause of this patient's disability."
Dr. Bliwas said that Mr. Tatum was "unable to engage in any gainful employment of any kind" and that "certainly he would not be able to continue working at Cooper." His overall assessment, the doctor said, was of a "major depressive disorder."
But the commission was nowhere near looking into Mr. Tatum's accusation.
"November 1992 came," Mr. Tatum said. "Christmas passed. I called them in February. 'Oh, you have an investigator now,' they said. The investigator tells me he's going out there to investigate. I called him a couple of weeks later. 'You been out there?' 'No I haven't had a chance. We're backed up.' "
Such delays are common. The commission routinely warns its clients that their charges must undergo a five-stage process, including a pending stage of a year or so during which they languish in the backlog.
The Milwaukee district office carries one of the heaviest loads of the 50 commission offices nationwide. Chester V. Bailey, the office director, said each of his 23 investigators dealt on average with 143 cases, 30 more than the national average.
"The charges are controlling us now," Mr. Bailey said. "We're doing the best that we possibly can under the circumstances. We need more funding and ultimately more staff."
 
The Hope
End Is Near, Yet so Far
 Once the pending period ended, in February 1993, Mr. Tatum's case seemed to be moving. Two months later, his investigator interviewed people at Cooper Power; a month later he met with Mr. Tatum and his lawyer.
Mr. Tatum said the investigator told him that he thought the accusation had "reasonable cause," or evidence enough to qualify for a suit, and that it was likely to be referred to the agency headquarters in Washington for a ruling on who would sue, the agency or Mr. Tatum.
In July 1993, Mr. Tatum said, the investigator said the case would be completed in September. But in September, the investigator said he had to go back to Cooper Power.
Mr. Bailey declined to discuss this specific case. But he said that sometimes, when the research on a case was nearly complete, employers and complainants introduced new information that required more work.
The investigator returned to Cooper Power seven months later, on March 24, 1994. By then, Mr. Tatum's restaurant was consuming the last of his savings. Mrs. Tatum was carrying the family, including two children, on her $12-an-hour job, and the couple was having trouble with mortgage payments.
Summer came, and Mr. Tatum finally gave up on Milwaukee. Moving alone to Kansas City in August, he found work as a $5.25-an-hour baggage handler at the airport and took a room at the Y.M.C.A.
By October, the Tatums were $10,000 behind in mortgage payments, so Mrs. Tatum gave the house back to the bank, moved herself and the children into an apartment with her husband and looked for another insurance job.
A month later, the family's fortunes picked up. Cooper Power settled Mr. Tatum's workers' compensation claim with a $10,000 payment without a finding of the cause of his illness. He kept $6,701.50; his lawyer, Ms. Katzman, received most of the rest, a ratio typical in such cases.
The new year has brought even better times. The family began saving to buy a house after Mrs. Tatum found a $12-an-hour job like the one she left in Milwaukee.
Then came the commission's Jan. 3 letter, a breakthrough in the case if not its end.
"I have considered all the evidence disclosed during the investigation," Mr. Bailey wrote, "and find that there is reasonable cause to believe that there is a violation" of Mr. Tatum's civil rights.
Mr. Bailey invited Mr. Tatum and representatives of his former employer to join in "reaching a just resolution of this matter," including consideration of compensatory and punitive damages.
Failing that, Cooper Power and Mr. Tatum are assured a day in court.

HEADLINE: A President-Turned-Patton Directs Peru's Jungle War

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Alberto K. Fujimori, known to many on Wall Street as the President who gave his country the world's highest economic growth rate last year, is now reveling in a new role, as Peru's Patton.
"Today, we bombed Tiwintza with 17 planes -- it was a saturation bombing," Mr. Fujimori said in an interview Thursday night. He was recounting his order to have Russian-made Sukhoi 22 bombers "soften up" an Ecuadorean military redoubt on an Amazon hilltop near the border. "Our Mirages gave cover in case enemy planes appeared," he said, referring to Peru's French-built fighter planes. 
 Poring over a war map, Mr. Fujimori used a ballpoint pen to indicate his troops' thrust up a disputed river valley, saying, "I'm sending in 1,000 counterinsurgency troops, all with jungle combat experience."
As Peru's border conflict with Ecuador stretches into a third week, with 47 confirmed dead and 88 wounded, Peru's President shows no sign of settling for anything short of an outright military victory.
Though pensive in the one-on-one interview in the quiet of the Presidential Palace, Mr. Fujimori was jaunty, even triumphant, in a taped television interview that was broadcast across the nation a few minutes later.
"They are crying uncle!" Peru's leader said, using local slang to dismiss an Ecuadorean appeal for a "humanitarian truce" during which bodies could be retrieved from the jungle. "There is no room for a truce at this point in the hostilities."
With peace talks in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, showing little progress, the United States and Brazil announced today that they were suspending all arms shipments to the two countries. Peru acknowledges losing two Russian-made helicopters and one Canberra flight training plane in the fighting.
On Thursday, an Aeroflot cargo plane arrived here with what Mr. Fujimori described as "spare parts" for Peru's largely Russian-equipped army.
Fresh from visiting an army field hospital in Bagua, Peru's main staging area, Mr. Fujimori said on Thursday that he was "certain" that the fighting would be over by the end of this month. Referring to military tensions along Peru's 1,000-mile border with Ecuador, he said, "We hope the fighting does not expand."
In a war largely without witnesses, the fighting is taking place in a remote, mountain jungle that is so dense that a 60-man Peruvian patrol was located Thursday after wandering lost for several days. The soldiers were treated for dehydration and insect bites.
In this thick rainforest, as little as 300 yards separate Ecuadorean and Peruvian positions.
"Our big surprise was that Ecuador was well prepared with artillery in these high places," Mr. Fujimori said, returning to his war map. "We dispersed our troops and quickly engaged with Ecuadorean troops." Fearful of shelling their own units, Ecuadorean gunners stopped using artillery pieces, Mr. Fujimori said.
Each side blames the other for starting the conflict. Mr. Fujimori charged that Ecuador fired the first shots on Jan. 26.
Citing his three trips in the last two years to visit his northern neighbor, he also said that he had repeatedly appealed to Ecuador to demarcate the 48-mile stretch of border now in dispute.
"I said to Rodrigo Borja: 'Invite me and I'll come,' " Mr. Fujimori said in a reference to Ecuador's former President, who received the Peruvian leader in Quito in 1992. Warmly greeted by Ecuadorean crowds, Mr. Fujimori was the first Peruvian President in memory to visit the nation.
With both countries now locked in low-level warfare, Mr. Fujimori blamed the falling-out on Ecuadorean politicians seeking popular support and on Ecuadorean generals seeking to retain their privileges.
While the border issue is traumatic for Ecuadoreans, most Peruvians show little interest.
"We had to put an ad on television to explain what the Rio Protocol was all about," Mr. Fujimori said, referring to a 1942 treaty. The agreement recognized Peruvian ownership of a huge Amazon area that Ecuador had lost to Peru in a war the previous year.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise Modestly, With Consensus Absent

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Even a report showing only modest inflation was not enough to inspire the listless financial markets yesterday, sending the leading stock indexes up only modestly.
 After rising as much as 14 points, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,939.07, up 6.39 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 1.27 points, to 481.46. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.99 points, to 790.43. 
 Despite four consecutive drifting sessions, the Dow managed to eke out a 10-point gain for the week. But the prices for the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped, as its yield crept up to 7.67 percent yesterday from 7.63 at Monday's opening, indicating pessimism on inflation.
 A market consensus, sometimes slow to develop, is largely absent for the moment. Nine days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the seventh time within a year, investors in the stock, bond and currency markets are still unsure whether interest rates have peaked, hence whether it is a good bet to buy shares, bonds and dollars.
 Despite a clearly favorable track record on inflation and strong fourth-quarter earnings, normally bullish signs, many traders are on the sidelines.
 Contradictory statements by Federal Reserve Board members are partly to blame. Susan Philips, a Fed governor, said in a speech Wednesday that inflation was "not yet all gone," a seeming signal that the Fed would raise rates again. But earlier in the week, another Fed governor, John P. LaWare, seemed to imply that the Fed had finished tightening credit. "We may be at the cusp of what we're trying to accomplish," he said in a Monday speech.
 Yesterday, the Producer Price Index, the major bit of market-moving news in a tepid week, lifted stock prices for only 20 minutes. At its market-moving peak, the news lifted the Dow by about 14 points, or three-tenths of one percent, and the S.& P. 500 by about 1.2 point, or two-tenths of a percent.
 That is paltry considering that the rise in the index, three-tenths of 1 percent for January, was less than Wall Street economists' expectations of four-tenths of 1 percent.
 The big stock winners yesterday were airlines. The major carriers reported that their January figures for paying passengers were on the rise. And Delta Air Lines angered travel agents by cutting commissions, a move followed by other carriers, including American Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
 UAL, the parent of United Airlines, rose 5 1/4, to 97, in heavy volume; Delta closed at a 52-week high of 56 3/4, up 4 in heavy volume; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 3, to 60 1/4, and Northwest rose 1 7/8, to 21.
 Clinicom, a developer of medical software, rose 4 5/8, to 19 1/4, after reporting that its fourth-quarter earnings almost tripled.
 Few stocks had big falls. Cascade Communications, which designs telecommunications equipment, fell 25/16 , to 639/16 . It reported on Thursday that its fourth-quarter net was 28 cents a share in contrast to a loss of 3 cents a year earlier.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal with 297.5 million shares changing hands.
 The most active stock, at 9.1 million shares, was Cisco Systems, a computer software developer, which fell 15/16 , to 351/16 .
 In Tokyo, stocks recovered yesterday after three consecutive declines. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 191.80 points, or 1.06 percent, at 18,291.35.

HEADLINE: American Insurers Seek More Business in Japan

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
When an earthquake devastated parts of western Japan last month, the AIU Insurance Company rented a boat, 100 hotel rooms, 50 mobile phones, 20 vans and trucks and a fleet of motorbikes and bicycles. Then the American company sent in claims adjustors, who distributed food, water and blankets as they tried to reach 3,000 policyholders to assess damages.
 This approach may have been the right one, not only from a humanitarian standpoint, but also from a business standpoint for AIU, a subsidiary of the New York-based American International Group Inc., which is trying to expand its share in Japan's $400 billion insurance market, the largest in the world outside the United States. 
 Although little known abroad, Japanese insurers like the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company have been among the world's biggest and most profitable financial companies. Long unchallenged by outsiders, they enjoyed profits virtually guaranteed by regulators and grew at the same blistering pace as Japan's overall economy.
 Now, however, insurers are in the public eye in Japan because the earthquake showed how well they managed not to accept risk but to evade it through policy restrictions.
 "It's regulated," said Rie Ota, an analyst at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. "If the industry doesn't make a 5 percent profit, it can apply to the Ministry of Finance for an increase. If it makes too much money, it returns the profit to the policyholders."
 But these days, Japan's insurance titans are facing an array of new challenges, symbolized by AIU's rush to the scene of the earthquake around the city of Kobe on Jan. 17. The earthquake is expected to lead to $2 billion in claims for Japanese nonlife insurance companies, and while the companies think that is plenty, there is public criticism that they got off too lightly. Overall damage from the earthquake was around $100 billion, perhaps more.
 "It's sad but true that there's very little risk to domestic nonlife insurance companies," said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "The little guy gets ripped off, and the Japanese people will stand there and take it."
 At the same time, deregulation is coming to Japan -- too slowly for the taste of some -- and one result is that a burst of new competition will shake up the industry and probably erode profitability. Staid companies will increasingly have to grapple with new entrants, foreign competitors and direct mail.
 The earthquake last month killed more than 5,000 people and destroyed or damaged about 100,000 homes, buildings and other structures. But only 3 percent of the people in the Kobe area had earthquake insurance, partly because premiums were so high. And even people who had it are limited to about $100,000 in claims on a demolished home -- about the cost of a parking space in Japan. For furniture and other household property, the maximum payment is $50,000.
 Many policyholders, however, cannot get even a fraction of that. Until last year, people with insurance for earthquake but not fire, or for fire but not earthquake, got nothing if their houses burned down after a quake. This caused an uproar last year after an earthquake struck Hokkaido in northern Japan, and the rules were changed.
 Now, if half or more of a house is destroyed by an earthquake-induced fire, people with fire insurance can receive up to $30,000 for residences and small retail shops and $200,000 for industrial operations.
As if to cushion the industry's payments, although it was in fact coincidental, fire insurance premium rates rose across Japan on Feb. 1.
 Reacting to public indignation, the Government suggested last month that it would raise the ceiling on how much money a family with a damaged home is legally allowed to receive on a claim. And life insurance companies declared they would pay full policy benefits regardless of exclusion clauses, so that they would end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars on claims from the quake that hit Kobe.
 If total individual claims for any one earthquake exceed set amounts, Government subsidies kick in on a sliding scale. Since the Government does not offer subsidies for corporate earthquake coverage, neither Japanese nor foreign insurance companies sell much commercial earthquake insurance here.
 But many foreign companies operating in Japan demand earthquake coverage and obtain it overseas.
 "Foreign companies will pay more in losses than their market share," said Ross E. Matthews, regional vice president at AIU. "All it takes is a factory to get hit, and you've got $100 million right there."
 The American International Group, which owns AIU and had a small share of marine and commercial insurance in the Kobe area, expects earthquake losses of only $50 million on total sales of $4.3 billion in Japan. A representative from the Cigna Insurance Company said its losses would probably be even less.
 An official at Lloyd's of London said that losses related to nonmarine reinsurance in Kobe, where it had a quarter of the market, would amount to $100 million.
 Although only a small minority of consumers had earthquake insurance, Japanese are generally avid buyers of insurance, especially life insurance.
 The Japanese spend nearly twice as much per capita on life insurance as Americans, and the nonlife insurance industry is particularly lucrative. Foreign companies had long looked at the Japanese market, and a few had been involved in it; then an agreement reached last fall by Japanese and American negotiators expanded foreign companies' access to the Japanese insurance market.
 While the agreement was welcomed at the time, the Japanese market is proving a tough one for American insurance companies, and many are not trying to enter it at present. Operating costs are very high, and Japanese companies and individuals frequently buy through established relationships.
 Because the industry is highly regulated, premiums charged by competing companies are identical. This means that foreign companies cannot offer lower prices to build business, but instead have to find other strategies to attract clients. Some focus on service, while others try to develop new kinds of insurance or drum up business through direct mail solicitations.
 For the most recent American entrant, the UNUM Corporation, based in Portland, Me., it took nearly 10 years of preparation to open for business in Japan this year. UNUM sells a product that typical Japanese insurance companies do not touch: disability insurance.
 Some foreign companies are hoping that the recent criticism of the Japanese insurance companies in the wake of the earthquake will create new opportunities for outsiders.
 "It's a very bad disaster," said Theresa T. Carney, regional vice president of Cigna. "But an unexpected impact for foreign insurance companies is that some companies that never thought of coming to foreign insurance companies are now coming and asking, 'What can you do for us?' "

HEADLINE: Agee Is Out at Morrison Knudsen

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
After an emotional six-hour board meeting here that ended late Thursday night, the Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced early today that William Agee had resigned from all of his positions at the giant construction and transit equipment company, effective immediately.
 Mr. Agee, 57, left this morning to return to his home south of here in Pebble Beach and was unavailable for comment, a company spokesman said at a news conference. 
 Mr. Agee's departure as chairman and chief executive closes a difficult chapter for the company, which is known for building the Hoover Dam, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and rail equipment like new high-tech cars for the Metro-North Railroad in New York. In the six years that Mr. Agee guided the company, he failed to generate steady growth in operating profit. As problems and complaints about his management arose, employee morale sank, the stock price fell and he left the corporate headquarters in Boise, Idaho, and tried to run the company from his Pebble Beach home.
 Now Morrison Knudsen faces a host of difficulties, including a sizable loss for the fourth quarter and the year and defaults on the terms of its revolving credit agreements with banks.
 Only 10 days ago, Mr. Agee had planned to leave the chief executive post "sometime this year" and stay on as chairman until 1998, when he would turn 60. But last week, a small group of Morrison Knudsen directors began pressing Mr. Agee to leave sooner, so that new leaders could be recruited to deal with the company's financial crisis.
 Stepping in today as acting chairman is William P. Clark, a director who pushed for Mr. Agee's immediate removal, according to people familiar with the board's deliberations. Mr. Clark, 63, served in the Reagan Administration as national security adviser and Interior Secretary. He now operates an international consulting business from his ranch near Paso Robles, Calif.
 Today he said his first priority was "to restore confidence among all our constituents, especially our 14,000 employees and their families, the financial community, our great clients and, certainly, our shareholders."
 Mr. Clark said that he had talked to the company's banks and that they "were highly appreciative of the action." He added, "With the board now fully informed and active with management, I am confident that the banks will cooperate with us."
 In New York Stock Exchange trading, Morrison Knudsen shares rebounded slightly today to close up 62.5 cents each at $10.25 a share. The announcement of Mr. Agee's resignation was made before trading began in New York. Several Wall Street analysts who follow the company's finances said they were taking a wait-and-see attitude. "This is still a very fluid situation," one analyst said.
 The board said it would announce its 1994 financial results during the week starting Feb. 19.
 Mr. Clark emphasized today that his tenure as chairman was "strictly temporary." Stephen G. Hanks, the executive vice president, was named acting chief executive. Mr. Clark said the board's search committee, which he heads, would continue to seek a permanent successor to Mr. Agee.
 Perhaps to underscore the break with that past, Mr. Clark said today that he intended to return the company's board meetings and its management focus to the Idaho headquarters. "Considering this company's great history and mystique, we have to recognize that its heart is in Boise," he said.
 Mr. Hanks, 44, said at the news conference that the company had not yet negotiated a severance package with Mr. Agee. His current employment contract, which expires on Dec. 31, calls for him to receive a severance benefit equal to twice his base compensation, including salary, bonus, health plan and pension benefits, under certain circumstances. But it was not clear how his departure today would be treated under that contract.
 A person familiar with the details of the protracted meeting Thursday night said: "Everyone was just too tired to take it up. That will come later."
 Mr. Agee's compensation package included a $750,000 base salary and a bonus structure that along with noncash compensation produced a salary as high as $2.4 million in 1993. Mr. Hanks said that the bleak financial results for 1994 eliminated the possibility of a bonus for Mr. Agee but that his total 1994 pay package would not be disclosed until the company's proxy statement is released next month.
 In addition to resigning from his positions at Morrison Knudsen, Mr. Agee also stepped down from the chairmanships of MK Rail and MK Gold, two former subsidiaries that were spun off as free-standing companies during his tenure. MK Rail announced today that Michael Farrell, its president, would also assume that company's chief executive post, formerly held by Mr. Agee. MK Gold has not announced a replacement for Mr. Agee as chairman.
 Assisting Mr. Hanks at Morrison Knudsen will be Robert A. Tinstman, 48, who will become chief operating officer, Mr. Tinstman is now president of the company's mining group. A mining engineer by training, Mr. Tinstman has been with the company 20 years.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Fall on Weight of New Supply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday as investment firms struggled to sell some of the $40 billion of notes and bonds they purchased in the Government's quarterly debt auction this week.
 The bond market "did have a major seller, and that was the U.S. Government," said Van Hoisington, president of Hoisington Asset Management, a Dallas firm with $2.7 billion in assets. "Anytime you have a major seller, the markets decline." 
 The Treasury completed its debt auctions on Thursday with the sale of $11 billion of 30-year bonds. Earlier in the week, it sold $12 billion of 10-year notes and $17 billion of 3-year notes.
 The price of the new 30-year bond fell yesterday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.67 percent from 7.65 percent, where it was priced in Thursday's auction.
 "The market is definitely feeling the weight of the supply," said Monty Cleworth, who manages $300 million in bonds at Founders Asset Management in Denver.
 Bond prices initially rose yesterday after the Government reported that producer prices rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in January. But prices retreated after traders saw evidence of inflationary pressures in the data. The report also showed that raw material prices like crude oil and iron ore rose as much as 1 percent.
 While the report failed to unsettle the market, it was "not the kind of news that will get much more money drawn into the market," said Daniel Callahan, head trader at Paine Webber Inc.
 To be sure, some analysts and investors have concluded that bond yields will keep falling because the Federal Reserve may have increased interest rates enough to keep the inflation rate from rising. As measured by the Government's Consumer Price Index, inflation ran at a 2.7 percent pace last year, unchanged from 1993.
 "There's still a conviction rates are stable or even moving lower," said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds. "That's a strong conviction out there."
 If the recent rally is losing steam, "some of that is to be expected, given we've had the auctions," said Patrick Retzer, who manages the $65 million Heartland U.S. Government Securities Fund in Milwaukee. "We've got to move higher here very soon to keep this rally going," he said. "We're losing momentum."
 Municipal bonds fell yesterday for the first time in eight sessions amid expectations that new bond issuance will increase after several weeks of declining sales. States, cities and agencies are scheduled to offer $2.24 billion in new bonds next week, up from $1.95 billion in the last five days.
The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer's index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose to 6.53 percent yesterday from 6.51 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Are Higher On Signs of a Lower Supply

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices surged yesterday in reaction to a drop in inventories that reflected solid consumer demand.
Continued strength in coffee prices, along with higher grain and crude oil prices, lifted the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities 1.26 points, to 233.93. 
 This week, copper prices recovered half of the 10 percent drop of the previous two weeks. The slide had been prompted in part by worries that higher interest rates in the United States would cause an economic slowdown, dampening demand.
But the market was bolstered yesterday by signs of a diminished supply. The London Metal Exchange, the world's principal respository for refined copper, said its warehouse held stocks of 301,525 metric tons, down 1.5 percent from three days earlier.
Copper for March delivery gained 2.85 cents, to 134.4 cents a pound, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
In an announcement after the close of trading, workers settled a weeklong strike at the huge Empresa Nacional de Mineria copper refinery in Chile, the world's top copper producer.
Coffee prices rose for a fourth consecutive day, encouraged by reports on Thursday that the Colombian National Coffee Federation would set a minimum export price on its coffee beans.
Also prompting the jump was news that Central American nations had withheld 238,042 bags of coffee, which weigh 132 pounds each, in January as part of a plan to limit supplies to the market.
Coffee for March delivery gained 3.85 cents, to $1.6275 cents a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Wheat and soybean prices rallied after the Government issued a report trimming supply projections and on renewed expectations that China would make large purchases of American agricultural products.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for March delivery rose 7 cents, to $3.765 a bushel, and March soybeans gained 3.5 cents, to $5.5775.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Takes a Tumble, Following U.S. Bonds Lower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, following American bonds lower after a report on producer prices in the United States showed rising raw material costs.
"The dollar was very tied in with the bond market today," said Ross Taylor, head of foreign exchange at Daiwa Securities (America). 
 Bond prices, which are sensitive to any signs of accelerating inflation, can steer the direction of the dollar because international investors need to buy dollars when they want to buy United States bonds and sell dollars after they have cashed out.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5192 German marks from 1.5286 marks on Thursday and to 1.2820 Swiss francs from 1.2927 francs. The British pound advanced to $1.5630 from $1.5575. But the dollar rose against the Japanese yen, settling at 98.93, compared with 98.90 yen on Thursday.
The dollar was buoyed against the yen by dollar purchases from Japanese investment and insurance companies, Mr. Taylor said. They are acquiring dollars to buy United States bonds, attracted by those bonds' high yields relative to Japanese bonds, he said. United States 10-year notes yield 7.64 percent, compared with 4.63 percent for Japan.
Initially, bonds rose and pushed the dollar higher, after the Labor Department reported that its Producer Price Index rose a smaller-than-expected three-tenths of 1 percent in January.
"The P.P.I. numbers were a little better than expected, and bonds liked that," said Earl Johnson, currency adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "So the dollar went up at first." Later in the day, however, said Dave Glowacki, senior currency dealer at NBD Bank in Detroit, "the bond market didn't like some of the P.P.I. components, and a selloff of the dollar coincided with the selloff of bonds."
The dollar also suffered from heightened tension in the Chiapas state of Mexico, traders said. On Thursday, President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon ordered army troops and federal police agents to arrest the commanders of the peasant uprising in Chiapas as criminals.
Such economic and social unrest has hurt the dollar because of the close economic ties between the United States and Mexico. The turmoil has benefited the German mark and Swiss franc, as investors seek a safe-haven currency. Since the Mexican Government devalued the peso on Dec. 20, the dollar has fallen 3.5 percent against the mark.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Index Up 0.3% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Despite sharply accelerating costs for many basic materials, inflation remained at bay in January as American producers obtained only modest price increases on goods at the stage just before they reach consumers, Government figures showed today.
 The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods -- what companies receive for items ready for sale to the final business or individual user -- rose three-tenths of 1 percent, as the biggest jump in energy prices since August was offset by the biggest decline in food prices since May. 
 After factoring out the volatile food and energy price swings, the "core" rate of increase in producer prices was two-tenths of a percent in January, after a revised increase of three-tenths in December.
 The report produced a seesaw reaction in financial markets. Initially, the bond market rose as traders jumped to the conclusion that the continued signs of low inflation improved the prospects that the Federal Reserve might not tighten credit further in coming months.
 But with more time to look at the Labor Department report, experts found the 1 percent surges in prices of both intermediate and crude goods to be more sobering. Bond prices skidded into negative territory, pushing rates higher. [Page 43.]
 In recent months, many companies have managed through a variety of means to absorb sharply higher costs for items ranging from cardboard cartons to aluminum without substantially increasing the prices of their own products. That pattern continued in January, but some economists expressed concern that the price pressures at earlier stages of production might not stay bottled up indefinitely.
 "There is a clear conflict of forces in the producer price data," said John E. Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. He noted that intermediate-goods prices have spurted 5.2 percent in the last 12 months, more than triple the 1.6 percent rise shown by finished goods.
 Such a situation cannot be sustained indefinitely, he contended, predicting some combination of lower profits and higher prices. Lower profits would be bad for stocks; higher prices would help drive down bond prices.
 Some companies are already suffering from a squeeze between the higher costs they pay for raw materials and intermediate goods and the competitive pressure from inflation-sensitive consumers who want prices kept down.
 Take Custom-Bilt Metals, a small California-based distributor of building products, with annual revenues of $25 million. It has been raising prices to the point where "our customers look at us like we're crooks," said Drew Popson, vice president of the company. Nonetheless, profit margins are "getting hammered," he said.
 He said his company was hit with a 10 percent increase in the cost of packaging and paper on Feb. 1 and two increases for aluminum this month that total 21 cents a pound. "There are price increases everywhere," Mr. Popson said. He said that Custom-Bilt had raised prices at least 5 percent each month since September but was approaching the limits of that strategy, so it had begun to urge customers to substitute, say, steel gutters and downspouts for aluminum ones.
 At the White House, the President's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, said the finished-goods index showed "very good performance." She said intermediate goods showed "some signs of price pressures" dating from mid-1994 and dismissed crude prices as a category that moved too erratically to cause concern.
 Still, some of the January increases were stunning. Among intermediate goods, nondurable factory materials jumped 2 percent, after a 1.1 December advance. Paperboard was up 4.9 percent and plastic resins, organic chemicals, synthetic fibers and phosphates all accelerated.
 Durable factory items jumped 1.8 percent, with aluminum mill shapes soaring 9.6 percent. Semifinished steel mill products and cold-rolled steel sheets and strip were also up more than they had been in December. Paper boxes and containers jumped 2.4 percent, triple the December increase.
 Plywood, however, perhaps reflecting sluggishness in housing, fell 3.1 percent, and copper and brass mill shapes rose at a slackened pace.
 Crude goods other than food and energy soared 3 percent after advances of 2.3 percent and 3.1 percent in the two preceding months. Iron and steel scrap rose 4.8 percent and price increases quickened for wastepaper (up 17.4 percent), raw cotton, pulpwood logs, and construction sand and gravel. Copper base scrap rose at a slower pace, 1.4 percent, compared with 6.2 percent in December.
 The heaviest of the price increases could be over, some analysts noted. "Spot prices for base metals have faltered in recent weeks, suggesting that the commodity price surge may be ending," Merrill Lynch told clients today.
 But interest rates may well have further to rise, said Kenneth Safian, proprietor of Safian Investment Research in White Plains. Using the intermediate-goods index as the inflation gauge, the real interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds -- the difference between the stated interest rate and the rate of inflation -- is now less than 2.4 percent, the lowest since February 1981. This is only half the real rate calculated using the Consumer Price Index, which is a lagging indicator.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Incentives Growing For Buyers Of Homes

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo 

 BODY:
WITH interest rates rising and home sales slipping, bankers and builders are trying to entice home buyers with such goodies as small cash payments, warranties, locked-in interest rates and discount financing.
 The inducements come on top of a substantial easing in credit terms early last year. To assist low-income home buyers, many lenders started permitting borrowers to have higher levels of debt, to have less than two months of cash after closing and to put just 3 percent down when the Federal National Mortgage Association agreed to begin buying such loans. 
 Market forces are driving the latest changes. Sales of new homes fell in November and December, the latest months for which data are available, and demand for mortgages has fallen off as much as 50 percent in the last 12 months.
"Lenders are out there beating the bushes, and you've got some out there who are starving," said Keith Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J.
 Fleet Mortgage Group, which has 85 offices in 35 states, acknowledged that it wanted to bolster business. "Looking at the market conditions, we need to be a little more aggressive," said Karen Spagna, regional sales manager for Fleet Mortgage, which is based in Columbia, S.C.
 The big mortgage company is offering existing customers $250 off closing costs if they refinance a mortgage or take out a new home loan. It is also allowing pre-approved home buyers to lock in an interest rate 30 days before a home buyer's contract is signed. "Prior to this, you couldn't enter into a rate lock until a purchase contract was signed," Ms. Spagna said.
 In yet another twist, Fleet is providing a free three-month warranty on heating and central air-conditioning and refrigerators. "As people are moving into a new home, it is often a time when they are strapped for cash and quite concerned about taking on initial obligations," said Charles Begley, a senior vice president with Fleet Mortgage.
 Builders' inducements can be even more generous. This winter, Eddy & Lewin Homes in Amherst, N.Y., offered $3,000 discounts on homes priced at $105,000 to $132,000.
 "It was effective -- I sold them all," said Thomas E. Lewin, vice president of Eddy & Lewin. "If the economy is doing great, you don't need to give incentives."
 Incentives are most common in winter when sales are slowest. Toll Brothers Inc., a major builder in the Northeast based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., is offering financing at below-market rates on some homes until May. For example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is available at 8.25 percent for borrowers willing to pay an origination fee of three points. A point is equal to 1 percent of the total loan amount. The rate is substantially below the average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, which was 9.15 percent on Feb. 7, according to HSH Associates.
 Buyers should not expect too much in rate discounts, though. "You can only cut rates so far," Mr. Gumbinger said.
 According to HSH, the average rate on a fixed mortgage is more than two percentage points higher than a year ago. The average rate for a one-year adjustable mortgage, at 6.76 percent, has risen more than 2.5 percentage points. "The lowest you are going to find today is probably about 5.25 percent, and that's with three points," Mr. Gumbinger said.
 Some borrowers, particularly those with good credit, might be able to negotiate with a lender for a better deal. Mr. Gumbinger recommended asking for a quarter percentage point off the origination fee, not a lower interest rate.
 "That's generally where their commission comes from, and you probably won't get more than a quarter point," he said.
 At the very least, home buyers should be able to find good service -- something often lacking during the refinancing boom of recent years.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Bill to Curb Antitrust Exemption On Way

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If any optimists remain, if anyone believes a negotiated settlement with the owners will propel striking baseball players back to work, developments in Washington and New York yesterday served as a sharp reminder that the best hope still lies with Congress or the National Labor Relations Board.
 Although Congress is not prepared to pass President Clinton's binding arbitration bill, it will get a chance to endorse a bipartisan bill that, if adopted, would prompt the players to end their strike, which today completes its sixth month. 
 Senators Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, announced yesterday that they would introduce a bill next Tuesday that would repeal baseball's exemption from antitrust laws as it affects labor relations.
 In a letter released by Hatch's office, Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, wrote to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, "If the bill becomes law, I will recommend to the members of the Major League Baseball Players Association that we end the strike."
 Repeal of part of the exemption could lead to the players' return because it would enable them to challenge in court any new work rules the owners might unilaterally implement.
 The labor board has leaped back into the dispute because the clubs, which a week ago agreed to restore baseball's old work rules, have ignited a new phase of their increasingly incendiary relationship with the players.
 With the clubs already having delegated exclusive authority to the Player Relations Committee to negotiate individual player contracts, their labor lawyers have informed the Players Association in the last two days that they will not conduct salary arbitration, will not recognize the free-agent collusion provision and will not negotiate individual contracts with players or their agents but only with the union.
 The players could also return to work if labor board developments lead to a Federal court injunction that would prevent the clubs from changing the work rules that were in effect until Dec. 23, when the owners declared a negotiating impasse.
 However, in either case, Congress or labor board, if the players ended their strike, the owners very likely would lock them out. The owners have vowed not to play the 1995 season under the old economic system.
 Unlike the binding arbitration bill, the Hatch-Moynihan bill would not impose a settlement or a means to a settlement on the two sides.
 "Rather," the senators said in a letter to their colleagues, "it would simply remove a serious impediment to settlement -- an impediment that is the product of an aberration in our antitrust laws."
 The owners have long insisted that removal of the exemption or any part of it would not lead to an agreement. But the players, for just as long if not longer, have argued that their inability to sue in court over a unilaterally implemented system has given the owners an unfair edge in negotiations.
 Hatch and Moynihan said the aberration in the laws "has handed the owners a huge club that gives them unique leverage in bargaining and discourages them from accepting reasonable terms."
 Moynihan introduced a bill on the first day of the 104th Congress that would repeal the entire exemption. The new bill would not affect franchise relocation, the minor league reserve clause or the amateur draft. Moynihan said he looked forward to "an end to this painful strike as soon as possible."
 No end, however, is in sight in the antagonistic acts between the owners and players.
 When Fred Feinstein, the N.L.R.B. general counsel, informed Chuck O'Connor, management's chief labor lawyer, on Feb. 3 that he was inclined to issue a complaint against the owners based on the union's unfair labor practice charge, the clubs agreed to revoke the salary cap system they implemented Dec. 23 after declaring the impasse.
 They also agreed to restore "the status quo that existed prior to implementation." Union officials believed that status quo included all of the elements of the expired collective bargaining agreement and filed a new unfair labor practice charge with the board last Tuesday after the P.R.C., the clubs' labor arm, said it would handle all individual contract negotiations.
 But in telephone calls and letters, the P.R.C. further advised the union that it had added other new wrinkles, eliminating salary arbitration and the collusion provision, which bars clubs from acting in concert with other clubs in the pursuit of free agents.
 In a letter yesterday, O'Connor also told Fehr, "The P.R.C. will not negotiate with individual players." The P.R.C., he wrote, will negotiate with the union.
 "They're taking the position that their promise to restore the status quo applies only to mandatory subjects for bargaining," Doyle Pryor, a union lawyer, said. "Their position is that salary arbitration and individual negotiations are not mandatory subjects. We believe they're wrong on the law. Whether they're wrong or not, it's inconsistent with the promise they made to the N.L.R.B."
 The board has begun its investigation of the union's latest charge. O'Connor deferred comment to an aide, Rob Manfred, but Manfred did not return a call.
 Earlier in the week, Feinstein, the N.L.R.B. general counsel, issued a statement in which he said that in his discussions with O'Connor, "I made clear that the P.R.C. would act at its peril in making any changes in terms of employment other than restoration of the pre-Dec. 22 status quo."

HEADLINE: Thieves in the Idea Marketplace

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
"I can't deal in my mind with ROM's," Beverly Sills confessed. "My children are better at computers than I am."
But Miss Sills, the chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, retired soprano and former New York City Opera director, said she had caught on fast when she walked the streets of China and Japan and saw "thousands, literally thousands, of my CD's with covers I had never seen before." 
 She was being ripped off. And so, perhaps, was her reputation. Many of the illegally produced compact disks mixed selections she had never recorded together, including duets with singers she hadn't sung with.
At a time when the computer-fostered piracy of copyrighted music, films, computer software and other intellectual property has set off a trade war between China and the United States, Ms. Sills's concerns are shared by many artists, policy makers, lawyers and technology experts.
With the computer serving as the world's biggest copier -- swiftly replicating not only text but also paintings, video and music for manipulation as "new" works -- how, they ask, can the original creators and owners be protected and compensated?
"What we have is a process that's created, in our words, a borderless, unpoliced public access to information, anytime, anywhere," Ivan G. Seidenberg, the president and chief operating officer of Nynex, said at a recent conference. "And so basically there are almost no rules associated with what one can do."
At the same time, computer technology is opening up extraordinary new channels for dispersing culture: museum exhibits viewable on home and classroom terminals, along with forums with arts experts, CD-ROM compact disk players with "read-only-memory" for interactive teaching and entertainment, and concerts and other events transmitted live over an interactive global video-telephone system.
But according to leading figures in the arts and humanities, technology is fast outracing the law, and the unauthorized copying, manipulation and sale of creative property, at home and abroad, are disrupting licensing structures that date to the founding of the American Republic.
More than 100 of these leaders, including Ms. Sills, gathered at the Museum of Television and Radio in December for a conference on the impact of new technologies on intellectual property rights and the arts. In subsequent interviews, some of them expanded on the issues.
"Everybody is just terrified over what ownership is," said Red Burns, the director of the Alternate Media Center at New York University and a pioneer in interactive television. Institutions, she said in an interview, "live in mortal fear of being sued."
Similar themes were sounded at the conference. "So long as original works were packaged in books and films and records and paintings, things we could actually store and handle, the notion of owning brain work seemed to hold," said Ernest L. Boyer, the president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the commissioner of education under President Jimmy Carter.
"But," he said, "when it became possible to send digital signals effortlessly and instantaneously from one hard-disk drive to another, information began to slip past the traditional gate keepers of the culture."
"I have no idea where all of this, legally, will lead," Dr. Boyer said, "except perhaps to what one lawyer friend of mine approvingly described as 'vistas of endless litigation.' "
Yet litigation is a costly and cumbersome way to resolve issues, many people in the arts agree. And events are moving too fast for the law.
The quandaries affect not only writers, artists, composers and other "content providers" whose creations lie open to cyberthieves. They also concern actors, dancers, musicians, teachers and other interpreters of intellectual property; presenters like producers, museums, publishers and television; providers of technology like telephone companies and computer hardware and software manufacturers; foundations and other sources of financial support, and finally the consumers and audience, the public.
"We're attempting to get the parties to understand they need each other," said Martin E. Segal, a former chairman of Lincoln Center and the chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts, who convened the conference along with Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company.
But the problems often defy consensus, particularly where creators of art are concerned. "I don't see this as anything but a disaster for creative people," said Garrison Keillor, the author and radio humorist. "I think there's a collision coming, and I'm pretty confident that the authors are not the guys at the wheel. I think the author is the deer in the headlights."
Anti-theft devices don't necessarily work, said Stephen Sondheim, the composer and lyricist, citing the routine piracy of cable television signals and the circumvention of anti-copy codes on videocassettes. "I know people who have machines that can uncopy-protect it," he said. "They rent it from their store, they copy it."
But many see promise as well as peril ahead. Maxwell L. Anderson, the director of the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University in Atlanta and a guru of the new technologies, cited his museum's growing digital outreach. Visitors to the Carlos can electronically browse the exhibits at computer kiosks or buy CD-ROM's of the shows to play at home. On the Internet, they can visit the museum from home 24 hours a day and engage in periodic live forums with the staff.
The Whitney Museum of American Art and the National Museum of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution have also launched themselves into cyberspace. "There is something about the anonymity and informality of the electronic technologies that encourages really free and occasionally irreverent expressions of opinion," said Elizabeth Broun, the national museum's director.
So long as pictures are reproduced with a limited palette of only 256 colors, there is little likelihood of piracy, Ms. Broun noted. But to guard further against infringements, she said, the museum will restrict its offerings for now to items to which it holds title.
"Like lots of other museums," Ms. Broun said, "we've looked at the veritable minefield of legal issues surrounding copyright and we have concluded that at least for now, while cyberspace is a chaotic wild west frontier full of highway bandits and subject to only the roughest kind of vigilante justice, we will just focus on our rich public domain collections."
Joel de Rosnay, director of development and international relations of the Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris, said he foresaw a day when everyone would walk around with computers and small re-inscriptable CD's. "Then everybody will be transformed into a potential thief," he said. But, he added, "I would like to look at those people as potential co-creators."
He said original material could be locked by codes until the user sent payment by E-mail. Billing users of telecommunications is already a routine part of telephone service.
The digital world, in fact, does allow artists and their public to communicate uniquely, one on one. Thus, said Brian Kahin, the general counsel of the Interactive Multimedia Association, "contract is taking precedence over copyright as a means for managing the flow of information on this environment."
In one innovative effort to resolve intellectual property rights, the Getty Art History Information Program of the J. Paul Getty Trust teamed up late last year with Muse Educational Media, a nonprofit museum group, to distribute art images and information from six museums to seven universities.
Under the collaboration, called the Museum Educational Site Licensing Project, the museums will put digital images of some 3,000 of their artworks on the campus computer networks of the universities, including Columbia and Cornell, without charge through mid-1997.
"The economic, the legal, the technical only go so far," said Alan J. Friedman, the director of the New York Hall of Science. "All of these solutions, to some extent, will require a social contract, a measure of trust, a measure of faith in the system working. We are all taking a risk. On the other hand, we don't have any choice."
Jacob Druckman, a composer and Pulitzer Prize winner, put it another way. "Cars get stolen," he said. "We don't give up cars just because of car thefts."

THE POPULIST PERSUASION
An American History.
By Michael Kazin.
Illustrated. 381 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $24. 
IN the 1990's, it is hard to find a political candidate, a media star or an advertiser who does not claim to be a populist. Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, Jesse Jackson, Pat Robertson, Rush Limbaugh, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna -- all portray themselves as the voice, the offspring or the champion of ordinary people. How bad have things become? Hewlett-Packard, Michael Kazin tells us, recently advertised a Populist printer, "perfect . . . for the masses"; "erstwhile neo-Nazi David Duke . . . helped start a tiny Populist Party in 1988," and Banana Republic has introduced a line of men's cotton "POPULIST pants . . . for the individual in everyman."
There was a time, writes Mr. Kazin in this perceptive and passionately liberal book, when the language of populism had real meaning to the people who used it. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, he says, populism implied a noble assemblage of common folk, employing the power of mass democracy to confront the forces of privilege and greed. Farmers, factory workers, progressives and prohibitionists all raised the populist banner to battle "predatory interests." His own "People's Party" was "the protest of the plundered against the plunderers," declared Tom Watson, a turn-of-the-century populist leader, "of the victim against the robbers."
As his title, "The Populist Persuasion," indicates, Mr. Kazin, a professor of history at American University, is more interested in the rhetoric of populist movements than the movements themselves. Beginning with the antislavery crusade of the 1840's, he skillfully surveys more than a century of mass protests, using imagery and symbolism as his guides. For most of its history, he notes, populism was associated with the left. Its language praised the toiling masses and linked political virtue with manual pursuits. But in time, this vision blurred, a relic of simpler days.
Following World War II, populism changed its political course, moving sharply to the right. The harsh cold-war climate and the return of prosperity served to discredit left-wing movements and ideas. In this new age of mass advertising and material abundance, most workers came to view themselves as consumers and taxpayers, not as members of an exploited class, and seemed less concerned by the power of big business, which provided them with good jobs, than by the growth of big government. For the first time, Mr. Kazin notes, the vocabulary of populism, of grass-roots protest, became a vehicle "to thwart and reverse social and cultural change rather than to promote it."
Mr. Kazin is well aware of populism's darker side. Its rhetoric had always stressed the fight between good and evil, between a virtuous majority and an unworthy elite. Populist spokesmen tended to portray their opponents as the enemies of ordinary people -- and thus of democracy itself. To illustrate these points, Mr. Kazin provides a superb portrait of William Jennings Bryan, who in the early 1900's preached majority rule on issues ranging from prohibition to evolution in the public schools; and another of Father Charles E. Coughlin, whose crusade in the 1930's for "social justice" degenerated into ugly attacks upon Jews.
In the 1950's, this intolerant strain was coopted by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, a self-proclaimed "country boy" who spoke of a giant internal conspiracy, directed by the liberal establishment, to advance the Communist cause. McCarthy didn't last long at the top. The rhetoric of populism is that of crisis, and his wild charges were muted by the election of President Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, the death of Stalin in 1953 and the subsequent armistice in Korea. Still, McCarthy showed that the anxieties and discontents of working people could be directed against the new liberal elite. This made him, as Mr. Kazin deftly details, a trailblazer of sorts -- a right-wing messiah of the masses.
In the 1960's, liberalism faced angry assaults from both ends of the political spectrum. On the left, radical college students tried -- and failed -- to convert the nation's growing antiwar sentiment into a political movement with "revolutionary democratic" goals. Mr. Kazin is sympathetic to these students, partly, it appears, because he was one of them. Yet his larger point, that their clumsy use of populist rhetoric offended an overwhelming majority of Americans, is surely correct. Wasn't a college education the ultimate privilege? What gave them the right to be angry at all? The black writer Julius Lester expressed an all-too-common sentiment when he described these students as "perhaps the first radicals anywhere who have sought to make a revolution in a country which they hate."
A backlash was inevitable. The chaotic social and political protests of the 1960's further weakened the nation's liberal leadership without producing a credible alternative. In short order, Mr. Kazin writes, a new populist spokesman arose to fill the void: George Corley Wallace, a working-class Southern Democrat with a segregationist history and striking national appeal.
Mr. Kazin sees Mr. Wallace as the godfather of the modern American right. (More traditional conservatives like Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona play a minor role in this account.) The problem, however, is that Mr. Wallace does not fit neatly into a conventional box. As the Governor of Alabama, Mr. Wallace supported many New Deal reforms. And as a Presidential candidate in 1968 and 1972, Mr. Kazin notes, he "explicitly favored a Government that aided the common folk -- as long as it stayed out of their schools, their unions, and their family lives."
What makes Mr. Wallace and his rhetoric so vital to Mr. Kazin's story is both his visceral attachment to these common folk and his open sympathy for their deepest passions and fears. Mr. Wallace, Mr. Kazin says, was the first major Presidential candidate of this century to identify himself as a working man. His 1968 campaign literature portrayed him as "a former truck driver married to a dime store clerk." He courted the kind of sneering jabs that appeared in a major intellectual journal about his "ill-cut suits" and his "graying drip-dry shirts," Mr. Kazin writes. His constituents were people much like himself, he boasted: average Americans who worked hard, loved their country, believed in God, paid their taxes and obeyed the law.
RACE was always central to the Wallace message, as Mr. Kazin makes clear. Yet Mr. Wallace rarely criticized blacks per se; his targets were the arrogant liberals who looked down on white working people and meddled endlessly in their lives. A typical Wallace speech skewered Federal judges who mandated forced busing and affirmative action programs; "pseudo-intellectuals" who promoted a permissive culture of crime, sex and drugs; and faceless bureaucrats, living comfortably in the suburbs, who spent billions of hard-earned tax dollars on failed programs for ungrateful minorities. "Some of his best applause lines," Mr. Kazin tells us, "came at the expense of the anonymous professor who 'knows how to run the Vietnam War but can't park his bicycle straight.' " When student hecklers appeared at his campaign rallies, Mr. Wallace brought roars of approval by shouting: "You young people seem to know a lot of four-letter words. But I have two . . . you don't know: S-O-A-P and W-O-R-K."
In the weeks before the 1968 Presidential election, public opinion polls showed Mr. Wallace at a hefty 21 percent, only 7 points behind Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, the Democratic nominee. But Mr. Wallace faded badly, the victim, it appeared, of his own excessive zeal. In October, he chose Gen. Curtis LeMay, the retired Air Force Chief of Staff and tireless advocate of atomic warfare, as his running mate on the American Independent ticket. "I don't believe the world would end if we exploded a nuclear weapon," LeMay told startled reporters. Indeed, he added, the testing of hydrogen bombs in the Pacific had been an environmental asset because the rats on Bikini atoll "are bigger, fatter and healthier than they ever were before."
Governor Wallace received about 10 million votes, or 13.6 percent, evenly split between North and South. His campaign revealed the first sightings of the Silent Majority, as well as the obvious limits of his own raw appeal. "In his clever, snarling way," writes Mr. Kazin, George Wallace "was too authentically populist, too candid and impolitic an outlet for the rage of his mostly male, mostly working-class followers to attract other voters who simply wanted the nation's troubles to end."
According to Mr. Kazin, the Wallace lesson was refined by Republicans like Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who learned to exploit the same mass resentments in a more respectable way. Mr. Reagan, in particular, presented a gentler vision of the Wallace message -- a vision of what must be protected rather than who should be beaten down. He emphasized the identical issues, from defense of family to an economic order based on merit and hard work, in a manner that attracted mainstream voters. The fact that Mr. Reagan's rhetoric was often at odds with his Administration's policies did not seem to matter. He had captured the language of populism, says Mr. Kazin, and that was enough.
Mr. Kazin finished his provocative book before the 1994 Congressional elections, which may explain his cautious optimism about the future of left-liberal politics in the United States. He believes that the "populist persuasion" -- the ideals and rhetoric of mass democracy -- can be refashioned by the left in a less strident, more meaningful way. But this will not be easy. Few Americans can recall a time when the common folk had shared interests, the welfare state was in favor, and the labor movement was strong. And fewer still, I suspect, would agree that "left" populism speaks to their present needs and humane instincts, while "right" populism caters to their resentments, hatreds and fears. The political landscape has changed dramatically in the past five decades, and casualties abound. For those in power today, the message should be clear: populism is a deep, enduring impulse with a very fickle past.

HEADLINE: Paying The Price For Blowing The Whistle

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
FOR three years, Arnold Gundersen was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night. He became so concerned about his family's safety that he bought a large dog for protection. The problem? He was a whistle-blower, one of those who take on the dismally unpopular role of exposing what they find to be unsafe or unlawful practices in the workplace, especially the nuclear workplace.
"It feels like you're in a fort surrounded by Indians, and you send for help," Mr. Gundersen said. "You hear the hoofbeats of the cavalry in the distance as it finally comes toward you. But they start shooting at you." 
 Mr. Gundersen, who lives in Warren, told of the day in 1990 when he discovered radioactive material in an accounting safe at Nuclear Energy Services in Danbury, the consulting firm where he held a $120,000-a-year job as senior vice president. Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations, Mr. Gundersen said, he was fired.
He is fighting a $1.5 million lawsuit filed against him by his former employer for continuing to discuss the alleged safety violations publicly after agreeing to an out-of-court settlement. Mr. Gundersen said he believes he was blacklisted, citing an April 22, 1991, letter concerning him that the company sent to 78 people. He also says he was harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right.
Mr. Gundersen's case, according to a number of whistle-blowers and others interviewed, is not uncommon, especially in the nuclear industry. Even though nuclear workers are encouraged to report potential safety hazards, those who decide to do so say that they risk demotion and dismissal. Instead of correcting the problems, whistle-blowers and their supporters say, industry management and government forces attack them as the cause of the problem.
Driven out of their jobs and shunned by neighbors and co-workers, whistle-blowers turn to each other for support. Several in Connecticut have formed an informal network with those in other states.
"There's no support," Mr. Gundersen said. "It's just us, talking on the phone late at night. Just our ragtag group." Mr. Gundersen, who holds a master's degree in nuclear engineering, said blacklisting in the industry made it impossible for him to find another job in his field. He worked as a dump truck driver before taking a $20,000-a-year job as a teacher at the Forman School in Litchfield. He and his wife, Margaret, have exhausted their savings, and their house is in foreclosure. The Gundersens and their two children are looking for a place to live.
Michael L. Cioffi, vice president and assistant general counsel of American Premier Underwriters Inc., the former owner of Nuclear Energy Services, said Mr. Gundersen was laid off because of a reduction in staff. The company was sold in 1993.
Although whistle-blowers are protected under Federal and state laws, a number said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which monitors the nuclear industry, fails to keep whistle-blowers' names confidential. Their claims are supported by results of an investigation begun in 1992 by the commission's Office of the Inspector General, which found the commission fails to protect whistle-blowers from retaliation and fails to resolve their complaints quickly.
Sixteen whistle-blowers interviewed during the investigation described experiences ranging from physical threats and attacks to psychological intimidation on and off the job, according to a report on the investigation published in 1993.
One whistle-blower told of a co-worker pointing to a charred mannequin used in firefighting exercises and saying the whistle-blower could end up in a similar state if his behavior did not change. The offender was disciplined, but the whistle-blower developed post traumatic stress disorder, a neurosis following an abnormally stressful experience, such as military combat or assault.
The report also detailed, although the investigation did not independently verify, other whistle-blowers' stories, including being forced off the road by an unfamiliar car while driving home from work, unidentified people shooting at a whistle-blower's home from a vehicle, poisoning of family pets and harassing phone calls late at night.
A total of 609 complaints of retaliation against whistle-blowers filed with the nuclear commission and the United States Department of Labor resulted in only 44 investigations and just 7 enforcement actions during four and a half years. A team established in 1993 to review the nuclear commission's whistle-blower protection program made 47 recommendations to improve the environment for workers who raise safety concerns. Some of those proposals have been carried out, while others have yet to be completed, Beth Hayden, deputy director of the commission's Office of Public Affairs, said.
After he lost his job, Mr. Gundersen said he had nightmares, his blood pressure went up and he suffered from impotence. He was so depressed that he came close to committing suicide, he said. "It was a question of whether I would drive my car into a tree or blow my brains out," he said. "I saw myself as a provider. I figured that if I couldn't feed my family, at least the insurance money would support them, so I decided to drive the car into a tree, because it would appear to be an accident."
But, he said, "Ultimately, I decided I would rather fight than run."
The authors of the book, "The Whistleblowers," Myron Peretz Glazer and Penina Migdal Glazer, surveyed 64 whistle-blowers and followed many from the early stages of their resistance through the final outcome.
The Glazers described the group generally as being made up of conservative people devoted to their work and their organizations who built their careers -- whether as professionals, managers or workers -- by conforming to bureaucratic life. Most had been successful until they were asked to violate their own standards of appropriate behavior in the workplace. Invariably, they believed they were defending the true mission of their organization by resisting unsafe or unlawful practices.
Donald Del Core Sr., a whistle-blower who lives in Uncasville, spends much of his time offering advice to others who say they have been punished for blowing the whistle. Mr. Del Core said he receives about 20 to 25 calls a year. "I advise them on the different agencies involved in their problem and where they may seek some relief. In all cases, I recommend that they contact a lawyer," he said. "And I provide confidentiality."
Mr. Del Core said he was working as an instrument and controls technician at the Millstone nuclear power plant in Waterford when he was fired in 1991 for whistle-blowing. He filed harassment, intimidation and discrimination complaints against Northeast Utilities, owner and operator of the plant, and took the company to court after his dismissal. Finally, Mr. Del Core said, his financial situation drove him to settle out of court.
"I wanted to fight. But I had a second mortgage and was collecting unemployment," he explained. "It was as if I was giving the store away. Everything I believed in and felt strongly about I had to throw out the window. It was either financial ruin or take a settlement agreement and try to put my life back together."
After investigating Mr. Del Core's charges against Northeast Utilities, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that, although some discrimination and intimidation may have occurred, Mr. Del Core was fired not for whistle-blowing but rather for disruptive behavior. The manager of nuclear information at Northeast Utilities, Anthony J. Castagno, also denied Mr. Del Core was fired for whistle-blowing, saying the reason for his dismissal was a breakdown in working relationships. "Sometimes it is in the best interest of everyone to settle," Mr. Castagno said, "rather than continuing to fight this in court or in the media."
Still fighting for vindication, Mr. Del Core wrote a letter last March to United States Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who has acted as an advocate for whistle-blowers, asking that the commission's investigation be reopened. He said he still has not received a reply.
Shortsightedness and concerns about the cost of having to shut down a nuclear plant prevent government and the nuclear industry from listening to whistle-blowers, said James Riccio, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a consumer advocate organization in Washington. "The nuclear power industry is fighting for its life," Mr. Riccio said. Wall Street analysts predict that as many as 25 reactors will be shut down by the year 2000 because they cannot compete with gas-fired turbines, he added.
We the People, a nationwide whistle-blower organization based in Rowley, Mass., has become a strong link in the whistle-blowers' network. Formed by Stephen B. Comley in 1986, the group seeks to protect whistle-blowers' identities, research their concerns, provide legal defense and offer moral support. "The biggest problem is getting someone in Washington to listen," Mr. Comley said.
Mr. Comley became a whistle-blower in the mid-1980's when he questioned safety practices at the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire. When We the People began making safety allegations public, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission demanded in Federal court to know the source of those allegations. Mr. Comley refused to reveal his sources and was found in contempt of court, resulting in a fine of $1,000 a day and narrowly missing going to jail. The fine has grown to more than $400,000, Mr. Comley said, the Internal Revenue Service has attached his personal tax refunds and a Federal attorney has threatened to attach his property. Would he take such risks again to make nuclear plants safer? "I don't know how I couldn't do it again," Mr. Comley replied.

HEADLINE: Lead Paint: New Rules, Old Questions

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
CLAUDE N. LIMOGES thought he recognized the threat of lead paint. When a 2-year-old boy living in an apartment building that Mr. Limoges owned was diagnosed with an elevated blood lead level, Mr. Limoges sent a work crew into the building to replace the windows, doors and woodwork, all of which were covered with lead paint.
But before the workmen had finished, they had spread so much lead around the four-unit building that the boy's blood lead-levels went even higher, and his 6-month-old brother was also poisoned. 
 "I got sued for $2 million," said Mr. Limoges. "I lost. The case never went to trial. My insurance company settled."
Mr. Limoges, then a landlord in Brockton, Mass., was so impressed that he went into the business of testing for lead contamination. With Federal legislation that has been enacted since his troubles in Brockton, and now coming into force, he is in a growth industry, as the hazard of lead in the home is more and more widely recognized.
And it will be a concern of nearly every landlord, renter, house buyer and house seller in the country in the next few months, when regulations governing all apartment and house sales and rentals, written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are scheduled to take effect.
The new rules are to govern what landlords and sellers have to tell prospective renters and buyers about lead on the premises, a complex and pervasive problem.
"It transcends poverty lines, socio-economic lines, and race lines, and it can be as much of a problem in a well-to-do suburb as in the inner city," said William F. Abrams, a lawyer in San Francisco who teaches part of a course in lead abatement at the University of California at Berkeley.
According to a 1990 study by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, of the 77 million privately owned homes built before 1980, 57 million, or 75 percent, have lead-based paint. Of these, 11 million have it indoors, 18 million have it outside and 28 million have it inside and out.
Lead can stunt a child's growth, hurt short-term memory, suppress appetite, disturb sleep, and cause hearing loss and hyperactivity. It takes more lead to hurt adults, but in adults it can cause hypertension and fertility problems, among other ailments.
The reason lead turns up in high-priced housing, experts say, is that lead was a premium additive. Some of its most useful qualities are now its most dangerous. For example, in exterior paint its use was especially heavy because under sunlight it tends to "chalk," and as the outermost layer sloughed off, a fresh layer appeared. (And the old layer became dust that accumulated in soil or was tracked into the house.) It was also prized for exterior use because it was so toxic that mildew would not grow on it.
Indoors, it was simply more durable. Thus lead in paint was a selling point from the early years of this century, when it became popular, until 1978, when it was finally banned nationally.
(In theory, New York City banned lead paint in 1960, but in a city known for informal retailing of banned chemicals, experts say that no one should count on a building's being lead-free just because it was built after 1960. In fact, most contractors shop where they live and if they came to work in the city from outside the five boroughs, they may have brought leaded paint with them.)
The lead paint is still there, and need not be falling in chips to be a hazard.
"In some ways, the biggest problem is not from the obvious, the walls, but from friction surfaces, like door jambs and window casings," said Steve Matthews, a spokesman for the New York City Health Department. "Every time the door opens and closes, or a window is raised and lowered, you're putting dust into the atmosphere. You can see the chips flaking form the wall, but you don't really see the dust from opening and closing the door."
Mr. Abrams, the lawyer in San Francisco, said that the dust that could be created even in generally well-maintained houses can be spread around with ordinary household cleaning, with a vacuum cleaner or dust mop, adding to the hazard.
And dust is all it takes in some cases, according to scientists, who are growing more and more cautious in their definition of lead poisoning. The units of measurement are difficult to understand, micrograms (or millionths of a gram) per deciliter of blood, abbreviated ug/ dL, but the trend is obvious; in 1970 the Centers for Disease Control declared that blood lead levels of 40 micrograms and up were elevated; in 1991 the same agency used 10 micrograms, or 75 percent less.
New York State uses 10 micrograms, requiring all children under the age of 2 to be screened and following up with monitoring of children whose level is 10 or higher; at 20 micrograms per deciliter the local health department sends out investigators.
"We will keep looking until we find out what the source is," said Mr. Matthews of the health department. "We will look at the grandmother's house, the babysitter's, but in virtually every case, it's the child's home. Last year about 2,000 children in the city were measured at 20 micrograms or above.
The source can be lead in drinking water, because lead piping was heavily favored early in the century, since it does not expand or contract much with changes in temperature. Many cities are now adding chemicals to drinking water to reduce leaching of lead from the pipes.
But with leaded gasoline nearly eliminated, most often now the source is paint.
The blood test is what alerted Ann-Isabel Friedman after she and her husband bought an 1852 brownstone on Dean Street in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. It had so many layers of paint that it was "alligatored," to use Ms. Friedman's expression. In December 1992, they began renovating it themselves, starting with two first-floor parlors, which they separated from the rest of the house with plastic sheeting.
The next month, they wanted to send their 2-year-old daughter, Sophie, to nursery school, and the school required a blood test. It showed a lead level of nearly 70.
"We had thought that as long as we weren't actually occupying the rooms we were renovating, we would be O.K.," said Ms. Friedman.
Paint with lead in it tastes sweet, so children eat it, but Sophie's x-rays did not show any paint chips. Because of this, Ms. Friedman believes that her daughter either ingested lead-contaminated dust -- a common problem with children that age -- or inhaled lead fumes created when she and her husband used a heat gun to strip woodwork. In any case, Sophie was hospitalized twice, for a week at a time, to receive two shots a day in each thigh of chemicals that wash lead out of the body, a process called chelation.
"It was pretty terrible," said Ms. Friedman. "She didn't feel sick, and it was hard to explain to her what lead was, this insidious thing she couldn't see."
A healthier solution, said Ms. Friedman, would have been to remove the woodwork intact, rather than stripping it. But Ms. Friedman, who at the time was working for the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, said, "My problem was, being trained to appreciate 19th century architecture, I wanted to look at it."
Howard L. Tomb felt safe in the apartment on Edgemont Road in Katonah, N.Y., that he and his wife occupied with their 8-month-old daughter, Lucy. It was in an old Victorian house, but it appeared to have been extensively renovated in the last few years.
But late last year, Mr. Tomb said, the owner brought in painters to scrape and paint the exterior. The painters failed to spread dropcloths to catch the scrapings, he said, so lead was tracked into the house.
Lucy showed 13 micrograms on a fingertip blood test in December, he said. The number is elevated but only slightly, and doctors recommend monitoring only. That level has not been shown to cause ill effects in individuals, but population groups with that level are more likely to show symptoms than groups with a lower level.
But, said Mr. Tomb, an author and freelance writer, "when you're talking about your own child, the fact that damage may not be evident in individuals is not enough to inspire confidence."
Mr. Tomb got a list of testing companies from the Westchester Health Department, which, like most health agencies, keeps a list of labs. He selected Mr. Limoges's company, American Lead Consultants, which has its headquarters in Bala Cynwd, Pa., near Philadelphia. The company uses moistened, nonalcoholic baby wipes, covering a precise square area with each, and then analyzes them for lead. It found nearly 200,000 micrograms per square foot in a nursery window well of Mr. Tomb's apartment, about 250 times the guideline set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The Tombs moved in with a relative.
Experts have a long list of advice. Never dry-sand paint that could have lead; use chemical stripping instead, or better yet, replace the woodwork. Be careful with heat guns, which can turn the lead in paint into a gas. Don't vacuum up construction dust with an ordinary vacuum; it will simply spread the dust around. Wash up with a detergent that has trisodium phosphate, described on the shelves of hardware stores as TSP.
Better yet, have the job done by a professional.
Lead is a problem all over the country, but particularly in older metropolitan areas, like New York, where the housing stock is mostly from the bad old days. Windows, window sills, doors, baseboards, wainscoting, mantles and any other wood trim are all suspect, because lead paint, particularly durable, tended to be used on woodwork, which needed a tougher coating than ordinary walls did. The consensus of experts is that the easiest way to solve the problem is not to strip woodwork, but to replace it.
There are two testing methods. One is to take "swipe samples," in which a technician uses a moistened cloth to gather dust over a carefully measured area. The dust is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Paint chips can also be sent for analysis.
(Do-it-yourself test kits are also available, but Government experts question their accuracy, especially at low levels.)
Lab analysis is the only method available for soil from around the outside of buildings. Soil near buildings that have been repeatedly painted and scraped can build up substantial lead deposits, which can hurt children playing in the dirt, or people who eat vegetables grown there.
The other test method is to measure lead content of paint still in place, using an x-ray fluorescence gun, known in the industry as XRF. This shoots x-rays at a surface, analyzes the echo, and in 5 to 10 seconds gives a reading of the amount of lead present, on the surface layer of paint or layers underneath.
Experts say that it is not as accurate as lab tests in terms of the precise number of milligrams per square centimeter. The staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in fact, concluded two years ago that the method "should no longer be recommended." But advocates point out that it will disclose lead in subsurface layers that swipe tests will not, and is neater and faster than chip tests.
Mr. Limoges said that an XRF test by American Lead Consultants generally covers 150 to 200 surfaces in a house. It makes sense to analyze the whole house, he said, even if there are some areas that the owners do not plan to work on. They might do a kitchen first, but be prepared for a bedroom renovation later with no further testing.
A whole-house analysis runs $300 to $500, he said. Others said that that charge was typical.
This sounds like an expensive complication for a new problem, but experts say the hazard isn't new, only newly recognized.
"It's not that it hasn't always been bad; it's that now we realize how bad it is," said Lucy Billings, director of special litigation at Bronx Legal Services and an expert on lead.
Mr. Limoges said, "For years, painters have been saying, 'I'm tired and irritable and achy,' and for years they have been misdiagnosed."
The concern is still growing faster than the regulations. At the moment, few towns and cities have rules governing abatement, or regulating laboratories or testing firms. New York City is an exception. It has extensive rules on how to clean up lead-based paint in those cases where it has ordered an abatement.
Under proposed rules published last year by the E.P.A., painting contractors would have to get blood tests of their employees, although painting and home improvements generally are often such informal, cash-on-the-barrel businesses that it is not clear how well those regulations will work.
But other regulations seem likely to have a broader impact. In October the E.P.A. and H.U.D. jointly issued proposed regulations under the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Act of 1992 that would affect all sellers, landlords and agents.
The sellers, landlords and agents would have to give prospective buyers and renters a pamphlet -- which has not been drafted yet -- that describes the potential hazards. They would also have to disclose whether any tests have been done, and what the results were. Purchasers or renters would get a 10-day opportunity to have the apartment or house tested, at their own expense.
That would add lead to issues like termites or urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, which can require testing, disclosure, certification, and more forms at closings or lease-signings.
The rules are supposed to take effect in October, but could be delayed by public comment, industry objections or action by Congress.
Ms. Billings, of Bronx Legal Services, said those rules were "a mini-step forward."
"They only require that a known lead hazard has to be disclosed," she said. "It doesn't affirmatively require a seller or landlord to inspect." That raises the prospect that the new rules could function like the Government-mandated warnings on cigarette packages, which tobacco companies are now using to argue that consumers cannot claim they were not warned.
Landlords, said Ms. Billings, could argue that "if premises are accepted by tenant, they assumed the risk, and they are contributorily negligent." The same would hold for buyers, she said.
"I don't think it's protection at all, really," she said. And low-income tenants are not going to test, she said.
But Mr. Abrams, the San Francisco lawyer who teaches a course in abatement, predicted a bigger effect. As a result of the new rules, "agents can't be ignorant or look the other way," he said.
"A little bit of knowledge goes a long way," he said.

HEADLINE: A City Built on $4.25 an Hour

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
IN Washington people talk a lot about the minimum wage these days, but few try to live with it. This is a place where people actually do.
Jacksonville is a one and two-story, asphalt-coated city of trailer parks and pawnbrokers, where the residents eat $4.89 soup to Jell-O meals at the Golden Corral restaurant and buy blue jeans for $11.84 at the Wal-Mart. It's close to the sea but remote, an hour's drive from an interstate and two-and-a-half hours from Raleigh, the closest big city -- and a world apart from North Carolina's high-tech, high-wage economy. 
 Other than Louis Sewell's 7,000-square-foot neocolonial palace with a circular, red-brick drive and ornate moldings worthy of Versailles, caviar tastes go begging. When Itchy Popkin, the leading local furniture mogul, eats lunch at the retreat of the city's elite, the Jacksonville Country Club, the fare is a simple buffet of deep-fried chicken, stuffed green peppers and macaroni bathed in bright yellow cheese.
 But there's no real slum, either. The poverty rate is 9 percent, well below the state's rate of 13 percent, and the unemployment rate is just 5 percent. People just don't earn very much. For four straight years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has determined that the average annual pay in Jacksonville, population 80,000, is the lowest of the nation's 310 urban areas.
People get along, however, because this is low-cost, low-tax country, too. Mr. Sewell's house would be worth millions in the suburbs of major cities, but it is carried at $500,000 on the tax rolls here, and he says he doubts that he could sell it for that. More run-of-the-neighborhood, three-bedroom houses sell for $50,000 to $70,000.
And there's an even cheaper alternative. A quarter of the people in the county that Jacksonville dominates live in mobile homes, or trailers, according to a recent study. Used, most sell for less than $10,000.
In most American cities, not even McDonald's counter clerks start at the minimum wage. But they do here. The $4.25-an-hour minimum sets the starting standard for most jobs, and the average pay for all jobs is $7.50 an hour, about $4 less than the national average.
This is not Every Town, but nor are most places. Like Houston with oil, Detroit with cars and Wichita with aircraft, the economy of this eastern North Carolina city rolls with the fortunes of something bigger -- Camp Lejeune, the home of 40,000 marines, in addition to Jacksonville's civilian population of 80,000.
The marines, with take-home pay that starts at about $1,400 a month, support this city's service economy. And when they went off to the Persian Gulf war in 1990 and 1991, the fortunes of many local businesses sank. But wars aside, Camp Lejeune keeps this economy rolling.
All this makes Jacksonville a place to test the influence of the minimum wage against the theological thunder in Washington over President Clinton's proposal last month to raise the floor from $4.25, to $5.15.
To liberals, lifting the wages of those at the lower rungs of the labor force is a matter of social justice, helping the plight of struggling workers. To conservatives, the notion of setting wages is anathema, a violation of free-market principles that threatens to fan inflation and force businesses to lay off workers. Here, the moralizing over the minimum wage seems overwrought, and the warnings that raising it will damage the economy seem overdrawn.
At the start of the decade, the last time the Government raised the wage, employment went up, not down, and prices barely budged. No one speaks of cutting staff if the wage goes up again, and any inflation would likely be confined to minuscule price increases at restaurants, the principal payers of the minimum wage.
"I'm not sure I agree with what I hear out of Washington -- that a guy's going to hire less workers because they raised the minimum wage," said Mr. Sewell. Girthy, 60, a bear and deer hunter, Mr. Sewell is part-owner of the Golden Corral restaurant chain, which was built on the minimum wage and operates more than 400 outlets nationwide. "But I'd prefer it to be raised over a three-year period of time and let merchants work their way into it."
 
A Boost for the Local Economy
 Itchy Popkin, 59, an unlighted cigar permanently fixed in his mouth, surveys the three acres of bedroom suites, loungers and television sets under the roof of one of his four Furniture Fair stores -- two in Jacksonville, two in nearby communities. He says he sells 80 percent of his furniture on credit. Many of his customers are members of the low-wage economy, and Mr. Popkin would like to see a bit more money in their pockets. "It would help us, going to $5.15," he said. "Even that's not enough." And whatever an increase might mean for business, he said, "I don't see how people can live on that."
Even people who in their guts just don't like the Government meddling with wages equivocate. "The problem today is not the minimum wage," said John O. Stevenson, an automobile dealer who sells Jeeps, Hyundais, Suzukis and a Mercedes or two a month, including Mr. Sewell's new convertible. "People who are willing to work will be paid more than the minimum wage."
Pausing, he adds, "But those statistics about Jacksonville's low income," he said. "I'd like to see my area prosper and do well. I realize I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth."
Jacksonville also shows how, as in much of the nation, a decline in manufacturing employment depresses wages in general as the low-wage side of the service economy tends to become the standard-setter. Nationally, manufacturing jobs pay an average of $12 an hour, while jobs in retailing pay $7.60 an hour.
Jacksonville and the rest of Onslow County have lost four or five factories since the start of the 1990's that employed more than 800 workers. Those that remain employ just 6 percent of the work force, compared with 21 percent nationally. As Jacksonville loses factories, it loses a lever that props wages up, so all wages drift toward the restaurants' floor.
At the Jasper Textiles plant here, 140 women sew Outer Banks men's casual shirts. The starting wage is $6 an hour, raised from $5.50 at the start of the year, and the average is $7.
This is no stereotypical garment industry sweatshop. Inside, the plant is as bright as a beach, and management has switched most of its repetitive-motion assembly lines to five-worker cells where each woman can make an entire shirt and the team sets its starting and break times.
That's one way to shave labor costs. The 16 cells of 80 women have only one supervisor. On the assembly line, there's one supervisor for 40 women. At their current level, says the president, Gene Raplye, the wages are low enough for him to absorb an increase provoked by a higher Federal minimum. "I have no problem with the minimum wage," he said.
But the exodus of other manufacturers and the scarcity of new high-wage businesses seem to drag all wages down. Walter Timm, executive vice president of Coastal Carolina Community College, the one place in town where people can go for training in higher-paid skills, reports that graduates are beginning work for an average of $8.20 an hour, 5 percent less than five years ago.
At the extremes, electronic engineering technicians start at $13.33 an hour, 33 percent more than in 1990, and computer programmers start at $5.77, or 72 percent less. "Here you have 10 applicants for three high-wage jobs," said John Nardo, head of the college's placement service. In Raleigh, he said, "you'll have 20 applicants for 30 of those jobs."
SOME people here, those with only themselves to support and indifferent to the ornaments of the middle-class, say they can actually manage on a full-time, minimum wage job that works out to only $737 a month or $8,840 a year. "Easy," said Ronald Salsman, 40, a divorced, childless construction laborer whose jobs pay between the minimum wage and $5.50.
"You learn to manage your money," Mr. Salsman explained. "Get a trailer, $150, $190 a month. Don't go out to eat. Don't use credit cards." He pays bills with 59-cent money orders. His last car broke down and a friend drives him to work, but he is saving for another. "Me being mechanically inclined," he said, "I can buy a car for $300, $400 and fix it up."
No one here calculates the numbers of workers like Mr. Salsman who are wholly or largely dependent on $4.25 or for that matter the numbers who earn the wage. Nationwide, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 2.5 million were paid the minimum wage in 1993, the most recent year for which figures are available. When workers who make even less are included, 4.2 million people, or 6.6 percent of all those paid hourly wages, earned the minimum wage or less. Of those low-wage workers, nearly 40 percent -- 1.6 million -- were employed in restaurants.
Jacksonville is the big city in Onslow County, where 13 percent of the work force of 32,000 is employed in restaurants, more than double the national average of 6 percent. All but the most experienced start at $4.25, or at $2.13, the Federal minimum for people who collect tips. Many other workers here, in shops, gasoline stations, delivery services and motels, also start at the minimum.
In Jacksonville, such low wages foster not only Mr. Salsman's thrift but also a new, enterprising class of hustlers who build modest, $15,000-to- $20,000-a-year living-wage lives out of minimum-wage jobs. Commission workers in stores and tipped workers in restaurants, most in their 20's and 30's, these people puncture the stereotype of minimum-wage workers who are teen-agers for whom McDonald's is a source of pocket change and work-ethic grooming.
CHERYL WILSON, 27, waits on tables at Golden Corral. It's the ideal job, she says. "When I need time off they give it to me. They work with me so I can be a mother." Divorced, mother of a daughter who is 9, she receives $150 a month in child support and, thanks to tips, earns $50 each of the four days, for a total of 26 hours, that she works each week.
Ms. Wilson's tips have begun to lift her above the Jacksonville economy's floor. Soon, she said, she will buy a new $20,000 mobile home, replacing a used one she bought for $2,500. She will have to borrow to pay for it, but shuns all other debt. Her car is a 1984 Buick that she bought three years ago for $1,800 in cash.
The most resourceful workers do even better. With little demand here for skills that pay high wages, those who want to stay in town fashion jobs waiting on tables into something akin to a profession. They start young, at McDonald's, Burger King and Dunkin' Donuts, then move up the ladder to employers who prize experience, like Golden Corral and Applebee's. They bound from one to another, always in search of fatter tips and optimum hours.
Herbert Jackson Mitchell 3d, who is 28, dropped out of college after a year, when his father died. Assertive and affable, he leapfrogged the stop at McDonald's for a waiter's job at Applebee's here. He then moved on, to Ragazzi's, to a Mexican restaurant that closed, to a Shoney's, to Golden Corral, and back to Applebee's.
ON military paydays, the 1st and 15th of the month, Mr. Mitchell said he makes at least $100 in tips, and $65 to $70 most other days. That, with his $2.13 an hour, lets him pay his half of the $500 a month rent on the three-bedroom house he shares with his mother, a factory worker. He also pays $45 a month for cable TV, $20 for water and $50 on the loan he took to go to college. Once, Applebee's put Mr. Mitchell into its management training program, and he dropped out. He said he had to work twice his usual 30 to 32 hours a week. It was stressful, and the salary, which he forgets, came to less than he earned as a waiter. "Waiting table is my income, my job," he said. "Unless I decide to go back to school, this is my career."
Now Mr. Mitchell is moving on again. On Monday, Jan. 30, the Red Lobster chain stretched a giant red and white "Now Hiring" sign across the front of its new, 196-seat outlet on Western Boulevard that opens tomorrow. Word swept through Mr. Mitchell's network that at Red Lobster, waiters and waitresses would not have to share tips with hosts and bartenders, the rule at Applebee's. Eleven-hundred people applied through the week for 106 jobs, and Mr. Mitchell landed one.
For other people, however, those who learn skills that they expect to propel them into the middle class, Jacksonville delivers a colossal jolt. Mark and Tracy Pryor moved here two years ago from Newark.
Mr. Pryor, 31, has a two-year associates degree in business administration from Kean College in Union, N.J., and became an industrial mechanic earning $30,000 a year, or about $14 an hour. His wife, who is 26, has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Kean. She said she earned $22,000 as a teacher and counselor in an after-school program.
Three years ago they had a child, a daughter, and a year later, fearful for her safety in New Jersey's largest city, they moved to a $225-a-month trailer near Jacksonville, where Mr. Pryor had been a marine.
The Pryors promptly tumbled into the maw of the minimum wage economy. Mr. Pryor found a skilled job as a maintenance mechanic for a food company. "I started at $4.25," he said, "and I stayed a year and a half." He took a similar job at another food company that paid $8 and stayed six months, until Friday, Jan. 13, when he was laid off. He'll take anything now, he said. "I've got to feed 'em. I've been looking like a crazed animal. I can't find anything above the minimum wage."
Recently, Mrs. Pryor, who has been caring for their daughter, began looking for a counseling job. She has found nothing, at any wage. The rub, she suspects, is their education. Only 13 percent of Onslow County's population of 150,000 have two years of college or more.
She said, "Different places I've applied, they say I'm overqualified. They get leery. They think we're going to try to get their job." So, she said, she's going to strike her degree from her resume and stick it out here. What they lack in wages, they have in faith. "We've got a great deal of belief in Christ," Mr. Pryor said. "We're sitting where he wants us to sit."
Justine Talbot, by contrast, yearns to get out. Twenty-nine, with a son two and a half, she has left the marine she met here and married. For a year, she earned $160 a week as a member of a crew that cleaned rich people's beach houses on Emerald Isle. She doesn't have a car, and the company would pick her up and bring her home. "And I didn't have the money for halfway decent clothes," she said. "Cleaning houses, you don't have to look like a beauty queen."
Last fall Ms. Talbot enrolled at Coastal Carolina Community College to learn to be a medical office secretary, her tuition paid by Government grants. She lives on $50 in child support and about $350 a month in Food Stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children. "I'm very dependent on people," she said, "and I hate it. I hate it."
WAGES for medical secretaries in Jacksonville, when there's a job available, start at about $6.50 an hour -- not enough, Ms. Talbot thinks, to put her on her feet. So she has begun looking for work as a medical secretary outside the area, because starting wages can reach $11 an hour or more.
Restaurant and small-business lobbies in Washington insist that an increase in the minimum wage will play havoc with the economy -- as well as their own profits -- by driving up unemployment and prices. But it is hard to find anyone who believes that here.
In 1990 and 1991, Washington raised the minimum in two steps, by the same 90 cents that President Clinton proposes raising it again. From three months before each increase to three months afterward, the state Employment Security Commission's monthly reports for Onslow County show that unemployment declined, from 5 percent to 4.4 percent after the first increase and from 6.5 percent to 5 percent after the second.
Restaurant prices edged up a bit, people here recall, but not enough to pinch pockets. Employment in the county's restaurants grew, from 3,180 the year before the first increase to 3,778 the year after the second, and the number of restaurants grew, too, from 204, to 225.
Yet the wage increase did hit its intended target. Locally, restaurant workers' annual incomes climbed right in line with the 26-percent increase in the wage, from $6,149 to $7,420. Washington lobbyists warn that raises in these workers' wages stir increases far up the pay scale, but there was little of that. Over the four years, the average annual earnings of all Onslow County workers climbed by 10 percent -- not enough to keep pace with inflation.
"The minimum wage increase did very little that I could see," said Ralph E. Leeds, manager of the employment commission office here. "There may have been a decrease in hiring for a little while."
Mr. Leeds's office disburses unemployment benefit checks and is Onslow County's main employment agency. As of the start of this year, it was placing workers at an average wage of $5.75. Job openings tacked on bulletin boards there a few days ago ranged from $9 for an asbestos remover and $8 for a carpenter to a much larger number at $4.25.
"We also see a lot of employers advertising $4.25 and $4.50 and up, depending on experience," Mr. Leeds said. But he said job seekers with experience return from interviews with the employers and tell him that they are saying $4.25, and that's it.
With labor so cheap, Mr. Leeds says, the hazard facing this economy is underemployment, not unemployment. Spouses of Camp Lejeune marines, many with college degrees, stay home rather than go to work. Mr. Leeds says that even with their degrees, they would earn little more than they would have to pay for child care. People with more than 12 years of school whom the employment service has placed in recent months started at an average of $5.91 an hour. "Imagine the talent that's lost in this town," he said.
HIGHER wages would also help the Government squeeze its welfare bill without any of the changes Congress and the White House propose. William D. McDonnell, director of the Onslow County Department of Social Services, says 20 percent of the county's 2,350 families receiving A.F.D.C. have jobs, as do 32 percent of the 4,143 on food stamps.
A case worker, Beverly Black, takes the example of a new client, a single mother with two children whose rent is $200 a month and who works 20 hours a week for the minimum wage.
That still leaves her far below the poverty line of $12,320, or $1,267 a month. Under the formulas that determine her benefits, she would receive $466 a month in A.F.D.C. and food stamps. With her earnings of $340 from work, her monthly income would be $806.
Then, if her wage rose to $5, everyone would come out a little bit ahead. Her income would be $834 -- $400 from work and $434 in benefits, and the Government would spend $32 less.
At the 475-seat Golden Corral restaurant where Cheryl Wilson works, near Jacksonville's busiest intersection of Western Boulevard and the Marine Highway, lines of customers, 20 and 30 long, begin winding by the cash registers each evening at six to buy the $5.89 all-you-can-eat Golden Choice Buffet.
The chain was sown in the sandy soil of Eastern North Carolina. In 1972, Louis Sewell, was a junior high school principal here in Jacksonville. He said his roommate at Eastern Carolina State University, James Maynard, asked him for money.
"Maynard had an idea," Mr. Sewell said. "We would provide affordable dining -- fill a guy's stomach as well as his heart." Mr. Sewell, son of a bakery delivery man and a department store saleswoman, refinanced his house to raise $6,000. He was an officer of the company until 10 years ago when he left for other ventures. He owns six of the restaurants, including the one here, which he leases back to the company.
Curtis Cunningham, the general manager here, has an tiny, windowless office off the kitchen. He clicks through the numbers to show the impact of a 75-cent rise in the minimum wage. Because he doesn't have to pay the half of the 140-member staff that receives tips as much as others, he said he would have to pay an average of 50 cents more per worker.
Had the higher minimum been in effect during the first five weeks of this year, Mr. Cunningham said his total wage bill would have climbed by $6,947, to $74,870, and from 18 percent of total business costs to 20 percent. Looking at it another way, he said the workers' share of the average $6.10 meal bill would rise from $1.09, to $1.20.
Thus, a 17.6 percent increase in the minimum wage -- 75 cents -- would add 11 cents or just 1.8 percent to the customer's bill. Mr. Cunningham said he expects the company to pass any increase on.
But so small an increase could be tough. The Golden Corral faces new competition from Red Lobster. Despite a possible increase in the minimum wage, that chain has introduced a new menu with lower prices, not higher.

HEADLINE: In Canada, Doubts Fade Quickly About Trade Accord

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
WHILE the United States and Mexico are still recovering from battles fought during the first year of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada, which was dragged kicking and screaming into the arrangements, has emerged as the real winner.
Exports have brought much-needed job growth. Employment last year rose by 2 percent, or 431,000 jobs, all of them full time and in the private sector. Unemployment, at 9.7 percent, is near a four-year low. 
 And the trade statistics are striking. Over the first 11 months of 1994, exports to the United States and Mexico jumped 21.3 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively. Imports were up 19 percent from the United States and 21.7 percent from Mexico.
The export surge has made Canada -- a country of 28 million people that must export to survive -- the fastest growing of the seven leading industrial countries. Matthew W. Barrett, chief executive of the Bank of Montreal, noted last month that Canada was leading the Group of Seven in the relative value of exports to output. In the third quarter of 1994, exports reached 38.1 percent of gross domestic product, up from about 25 percent in the 1980's.
Until recently, Canada was split down the middle over free trade. The elections of 1988 were fought over a bilateral free trade pact with the United States. Tories, who supported free trade, barely won. John Turner, then the Liberal opposition leader, called the agreement "the Sale of Canada Act" and warned of a severe job loss. The elections of 1993, in which the broader North American agreement was on the table, were a more subdued replay.
To Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief executives of leading Canadian companies, "Nafta has accomplished exactly what it was supposed to -- it has spurred firms in all three countries to think increasingly in North American terms."
THE peso crisis in Mexico may have shrunk that currency's value by about one-third, but many Canadian traders are unfazed.
Late in December, when the currency turmoil was at its peak, BJB Polymer Systems Ltd. -- a small company in Brampton, Ontario, that makes moldings for the automotive and office furniture industries -- quietly increased the investment in the plant it owns just outside Mexico City by 25 percent, or $1 million.
"The business is absolutely phenomenal compared with anywhere in Canada," says Robert Gregory, the company's president.
Investors aren't the only ones singing the praises of the trade agreement. Canadian Government officials are even talking about greatly expanding the pact.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a member of the party that opposed free trade a few years back, has proposed that the three countries in the North American accord negotiate a free-trade deal with the European Union. In a little-noticed speech in Paris in December, he suggested that this liberalization would "re-energize our economic relationship." And if the other North American partners balk at a European deal, there is nothing to stop Canada from going it alone.
In a warm endorsement of the Chretien proposal, The Globe and Mail in Toronto said in an editorial: "A free-trade agreement with Europe would not only rebalance at least in some degree our overwhelming dependence on trade with the United States. It would be an assertion of our independence."
The Government also wants to expand the North American pact to the south, to include nations like Chile, one of the fastest-growing countries in the world. Otherwise, Canada fears that South American countries may make bilateral arrangements with the United States, excluding Canada and making Washington the hub. Canadians see increased membership as a way to achieve what Roy MacLaren, the Trade Minister, has called "a more balanced negotiating framework."
CANADA and the United States have the largest two-way trade in the world, approaching $300 billion in 1994, or 20 percent more than the business the United States does with Japan, the second-largest American trading partner. But because the Canadian economy is only one-tenth the size of the American economy and is heavily dependent on exports to the United States, Canadians are far more sensitive than Americans to the bilateral relationship. According to the most recent figures, 84 percent of Canada's exports are sold to the United States.
Against the huge volume of exchanges across the 49th parallel, there have been points of friction, generally brought on by American accusations of unfair Canadian trading practices involving products like steel, lumber, sugar and beer.
Canada had hoped that North American market integration would reduce United States complaints. Indeed, dispute settlement procedures have been strengthened and many disputes resolved by panels of trade experts from both countries. But every time an issue is resolved, another seems to take its place.
For instance, a truce has been reached in a fight that goes back at least a decade over American industry complaints that Canadians unfairly subsidize lumber exports. The two Governments have new procedures to insure that Canadian exports do not attract American penalties.
Yet new quarrels have started in the last two months over Canadian cultural protectionism -- an issue deliberately left out of the North American agreement -- and the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, has opened formal investigations that could lead to retaliation. These tiffs probably will loom large when President Clinton visits Ottawa at the end of this month.
In one case, Canadians are threatening Sports Illustrated Canada with stiff duties to try to end a practice in which American magazines solicit advertising in Canada but run little Canadian content. In another, Canadian regulators have pulled the Country Music Television channel of Nashville from Canadian cable networks, replacing it with a Canadian network in what the Americans are calling an act of expropriation.
Although they are little noticed in the United States, the trade skirmishes have high political visibility in Canada. For this reason, Canadians are particularly anxious to diversify trade, which further explains why international free trade is now in such vogue here. For it is only through what Mr. MacLaren calls "the messy, haphazard scramble toward a system of global free trade" that many Canadians believe they can achieve that diversification -- and greater economic independence.

COMPANIES
 
You Can't Go Home Again If You Stay in California
To Morrison Knudsen's directors, William Agee must have seemed a natural. He'd done great things as the boy wonder of Bendix, and if he'd made messy headlines for promoting Mary Cunningham a bit too rapidly, well, that was yesterday's news. She was Mary Agee now. And Mr. Agee would surely put his heart into running Morrison, based as it is in his hometown, Boise, Idaho. Maybe the board was so proud to have landed Mr. Agee in 1988 that it didn't notice the warning signs. What signs? Well, there was the company jet; the Agees used it so much the I.R.S. tried to get them to report it as taxable income. And Mr. Agee took telecommuting to unimagined heights, ending up running things from California, mainly by fax and phone. But losses and a plunging stock price could not be ignored; last week, under mounting pressure, Mr. Agee resigned. 

I.B.M., Hold the Starch
This is getting serious. It was one thing for companies to "restructure," "downsize," get "lean and mean" -- all that heavy stuff. But edgy traditionalists knew some things would be inviolate -- like I.B.M.'s dress code, a dark-suited, wing-tipped bulwark against onrushing chaos. Well, did you hear that crash last week? The mighty tradition fell, as Louis Gerstner, the ultimate out-with-the-old chairman, decreed that casual dress was just fine. Yes, many workers stuck with prim and proper -- that's probably all that's in their closets -- but there were a lot of sweaters and jeans. And, no, capitalism didn't crumble.
 
Hitting the Big Time in Cable
Time Warner set out to become a force in the cable industry, and last week it took a big step toward its goal, agreeing to buy Cablevision in a deal valued at $2.7 billion. That came just two weeks after it bought Houston Industries' cable properties. These will give Time Warner 11.5 million subscribers in 33 population "clusters" -- it wanted this concentration so it could offer phone service, too. So, depending on who's counting, it's now either No. 1 or No. 2 in the nation. Tele-Communications claims slightly more subscribers. No matter: these are the big guns now.
 
Four-Wheel-Drive Mania
As cars get better -- more efficient, smoother, sleeker -- Americans are doing the only logical thing: buying clunky gas guzzlers. And paying luxury-car prices for the privilege. It's almost to the point that if you don't drive a "sport utility vehicle" (how quaint the word "car" now seems) you risk having your loyalty investigated by Congress. The latest entry: Chevrolet's Tahoe. The four-door starts at $29,195. Ouch. Last winter put many people over the edge, of course, but the fad was already roaring ahead. But, uh, do people use four-wheel drive, the toy that helps drive gas mileage down? Don't ask.
 
Too Tempting at AT&T
It has to be hard knowing that a company's about to be acquired, and that big money could be made buying its stock, and not cashing in. Too hard, apparently, for many people lately. For the latest year, the S.E.C. filed a record number of insider trading cases. Last week saw perhaps the biggest ever -- not in dollars but in the number of people involved. The Government charged 17 people with using secret data about AT&T's acquisition plans. Officials said two AT&T employees tried to keep their noses clean by never buying stock themselves, instead giving tips to friends and relatives. The take: $2.6 million.
 
'Congratulations! . . .' Click
Telemarketing. The very word can send normally civilized people into a babbling rage. Just as you step out of the shower or sit down to dinner, the phone rings and someone tries to sell you something, get you to invest in something or, worst of all, give you something. Do the callers understand "No, thank you"? Of course not. They refuse to let go. Most people cannot be sweet-talked into, say, sending in a $1,500 "donation" to get a "prize." But the ranks of the gullible are huge, enabling telemarketers to defraud Americans out of perhaps $100 billion a year. Last week, though, the Government proposed a crackdown on this fraud, to include bans, for instance, on offering prizes, pretending to represent the Social Security office, or failing to disclose an investment's risk. Better yet: how about a national ad campaign on this theme: "Just hang up"?
 
THE ECONOMY
 
The Monster That Won't Die
There was no ambiguity: "Star Wars," like Franco and the 5-cent cup of coffee, was dead. The cold war's end dealt the final blow to that extravagant, visionary antimissile shield so dear to Ronald Reagan's heart, and in 1993 Defense Secretary Les Aspin administered last rites. But clearly anything's possible now that Washington's been turned upside down, and sure enough, the Republicans now want to revive the program. Never mind that $36 billion has already been poured in, with nothing to show for it. (That money couldn't have contributed to the deficit, by any chance?) And never mind that many experts think it's a sinkhole -- and will never really work anyway. Newt Gingrich says it's "doable."
 
The Budget: Don't Ask, Don't Tell
It's the Senate's turn on the balanced-budget amendment, and last week Democrats offered a proposal that said, in effect, Fine, but you've got to tell us exactly how you're going to do it. The Republicans swatted that one away, because of course that's the glory of the amendment -- you can come out grandly for motherhood, apple pie and a balanced checkbook, with nary a number in sight. In defense of vagueness, the Republicans offered this analogy: In 1941 there was no blueprint for defeating Hitler. At last report, though, the national debt has not set out to murder millions of people and conquer the world.
 
Tough Love, Tough Logic
A key part of the welfare solution proposed by House Republicans last week -- a plan that included a broad shift of responsibility to the states -- was to bar the payment of Federal tax dollars to unwed mothers under 18. The theory: treat the poor with "tough love" to steer them away, early on, from a life of dependence. Yes, that cycle of dependence must be broken. But ignoring for a moment the predictable liberal outcry against such a move, does Republican logic even hold here? Certainly, few unwed teen-agers want to get pregnant. But when they do, such a restriction would surely pressure more of them to get abortions. That hardly fits in with standard Republican philosophy.
 
Hitting a Nerve, Italian-Style
To Americans, it was one more variation on an old theme. Another food was added to the enemies list, and the health-conscious were again asked to cut their diets to fit this year's fashions. Diet experts had been on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate kick, but last week they had second thoughts, so pasta's the latest culprit. Well, Italians didn't take this at all lightly. A leading dietitian called it "ridiculous" on television; a nationwide daily trumpeted, "America, You Don't Understand Pasta," on its front page, and a nutritionist lit into the "mountains of hot dogs" Americans consume. Salad anyone?
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
This Time, China Blinked
Trade disputes often come down to who blinks first. Take China and the United States: think of all the "Made in China" labels and our dependence is clear. And China, striving for the economic big time, clearly needs us. After Washington slapped 100 percent tariffs on more than $1 billion worth of Chinese goods last week, China blinked quickly, asking American negotiators to come back this week to grapple anew with the core of the dispute -- piracy of American-made music, movies and software. So will the dispute be resolved by Feb. 26, when the tariffs are set to kick in? Not necessarily, said Mickey Kantor, our man in trade. After all, China has 29 plants turning out CD's.
 
Mexico on the Mend? Yes, But
Rays of light may be appearing in Mexico -- but don't count on it. Here's one positive note: last week the Mexican Government managed to sell some Treasury bonds -- the first since that $50 billion rescue package was announced. And the interest it had to pay came down to an almost reasonable 15.4 percent, a sign of healthy demand. But more troubling is the condition of Mexico's banks. They've already got a lot of bad loans on their books, and a battered peso will make it harder for companies to make loan payments, which will just make this worse. Not to mention that about $8 billion in C.D.'s are coming due soon -- redeemable in suddenly costly dollars. That will hurt.

Socializing Risk to Foster Free Markets

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
INVESTORS in emerging markets should offer up a nightly prayer for the success of Michel Camdessus's latest endeavor.
Mr. Camdessus, a former governor of the French central bank, heads the International Monetary Fund, which seeks to impose financial discipline on the world. But the I.M.F. has found increasingly that countries can evade its strictures by borrowing from private markets instead. 
 The Clinton Administration's mammoth rescue package of more than $50 billion for Mexico, which finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly endorsed in Toronto last weekend, gives Mr. Camdessus a chance to reclaim a more central position for the fund in the international financial arena.
He wants, in effect, to institutionalize the Mexican bailout by creating a new I.M.F. loan window to be called the short-term facility, in which emerging market countries experiencing a crippling capital outflow can raise a quick loan in return for taking steps to restore foreign confidence.
In Paris last week, Mr. Camdessus even said he has a secret list of 10 potential Mexicos that seems likely to include Hungary, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, all of which, like Mexico, have big current account deficits as well as large foreign debts.
It is easy to be cynical about a mechanism that would effectively provide insurance for investors in emerging markets by preventing a sudden failure of confidence in the country from undermining the value of stocks and bonds.
At Toronto, Hans Tietmeyer, the German central bank's conservative president, warned that more Mexican-style bailouts would only encourage developing countries to follow unwise policies and investors to take unwarranted risks.
Some other analysts expressed similar thoughts. John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said last week, "The creation of a massive short-term financing facility creates obvious moral hazards."
And Neil A. Soss of the New York investment firm of Soss & Cotton, said, "It's ironic that to encourage capitalism in emerging economies you must socialize the risk for U.S. investors."
But the Clinton Administration and the monetary fund, which bent its own rules to lend Mexico up to $17.5 billion -- over six times the normal limit, felt a Mexican default on its foreign debt would have been, in Mr. Camdessus's words, "a true world catastrophe."
"This was not a country crisis, this was a systemic crisis," insisted a senior I.M.F. official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named. He argued that a collapse of confidence in Mexico threatened a withdrawal of foreign funds from emerging economies worldwide and a flight of capital from overly indebted industrial countries like Sweden, Italy and Canada.
Had Mexico defaulted on its foreign debt, the official said, the resulting crisis might have undermined the free-market-based development model that has become this decade's economic signature tune.
As C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, told Congress this month, a failure to rescue Mexico risked "a retrogression in economic reforms associated with the Mexican model, back towards greater state intervention, closed markets and populist budgetary excesses."
A new loan window to preserve investor confidence in emerging economies may also be justified by the size and nature of the modern capital flows on which these countries now rely, but which were unforeseen when the International Monetary Fund was created at the Bretton Woods conference held at the end of World War II.
Between 1989 and 1994, official aid to developing countries rose from $42.6 billion, to $54.5 billion, according to the World Bank. But total private capital flows jumped from $41.9 billion, to $172 billion. And the most volatile portion, portfolio and equity investment, climbed from $3.5 billion, to $46.9 billion in 1993, before settling at $39.5 billion at the end of 1994. Moreover, much of this money comes not from Wall Street "fat cats" but from the savings that ordinary citizens invest in global mutual funds.
"There is a case for a new facility given the enormous unforeseen increase in capital flows and that the victims of a Mexican-style crisis are mainly retail investors and the country itself, which loses development," Robert Solomon, a former chief international economist at the Federal Reserve who is now with the Brookings Institute in Washington, argued last week.
Mr. Solomon pointed out that when the great British economist, John Maynard Keynes, was defending the Bretton Woods system he had helped design, he promised it would keep interest rates low by allowing countries to insulate themselves against "the ebb and flow of international capital movements and flights of hot money."
"That shows the Bretton Woods founding fathers lived in a different world from us," Mr. Solomon said. "We should adapt the I.M.F. to ours."

Seaport's Blemish: Old, Not Quaint

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Guests of the Best Western Seaport Inn pay up to $205 a night for a room. But when they look out their windows, they see debris-strewn lots and abandoned buildings.
"One guest even sent me a Polaroid of the view," said David Werber, co-owner of the 65-room hotel. He and owners of several stores and restaurants in and around the 13 buildings, which honeycomb Front Street and Peck Slip, contend that the derelict properties have hurt their business. All but two are vacant. Those house, temporarily, two wholesalers and an ice company from the Fulton Fish Market. 
 Last month, Community Board 1 formed a task force whose goal is to salvage the buildings, which date to the 1800's and are owned by the city. The Seaport Task Force would like the city to sell the buildings to small property owners, said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Board 1. Mr. Werber said he might be interested "if the terms were right."
Though not architecturally significant, the 13 buildings are in the South Street Seaport historic district. Just south are the Seaport Museum, J. Crew and restaurants selling $25 lobsters. To the north are Mr. Werber's hotel, restaurants and bars.
"A lot of business people on the north are frustrated," said Christopher White, chairman of the task force. "They feel these buildings cut them off from the development on the south side because no one wants to walk down this street."
But a vice president of the South Street Seaport Corporation, John Pollack, said he was not sure the sites could be developed given the area's well-publicized economic troubles. And there is a question of who is responsible for the buildings.
The city owns the property, but the nonprofit Seaport Corporation holds the lease. In the late 80's, it subleased it to Metropolis Group, which has defaulted on its development agreement. Only the city's Economic Development Corporation can void the Metropolis agreement and free the site.
"Obviously it appears that Metropolis has not lived up to their obligations and we will soon -- within a few months -- be taking appropriate action," said Ellen Weiman, a Development Corporation spokeswoman, adding that the agency intends "to address what is obviously the buildings' dilapidated status and lack of development."

HEADLINE: After Fabulousness, An Age of Intimacy

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
THERE are those who believe that the only thing more splintered and tribalistic than nighttime New York in the 1990's is the former Soviet Union. A crawl through the city on a Friday may prove them right.
 At the Cub Room in SoHo, administrative assistants in khakis and pearls order Rolling Rocks and exchange office war stories. Not far away, at the Crowbar in the East Village, shirtless young gay men sweat to Gloria Gaynor in a tiny, steamy space. A slightly older crowd of men, some of them in wild wigs, dance across town at Don Hills. The Palladium is jammed with black and Hispanic youths who move to a raucous hip-hop beat, and at the Limelight, a crowd that is mostly white college students in cropped sweaters from Urban Outfitters sways barely discernibly. 
 It was not so long ago that the fabulous people were as one.
 The downtown celebrity scene once defined New York night life: Wall Street lawyers were happy to share a table with transvestites, who in turn rubbed shoulders on the dance floor with East Village artists, teen-agers from Queens, waiters in false eyelashes, celebrities and a professional tennis player or two.
 Together, they tossed back beers at bars where live snakes squirmed under the glass beneath their elbows. They would pile into the back of a rented meat truck illuminated with a single disco ball and shuttle from Greenwich Village to the the Tunnel nightclub on 12th Avenue, or to the Williamsburg Bridge, where they would stop traffic with their partying until the police carted them away.
 Decked in feathers, fibers, silk, lame and occasionally plastic, they left their apartments long after the sun had set and danced wildly, sniffed drugs and pontificated. They dressed up like King Neptune. They juggled in the nude.
 Those days are gone.
 "The reasons I wanted to live in New York have ceased to exist," said Rudolph, who goes without a last name but who was behind numerous night spots in New York during the 80's. He left for Los Angeles in 1991. "That cutting edge of insanity and creativity has just lost its steam."
 In the mid-1980's, a new hot club would open or reinvent itself every six months and was packed every night. Of the 70 or so spots that have opened since the early 80's, 45 have closed. In the last five years, only about five new nightclubs have opened.
The excitement, the misadventures and the social pluralism that characterized the old night life have all given way to a new, splintered, quieter reality, results of AIDS, economic woes and a changing cityscape that brought families to club territory and made community boards less willing to tolerate the fun. Meanwhile, many club crawlers have felt the need to sit back, quiet down and settle into affordable dinners.
 "I really find that night life is dead and boring now," said Stephen Saban, a contributing editor at Details magazine who has chronicled the night since the 70's. "Now, all of the excitement is kind of forced."
 The impact of AIDS cannot be overstated. The disease killed many of the outrageous spirits and trampled others. Gay men are now gathering in the more remote caverns where the weekly "parties" are smaller, the bodies fully dressed and the drugs replaced by plates of greasy onion rings.
 "AIDS was the ghost that passed through New York night life," Rudolph said. "The moment the plague was out, the straight crowd was scared of the gay types. Also, it took away 25,000 very fun and creative people who were out there agitating."
 Many also say that new gay clubs and parties have cropped up largely because the trend among gay people has been to turn inward and look for comfort together. "For me it is too painful to be in a place where I used to perform where people who were there aren't here anymore," said Karen Finley, the performance artist.
 Clearly, the economy has helped poop the party. The 1987 Wall Street crash signaled the beginning of the end for big clubs. Money for huge corporate parties, which kept a club flush enough to turn away people at the door on other nights while cheerfully losing money, dried up.
 As clubs began to feel the sting, they started offering discount passes, and door fees slid from $20 to $10. Special nights were started, to attract certain crowds, at rock bottom prices. The fragmentation began. And people began expecting more for their money. "Before, you could just throw a big ball in the air and paint the club black and people would come," said Peter Gatien, who owns most of the last remaining discos. "Now they want more. Before, everyone danced to the same music. Now, they expect several dance floors, better dejays and better sound systems."
 Suddenly, clubs that were used to snubbing one another's clienteles began competing for them, and the obsession over having hip people in the club was replaced with the need to make ends meet.
 "There was a free-wheeling creative scene before," said Chip Duckett, who has planned and promoted parties for a decade. "Now, it is just big business. There is no exclusivity anymore."
 Most clubs now can open their doors only a few nights each week, and they can no longer afford to keep out those who sport the wrong shoes. Gossip columns are now filled with yarns about Bruce Willis or Christy Turlington instead of tales of performance artists eating live animals on stage.
 While many of the impresarios who designed, ran and and performed in the night clubs have left disillusioned for the shores of Los Angeles or Miami, many more, like John Sex and Steve Rubell, are dead.
 Try as he may, Mr. Gatien, the disco owner (his name rhymes with "Haitian"), cannot convince the beautiful and the outrageous people who illuminate New York after dark that his gigantic rooms at the Tunnel, the Limelight and the Palladium are worth venturing into these days.
 "Those spaces themselves now seem cursed," said Cathay Che, a queen of the night and the membership director of a gay-rights group. "They have all this dead space. I want to be in a place that stimulates me intellectually."
 Many of those who go out now save their display behavior for restaurants or the gym. When they dance, it must be in a place where another room full of old couches is not far away, so they can sit down and talk about Proust should the mood strike them.
 Chitchat has almost taken precedence over dancing. "In 1986, fabulousness was peaking," said Dianne Brill, a nightclub denizen, who has hit every club in Manhattan during the last decade of going out several nights a week. "The 80's scene gave people confidence, but the intimacy wasn't there. Now, people are looking to know what you feel, what you're about."
 While less than a decade ago people watched synchronized swimmers and ice skaters in the middle of a club like Visage, the night is now danced away in bars that seem by contrast scarcely bigger than an average New York apartment bathroom.
 Gone are the cavernous Danceteria, Area, World, and other megaclubs where people from every corner of the city mixed. Now, the little bars cater to specific groups, Euro or Latin, young or old, straight or gay, hopelessly hip or fans of pop music -- and the weekly parties are small, intimate, with very specific dress codes and sounds.
 The parties have themes. The Cooler, an underground space in the meat-packing district, offers multimedia nights of rock, film and readings. Nearby, at 432 West 14th Street, Tuesdays are Jackie 60 nights, combining poetry readings and music. At Don Hills, on Greenwich Street, there is Squeezebox on Fridays, with rock-and-roll.
 There are nomadic parties for people who only like to wear sneakers and dance, and a bar called Babyland in the East Village where patrons sip their drinks from baby bottles while sitting in old cribs.
 "My party is the antithesis of fabulous," said Mr. Duckett, who runs the 1984 party at the Crowbar. "It costs $2 to get in, I have almost no door policy, and drinks are $1.50. That is what the 90's are about."
 The large venues were also victims of gentrification, specifically, the gentrification of Chelsea. When people began to live in that former warehouse district in the late 80's, the discos were no longer welcome as neighbors. Community boards began to complain bitterly about noise and crime from club patrons, particularly around rowdy places like the Red Zone and Tracks -- both now closed -- where shootings, stabbings and muggings happened regularly.
 Under 1990 zoning regulations, new nightclubs were generally restricted. In 1992, Mark Green, then Consumer Affairs Commissioner, proposed a law to ban discos from operating within 200 feet of residential buildings. The bill has languished in the City Council, but the boards have tried their best to make things hard for club owners.
 Where clubs have left off, restaurants -- and even gyms -- have stepped in. Ms. Brill now spends her nights with the rest of the self-referential crowd at the Bowery Bar, munching appetizers and scanning the room for adoration. "I remember William Burroughs's birthday party at the Limelight," said Alan Rish, who has promoted parties since 1984. "I can't imagine that anyone would have their birthday party in a club now. They'd have it at Match or Bowery Bar or, better yet, they'd just stay home."
 Perhaps a focus on health is a natural outgrowth of an age of sickness. "All the people you used to see in clubs you now see in gyms," Mr. Rish said.
 Even Phoebe Legere, the performance artist, who made her name in the clubs, says she is quite content to spend her leisure hours working her abdominal muscles. "I love the gym," she said. "It is the Spartan development of mind and body." (As for disseminating her art thoughts to the masses -- no problem. She is now on line.)
 Old-timers on the club scene lament the departure of Rudolph, whose night spots in the 80's including Danceteria and Mars.
 "Rudolph appreciated night life in every permutation of its form," said Mr. Duckett, the party promoter. "He went to every conceivable night club, from Greek hetero discos in Astoria to topless bars in New Jersey." This love for night life manifested itself in hundreds of oddball parties.
 Mr. Gatien admits he does not much care for dancing or partying ("I maintain a very low profile," he says) and has often said that the most important part of running his businesses goes on during the day. But he has managed to keep his clubs running, with the exception of Club USA, which closed.
 When he speaks, though, it is difficult to see what exactly excites him. He is sketchy on the names of hot musicians, almost grim faced as he speaks about his clubs.
 "Peter Gatien is a very successful, money-making, entertainment-providing businessman," Ms. Brill said. "But he isn't 'fabulous.' His clubs are all someone else's ideas."
 Even though big may be banished, there is still a future for night life, somewhere out there. "Changes occurred because New Yorkers wanted them," Mr. Duckett said. "The fabulous world is dead and buried, but none of us wants to be stuck in the 80's. The only thing worse than death is being stagnant. Who can stand that?"

Look Who Wants U.S. As a Leader

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
WHEN the 1990's began, intellectuals in New Delhi, which thought of itself as the capital of nonalignment, were deep in gloom, fearing that now everybody would have to take orders from an unfettered Uncle Sam.
 Half a decade later, it is all but impossible to find a hegemonistic bone in any body in Washington -- Republican or Democrat -- and a new batch of critics from the developing nations is complaining that the United States isn't interfering enough. 
 It isn't that theoreticians of third world politics have suddenly embraced the idea that the United States should tell them what to do. Rather, it is that with only one truly global bankroll, diplomatic corps and military left, it is American money they want (to help them develop), American pressure (to help control unruly neighbors) and American military force (to give weight to peacekeeping operations).
 But while these nations may complain about a lack of leadership, they have increasing difficulty speaking with one voice on just how the United States should lead.
 "This is not an easy question to answer any more," said John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, an independent research and policy organization in Washington. Although there are still faint echoes of the old us-them view of the world -- that the rich countries are pitted against the poor ones -- the developing world has fractured and now has many different agendas.
 "If you look at Latin America and Southeast Asia, what they want is more trade liberalization and market access," Mr. Sewell said. "Africans feel very strongly that they need their debt situation dealt with in a much more forthcoming way."
 "India needs new forms of development cooperation," Mr. Sewell said, noting that it has a newly established open-market policy but still must cope with a huge poor population. "China is different, though not dissimilar, with its fast-growing private sector in a large pool of poverty." Everywhere, he added, there is both a yearning for investment and a fear of the volatility of foreign money. In the wake of Mexico's crisis, countries half a world away saw funds evaporate. Nations that are opening their economies to foreign capital want assurances of prosperity that are probably impossible to provide.
 On the other hand, reassurances on some moral issues are not impossible, and here too the leaders of vulnerable countries are asking for leadership.
 Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister, was in Washington and New York City last week seeking public expressions of solidarity from the Administration and Congress for his Government's risky new peace overtures to the Tamil Tigers, a ruthless guerrilla army that spread havoc for nearly two decades.
 "I did not come with a begging bowl," he told an audience at the Asia Society in New York City. "I am not asking for money. I don't want weapons." He said that even a Congressional resolution taking note of peace negotiations would help.
 Such a request might fall oddly on American ears, but Sumit Ganguly, an Indian-born political scientist at Hunter College, says Americans do not understand the power their voices can sometimes have.
 "He's absolutely right." Professor Ganguly said. "A statement by an obscure aide somewhere in Washington can set off a reaction all over South Asia. "We in America see ourselves as a helpless giant, and we are not."

 
 
A Need for Consistency
 But there is a problem with even that form of engagement with the countries of the third world, and Mr. Ganguly recognizes it: The power to lecture or cajole other countries on moral issues cannot be used inconsistently or half-heartedly, or it will evaporate. In particular, the Administration has been widely criticized for failing to express its human rights concerns in India, Indonesia and China, for the sake of pursuing business interests instead. "We cannot engage in moral grandstanding, then run the other way when the crunch comes," Mr. Ganguly said.
 Mr. Sewell said that one thing the United States could do to reassure the developing world is to provide a strong voice and vision within international organizations. "What the developing world would like to see most from the United States, and is not getting, is global leadership," he said. "The United States has long been the historical leader of the multilateral system, and we are running the risk of losing that role." The problem, he said, is not only in a Congress hostile to the United Nations, but in a White House and State Department whose top officials are often at best lukewarm.
 Take this complaint, for example: An international conference, planned by the United Nations, about poverty and social dislocations that spill across borders in the developing world is to take place in Copenhagen in early March. Leaders of more than 100 nations, including France, Germany and Japan, have signed on. President Clinton has not, and the Administration has not decided whom to send.
 "This Social Summit may well die from political indifference," said Mahbub ul Haq of the United Nations Development Program. "This summit without Clinton will be like staging 'Hamlet' without the Prince of Denmark."
 "The fear in developing countries used to be about American political and economic hegemony," said Mr. Haq. "But people have begun to realize that the real threat comes from lack of leadership on these issues."
 He paints a grim picture of the future if that attitude continues. "More than 90 percent of the new population is now in the developing world," he said. "Last year 95 percent of babies were born there. Can the five percent in the industrial world prosper without the 95 percent?"

In China, Art of the Raw Deal

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
FOR 16 months, Jimmy Peng Jiandong has been held in a jail in Shenzhen, just across the border from this British colony. He was imprisoned after being kidnapped by the Chinese police from the Portuguese colony of Macao. He has never been convicted -- indeed, the judge at his trial last November told prosecutors they had not proved that Mr. Peng was corrupt. But he wasn't released. Chinese officials seem determined to prove him guilty of something.
 Mr. Peng, a 36-year-old Australian citizen, is one of a growing number of foreign citizens of Chinese ancestry whose business dealings and commercial disputes inside China have resulted in extortion, house arrest, even jailing and trials. Lawyers, human rights advocates and business people themselves are citing a surge in detentions, extortion demands and fabricated criminal charges against foreign business people by local police and judicial authorities, who are wielding their power on behalf of local business interests -- power often exercised free of control from Beijing. 
 "What you've got is the breakdown of the rule of law in localities," said Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights/Asia, a group based in Washington. "This is very relevant for the business community. They may not care about the rights of dissidents, but they shouldn't be under the illusion that human rights and business are unconnected issues. Can you have a proper business climate without the rule of law? I don't think so."
 Foreign companies, particularly large American companies, have vociferously denounced linking human rights issues with trade, insisting that continued and substantial foreign investment inevitably will lead to an improvement in China's human rights record. But after a decade of sustained foreign investment, the State Department this month pointedly described a worsening in China's human rights situation. For foreign businesses, the increasing criminalization of commercial disputes by localities and the victimization of ethnic Chinese business people illustrate that human rights issues are not always confined to democracy advocates and independent labor leaders.
 No one knows precisely how many foreign business people have been harassed or detained in China, but reports of new incidents continue to surface. Last week, the Australian consul general in Guangzhou disclosed that two more Australians of Chinese descent have been detained in commercial disputes; one of them has been held without charges for 18 months.
 "We don't have any accurate numbers," said John Kamm, a businessman and human rights advocate here who travels regularly to China. "It's an endemic problem. It's a systemic problem. And even if it's not you, a foreigner, it could be one of your Chinese employees."
 Ethnic Chinese make up by far the greatest percentage of foreign business people working in China. While Hong Kong, Taiwanese and Singaporean companies, run predominantly by ethnic Chinese, make up the largest portion of foreign investment in China, many Western companies routinely hire ethnic Chinese to oversee their operations in China.
 Having such representatives offers obvious advantages to companies doing business in China, but an important drawback is that Chinese foreigners face the tendency of Chinese officials and institutions, particularly at the local level, to assume that Chinese facial features somehow make one "really" Chinese, and hence not a foreigner at all.

 
 
Innocence Abroad
 American citizens have not been immune. A year and a half ago, police officials in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, dragged Philip Hui-ho Cheng out of his hotel room, confiscated his passport and threw him into jail. Mr. Cheng, a naturalized American from Hong Kong, was released after 72 hours, but he was then placed under house arrest in the city and told that he was under investigation for economic crimes related to his small bicycle- and motorcycle-helmet factory in Zhuhai, just across the border from Macao.
 "I don't know how it became a criminal issue," said Mr. Cheng. "I kept asking why this happened. Nobody can tell me."
 As Mr. Cheng tells it, his local Chinese partner abrogated a joint venture contract with Mr. Cheng and collaborated with the Changsha police to hold him until Mr. Cheng repaid him for his half investment. As it turned out, Mr. Cheng fought the issue successfully in the local courts and after seven months was allowed to leave. Unintimidated, he returned to his factory.
 American officials have declined to comment on the case. "My feeling is that the American Embassy doesn't want to be involved too much," Mr. Cheng said in a telephone conversation from Zhuhai. "Nobody from the embassy ever showed up. Nobody ever came. They don't want to be involved in an economic dispute, or business disputes."

 
 
Damning Documents
 For Taiwanese, the situation is often worse. Chiu Chen, a Taiwanese lawyer who advises investors about business on the mainland, said Taiwanese are often arrested or have money extorted from them when commercial disputes arise. She said Taiwanese in China have no legal or diplomatic protection there because the Government regards them as Chinese just as it regards Taiwan as Chinese territory.
 China regularly insists that its legal system is fair, but recent internal documents acknowledge that in many localities kidnapping, hostage-taking and illegal detentions of business people occur regularly. Among these documents, obtained by Human Rights Watch, is a series in which the Public Security Bureau, the Supreme Court and the Supreme People's Procurate -- the principal judicial and law enforcement bodies in China -- order local authorities to halt the abuses.
 Mr. Peng's case is among the most egregious, say human rights advocates. Mr. Peng ran a company in Hong Kong listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Among his many ventures was a successful company in Shenzhen engaged in a range of activities, including textiles and property development. In 1991 he decided to take it public on the new Shenzhen stock exchange.
 That was when his problems began, said Lina Shen Peng, Mr. Peng's wife. The Shenzhen authorities tried to pressure him to reduce his control of the company, which he exercised through his Hong Kong holding company. To fend them off, he hired Ding Peng, a relative of China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. But rather than help Mr. Peng, Ms. Ding transferred the disputed shares of his company to one of her own companies in Hong Kong. Mr. Peng sued to recover the shares and won, but Shenzhen refused to enforce the court order.
 Then 16 months ago, while he was in Macao on business, Mr. Peng was forced into China and arrested. The Macao police said Mr. Peng voluntarily agreed to enter China. But in a letter he was able to smuggle to his wife, Mr. Peng said that he was physically handed over to the Chinese. Last November, Shenzhen's prosecutors tried Mr. Peng on charges of embezzling $1.4 million, but they failed to convince the judge, who has now allowed prosecutors to try again.
 Australia's Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, appealed for Mr. Peng's release to the Chinese Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, to no avail. Mr. Kamm said the local powers in Shenzhen are "a law unto themselves."
 "My husband said to me he was innocent, and I know he is right," said Mrs. Peng. "My husband told me to believe in justice and the truth will come out one day."

HEADLINE: The World: Martial Arts;
This Is a Trade War! Get Your Popgun!

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS trade wars go, the one that started between the United States and China last week in Washington -- and that may well end in truce or treaty later this month in Beijing -- is a classic of the art form.
 Both sides claim their national sovereignty and economic livelihoods are at stake, so they threaten each other with billions in sanctions and counter-sanctions. Both grab big headlines from Silicon Valley to Shanghai. And both quietly abide by the Geneva Convention of Economic Conflict: Never aim for the vital organs. 
 The battle between China and the United States these days is ostensibly over the protection of copyrights and patents, bringing an end to the rampant copying of Whitney Houston CD's, Microsoft software, Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Gillette razor blades. But it is really a fight about which country is more important to the other. That is a particularly difficult question for Washington in an era of post-cold war economic competition, in which yesterday's counterweight to the Soviets is today's software pirate and tomorrow's Great Emerging Market. The result is a dizzying set of signals from both sides: Don't mess with me, I don't need you, my current-account balance can't live without you.

 
 
Stop It. Pretty Please?
 In the past week alone, all of those messages have raced across the Pacific at a furious pace. The initial sanctions announced by the United States looked tough at first blush, but they excluded American sanctions on electronic components, toys and other items American industry and retailers cannot live without. The Chinese excluded airplanes, which accounted for roughly $2 billion of America's exports to China last year. This may be trade war, but there is no sense dampening profits at the giant McDonnell Douglas aircraft factory in Shanghai, where China is learning the magic of how to build airframes.
 And while China may need access to the American market today far more than American firms need to be in China, no one doubts that the equation will change dramatically in a decade or so. Like Mexico (at least the Mexico of two months ago), China is the key to President Clinton's strategy of creating millions of American jobs by exporting like mad to the world's fastest-growing corners.
 That may explain why, over seven days, Washington threatened to cripple Chinese exports unless it cleaned up its act, then sold China a million tons of wheat at below-market prices and prepared Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and two dozen business executives for a trip this month to ask if the Chinese might be interested in buying $8 billion in power-generating equipment.
 And by the way, Ms. O'Leary's well-balanced brief reads, would it be too much trouble if we asked you to stop selling missile parts to Iran and Pakistan?
 "This is the proof that the days of gunboat diplomacy are over, when every American act in a developing country is aimed at one interest," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. "When it comes to the big emerging markets, we find ourselves balancing a whole series of interests at once -- human rights, intellectual property, trade, security interests. And it's not just China. The same is true in India, Brazil, Argentina."
 The Chinese have learned the game of interdependence fast, using American business interests to pull the right levers -- as they did last year, when President Clinton backed down and agreed to abandon his policy of linking China's human rights record to the annual renewal of its most-favored-nation trade status.
 But in this case, the United States stands a good chance of getting, at least on paper, most of what it is asking for, including the right to export music and movies to the Chinese market. Business is on Mr. Clinton's side this time. And there is a hidden card: China desperately wants entree to the new World Trade Organization, though it is balking at the free trade rules. Without resolving the current dispute, Chinese leaders know they have no chance at admission.
 Over the long term, however, America's clout in such arguments seems bound to wane as the United States becomes a relatively smaller part of the world economy. And so far the effort to get other countries to join in enforcing the rules -- an economic NATO -- has been undermined by the fact that all of America's allies are also its economic competitors. And they are happy to let Washington play bad cop.
 Consider the compact disc dispute. Sure, Kenny G is hot in China, but so are the mournful love songs of Japanese enka singers. But the Administration knew better than to ask Japan, or even Taiwan, to join in its demand that China close the pirates' lairs or face trade sanctions. Japan and others are happy to watch superpowers play off against each other. If Chinese-American relations drop into the deep freeze, the Japanese can fill the trade void. If America prevails, it will open the market not only for itself, but everyone else.
 "This is our fate as the world's largest power," Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said in his office the other day. "We have to blaze the way, and others take a free ride."
 The fundamental problem is that there is no assurance that any agreement will work. William P. Alford, a Harvard law professor who recently wrote a book on Chinese views of intellectual property -- "To Steal a Book is an Elegant Offense" (Stanford University Press, 1995) -- notes that the United States, Europe and Japan once did negotiate an agreement to protect copyrights and trademarks -- in 1904, after the Boxer Rebellion.
 "It took about a year for the Chinese to figure out that the best way to proceed was to give the Americans whatever they wanted and tell them to go away," he said. "They did not have the institutions to enforce intellectual property rights at the time, or broad understanding in the country that this is a kind of right to be respected. And even now, there is no broad understanding."
 Nor is there any political will to solve the problem. Under pressure from Mr. Kantor, China two years ago enacted all the laws it needs to crack down on the illegal copying of products. "On the books, it looks great," Mr. Kantor said. "But no one is enforcing the rules." Going to court in China is nearly hopeless. And even if you did, no judge is about to shut the biggest factory in town, especially if it is owned, as many are, by the military, the local government, or close relatives of provincial and national leaders.
 Professor Alford argues that rather than apply pressure and thereby prompt a few ritual raids on prominent factories, the Clinton Administration should encourage changing the system to create respect for law and legal institutions. Otherwise, he argues, the effort is doomed. The Chinese authorities may be able to "crack down on a few dissidents," he argues, "but there are a lot more pirates than there are dissidents."
 Such a strategy, though, points up the dilemma confronting America's increasingly commercial foreign policy: Bringing about change no longer means policing what nations do at their borders -- where they are pointing or selling their missiles -- but rather meddling deeply in the inner workings of another country's economy, its power structure and its laws.
 That is the strategy the United States has pursued with Japan. It has been slogging, politically unrewarding work, and results for American companies are, at best, a mixed bag. And that was working with one of America's closest allies, a country that proudly places itself among the leading industrialized nations and whose defense rests on the presence of 45,000 American troops. Imagine how much fun it will be negotiating over market access rules with a Communist nation in the midst of a leadership crisis, a series of increasingly independent economic fiefs, and an army quite able to fend for itself.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Detours on the Road To Legal Precedents

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's the wrong time
And the wrong place.
Though your case is charming,
It's the wrong case.
 
COLE PORTER may not have put it quite that way, but the Supremes -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, et al. -- may soon be singing that tune.
 While the Supreme Court's current term will undoubtedly produce several important decisions, the docket is notable for some cases that probably will not live up to expectations. Once apparent candidates for major rulings, these cases now appear more likely to produce only narrow decisions -- if the Court manages to decide them at all. 
 In arguments before the Court during the past few weeks, it was clear that several of the highest-profile cases of the term, on subjects including affirmative action, school desegregation and the constitutional right to travel, have serious procedural flaws or factual problems that make them poor vehicles for resolving the profound issues the Court presumably had in mind when it agreed to decide them.
 The path from potential landmark to veritable footnote is a painful one for a Court that guards its power of review so jealously. The Court agrees to decide fewer than 100 cases of the 7,000 or so that reach it every year, and each of the chosen cases has a job to do: resolve a long-simmering conflict in the lower courts, for example, or make sense of contradictory lines of Supreme Court precedent.
 "The British empire may have been created in a fit of absent-mindedness; the agenda of the U.S. Supreme Court is not," H. W. Perry Jr., a political science professor at the University of Texas, wrote in a highly regarded 1991 book, "Deciding to Decide: Agenda Setting in the United States Supreme Court" (Harvard University Press).
 What a Supreme Court case is not supposed to do is require the Justices to guess at a lower court's meaning, untangle a messy factual quarrel or resolve an issue that has been overtaken by events. That is beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, which are limited by Article III of the Constitution to deciding "cases" and "controversies," meaning live disputes.
 Nor is a case supposed to waste the Justices' time by presenting such a narrow or idiosyncratic slice of a problem that a decision would be little more than "a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only," a famous image from a 1944 dissent by Justice Owen J. Roberts.
 Yet the Court seems to have bought itself just such problems when it ignored warning signs and accepted the three hot-button cases that were argued last month amid signs of frustration and second-guessing from the Justices.
 One case, Missouri v. Jenkins, is an appeal by the state of Missouri of the lower courts' refusal to relieve it of continuing financial responsibility for an elaborate court-ordered desegregation plan for the Kansas City schools.
 The provocative question in the state's petition for review was whether success in desegregation is to be measured by black students' success in meeting national norms on standardized tests; the state argued that such a standard holds the schools responsible for society's ills and goes beyond the bounds of the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantee.
 Yet it was never clear from the lower court opinions, appended to the state's petition, that any judge had actually established such a requirement. At the argument, Missouri shifted to a broader attack on the broad desegregation remedy itself, which inconveniently for the state, the Supreme Court had refused to review six years ago.
 The result was confusion: the Court spent a considerable part of the hour-long argument trying unsuccessfully to pin down exactly what was at stake in the case. "Please tell us as simply as you can precisely what you're asking us to do," an exasperated Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose vote may be the most critical to the outcome, said at one point to John R. Munich, the Missouri assistant attorney general.
 The second case, Adarand Constructors v. Pena, is a white contractor's challenge to a Federal Government affirmative action program for small and "disadvantaged" businesses. Theoretically, this is the conservative majority's long-awaited opportunity to rein in affirmative action at the Federal level as it did at the state and local level in a 1989 decision, City of Richmond v. Croson.
 But the program at issue is so unusual -- black-owned companies do not necessarily qualify for the benefit, while some white-owned companies theoretically may -- and the white plaintiff's legal standing to have brought the case in the first place is sufficiently in doubt that the big issue may be beyond the Court's reach. "We may have a case here in which we can't decide an issue we thought we were going to decide," Justice Antonin Scalia said in frustration.

 
 
Opportunity Knocking
 While the Court will almost certainly decide something in these cases, it is likely to dismiss a third outright. This case, Anderson v. Green, is an appeal by the state of California with important implications for the constitutional right to travel. Invoking that right, a Federal appeals court blocked California from putting into effect a welfare "experiment" under which newcomers would be limited, for one year, to the (presumably lower) welfare benefits they would have received in their home state.
 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, among others, probably saw this case as a chance to limit or overturn precedents he has never accepted that applied the right to travel to welfare and other benefits. But even if California wins its Supreme Court appeal, it will not be able to put its program into effect because of an administrative barrier erected by a Federal court ruling last July in a related California case. The Justices were advised of that problem before they accepted the case on Oct. 7.
Since Justices do not announce their reasons for accepting -- or for turning down -- cases, there is no way of knowing why they overlooked signs that it should have passed these cases by. It may not be a coincidence that all were granted at the very beginning of the term, when with the help of brand new law clerks, the Justices are faced with sorting through nearly 2,000 new cases that have piled up over the summer.
 Or something other than inadvertence may be at work. Because each case apparently offered the opportunity to overturn major liberal precedents, the conservative Justices who have been looking for such an opportunity may have seized them believing the problems could be overcome -- as, indeed, they may yet be -- or, if not, that nothing would be lost in the attempt. The Court's rules provide that four Justices, a minority, can accept a case for decision.
 Ultimately, no matter how eager their appetites, the Justices must make do with the cases that come along. They cannot roam the countryside, constructing a docket from scratch. They must rely for their raw material on the problems people bring to their doorstep, in however flawed a package. That may be the lesson here: the Court's activist desires are entangled in its passive roots.

A Natural-Gas Man Has a Certain Something

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
IN the energy world, the geeks are pushing out the sheiks. OPEC ministers, old-line oil executives and Texas wildcatters are no match for the balding economists, scientists and engineeers, dripping with graduate degrees, who run the natural gas companies.
 While Saudi Arabia wallows in debt, companies nobody has ever heard of are building multibillion-dollar pipelines across mountain ranges, deserts and seas, and multibillion-dollar liquefaction plants to ship gas where even the pipelines can't go. 
 As a result, owlish executives like Kenneth L. Lay, (Ph.D., economics), the chairman of Enron, are global diplomats. Pipelines across the Andes are tying together Latin American countries that had been chilly neighbors. Japan is balancing its exports to Southeast Asia with imports of liquefied natural gas. By next summer, a pipeline under the Straits of Gibraltar will feed Spain and Portugal natural gas from Algeria by way of Morocco.
 And where are many Middle Eastern nations turning for help in developing and marketing their own natural gas? To Israel. Jordan and Egypt have agreed to build natural-gas pipelines to Israel, and Qatar is trying to negotiate a shipping deal.
 As Amos Ron, director general of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, put it in an interview, "Such projects like natural gas pipelines are important stakes for the tent of peace, to hold it on the ground."
 Dr. Lay's ambition is to match the global scope of the corporate oil titans, perhaps casting himself as the next Rockefeller. "Our vision is to provide the same kind of technical, marketing and financial skills to the natural gas business worldwide that the oil majors provided in the early part of this century," he said above the static from his jet's telephone.
 For the natural gas geeks, the competition has a long head start.
 Oil can be sent anywhere on anything. Natural gas fields must be tied to urban markets by costly pipelines and processing plants. Shipping natural gas requires liquefaction in plants as expensive as emirate palaces, although costs are falling.
 Back in the 1970's, the United States lumped oil and natural gas together as petroleum products that electric utilities should shun. Having discovered since then that major natural gas producers like Kansas and Oklahoma don't even belong to OPEC, policy makers changed their minds. Natural gas, which burns far more cleanly than coal or oil, has become the Clinton Administration's favorite fuel.
 Deregulation at home and improved techniques for finding and transporting natural gas globally have lowered prices. Whoever stuck much of the crude under a collection of religious zealots, medieval-style monarchs and petulant warlords, wisely spread natural gas more evenly around the world. And in 1993, the United States for the first time produced more natural gas, in dollar value, than oil.
 Surging international demand for electricity, especially in developing nations, has prompted companies like Enron to create their own markets by building gas-fired power plants. Israel plans to generate half its electricity from natural gas in a decade, up from nothing now.
 But natural gas still lacks popular appeal. The geeks may have billions of dollars and much of the world's energy supply at their disposal, but they are not as flashy as the wildcatters or as easy to vilify as Arab despots. Hollywood gave us James Dean as Jett Rink in the film "Giant," but Johnny Depp will never play Ken Lay. For the natural gas companies, it seems that the only bursts of publicity come when the pipelines burst, as in Edison, N.J., last year.
 Natural-gas company bosses love to chat about complex engineering and byzantine finance. Michael E. J. Phelps, chief executive of Westcoast Energy, says his wife never forgave his decision to quit criminal law for the natural gas business. "I used to come home and talk about murder, rape, robbery and sodomy," he told his colleagues at a Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference last week. "But demand commodity toll design doesn't make for the same dinner table conversation."
 Besides which, natural gas smells funny. (Not our fault, say the natural gas guys. The scent is added for safety).
 What to do? Learn how the computer nerds recast themselves as business geniuses able to put their products on every desktop and kitchen table. Maybe sign them up as partners. "In the future," says Oliver G. Richard 3d, chief executive of New Jersey Natural Gas's parent company, "you will probably find someone from Bill Gates's group at Microsoft trying to sell you natural gas in your home."

HEADLINE: Leonard Silk Dies at 76; Times Columnist Helped the Public to Understand Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Leonard S. Silk, a columnist and editorial writer for The New York Times and for Business Week, who set a standard for a generation of journalists as a pioneer in making complex economic issues understandable to general readers, died Friday night at his home in Montclair, N.J. He was 76.
The cause of death was liver cancer, members of his family said. The disease struck last summer, two years after Mr. Silk wrote his last Economic Scene column for The Times. 
 But he was too deeply engaged in his work to really retire. He continued to write, to lecture and to travel. And even in his final weeks, he managed to work for a while most mornings on a book -- his 15th -- about the future of capitalism.
Mr. Silk was a rarity in journalism: a reporter with a Ph.D. in economics, who taught the subject at a college level and worked in government before becoming a full-time journalist. He started at Business Week in 1954 and moved to The Times in 1970. Departing from the dense coverage of markets and statistics that characterized economic reporting in the 1950's, he found ways to describe, in simple prose, the economic forces shaping his readers' lives.
"He was one of the earliest properly trained scholars who decided to devote himself to the problems of journalism and public writing about economics," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science. "And he had a gift for making the intricacies of economics understandable."
Mr. Silk did it at times with vivid touches. In a 1955 essay on forecasting, for example -- an essay illustrated with Charles Addams cartoons -- he explained not only the role of economic forecasting and its shortcomings, but how readers could use a forecaster's tools and equations.
Such clear reporting of complex issues is more common now than it was then. In pioneering the new style, Mr. Silk said his models were the science writers of the day, particularly William L. Laurence of The Times, who were making nuclear physics familiar to Americans.
"I did not want to write down to people," Mr. Silk said in a recent interview. "I wanted to make economics accessible, just as science writers were making science accessible. I thought any idea could be plainly stated."
His role in American journalism went beyond plain writing. For most of the 1970's, Mr. Silk wrote most of The Times's editorials on economics. He had been hired in 1970 by John B. Oakes, then the editor of the editorial page, to provide expertise in economics, and Mr. Silk and Mr. Oakes determined what The Times would say on most economic issues.
After Mr. Oakes stepped down in 1976, Mr. Silk also left the editorial board, to become a full-time columnist. For most of the next 16 years, his column appeared twice weekly in the business pages under the Economic Scene rubric.
His editorials, in The Times in the 1970's and in Business Week in the 1960's, reflected Mr. Silk's view that his expertise in economics should be used, as a journalist, to interpret what he saw in the real world, without being doctrinaire.
Thus, Mr. Silk favored President John F. Kennedy's proposal to cut taxes to stimulate a flagging economy in the early 1960's. But later, with the economy booming again, he urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse the cut and raise taxes, a step Johnson delayed taking. Without a tax increase, Mr. Silk's editorials argued, there would not be enough revenue to pay for Mr. Johnson's Great Society programs and the Vietnam War. The budget deficit would shoot up, he wrote, and so would inflation. They did.
During the Administration of Richard M. Nixon, editorials in The Times by Mr. Silk endorsed the President's watershed decision, in August 1971, to impose price and wage controls to restrain inflation, and to suspend the dollar's convertibility into gold, which had the effect of devaluing the currency to stimulate the economy.
"We have varying degrees of enthusiasm about the specific approaches Mr. Nixon plans to employ, but we applaud the scope and daring of his effort to get the economy off and running," Mr. Silk wrote at the time.
After an initial honeymoon, the Nixon measures failed to achieve their goals, and Mr. Silk later altered his view. "In retrospect, I saw the merit of the criticism that was leveled at Nixon, but you don't have that hindsight in the moment of action, when you have to write," Mr. Silk said in the recent interview.
As a columnist, Mr. Silk preferred to make his points through analysis and reporting, rather than outright advocacy. "I felt it should be an analytical column, but the logic should be so persuasive that you convince the reader this is the way to go," he said.
In airline deregulation, for example, his initial columns sent readers away with the conclusion that deregulation was a good idea. But as time passed and the Carter Administration pressed successfully to implement the idea, Mr. Silk grew doubtful. He conveyed all of this to his readers.
The Depression drew Mr. Silk into economics, while he was an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin in the 1930's. For a generation of economists who emerged from that era, economics seemed to offer solutions to hardship and devastating unemployment.
Mr. Silk first heard the name of John Maynard Keynes at Wisconsin, and like many of his classmates he was taken by the Keynesian thesis that a stimulus from deficit spending by the government could revive the economy. Keynesian economics suddenly meshed with political action, becoming a powerful force that endured into the 1970's.
Mr. Silk eventually shed his enthusiasm for Keynesian theory. He refused to lock himself into any set of theories or beliefs that became, as Mr. Silk put it, "more real than reality itself." What survived instead from those heady Wisconsin days was a view that government must step in from time to time to supplement or regulate free markets. Capitalism, he reasoned, needed to be saved at times from its worst tendencies. The goal of this process -- of economics itself -- should be to improve people's lives, he thought, by combining theory with human concerns.
These remained Mr. Silk's guiding principles, and he restated them in his farewell column on May 29, 1992. "I see economics as a branch of philosophy -- moral philosophy as it was called in the days of Adam Smith," Mr. Silk wrote. "Its mission was and still is to improve the lot of humanity, especially for the poor."
Leonard Solomon Silk was born on May 15, 1918, in Philadelphia. His father, Harry, was a department store manager, a calling that took the family to New York, then to St. Louis, and finally, when Mr. Silk was 7, to Atlantic City. There, the journalist in him first surfaced. As punishment for misbehavior, his mother sent him into a large, well-lighted closet, where he was allowed to bring books and writing material. Soon he was composing stories about boys going to the West.
Mr. Silk entered Dickinson College in Pennsylvania in 1936 and the following year transferred to Wisconsin on a scholarship.
There he edited Octopus, a humor magazine, and came under the influence of an economics department that was moving away from abstract theory, particularly the classical view that the economy would automatically right itself and restore a more prosperous equilibrium. Professors like Selig Perlman, a labor expert, argued that economists must also study specific situations, particularly the concerns of American workers.
From Wisconsin, Mr. Silk went to Duke University in 1940 for graduate study. America entered World War II and he enlisted in the Army Air Forces, which sent him to Alaska as a Morse code operator. But he soon got back into journalism, writing for Yank and other Army publications. In 1945, he covered the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco.
Back at Duke in 1946, Mr. Silk's mentor, the international economist Calvin Bryce Hoover, encouraged his student's interest in going abroad. Mr. Silk wanted to study Swedish housing, which had benefited from Keynesian-style government spending even before Keynes elaborated his theories.
Mr. Silk's research soon appeared as an article in Fortune magazine. A longer version became his Ph.D. thesis and then his first book, "Sweden Plans for Better Housing." That would be the pattern throughout Mr. Silk's career, with his journalism expanded into books -- three of the best known being "Economics in Plain English," "Economics in the Real World" and "The American Establishment," the last one written with a son, Mark, who is now a writer for The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
In the postwar years Mr. Silk tried other careers. He taught at the University of Maine and at Simmons College in Boston. He married Bernice Scher, a concert pianist. He went to Norway on a Fulbright fellowship to teach at the University of Oslo. Mr. Silk also worked for the Federal Government, first as a housing expert in Washington and later in posts overseas, the last one as an economist for the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
And then, while on home leave, he sought out Elliott Bell, the new editor in chief at Business Week, who hired him to be the mainstay of a new economics department.
A few years later, with the election of President Kennedy, the Keynesian era hit a high point. The late Walter Heller, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, convinced Mr. Kennedy to push for an $11 billion tax cut, the largest in American history. The goal was to put more zing in the economy even though the tax cut would initially increase the deficit. Mr. Silk had become acquainted with Mr. Heller while the economist was a professor at the University of Minnesota, and Mr. Silk found himself traveling to Washington to cover the story. Congress finally passed the tax cut in 1964, after Mr. Kennedy was assassinated.
Mr. Silk left Business Week in 1969, soon after Mr. Bell's departure. He spent a year as a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and then joined The Times. There, he wrote not only editorials and columns, but also frequently, in later years, major news stories on economics.
Besides his wife and son Mark, Mr. Silk is survived by another son, Dr. Adam Silk, a psychiatrist in Boston; two sisters, and five grandchildren. A third son, Andrew, also a writer, died of cancer in 1981.
 Services will be at 10:30 Monday morning at the Jewish Memorial Chapel, 64-70 Howe Avenue, in Passaic, N.J.

HEADLINE: Washington Buckling Under Home Rule

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Two decades after winning its long-sought quest for home rule, the city's government is a shambles, its cash is expected to run out sometime this spring, and its autonomy is threatened by its old ruler and nemesis, Congress, now led by conservative Republicans.
Mayor Marion Barry, the dominant power for 12 of those years, back in office from a jail cell, is proclaiming the limited home rule a failure. Throwing the city on the mercy of Congress, he declares the nation's capital cannot survive "half slave and half free." 
 A bloated, sometimes surly and indolent bureaucracy, packed onto the payroll by Mr. Barry in flusher times, is draining the treasury while providing perhaps the worst municipal service in the country. Like a panhandler scraping together change for another drink, the city is trying to make ends meet by stiffing its creditors and sending the police to give out tickets to cars waiting to be parked at expensive restaurants.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has just opened an investigation into whether city officials bamboozled Wall Street investors to borrow $250 million last December.
The flamboyant Mr. Barry, brought down by his craving for women and cocaine, is seen by some as the very personification of the problem. But if his return to power is shocking to outsiders, it reflects the city's stark racial divisions.
Mr. Barry's predecessor, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, entered office waving a shovel as a symbol of her determination to clean things up and left without carrying a single precinct in the Democratic primary.
Congress was so happy to see Mr. Barry gone that it welcomed Mayor Kelly by voting an extra hundred million dollars to clean up the deficit left by Mr. Barry and a loan of $330 million as a buffer for the future. But Representative Julian C. Dixon, a California Democrat sympathetic to the city who is regarded as an expert on its finances, said the Kelly administration overspent -- "they spent the whole $330 million" -- and used accounting ploys to make the budget appear balanced.
The possibilities likely to be debated on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks include returning some of the more expensive functions to the Federal Government, putting the government in receivership and even exempting residents from Federal income and other taxes by making the District a Commonwealth territory. Whatever the short-term fixes, those involved in the city's problems say they stem from a number of factors, including these:
*The city's racial division.
*The conditions set by Congress in granting home rule that limit the city's ability to raise money.
*Two unpredictable and unrelated phenomena at the end of the 1980's that drastically changed the city -- the end of the building boom and the epidemic of crack cocaine.
*The rapidly accelerating flight of the black middle class largely because of failing city schools and services, and violent crime that is mostly drug-related.
Washington is two cities. One is Federal, overwhelmingly white and affluent. The other is local, overwhelmingly black and increasingly poor.
The city has three divisions:
"West of the Park," the area beyond Rock Creek Park in the Northwest, includes Ward 3, the whitest and wealthiest, neighborhoods of prim row houses and landscaped mansions, where the residents buy virtual independence from the city's faltering services, with private schools, security guards and garbage collectors.
"East of the River," the Southeastern section beyond the polluted Anacostia River, includes Ward 8, the blackest and poorest, a swath of bombed-out and boarded-up buildings, crumbling public housing projects, liquor stores and check-cashing places, the city's dumping ground.
The rest is in between -- official Washington, the tourist monuments, the business district of lawyers and lobbyists and, stretching north, a few mixed enclaves, like Capitol Hill and Adams-Morgan, and largely hard-working, home-owning black areas spotted now with "For Sale" signs.
Numbers tell some of the story. Some 60 percent of the salaries paid inside the District go home to suburban Virginia and Maryland, protected by law against city taxes. The city is two-thirds black, with a third of the population on some form of public assistance. The number of people receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the primary form of welfare, increased by 20 percent, to 74,544 women and children in the past three years. In the last eight years, the number of city residents with jobs -- and paying city income tax -- dropped to 250,000 from 320,000.
A study in 1992 found that on any given day 42 percent of black men ages 18 to 35 in the city were either in jail, on probation or parole, awaiting trial, or being sought on arrest warrants. In an age of home-computer modems and faxes, the number of households here without telephones rose to 27,000 in 1992 from 14,000 in 1988, or about 12 percent of the city.
The city had been a kind of stepchild of Congress until 1974, when home rule finally came, but with conditions that would prove crippling.
Most important was a flat ban on any commuter tax, rendering 60 percent of the salaries earned here untouchable. In addition, the city assumed a set of costly responsibilities normally taken care of by a state, including prisons, welfare and Medicaid, functions that Mr. Barry would now like to unload.
The city's tax base is weakened because vast amounts of land belong to the Federal Government and because the city is filled with large numbers of institutions like the National Geographic Society and the Federal National Mortgage Association -- Fannie Mae -- that are tax-exempt. If Fannie Mae alone paid taxes, it is estimated, it would bring in some $300 million.
"We were so anxious to show we could take care of ourselves, so thirsty for freedom," that the city accepted the limits, Mr. Barry explains in what has now become his standard speech, mopping the sweat off his face as he tells angry city workers they will have to take pay cuts or layoffs.
Larry Herman, a Peat Marwick consultant who recently completed a critical study of city government, said: "The problem is not Marion Barry. He didn't make it. The problems go back to home rule. The Feds gave them a lousy deal. And, as best as I can tell, Mrs. Kelly chose not to take quick action. There were studies up to here telling Mayor Kelly this is a big-time problem."
"They built a government they couldn't afford, bigger than their revenues," Mr. Herman said. "There's 50,000 employees, more or less, for a population of 500,000. It's one of the higher per capita ratios in the world -- even Moscow -- more government workers supported by fewer taxpayers."
Mr. Barry first swept into office in 1978 with white support, in large part because he was seen as a street organizer who could keep restless young blacks from burning down the city, mainly by giving them jobs. An electoral map of the last race is a demographic chart of the city, with Mr. Barry losing only the white Wards 2 and 3, and a few scattered other precincts where whites live, and running strongly in the black middle-class Wards 4 and 5. He claimed redemption, striking a chord with black churchgoers, who spoke, too, of something called "The Plan" by whites to strike down black leaders.
Early on, Mr. Barry called himself "a situationist," saying, "I do what's necessary for the situation." His elegant clothes mirror the situation: he campaigned draped in kente cloth and African hats; now he is back to double-breasted suits.
How the promise of Mr. Barry's first years, surrounded by enthusiastic comrades from civil rights days with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, dissolved in a haze of women, brandy, corruption and cocaine is detailed in the book "Dream City" by Harry S. Jaffe and Tom Sherwood (Simon & Schuster, 1994).
"The dog is running," his security men would shout into their radios as he swept into the night through topless bars and jazz spots and finally into Room 727 of the Vista Hotel, where police and the F.B.I. were poised to videotape him smoking crack with a faded model named Rasheeda Moore.
"His first term, I thought he was good -- a lot of people thought he was a good mayor between '78 and '82," said Roger Wilkins, a writer and professor at George Mason University, in a widely shared assessment. "But by the middle of the second term, he began to fall apart. He personally began to fall apart, and he was loading the city payroll shamelessly. Marion was foolish and weak and it all went wrong with him at the end, the drugs, the women, the parties."
As the Mayor was crashing, so was the city around him. The building boom of the 80's that transformed the once-dowdy downtown -- and provided the money that kept the city government afloat -- suddenly went bust. At the same time, crack cocaine was taking over the streets in black neighborhoods, particularly in the southeast, with rival gangs shooting it out for turf.
Mayor Kelly's term was less melodramatic, marked mainly by her construction of a palatial set of offices with $140,000 worth of oak and cherry cabinetry, a $50,000 polished granite fireplace and bullet-proof windows, even though it was on the 11th floor, vulnerable only to helicopters.
But now Mr. Barry and his people say they are finding bills and vouchers stuffed in ledgers that have sent estimates of the deficit spiraling upward by hundreds of millions over the past few weeks.
The city's longtime Chief Financial Officer Robert Pohlman, who served under Mayor Kelly as well, testified before the City Council that a variety of accounting tricks, including loading 15 months of revenue into a single fiscal year and writing off $85 million to keep the General Hospital running as a "loan" even though it would be repaid, were used to balance the books. Some, however, suspect that Mr. Barry is creating a "worst case" scenario so he will look better if the crisis is scaled back.
City services were terrible under both mayors. City housing projects fell apart and repairs were late and rare. Even though there were tens of thousands of vacant apartments, people waited six months or more to get in. Ambulance drivers couldn't find the injured.
The police-recruit classes of 1990 and 1991 were hired without background checks, resulting in officers so dirty that the F.B.I. formed a special unit to chase them, and 35 officers were indicted on charges including murder, theft, sodomy and armed kidnapping. Things are even worse now, with the city laying off hospital workers, closing neighborhood clinics and delaying paying its bills so long that a Maryland repair garage refused to return the fire truck responsible for the White House until the city paid its old tab.
Washington, the blues great Leadbelly sang, was a "bourgeois town," a judgment confirmed by the sociologist E. Franklin Frazier, a singular urban culture of a solid black middle class, many employed by the Federal government, with an aristocracy centering around Howard University. But now, says George Grier, a demographer with the Greater Washington Research Center, "the black middle class is fleeing in droves." Most go just over the border, into Prince Georges County, Md., changing it to a well-to-do black suburb.
"We've lost over 15,000 residents," said Kevin P. Chavous, a City Councilman from the southeastern Ward 7, which was hit particularly hard.
"Obviously the crime is a factor, the schools. It's such a dramatic thing. Most of the people moved less than 2 miles, literally just over the border."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Moves Health Debate To Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The painful, complicated struggle over health care is beginning anew on Capitol Hill. This time, it is Republicans, not Democrats, who are leading the charge. And this time, it is the huge Medicare program for the elderly that is the target, not the private health-care system.
But the Clinton Health Care Battle of 1993-94 and the developing Republican sequel are alike in at least one respect: they were and are fueled by the rising costs of health care. 
 Despite a general moderating trend in recent months, Medicare spending is still projected by the Administration to grow at an average rate of 9.1 percent a year over the next five years.
Republicans feel those pressures all the more acutely, because of the web of promises that they have made, to balance the budget in seven years while passing nearly $400 billion in tax cuts to families and businesses.
Republicans have been looking at options large and small intended to control the growth of Medicare spending, like creating a Medicheck voucher that would allow the elderly to buy private benefits, raising Medicare premiums for upper-income recipients and encouraging the use of health maintenance organizations. The Republicans say they are in the exploratory phase.
When asked how much they wanted to save, Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said, "As much as possible without any diminution in the quality of care for seniors."
Critics in the Democratic Party and among advocacy groups for the elderly say they are skeptical and wary.
Republicans bristle at comparisons between their plans and the Clinton Administration's ill-fated efforts. Mr. Clinton was trying to extend the heavy hand of Government to business, the Republicans say, and they maintain they are trying to turn a 30-year-old program into something more flexible, less bureaucratic and much more cost efficient.
"We have a Government-run fee-for-service system that's running at twice the rate of medical inflation, and we need to transform it," John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said in an interview this week.
The Health Subcommittee held hearings all week on Medicare, capped by a session on Friday that focused on encouraging the elderly to join H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care. Such networks, which seek to control and coordinate care by using selected lists of doctors and hospitals, can achieve significant savings, experts say.
But Medicare continues to be a last bastion of fee-for-service medicine, under which doctors have an incentive to perform more, not fewer services, experts add. Just 9 percent of Medicare recipients are in managed-care plans, according to the Government.
Bruce C. Vladeck, head of the Health Care Finance Administration, which runs Medicare, came under considerable fire from Republicans for not opening up the system more to managed care and other new ideas. "I'm just concerned about the timidity, about the failure of you folks to be anywhere near as bold as you were in the last Congress," Mr. Thomas said at the hearing on Friday.
Mr. Vladeck replied, "The place where one should be most risk-averse is the one segment of the population that has universal health care and is quite satisfied with it."
Mr. Thomas, citing "Jurassic Park," warned Mr. Vladeck of the dangers of protecting a dinosaur.
Mr. Vladeck said the real moral of the movie was the danger of unbridled experimentation.
If Republicans do seek fundamental changes in the financing and delivery of health care for the elderly, they will be stepping onto treacherous political ground. In the last health wars, policy makers in both parties studiously avoided abrupt changes in Medicare, mindful of the vulnerability and sensitivity of its almost 36 million beneficiaries.
The operative political image for many lawmakers when they think about changing Medicare continues to be the elderly who banged on Representative Dan Rostenkowski's car in 1989, when the catastrophic health insurance program went down in flames.
"Medicare needs to be approached with a good deal of caution," said Bill McInturff, a pollster who specializes in health issues and advises the Congressional Republican leadership. "Before we begin, this Republican caucus had better lock down that we're a party that cuts stupid spending, wasteful spending, and convince people that we're going after our own sacred cows long before we begin the public discussion about Medicare."
Some of the alternatives discussed by Republicans, like the push to managed care, are ideas that some Republicans criticized in the last go-round, when the Democrats were backing them. Some conservatives, in particular, passionately defended the right to be treated by the physician of one's choice, which is often restricted in managed care but which is considered to be particularly important to the elderly.
"Seniors are very high specialist users," Bob Blendon, an expert on polling and public health at Harvard, said. "And when you have a chronic illness, you develop a relationship with a set of doctors."
Unless new managed-care systems are offered as purely voluntary options, without penalties for people remaining with fee-for-service medicine, "they will be highly threatened, and that will open up just enormous political battles," Mr. Blendon said.
That explains why most Republicans are speaking in generalities. "They do realize this is a third rail," said Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Republican leaders say their ideas for Medicare would be purely voluntary, a means of opening choices and improving benefits. Their argument is that health plans would vigorously compete for Medicare patients, adding benefits as inducements.
The deliberations among House Republicans, who will probably set the pace for the issue, are proceeding down two tracks. They are looking at short-term proposals to squeeze savings from the program and they are looking at making fundamental changes to slow growth by changing basic incentives.
Among the short-term options is raising the charges for higher-income participants in the Part B section of Medicare. That covers physicians' and outpatient services. Medicare beneficiaries now pay $46.10 a month for that coverage. The Federal Government pays more than 70 percent of the true cost of the program. The idea is to adjust the subsidies according to incomes.
Another proposal from the past and quite likely to receive fresh consideration is instituting co-payments on the fastest-growing part of Medicare, home health care. Republicans could also turn to the traditional way to squeeze money out of Medicare, by restricting payments to providers.
But at least some Republicans are clearly hoping to rein in costs by tapping forces that have brought savings for businesses. Competition among big managed-care plans would, the argument goes, have financial incentives to keep patients satisfied and healthy.
Mr. Vladeck, however, warned on Friday that managed care was no panacea. Part of the problem has to do with Medicare reimbursement formulas for recipients' choosing managed care. Medicare now tends to pay too much, Mr. Vladeck said, because the health plans attract the healthier members of the Medicare population.
More broadly, analysts and advocates have concerns about moving Medicare participants too quickly or without adequate regulation to managed care. The elderly are an exceedingly vulnerable population, those people say, and 20 percent of the recipients are over 85 or severely disabled.
Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said a major concern was pushing the elderly to profit-making networks that decide which services are necessary and which are not. "There are some very big ethical questions that are getting swept under the rug in this discussion of getting everybody into a managed-care system," said Dr. McDermott, a physician who supports a Canadian-style system.
Republicans say sustaining the Medicare status quo is simply not possible, given the status of the hospital trust fund, which Mr. Thomas

HEADLINE: Iranian President Blames West for Hardships

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Looking back on 16 years of Islamic fundamentalist rule, President Hashemi Rafsanjani, in an address today, strongly defended Iran's accomplishments and warned the West that its "poisonous campaign of lies" against Iran and Islamic militancy would fail.
Speaking to an estimated 150,000 people in Teheran's Freedom Square in state-orchestrated ceremonies commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, Mr. Rafsanjani said that Islamic fundamentalism had become a nuisance to western interests. 
 "The West and particularly the United States wants to confront Islamic fundamentalism the same way they challenged Communism," the Iranian President said. "It is a mistaken comparison and a policy that will only strengthen the movement."
As brass bands played the national anthem and schoolchildren in uniform chanted slogans against "satanic oppressor powers," Mr. Rafsanjani told the crowd that the hardships of the last few years were caused by the hostility of the United States.
Iran's deteriorating economic situation has increasingly led to attempts by the leadership to galvanize the population and blame foreigners for problems here, analysts say.
"This regime has not provided people with economic comfort," Massoud Behnoud, an Iranian journalist and author, explained. "It has not provided competent management. But it has given the public a sense that their Government is independent and will not bow to external pressures."
According to diplomats, those external pressures, many of them economic, heightened in the last two years.
"Two years ago, the United States publicly criticized the Europeans for supporting and having financial relations with Iran," said a Western European diplomat. "The Americans also opposed a global agreement on rescheduling of Iranian debt. But there is no trend now towards improving or expanding economic relations and there is no real conflict between the United States and Europeans on Iran."
European and Japanese leaders had maintained that financial and economic relations with Teheran would prevent the rise of Islamic hard-liners in Iran.
Mr. Rafsanjani today accused Washington of a consistent campaign of lies and false allegations.
Hermidas Bavand, professor of International Law at Imam Sadegh University, said, "It seems that the United States is trying to force Iran to change its position and attitude with regard to the U.S. and American vital interests in the region."
The professor said, "The pressure is verbal, economic and financial. Inevitably, Iran will have to improve its relations with powers that have global influence. The proper way is to develop economic and commercial relations with Teheran and make it dependent on the outside. This would be commensurate with existing international realities of coexistence."
But according to diplomats, Teheran's international isolation has increased in the last year as buying power plummeted with the devaluation of Iranian currency by more than 100 percent against the dollar and a drop of more than 40 percent in Iranian imports.
Furthermore, ideological interests continue to undermine strategic and national interests. A recent diplomatic row with Norway over the fate of the fatwa, or religious decree, calling for the death of the British author, Salman Rushdie led to an unofficial downgrading of relations with Oslo and damaged Iran's relations with other Scandanavian countries.

HEADLINE: Conservative Champion Arrives From Rust Belt

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich., Feb. 7

 BODY:
Pudgy, balding and a plodding orator, Gov. John M. Engler has become an unlikely face of revolution.
Four years after winning office in an election many called a fluke victory for Republicans, John Engler came to Washington last week a conquering hero, winning salutes from both President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. When he arrived home, at the Michigan Republican Party convention, he was welcomed with placards that declared, "Engler for President." 
 To the many Republicans, and even some Democrats, who are behind a growing movement they call "devolution," Mr. Engler has become the pre-eminent symbol of the notion that the states know best.
His rallying cry harks back to the Boston Tea Party: "We are not the colonies. And Washington isn't King."
William Ballenger, who edits a nonpartisan political newsletter, Inside Michigan Politics, said, "Right at the moment of truth, when Republicans have seized control of Congress and are talking devolution and returning power to the states, he is a guy who has talked the talk and has walked the walk."
In one term, Mr. Engler rescued Michigan from a $1.8 billion debt and slashed property taxes, leaving the state with a surplus of about $600 million. (The state raised its sales tax, however.) He eliminated the general assistance welfare program, which provided grants to unemployed adults without children. He drastically changed how schools are financed. With that under his belt, Mr. Engler was re-elected in November with an impressive 61 percent of the vote.
"There's a pride now," Mr. Engler, 46, said with self-satisfaction in an interview in his office here. "As opposed to us being a Rust Belt state with the best days behind us, we're now this Midwestern powerhouse."
Despite the high praise, many critics assert that Mr. Engler's successes are built on a precarious foundation: an improved national economic climate that helped spur the resurgence of the automobile industry. They argue that the Governor's recipe of cutting taxes and putting people off welfare has been excessively harsh, and could catch up to him and to the state.
"He's riding a crest at the moment but the danger is what may happen around the corner," said former Gov. William G. Milliken, a popular, moderate Republican who served from 1969 to 1982. "If we have a downturn in the economy, which is really inevitable, and with taxes having been reduced, are we going to be able to meet our commitments on education and other public services, including welfare, that are absolutely essential?"
Robert J. Klein, senior economist at Public Sector Consultants, a nonpartisan concern in Lansing, said, "I don't think he's been a major innovator, but he's had the benefit of the best economy we've had in 20 or 25 years." Mr. Klein warned, though, that "if we do get a slowdown, we could have some serious problems."
Mr. Engler dismisses the worries, noting that he aggressively took on organized labor, particularly the Michigan Education Association, and endured relentless attacks over his plans when he came into office after defeating two-term Gov. James J. Blanchard. Nor is he shy about cutting money for arts or in espousing his conservative beliefs on social issues, like his strong opposition to abortion.
"The first year we had protesters virtually everywhere we went," he said. "Not only did we have to have a real commitment to our programs, but we also had to have a resolve to be able to stand up to all of the pressure."
Still, the Michigan success story is not as overwhelming as the Governor might have audiences believe. For example, studies have found that his welfare plan did not greatly reduce the number of families on welfare. Mr. Engler disputes such studies, though he allows that "there are some unrealistic expectations out there about what can be done."
Though there are doubters who say Mr. Engler's vision could come crashing down, the state has thus far survived, even prospered under his stewardship. And that has been enough for politicians (and the Republican Presidential candidates who are courting him) who want to bask in his success.
Gov. George E. Pataki, for one, lured away Mr. Engler's budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, to help pull New York from its deficit. "It's a big mess they've inherited," Mr. Engler said of New York, adding that "in terms of actual entrenched bad practices, it's probably worse" than what he found in Michigan in 1990.
Last week, Mr. Gingrich said he planned to take up the Governor's idea for having Congress spend a day each month eliminating dumb bureaucratic rules, for which he said Mr. Engler "deserves a lot of credit." An hour or so later, Mr. Clinton cited Mr. Engler for unfurling a parchment that listed hundreds of anti-poverty programs for consolidation. The President said that he, too, had a list of programs he wanted to consolidate and "a lot of those were on Governor Engler's list."
Even at the frequent governors' meetings he wins deference from others. He is in line to become chairman of the Republican Governors' Association this year.
One who has benefited from the Governor's rise is Senator Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican who was elected in November and who campaigned essentially as an Engler clone. "Having Engler's precedent helped me," he said. "He gave me more credibility."
With no prodding, Mr. Engler likens himself to Mr. Gingrich, saying they both came to power after years on the sidelines that gave them time to think about what they wanted to accomplish. "There's some irony in the fact that Newt Gingrich and I have some similarity, I suspect, in having been in the opposition, we had ideas about what to do," he said.
Mr. Engler laughs off, but does not entirely dismiss, the talk that he would like to run for Vice President, or even President. His wife, Michelle, is more forthcoming. Of the possibility that her husband could be tapped to run for Vice President, she said, "It would be a very heady experience, and a difficult offer to refuse." But some Republicans said that Mr. Engler is such a product of this state -- with degrees in agricultural economics from Michigan State University and in law from Thomas M. Cooley Law School -- that they do not know if he would play well with voters outside.
Even some advisers have commented that Mr. Engler looks and talks as if he would mix better among the cattle farmers in rural Beal City, where he grew up, than in Washington. While Mr. Engler has been a politician for his entire career, first as a state representative and later Senate majority leader, he still strikes some as not warm and appealing enough.
Many Democrats say he is worse than cold-hearted. "He is a mean and ruthless politician but a very brilliant one," said Maxine Berman, a veteran Democratic state legislator from Southfield, Mich. "I don't think he cares at all about programs that directly benefit people."
Mr. Engler is trying to display a softer, domestic side. Wherever the Governor goes, he shows the triplets his wife gave birth to days after last year's election. But even Mrs. Engler acknowledges that her husband can appear to be a "wonk head" and has had to work on how he comes across.
"John's problem seems to be that he gets so involved in the nitty-gritty as well as in the overall policy," she said, "that he does tend to forget that not everyone understands, particularly those not involved in politics. We had a real problem at the beginning with the message."
But the election, and all the attention, has given new confidence, and stature, to a politician already known for trust his opinions. He has traded in his Oldsmobile for a Cadillac. And he is planning to push even more: more tax cuts, maybe tackling the state's health care system.
John Engler is still not a commanding speaker. But he speaks with more authority. "The dread of having to do some of the stuff is gone," he said of his first forays before national audiences. "It's a night-and-day difference."

HEADLINE: A Grant Makes Daydreams Possible

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When 10-year-old Chris Frye peers from his window to the parking lot of the dilapidated Queens public housing complex where he lives, his mind's eye often sees a skating rink, a playing field for football, soccer and track, and a swimming pool.
These are not just the daydreams of a youngster who has been chased by drug dealers from the playground where he used to shoot hoops. Last month, the Beach 41st Street Houses in Far Rockaway, where Chris lives with his family, received a $48 million Federal grant, the largest ever given to a single housing project in New York City. 
 Tenants in the 712-unit complex have been promised building renovations and a vast array of physical and social-service improvements in the next five years: a gymnasium, new lobby security systems, a day-care center, a high school program for adults and a community center with a theater and library.
The grant also provides for an array of social services, including apprenticeships, job and computer training, small-business development programs. Money would also go to programs for children, like scouting, homework help and sports and other clubs.
"I've told my son that by the time he gets to junior high school this will be a different place," said Patricia Frye, Chris's mother, who is vice president of the tenants' group. "Right now there is nothing here at Beach Houses and not much in this part of the Rockaways for youngsters."
The New York City Housing Authority, which operates Beach 41st Street Houses, hopes the changes will not only renew the lives of existing tenants but also attract more working families to the complex, where people with full-time jobs make up barely 11 percent of residents. In renting renovated apartments there, the housing authority will create a separate waiting list composed almost exclusively of working families and the elderly.
The list is part of a sweeping policy change in which the authority will give priority to working families for up to 50 percent of vacancies in all public housing.
But residents at Beach 41st Street have been assured that no one will lose a home because of poverty. Tenants will be offered opportunities to move to private housing with rent assistance provided by Federal housing subsidies.
Frances Johnson, president of the tenants organization at Beach 41st Street Houses, where she has lived for 20 years, said most tenants support the economic integration plan.
"The people who care about the future of Beach Houses know that this is a good idea," said Mrs. Johnson, one of several tenants who helped design the changes.
Not everyone is as optimistic as Mrs. Johnson and the Frye family. For some at Beach 41st Houses, the new plans for their project have all the credibility of a blueprint drawn with invisible ink.
"One can only hope," said Ramon Quinones, who has heard talk of the changes that are to come at the complex, which sits across Jamaica Bay from Kennedy International Airport. "Maybe it will come, maybe it won't. They don't seem to have been able to do much about the other problems here."
For many at Beach 41st Street Houses and the community beyond, the vision of the future is viewed from the perspective of unkept promises of the past. Scheme after scheme to revitalize the once picturesque resort community has come to naught on the hundreds of acres of vacant city-owned land that dominates this part of the Rockaways.
There are still pockets of privilege in Far Rockaway. But the peninsula is also home to about 4,000 units of public housing. And by the calculations of the Housing Authority, the residents of Beach 41st Street are worse off than most.
At the 20-year-old development, nearly half the tenants receive public assistance and 40 percent are elderly and on Social Security. The average household income, $10,380, is well below the $12,500 average for all public housing tenants in New York City.
The Rev. Robert Castro, pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle, which sits across Beach Channel Drive from the complex, says it is not only their poverty that has marooned the residents of Beach 41st Street Houses.
"Some people there have forgotten how to dream," Mr. Castro said. "There are moms and dads who are trying hard to be good parents. But things have been so bad for so long that they have lost hope."
Mr. Castro worries that many of the youngsters he works with through his church often do not seem to have a notion of what opportunities exist beyond the causeway, the peninsula's link to the rest of the world.
It is for this reason that Mrs. Johnson, the tenant leader, believes the biggest challenge to residents at Beach 41st Street Houses is to make the most of their windfall.
"Everyone wants nicer apartments, new lobbies and better security," Mrs. Johnson said. "But what will really make a difference will be the programs that give us the opportunity to change things for the people who live here, not just the places where they live."

HEADLINE: A Generation's Heritage: After the Boom, a Boomlet

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
Once again, it's the invasion of the stroller people.
Chappaqua, a quiet Westchester County suburb that a generation ago was a haven for young families, is seeing history repeat. The World Cup Gymnastics and Nursery School added nine new classrooms last summer and recently voters approved a bond issue to expand the primary schools. The kiddie pools at the swim clubs spawn 3-year-olds like tadpoles. And when the Ragamuffin Parade turned off Greely Avenue last Halloween, dozens of MacLaren strollers were parked in the eddy, holding next year's marchers. 
 "I remember one day standing on the checkout line at the supermarket and seeing a woman with a belly, and I realized I hadn't seen that for the longest time," Alice Ozaroff, who moved to Chappaqua in the 1960's, said. "Then there was another one. And all of a sudden it was like an ant colony."
Chappaqua is not alone. All over America, a new generation is making itself felt in nearly every aspect of social, economic and political life, even though its members are barely 3 feet tall.
Every year since 1989, according to the Census Bureau, there has been a bumper crop of more than four million births in the United States -- a magic number for demographers, because the last time the birth rate climbed above four million was in the baby boom.
The new surge -- which population experts call the baby boomlet, the millennium generation or the baby boom echo -- has the potential, as its members age, to shape American society as profoundly as their illustrious namesakes. If the baby boom is a pig passing through a python, the python has taken another gulp.
Demographers and pollsters see the boomlet's effects in everything from the sales of multimedia computers to the success of "The Lion King," last year's top-grossing movie, to policy issues like health care and welfare.
"We have seen in the last five years or so a real focus on family-related issues," said Bradford Fay, a vice president of Roper Starch Worldwide, a polling and market research company. "You see it in television programs. You see it in the 1992 family-values issue that came up. And you see it in the emphasis that we're placing on home life."
The boomlet startled the demographers at the Census Bureau, who predicted in the late 80's that births would not climb above four million annually. In 1989, however, there were 4.041 million births, and in 1990 the figure shot up to 4.158 million. Since then the figure has declined slowly but has remained above four million a year.
Several trends converged to produce the increase. Baby boomers, after declaring in their youth that they did not want children, changed their minds in dramatic numbers in their 30's and 40's. At the same time, a younger generation began having children in their 20's. And a wave of immigrants has brought newcomers who traditionally have more children than native-born Americans.
The boomlet generation is far more racially and ethnically diverse than its predecessors, which some demographers see as a harbinger of increased racial tolerance. But others fear a generation further polarized along lines of race and class.
"The really scary part for those kids is they are shaping up to be a generation of haves and have-nots," said Susan Mitchell, writer of "The Official Guide to the Generations" (New Strategist, 1995). "There are 6-year-olds in affluent places who are logging onto computers themselves, practically on the information highway already. But then there are 6-year-olds who have never seen a computer."
Education, many hope, will level the playing field, but as the babies of '89 and afterward enter kindergarten, schools almost everywhere are facing enrollment crunches. Districts that shut down buildings during the baby bust that followed the baby boom a generation ago are being forced to convert libraries to classrooms, add trailers and beg for new construction money at a time of falling government aid to education and a revolt by homeowners against higher property taxes.
Kindergarten enrollment rose 7.2 percent from 1988 to 1993, from 3.357 million to 3.597 million, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the Department of Education. Preschool enrollment over the same period was up 14 percent, from 2.621 million to 2.984 million.
At the private Horace Mann School in Manhattan, the admissions office began taking requests for application forms for entering 3-year-olds for the fall of 1995 the day after Labor Day 1994. The school stopped sending out the forms days later, after more than 300 requests for about 40 places.
While many fear that enrollment pressures will further erode the quality of public education, some demographers see a coming era of education improvements as baby-boom parents become preoccupied with their children's schooling.
A Roper poll last July found that 22 percent of the general population ranked education as one of their top three concerns. But among parents with children under 18 the number rose, to 30 percent.
As a consumer market, the echo generation is already a force to be reckoned with, as small children influence their parents' choices of big-ticket purchases. Boomers who grew up in the back seats of station wagons swore that they would not be caught dead driving their parents' cars; when they had children of their own, they discovered the minivan.
"What minivans did was make it acceptable for a boomer to buy a Dodge or Plymouth or Chrysler," said Christopher Cedergren, senior vice president of the Autopacific Group, a consultant in Santa Ana, Calif.
That the ugly duckling van is basically a station wagon that dare not speak its name has been a bitter pill for some boomers. "A couple of our friends who never foresaw themselves as having a minivan, which epitomizes suburbia in the 90's, didn't like the idea," said Steve Schifrin of Highland Park, Ill., who bought a 1989 Plymouth Voyager after the birth of his second child, deftly transferring the cellular phone from his BMW to the van.
Similarly, the personal computer industry is experiencing astonishing growth, in significant measure thanks to multimedia machines bought to run programs starring dinosaurs and Reader Rabbit. Sales of computers equipped with CD-ROM rose nearly 50 percent last year, to 5.9 million, according to the Link Resources Corporation, a research company in New York. "Right now the majority of stuff on CD-ROM is geared to children," said Helen Rosen, an analyst at Link.
Cheryl Russell of Ithaca, N.Y., bought a home computer with a CD-ROM drive last year -- a decision made largely with her two children, 6 and 2, in mind. Now her 2-year-old daughter removes her thumb from her mouth to use the mouse. Ms. Russell, a former editor of American Demographics magazine and a publisher of demographic reference books for business, predicted that a generation raised on interactive learning would grow up with ever-higher expectations of instant responses from business and government.
In entertainment, the burgeoning young audience has helped give Walt Disney Studios a string of animated hits since 1989, beginning with "The Little Mermaid" and extending to "The Lion King," which grossed $300 million at the box office last year.
Matt Mazer, executive vice president of Nest Productions, which last year released "The Swan Princess," said an animation boom was being driven by the knowledge that even if films did not fare well at the box office, profits could be made on home video sales. Indeed, Disney films represent one-fifth of the $5 billion market for home video sales.
"Parents create libraries of home video products the same way our parents used to buy things called books," Mr. Mazer said.
The 90's sometimes seem to be the child-safety decade, spawning laws about bicycle helmets, high-rise window guards and community notification of released sex offenders.
"The parents of the busters bought the line that you do your thing and I'll do mine," Ms. Russel said. "Many boomers might have believed it for a while. But then they said, 'Whoa, that's not going to work for my kids.' I think the boomers will insist on much more supervision of their kids."
Now that boomers are reveling in parenthood, national politics often seems to revolve around protecting the home front, from health care to crime to orphanages.
"In the last 10 years there isn't a single important political issue that has not been effectively rephrased as being a child issue," said Neil Howe, co-author with William Strauss of "Generations" (William Morrow & Company, 1991). He cited the national budget deficit, which is attacked as a burden to future generations, and environmentalism, which has been repackaged from its anti-establishment roots in the 70's into a matter of stewardship for the sake of children.
Bill McInturff, a prominent Republican pollster in Alexandria, Va., predicts that the great political showdown of the late 90's will pit children's advocates against defenders of Medicare and Social Security.
"A third of our budget is going to 14 percent of the population, while 1 of 6 kids is in poverty," Mr. McInturff, a boomer with young children of his own, said. "This is going to be a fight over who gets the money, our kids or our parents. In the next three to five years all policy will revolve around that battle."
As the boomlet children come of age, will they have as revolutionary an influence on American society as their parents? Probably not, say most demographers, who see the new generation continuing long-term trends toward individualism, mobility and technological mastery in American society.
Watts Wacker, a market analyst at Yankelovich Partners in Westport, Conn., whose business card reads "resident futurist," calls children under 12 the "Alexander the Great generation," after the Greek who conquered his known world by age 18.
"This generation has that much focus," Mr. Wacker said. "They know how to take care of themselves and be their own boss, because their parents have always worked. They have an unbelievable sense of being self-sufficient and confident. They're all Macaulay Culkins. They feel very comfortable about handling what life's throwing at them."

HEADLINE: The Grabbing of the Green;
Acquisitive Parks Dept. Is Wily Scavenger for Bits of Land

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
At a time of city budget cuts, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern is aggressively enlarging his emerald empire, even as he admits that his agency cannot adequately care for the parks it has.
From the salt marshes of Jamaica Bay and Staten Island to the vacant lots of Harlem and the Bronx, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation last year acquired 416.2 acres, a total roughly the size of half of Central Park and the most land acquired since 1983. 
 Mr. Stern has managed to enlarge the city green in large part by following a path from the past, namely that of Robert Moses, who combined guile and a keen knowledge of the city's bureaucracy to create the modern park system during the depths of the Depression.
Like Mr. Moses, today's park-land grabbers avoid spending new money by mining other city agencies for most of their parcels -- taking over vacant lots, parking lots and properties of tax evaders that fall into city hands.
More than three-quarters of the land acquired last year was bought with money used to settle legal claims against polluters. Most of the rest was already city land, converted from small parcels on vacant lots, city esplanades and piers.
But critics complain that the parks people are expanding beyond their means to properly maintain these lands, although Mr. Stern has won the favor of environmentalists and city budget planners.
"Why acquire what you can't maintain?" Mr. Stern asked.
"The answer is that land and parks are forever. People will enjoy these parks as long as we have a city."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani endorses the program. "If possible, we want to increase our park land and open spaces," Cristyne F. Lategano, his press secretary, said.
And the acquisitions draw raves from park advocates. "It's something we're thrilled about," said Marcia Reiss, policy director of the Parks Council, a research and advocacy group. "Park builders have to take the long view because land is so precious."
Indeed, some proponents of open spaces advocate an even brisker pace. Next week, the Trust for Public Land, a national conservation group, plans to release a report calling for the acquisition of 286 more acres of park land: 189 acres in private hands and 97 acres of publicly owned land.
Its recommended acquisitions range from sites on the Harlem and Hutchinson Rivers to Udalls Cove near Douglaston, Queens, to Staten Island's Mount Loretto shoreline to a site on West Broadway in SoHo.
But others argue that proper management of existing resources should be the prerequisite for any expansion. "I would be very leery of it," said Betsy Gotbaum, Parks Commissioner for Mayor David N. Dinkins, adding that until parks are properly maintained, acquisitions should be low on the list of priorities. "You tend to create a situation that could be potentially dangerous -- not only to the Parks Department but also to the children."
Dean Mead, senior research associate for the Citizens Budget Commission, a fiscal watchdog group, said his analyses show that the agency is already conducting a policy of triage, knowingly letting maintenance go in many parks. "Acquiring more park land is counterproductive because they can't care for what they've got now," he said.
Commissioner Stern answers that land generally goes up in value and is often forever lost to other uses anyway. He advocates "landbanking," until there is money to pay for development. "Some parks don't come to life until a couple generations after they're acquired," he said.
Three basic kinds of parks are being added to the system, according to Jane Cleaver, director of park land for the department. They are wilderness areas on the city's fringes, small parcels adjacent to existing playgrounds, and new, medium-sized parks in areas with no or few existing parks. Much of the land fell to the city when owners failed to pay property taxes.
Each parcel must be discussed thoroughly with concerned neighbors and go through a formal review process that ends with parks being placed on the official city map by the State Legislature. Before that, every parcel must be approved by the city's Land Use Committee, a multi-agency group.
But for a fiscally pressed city administration, the negligible price is eminently right. Wilderness land on the city's fringes has usually been bought with settlement funds from oil spills in Staten Island's Arthur Kill and monies won from cases involving illegal dumping in Jamaica Bay, among others lawsuits. The total exceeds $18 million, with more than half this amount already spent on acquisitions. Other settlements are being negotiated. The settlement agreements require these funds to be used for park acquisitions or other environmental purposes.
Other land already belongs to city agencies, such as the Department of General Services and the Economic Development Corporation. Only a small proportion has to be bought from private owners. And even in these transactions, Ms. Cleaver is almost always able to avoid using city money: she normally gets state grants from a special conservation fund.
Maintenance costs are low. The wilderness areas usually require only the building of a fence. No park or playground is acquired anymore unless local residents formally agree to maintain it, Mr. Stern said.
The economic downside is that land mapped as park land cannot be used for any other purpose unless a state law is passed to take back, or "alienate" its special status. And even then, legislative tradition requires that at least an equivalent amount of new park land be set aside.
The acquisition strategy harks back to the methods of Robert Moses, who was flatly told by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia that there was no money to buy parks. Mr. Moses responded by assigning a staff member to comb through the records of every publicly owned piece of land in New York City. By raiding the property of agencies from the Board of Education to the Transportation Department, Mr. Moses increased the number of city playgrounds from 119 to 179 in his first six months on the job.
Mr. Stern, who refers to Mr. Moses often in conversation and speeches, has two aides -- "tigers," he calls them -- leading the day-to-day charge to acquire more parks. One is Ms. Cleaver, who has been involved in acquiring parks for 26 years and says she makes it a practice to walk every square foot of a site.
She also follows squarely in the Moses tradition of raiding other agencies' real estate. She expects to have completed by Wednesday a two-and-a-half-month-long inventory of all vacant property under the jurisdiction of the Department of General Services to determine which parcels are next to existing playgrounds. The idea is to acquire these and fence them in. Then, when the playground is next remodeled, it can be enlarged.
It is important to strike swiftly. "For every piece of land, there is only a small window of opportunity," Ms. Cleaver said. "All the pieces have to line up."
Among her current projects are pushing through ball fields in Brooklyn's Bushwick section and Queens's Broad Channel and a community park on the Lower East Side, and adding some private lots to a windswept bird sanctuary at Brant Point Park in Far Rockaway, Queens.
"Our job is to look at land and see it not as it is, but what it will be 10 years from now," she said. "We're in the dream business."
The other aide is Mark Matsil, director of the department's Natural Resources Group. His contributions include persuading courts to direct awards won from polluters of public lands to his acquisition initiatives, as well as providing proof of an area's natural importance, to back up Ms. Cleaver's paper trails.
In area, Mr. Matsil's acquisitions are far bigger. Indeed, 84 percent of the property acquired last year was on Staten Island, where there has been an aggressive effort to add to the city's inventory of remote natural lands, usually wetlands with interesting bird populations. This effort has been greatly aided by a general awareness that Federal and state laws so limit use of wetlands that wildlife sanctuaries are often the only possible alternative.
These acquisitions often involve working cooperatively with other city agencies. At Four Sparrows Marsh in Brooklyn's Mill Basin section, Mr. Matsil persuaded the Economic Development Corporation to move a condominium development back from a fragile wetland and to build a barrier of trees and shrubs to protect it. The swampland and the barrier area were recently assigned to the Parks Department, and the development is going ahead.
Mr. Matsil said a cooperative attitude has been key to his agency's success in winning land assignments from other agencies. "You've got to select your battles so you're not perceived as land-hungry usurpers trying to create fiefdoms everywhere," he said.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Individuals' Accounts Spur Many to Make Donations

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Sandra Westin knows the dread and frustration of losing a job. She knows the ache of rejection and isolation. So when she read the story of Aida D., a jobless woman who has been helped by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Westin's response was heartfelt.
In a letter to the fund, she offered her typewriter to Ms. D., who has been writing cover letters by hand. The story, she said, mirrored her own struggles. 
 "I'm also sending a check to the Neediest Fund -- something I try to do annually, but was not motivated to do this year until I read your moving story and realized, but for a little cash and a lot of luck, it could have been me," wrote Ms. Westin, a Manhattan resident. "Perhaps my typewriter and contribution will bring her luck -- I truly hope so."
Thousands donate to the fund each year out of habit. But occasionally a contribution comes in response to a particular story. In such cases, the donors' reactions might be based on personal experiences.
Helga Lob sent $50 after reading the story of Joyce B., a Queens woman who was trying to reconstruct her life after two brain surgeries.
"My husband died of a brain tumor nine years ago, after five surgeries," wrote Mrs. Lob, of Fort Lee, N.J. "I know how difficult it is, and want to help her. Please apply my donation to her case and cause."
For Mary T. Brown of Merrick, L.I., it was the case of Denis Sivets, a 10-year-old boy from Tajikistan, a former Soviet Republic, who was seeking treatment for a rare disease in New York. Mrs. Brown, who sent $10, wrote that she cried after reading about the Sivets family's hardship.
"I, too, am the mother of a profoundly retarded son who does not speak," she wrote. "Sometimes life is very unkind but we must have faith, as I'm sure you do. You are a very special family. Just remember you are in my prayers."
The Neediest Cases Fund was started in 1912, after Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The Times, met a beggar on the street. The man had no money and no place to sleep, so Mr. Ochs gave him a few dollars and offered him a job. Soon after, Mr. Ochs came up with the idea for the fund. Helping a stranger had given him a sense of satisfaction, and he wondered if one man's feeling might be the basis for a city's goodwill.
The first campaign raised just $3,630.88 from 117 contributors. In the past 11 weeks, more than 11,000 donors have sent nearly $4 million to help the city's poor, sick, elderly and disabled. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
A number of readers responded to the case of Max Epstein, an artist who has lived in poverty since he was struck by a car in 1986. Although he now receives social security benefits and food stamps, he cannot afford art supplies.
A group of artists in Lambertville, N.J., offered to establish an account for Mr. Epstein at a supply shop. And Hospitality Art, a Manhattan art dealership that owns some of his silk screens, offered to donate them to an auction in order to raise money for him.
Another story that kindled great response was that of Dorothea Y. and her autistic son, Jonathan. Mrs. Y. has suffered two brain aneurysms and recently lost her job, but was determined to maintain stability for her son.
"I was especially taken by this story because here is someone coping continually and in a short period, she is facing her worst fears," wrote Susan Berne of Manhattan, who sent $200. "She is a woman to be admired; a fighter and survivor not only for herself, but also for her son.'
Gloria Kogan of Manhattan promptly responded to the story of Erika B., a Holocaust survivor whose husband was murdered years ago in Queens. Mrs. B. suffers from depression, loneliness and various health problems.
"I am approximately the same age as Mrs. B. who has suffered from so many coincidental outbreaks of misfortune," wrote Mrs. Kogan, who gave $25. "Perhaps this will help in a small way to put her back on track. I wish her well."

Battle of the Briefcase

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When I was in Hong Kong recently I noticed a small item in the paper reporting that a prominent democracy campaigner from Shanghai, Dai Xeuzhong, had been sentenced to three years in prison for tax evasion. Now that's interesting, I thought. The Chinese have been telling the U.S. that they just can't track down all those pirate factories ripping off American compact disks, movies and software, but they managed to track down the tax returns of Mr. Dai, out of 1.2 billion Chinese. Funny people these Chinese leaders. They have no problem with the needles; it's the haystacks that elude them.
 Why? Because the pirate factories are owned and operated by provincial governments, ruling families or the army and are cash cows for all of them. They need to keep them going to underwrite lavish life styles, to finance government budgets or to employ some of the millions of Chinese who have left the countryside and are roaming the cities for work. That's why when the central authorities in Beijing, who have good copyright laws on the books, pull levers to enforce those laws, the levers come off in their hands. 
 That is also why this copyright dispute with China is about so much more than whether Barbra Streisand collects an extra $100,000 a year in royalties. It's about what could be one of the most important questions of U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century: What if China can't go straight? That is, what if the system there remains so trapped in the half-light between reform and corruption, between state control and regional autonomy, between truth and lies that China finds itself incapable of playing by the global rules?
 The Chinese are so used to lying to themselves that they think they can lie to the world and no one will call them on it. When the U.S got fed up last month, broke off the copyright talks with Beijing and slapped China with $1 billion in sanctions, the Chinese were shocked. They denounced Lee Sands, the top U.S. negotiator, and complained that he left Beijing "without even saying goodbye."
 Imagine that -- he didn't even say goodbye! President Clinton deserves credit for his bluntness. In today's one-superpower world, if the U.S. doesn't confront the Chinese on this issue, no one else will. The craven Europeans and Japanese are behind us all the way -- way, way behind us. So far behind us you can't see them because they are too busy trying to gobble up market share that U.S. companies might lose as a result of this confrontation.
 The trick for the U.S. is to find a way to put enough pressure on China to make it conform to international trade norms, without putting so much pressure on it at once that the U.S. and Beijing get into a cold war on a broad front. (It's one thing to fight a cold war with a hollow Soviet economy that produced television sets that blew up and tractors that were more valuable as scrap metal. It's another to fight a cold war with 1.2 billion people, whose economy grows at 10 percent a year.)
 The key to such a nuanced strategy is the U.S. business community. China's leaders understand that their power depends on their ability to keep expanding their economy. They will only go after the pirates when we make it clear that their economy won't attract investment if they don't. The only way to do that is to demonstrate that U.S. business is on the side of the Administration.
 In a real war, you count tanks and soldiers. In a trade war, you count C.E.O.'s. And what is interesting about this dispute over copyright laws is that the balance of briefcases now favors the U.S. That's because the U.S. business community has discovered that China doesn't want to just import U.S. goods. It wants to import U.S. technology, so it can make everything itself. And if China is ripping off Mickey Mouse emblems today, it will be ripping off auto designs tomorrow. In fact, it already is. The Big Three U.S. auto makers are backing Mr. Clinton -- even though Beijing has singled them out for retaliation -- because China has already ripped off Chrysler technology and produced a knock-off Jeep.
 The two sides have scheduled last-ditch negotiations for this week. You don't need to be Clausewitz to handicap this one. It's real simple: If Mr. Clinton can hold his business brigades together, the Chinese will cave. If he can't, the Chinese will walk -- and you can be sure they won't say goodbye.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Owners Chose Their Course

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When President Clinton held a news briefing after the most unusual bargaining session in baseball labor history, he twice mentioned the absence of a commissioner.
"There is no baseball commissioner," he said, explaining why he was taking the unusual step of asking Congress to pass a bill imposing binding arbitration. "We'd lost the World Series, millions upon millions of dollars in lost income is at stake, and a lot more as well." 
 Responding a moment later to a question asking him to compare his action with previous Presidential forays into labor disputes, he said, "This is far more in the nature of a unique set of circumstances where there isn't a commissioner and there should have been to resolve this."
The next day, standing in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where the players' and owners' groups had gathered the previous evening, Clinton said, "If we had a baseball commissioner, maybe none of us would have been in here."
At his own news conference after he returned from the White House, Bud Selig, who is acting as commissioner but rejects the idea that he really wants the job, was asked about the President's remarks.
"I talked to the President about that tonight," the Milwaukee Brewers' owner said. "I would remind you that there have been seven work stoppages under commissioners before this. It's that same mythology that we keep crafting all the time -- if there was a commissioner."
The difference, of course, between those seven work stoppages and this one is that those stoppages stopped. This one, fueled by the absence of a commissioner or Energizer batteries, keeps going and going and going. This stoppage, already the longest in sports history, begins its seventh month today.
The next day Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, addressed the President's remarks.
"His reference to no commissioner," Fehr said, "just reminded me that we all knew this was coming more or less when, two and a half years ago, Fay Vincent was fired and the owners began to talk about going to war with the players and the necessity of removing a commissioner who could act in the best interests of baseball so they could have the fight we're now having. That sequence of events, given the timing of it and how accurately it has presaged this dispute, tells us a lot about what the mind-set of the owners has been."
If the owners' ouster of Fay Vincent presaged this never-ending dispute, Selig himself presaged the ouster of Vincent.
Following the seventh work stoppage under a commissioner, the owners' lockout in 1990, Selig wrote what he called an "analyzation" of the lockout, the negotiations and the settlement. Selig and Jerry Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner and silent force, still blame Vincent for undermining the owners' position and negotiating a deal when, Selig wrote, the players were a day or two away from caving.
"The commissioner's involvement, while well-intentioned, is a destructive mechanism," Selig concluded, adding, "There is no doubt in my mind that the commissioner and his entire office should never again participate in labor negotiations or even labor-related matters."
In the summer of 1992, Selig and Reinsdorf, acting on Selig's "analyzation," asked Vincent to relinquish his authority in labor-related matters. He refused, and three months later he was gone from all commissioner-related matters.
Selig and Reinsdorf have offered other reasons for the move to end Vincent's tenure prematurely, but Selig's own written words, which never before have surfaced, speak distinctly to their motives.
 
The Dysktra-Angelos Spectrum
 Before the owners get too excited about and place too much stock in Lenny Dykstra's questioning of the union's position in negotiations, they might want to remember that one of their own, Peter Angelos, has criticized management's position far longer and louder.
Angelos represents 1/28 of the owners, Dykstra 1/1100 of the players. Even if Dykstra's view prompted other insecure players to speak up, it is highly unlikely that the owners could expect a ground swell of defections, any more than Angelos's stance on replacement players has led other teams to refuse to field teams.
The difference is the owners will try to punish Angelos; union officials will only try to explain to Dykstra why they think he is wrong and how his public comments don't help the players get a deal.

 They played together in the Detroit Tigers' system, the four of them. None made it big (only one made it out of the minor leagues), but they succeeded in other ways, Jim Leyland and Gene Lamont as major league managers, Bob Gilhooley and George Kalafatis as major league player agents.
Kalafatis, a New York high school and college star, died a week ago, leaving behind his status as the strongest hitter, by all accounts, of the friendly four when they were in the minors. They first played together at Rocky Mount, N.C., in 1967, Leyland and Lamont as catchers, Gilhooley the shortstop and Kalafatis the first baseman.
"George managed to pick off all of my throws and save me from further embarrassment," Gilhooley related. "Lamont was the better catcher. Although he wasn't much of a hitter, George had the most power. I was the best hitter. Leyland was a scrappy guy, played to the maximum of his skills. I couldn't field, but I could hit. George had great power, but he struck out a lot. He should have got a chance at Tiger Stadium."
Lamont, the Chicago White Sox manager, who roomed with Kalafatis for five or six years in the minors, offered a similar scouting report: "hit home runs, struck out a lot."
Leyland recalled a game he played with Kalafatis at Montgomery, Ala.
"The first time up one night against Birmingham," the Pittsburgh manager recalled, "George hit a double, and the next four times up he hit home runs."
Why didn't Kalafatis make it to the majors?
"He couldn't hit," Leyland said. "He had good power, but he couldn't hit. Gilhooley was a pretty decent hitter but not a good fielder. I never got out of Double A and was a backup at that. That's what teed me off, not being in Double A but being a backup."
 
 
Critic's Corner
 The Trial (anyone who needs to ask which one shouldn't bother) has prompted an idea that could enhance the listening or viewing pleasure of fans of any persuasion -- replacement players (owners) or replacement games (players).
The Trial has created the largest group of professional second-guessers ever, lawyers appearing on every television and radio show commenting on the performance and the tactics of the prosecution and the defense.
Baseball always has a small army of out-of-work former managers and coaches. Each station or network that carries games could hire one or two, not only helping to reduce unemployment but also adding to the enjoyment of the game. These professional second-guessers could instantly assess the moves made by the managers in the dugouts and suggest ways that they could have had bigger innings or short-circuited big innings against them.
The only problem is these professional second-guessers would have to compete with the people who already fill those roles -- the broadcasters and commentators.

HEADLINE: Flat-Tax Proposal Rewards Go-Getters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Robert Kuttner's "Instead Close Loopholes" (Op-Ed, Feb. 8) concludes that "the very idea of a flat tax is a reversal of the well-established principle of taxation based on ability to pay." That "principle" has been employed to justify marginal tax rates of up to 90 percent, although that confiscatory level has dropped to approximately 42 percent. But the notion that ability to pay should guide taxation is morally bankrupt. 
 The indolent pauper who has squandered the countless opportunities in the United States for training and employment owes to society a moral debt for contributing nothing to its strength; whereas the persevering high-income earner is entitled to moral credit for conduct that contributes to the pleasure of others and augments the nation's wealth.
 High incomes should be taxed no more heavily than lower incomes; they should receive lighter taxation to reward conduct that most advances the happiness of others.
 As a practical matter, taxing the impecunious will yield little if any revenue. It should thus be forgone not because of moral scruples but because the game is not worth the candle.
 Mr. Kuttner's contention that progressive taxation "is sensible economics" and "sound fiscal policy" wars with all experience and intuition. Reducing the tax rate would effect a corresponding rise in the incentive to work, boosting prosperity. Hong Kong is illustrative.
 That tiny but densely populated British colony, bereft of natural resources, has surpassed the mother country in per capita income in the last decade with a 15 percent flat-tax rate, a sharp contrast to Britain's progressive rate structure.
 House Majority Leader Dick Armey's flat-tax proposal is no survival-of-the-fittest law. Its generous exemptions would remove an additional 10 million individuals from Federal income tax rolls. It would also puncture bloated entitlement programs that redistribute wealth to unproductive members of society. Such hundreds of billions in subsidies to sloth are morally perverse and a dead weight on the economy.

HEADLINE: On the Subject Of Highway Tolls

 BODY:
Once again, it tolls, and the toll increases. As a longtime commuter and traveler in the N.J./N.Y. area and N.J./Washington corridor, I believe it is long past the time for a fresh look at the entire situation. Perhaps our new governors can be persuaded to apply some new thinking to the toll issue.
Is there not a way to devise a registration-based system that would eliminate both the need for and the colossal waste involved in the toll collection process? 
 New Jersey should consider the full economic costs of collection, not just the maintenance of toll booths and the labor costs of the collectors, but the tens of thousands of hours lost in lines associated therewith. Also, the gasoline consumed, the wear and tear on vehicles in this process, not to mention the mental wear and tear.
Surely one could tax vehicle registration in the tristate area to pay the lion's share of the bills for the currently tolled units of the highway system. Tristate vehicles would be taxed, stamped and freed of all toll lines at all presently tolled sites. If you own a vehicle, for any purpose, you benefit from the full system and should contribute to it, whether you use the bridges and tunnels daily, or only on occasion. If you are in business, your business benefits in the same way.
One could also provide special toll lanes for out-of-area vehicles so that passers-through could pay their fair share.
We should be spending less money fighting about toll increases or buying new computerized gadgets to collect fares, and more on providing better transportation services at every level.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Open Office To Improve U.S. Ties

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
When Hanoi opened its first diplomatic office here last week, the chief of liaison was met with angry shouts from protesters. In the days that followed, however, the downtown suite of offices has filled up with flowers from American companies eager to do business with the former foe.
As Vietnam and the United States move gingerly toward full diplomatic ties, the strains of the past and the hopes for the future overlap awkwardly. 
 Le Van Bang, the chief of the new, six-person liaison office, describes his role as helping to tell America of how Vietnam has moved on since the Communists emerged victorious and unified the country nearly 20 years ago. As he shows a visitor around the rambling and largely empty downtown suite of offices, decorated with tapestries of pagodas and the orange and yellow Vietnamese flag, he stopped to read the cards from some of the floral tributes.
"All these flowers are from American companies," said Mr. Bang. "For instance, this one is from a company that clears mines from the ground."
As Hanoi's representative to the United Nations for the last three years, Mr. Bang said that 80 percent of his time was spent trying to smooth relations between the United States and Vietnam. During those years, he traveled around the United States, meeting with Vietnamese-Americans, American business people and veterans' groups to promote the image of a new Vietnam.
"I tell people about the new foreign policy to be friends with everyone," said Mr. Bang. "Many are surprised when I tell them we are now a free market economy, that we encourage private ownership."
It is also his job to help resolve the issue of Americans still missing in Vietnam.
State Department officials say lack of progress on the issue of American soldiers still listed as missing in action and other Americans unaccounted for remains the main stumbling block on the road to full diplomatic relations.
On Friday, a State Department official said that while the United States is heartened by Vietnam's increased cooperation, returning 61 sets of remains of Americans during the last year, "the remains of 2,100 servicemen are still missing, and further steps towards diplomatic normalization will not continue unless there is tangible progress."
Mr. Bang also tries to help Americans caught in Vietnam's red tape. One of the first phone calls he received in his new post was from a representative of the Vietnam Veterans of America, who was calling because he was having a problem securing visas for a delegation to visit Vietnam.
"I intervened, and the next day they got the visas," said Mr. Bang.
Mr. Bang is swift to describe the warm relations he enjoys with groups like the Vietnam Veterans of America. But Paul Skogland, the group's executive director, stopped short of calling the increased diplomatic relations a positive development. "Once something's a done deal," he said, "we try to make the best of it."
The opening of the Vietnamese liaison office on Wednesday coincided with the release of the State Department's annual report on human rights around the world. In the report, the State Department said that "Vietnamese citizens did not have the right to change their government, or to assemble, associate or speak freely, and the Government continued to arrest and imprison people arbitrarily."
Mr. Bang attributes the report's criticism to cultural and economic differences between the United States and Vietnam. "Here the press criticizes the President openly," he said. "Traditionally, in Vietnam, that is not acceptable."
As for arbitrary arrests, Mr. Bang said: "We still consider security a very high priority. If you are going to do something that causes disorder, we have to take care of that."
Mr. Bang and his staff plan to move into the old South Vietnamese Embassy by March, as soon as renovations are completed. However, Mr. Bang anticipates that the move will only mean a change to more spacious quarters, not an increase in diplomatic stature.

HEADLINE: Traffic Jams Around Princeton Rekindle a Highway Debate

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Drivers who live within a 30-mile radius of this university town keep a playbook on local roads that is often as complicated as the ones memorized by Super Bowl quarterbacks.
Reverses, buttonhooks, end-arounds and a lot of Hail Marys are called upon to get in and out of the area on roads so choked with traffic and construction that they seem to surrender only three yards and a cloud of dust at peak hours. 
 It's been a dozen years since New Jersey officially spurned a new north-south pathway for Interstate 95 through the middle of the state. Environmentalists and landowners feared it would bring congestion and developmental clutter to the farmlands and gently rolling estates of Mercer and Somerset counties.
But every day, fallout from that decision piles up at stoplights and intersections between Trenton and New Brunswick, making many people wish they could turn back time and build the high-speed roadway.
"It would've spared us a lot of problems we see today," said Mimi Summerskill, owner of La Follette winery and vineyards at Belle Mead, north of Princeton, where upscale French chateau style houses bloom on former farmlands and Route 206 is packed during weekday rush hours with commuters.
"What we have now in the area is development without the interstate highway," said Mayor Marvin Reed of Princeton. "It will be solved only when everything comes to a standstill and drivers look around for other routes."
But there is no going back.
The project died a formal death in 1983 when the 27-mile stretch of I-95 was taken off the drawing boards by Washington. Now any hope for relief would have to depend on money from the state at a time Trenton is in a penny-pinching mood.
Princeton, where Routes 206 and 27 converge, is under siege daily by motorists and truckers groping for a way through the region. A few miles to the east is Route 1, one of the most congested arteries in the state, a four-lane divided highway that seems endlessly under construction. Cars and trucks back up for miles at traffic signals and motorists exiting new shopping malls and office clusters feel the need to make kamikaze dives into oncoming vehicles.
It's not only stop-and-go traffic that has local officials worrying.
For Barbara Wolfe, who just ended a three-year stint as Mayor of East Amwell Township in southern Hunterdon County, it is the sight of a steady stream of tractor-trailer rigs barreling along Route 31 in the Hopewell Valley about 10 miles northwest of Princeton, a two-lane blacktop designed for small farm vehicles and local autos.
"It's dangerous for cars and school buses to share a small country road with 18-wheelers," said Ms. Wolfe, citing a state Department of Transportation survey that found that truck traffic on Route 31 more than doubled last year from 700 to more than 1,700 trucks a day.
The study said the increase was a direct result of the completion last year of the portion of I-287 in northern New Jersey that connected with the New York State Thruway and the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson. By using Route 31, truckers found a toll-free link in western New Jersey between the I-95 and I-295 loop around Trenton to the south and -- via I-287 -- to New York State and New England, skirting congestion around New York City.
The maximum toll at present for trucks traveling one-way on the turnpike between the Delaware Memorial and George Washington bridges is $ 20.80, according to the Turnpike Authority.
The Route 31 survey was completed before the portion of I-295 called the Trenton Complex, which loops through the capital and south through Bordentown, was completed in December, another closing of a "missing link" that some fear will encourage even heavier use of Route 31 by truckers.
Department of Transportation officials, however, say the new road may relax rather than exacerbate the problem by giving truckers easier access to the turnpike.
"A lot of major construction has been accomplished at the Trenton Complex and along Route 1 in recent years," said Dennis Keck, assistant commissioner for planning at the Transportation Department.
"Is traffic free-flowing and uncongested?" he asked.
"No, of course not," he answered. "But has significant relief been provided? Absolutely!"
It's difficult for some commuters like Patrick Kreger, an auditor for the International Business Machines Corporation who lives in Lawrence Township, not to be skeptical.
"Yeah, if I leave home at 6 in the morning and return late in the evening, I'm O.K.," Mr. Kreger said. "But if you hit these roads at 7 to 9 A.M. and 4 to 7 P.M. you're going to sit in traffic, there's no beating it."
Local traffic problems were already evident when opposition to I-95 gathered strength in the 1970's. Industrial parks housing pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporations joined research firms associated with Princeton University along the Route 1 corridor.
New housing by 1980 had doubled the 1960 population of prestigious Princeton satellite communities like West Windsor Township, overburdening local roads and sending warning signals to landowners in more sparsely settled Hopewell and Montgomery townships that they were next in line for change.
The boom continued in the 1980's; West Windsor's population doubled again to 16,021 by 1990. But with I-95 slicing away to the south in a new direction, Hopewell Township gained only 697 residents in the decade.
The ensuing recession, however, put a new twist on attitudes.
"When the economy went sour people went looking for more ratables to help their property tax problems," said Dianne Brake, executive director of the three-county Middlesex Somerset Mercer Planning Council. Ratables are properties that have been developed and are appraised for tax purposes. Putting up new housing on undeveloped land without roads, schools and sewers ran counter to the orderly growth that encourages development where public infrastructure already exists, she explained.
Nonetheless, as the economy recovers developers are turning toward less settled areas like Hopewell and Montgomery townships, the strongholds of anti-I-95 sentiment, for construction that will feed more traffic into the congested roads of neighboring towns.
"The irony is that a place like Hopewell, which had many residents who killed I-95, is now putting in ratables along our town line that will impact our roads," said Gretel Gatterdam, a councilwoman in Lawrence Township, a community that had championed I-95. "All the ratables will be in Hopewell but the traffic will be on our streets."
Washington gave New Jersey $ 246 million in lieu of I-95 construction costs to finance a number of projects deemed necessary to help the area improve its road and build new ones. But the money has been spent and several key projects were never started, killed by local opposition.
Another new road, Route 92, planned as a bypass north of Princeton, was never built. Turnpike commissioners voted recently to proceed with designing the roadway, but residents have asked Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to block the work. An aide said she would decide what to do later this month. If the Turnpike Authority gets the go-ahead, the new highway would run between Exit 8A of the turnpike and Route 27.
For commuters who despair of seeing the day when local roads become manageable, there is always rail service running between Princeton and New York. The hitch is that obtaining a long-term parking permit at the Princeton Junction train station is like buying a season ticket for the Giants football games: the waiting list is at least two years long and some permits are passed down within families like precious precious heirlooms.
 
Other Road Choke Points
 Most motorists don't need experts to tell them the Long Island Expressway, Cross Bronx Expressway and numerous other highways, tunnels and bridges in the metropolitan area cannot handle the traffic loads placed on them. But traffic counselors for American Automobile Association clubs in the region and Port Authority planners offer insights on lesser-known major roads with chronic congestion problems that no amount of patchwork solutions will relieve for the rest of the century. Here is their dirty dozen.
 
Long Island
 
MEADOWBROOK PARKWAY : "Inadequate capacity at Northern State and Southern State interchanges."
 
SEAFORD OYSTER BAY EXPRESSWAY : "Poor interchange design at Long Island Expressway."
 
New York City
 
VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY : "Inadequate capacity and grading ... airport traffic at Belt Parkway connection."
 
BELT PARKWAY : "Substandard design and capacity ... roadway deterioration ... flooding."
 
MAJOR DEEGAN EXPRESSWAY AT CROSS BRONX : "Ramps back onto Deegan."
 
SHERIDAN PARKWAY IN THE BRONX : "Connector to Cross Bronx heads west only; must use side streets to connect with eastbound lanes."
 
New Jersey
 
ROUTES 17 AND 23 : "Bottlenecks leading to newly opened sections of I-287."
 
ROUTE 10 IN MORRIS COUNTY : "Tremendous growth of mall and commuter traffic avoiding major routes ... reduced speed limit but still can't handle volume."
 
ROUTE 206 IN SUSSEX COUNTY : "Secondary road leading to I-80 ... not designed for heavy traffic."
 
ROUTES 1 AND 9, NEWARK AREA : "What's worse -- the trucks or the traffic lights?"
 
I-287, SOMERSET AND MIDDLESEX COUNTIES : "Forget it at rush hours ... try back roads."
 
ROUTE 18, NEW BRUNSWICK : "A major route with endless malls."
 The Princeton article also misstated the route of a proposed road, Route 92. It would run between Exit 8A of the turnpike and Route 1, not Route 27.

HEADLINE: FILM;
In the Wings: A Film With Few Clothes and No Regrets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
HIGH OVER MALIBU, THE FULL MOON is so perfect it could have been installed by lighting technicians. Aloof, it casts a cool light on the seething movie scene below, a show-biz party on the patio of a preposterously vulgar beach-front mansion. The partygoers, who include a more than healthy sprinkling of leggy young women in very short, very tight spangly dresses, mill around a swimming pool. Off to one side, a Lucullan buffet table bends under the weight of 10-pound lobsters on beds of seaweed, innumerable super-shrimp, heads of broccoli and cauliflower, bunches of grapes, and mega-loaves of bread. Neon pink flamingos near a classical colonnade provide a subtle touch of class.
Paul Verhoeven, behind the camera for the first time since "Basic Instinct" in 1992, fusses over a small detail in the scene. It is a key moment in "Showgirls," a drama that ventures, untentatively, into the sex-saturated world of Las Vegas lap dancing, strip clubs and top-of-the-line topless revues. A smarmy Vegas singer, played by William Shockley, is supposed to breeze past two men in togas, Roman sandals and gilded laurel wreaths who will announce his entrance with a trumpet blast. "The left trumpet a little lower, yeah?" says Mr. Verhoeven. "Good. That looks silly enough." 
 As the scene progresses, Mr. Shockley moves toward Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley), a former stripper who has just been named the lead dancer at a Vegas hotel. "I love your songs," she tells him.
Mr. Shockley leers, leans close and whispers in her ear that he loves something about her, too. It's not her songs. The remark is flippant and breathtakingly crude. Behind the camera, the 56-year-old Mr. Verhoeven smiles delightedly. It's a good moment. It's got sex, aggression and spectacle, everything that "Showgirls" promises to deliver in copious quantities. Well, not a lot of sex, actually, all things considered.
"This is one of our decent scenes," says Mr. Verhoeven. "Of course, we have a rape inside on the second floor -- so it's never completely decent."
Never even close to decent. "Showgirls" stands a very good chance of earning an NC-17 rating, which means that the film will be off-limits to viewers under 17, and guarantees that many theaters will not show the film and many publications will not advertise it. Mr. Verhoeven's contract, moreover, does not require him to make the trims that would bring "Showgirls" back into R territory. For the first time since the ratings system was introduced in 1968, a Hollywood studio -- in this case, MGM -- is treading into adults-only terrain with its eyes wide open. If it succeeds, the film may rewrite the rules that govern Hollywood's treatment of sex on the screen. For several years, film studios have flirted madly with NC-17, only to back off at the last minute and make the cuts needed to earn an R. Just one NC-17 hit would turn attraction into love.
MGM is taking the gamble because it needs a hit, desperately. The faltering studio, which was acquired by the French bank Credit Lyonnais, its main creditor, in 1992, can point to only one box-office winner since "Thelma and Louise," last fall's surprise hit "Stargate." With "Showgirls" the potent combination of Mr. Verhoeven and the scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas -- whose last joint effort, "Basic Instinct," sold $ 352 million worth of tickets around the world -- was simply too attractive to pass up.
"WE'RE BETTING Paul will make an astonishing film," said John Calley, the president of MGM's United Artists division, which will release the film in the fall. "We made the deal knowing what we know about the film, and we will support the film that we get." Better than that, the studio is already exercising bragging rights in anticipation of a ratings board dust up. Mr. Calley said he has not seen any footage of the film.
"Showgirls" tells the story of Nomi, a tough young woman who hitchhikes to Las Vegas and finds work as a lap dancer at a strip club, a job that requires her to sit on the laps of male customers, unclothed, and "dance" a simulation of the sex act. Nomi aspires to greater things, namely to replace Cristal (Gina Gershon) as the star of a topless revue. She pursues this goal ruthlessly, at great cost to herself and her friends.
The film, with a soundtrack by Dave Stewart that will include original songs by David Bowie, Thrill Kill Cult and the artist formerly known as Prince, has already been dubbed "Fleshdance" in tribute to an earlier movie that also had a script by Mr. Eszterhas. The new film has been described as "All About Eve" minus the clothes and the wit.
The same ratings board that sent Mr. Verhoeven back to the editing room for the violence in "Robocop" (1987) and "Total Recall" (1990), who imposed cut after cut on the sex scenes in "Basic Instinct," will no doubt have many suggestions to offer after seeing "Showgirls." The film includes three lavish production numbers, one of them an S&M fantasia, all of them featuring wall-to-wall nudity. Nomi treats the hotel's entertainment director (played by Kyle MacLachlan) to a lap dance that registers high on the Richter scale, and she has a sizzling encounter with her dance teacher. As he did in "Basic Instinct," Mr. Eszterhas has thrown in a titillating touch of bisexuality, adding extra interest to the relationship between Nomi and Cristal.
Cut the more humid moments, the production numbers, the hot and heavy groping, the lesbian nibbling, and you're still left with a film in which nearly all the female characters spend most of their waking hours with no clothes on.
"There is nothing to say that this movie will be an NC-17," said Frank Marshall, a co-producer of the movie, striking a hopeful note. "It doesn't contain a lot of violence, and it doesn't contain a great deal of sex. What it does contain is a great deal of naked bodies."
Mr. Eszterhas, who dropped by the set of "Showgirls" recently and saw some of the lap dance sequences, said, "It looks like an NC-17 to me."
Normally, directors are required by contract to deliver a film with an R (for "restricted") rating, which means that viewers under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. The NC-17 rating was created in 1990 as a nicer-sounding alternative to X, which had become identified in the public mind with pornographic films.
The rating was first applied to "Henry and June," about a menage a trois involving the writer Henry Miller, which included several fairly explicit sex scenes. The film, shown in only 307 theaters, wound up earning a modest $ 11 million, a figure that still makes it the most successful NC-17 so far. Other films rated NC-17 were "Romper Stomper" (sex and violence), "Bad Lieutenant" (ditto) and "Wide Sargasso Sea" (sex, including frontal male nudity). Two recent films, "You So Crazy" and "Clerks," earned their NC-17's by talking too much about sex -- though the rating on "Clerks" was reduced to an R on appeal.
The rating has serious economic consequences for film companies. Some theater chains will not show an NC-17, and most theaters in malls are forbidden by contract with mall owners to show such movies. With fewer viewing outlets, a film's chances of turning a profit are narrowed. Moreover, Blockbuster Video, Kmart and Walmart, which account for more than half of the video sales in the United States, will not handle NC-17 titles.
MR. VERHOEVEN, however, refused to make "Showgirls" without retaining complete creative control. And after three box-office smashes in a row, culminating in "Basic Instinct," he was in a position to get what he asked for.
"When I first read the script, I told Joe I wouldn't consider it unless we found a film company that would give the O.K.," he said during a late-night break in shooting. "I didn't want to go through the 'Basic Instinct' experience, going back to the M.P.A.A. 300 times. I would have to continually compromise every scene."
To make "Showgirls," and bring down the costs for the film, which has a budget of $ 35 million, Mr. Verhoeven agreed to defer 70 percent of his $ 6 million director's salary until the movie turns a profit. (Mr. Eszterhas, who will also be a producer on the film, has already been paid $ 3.2 million for writing the script.)
Mr. Marshall said the film can still succeed with an NC-17 rating but it will face an uphill climb. "Basic Instinct" took in $ 15 million in its first weekend. Assuming the same level of consumer demand, "Showgirls" with an NC-17 rating would probably take in only $ 8 million, because of the limited availability of theaters, Mr. Marshall estimated.
"In some ways, it's uncharted territory," said Gerry Rich, the executive vice president for worldwide marketing of MGM/United Artists, who will oversee the advertising campaign for the film. But he also said that the studios' fear of NC-17 may be outdated and that enough theater chains and advertising outlets are available to make a commercial release possible.
"If you go to the networks and the stations, the regulations are not set in stone," he said. "There are certain restrictions -- for example, commercials for an R film have to run after 9 o'clock, and those may be more stringent for NC-17. But there are a plethora of options, and we are not as reliant on the networks as 10 years ago. We wouldn't have gone into this if we felt it was impossible to release an NC-17 in a commercial manner."
Mr. Verhoeven, meanwhile, presses on, seemingly indifferent to the gathering storm. "I'm not a crusader," he said. "I'm too amoral to care. And it's not to shock. I just don't want to shock myself by cutting my film."
As Mr. Verhoeven tells it, he was instantly attracted to the project, which gives him free rein to indulge a highly developed taste for spectacle, color and excess.
"The artistic interest for me is extravagance as a style; otherwise it's just extravagance," he said. "I want to tell a story using this excessive visual style. And Las Vegas is excessive in every respect."
Ms. Gershon, who makes her entrance in the film emerging from an exploding volcano, said: "Paul goes to the edge, and honestly, I think that's the only way to do this movie. I do feel that it's a really interesting world that's worthy of depiction."
Mr. Verhoeven is an odd fish, a European intellectual with an untamed appetite for the cinematic equivalent of red meat. Growing up in the Netherlands, he feasted on action-packed Hollywood fare. Although he holds a doctorate in mathematics and physics and used to be infatuated with French New Wave and the films of Fellini, he tends to invoke as models "Ben-Hur" or "Gone With the Wind," films that grab viewers viscerally and pull them right into the screen.
"The chariot scene in 'Ben-Hur' is one of the best ever shot and edited," he said. "For 10 minutes, with no music, there is nothing but bumpa-bumpa-bumpa." He worked his arms up and down like pistons, acting out the pounding of horse hooves.
Mr. Verhoeven is also capable of spending 15 minutes analyzing the subtle deployment of actors' bodies in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" when explaining his finickiness in shooting Mr. Shockley's entrance onto the patio.
So, the Verhoeven approach: technical finesse, earthy tastes, a lurid imagination and a zest for putting the "big" back in "big screen." Plus a genuinely subversive streak, evident in the satiric touches in "Robocop" or the kinky plot turns of "The Fourth Man," his last Dutch film, whose gay protagonist pursues Renee Soutendijk in the hope of reaching her not-too-bright but well-muscled boyfriend.
Viewers of "Basic Instinct," by the way, might find something familiar in Ms. Soutendijk's performance as an ice-cold blonde with a very scary pair of scissors. They might also be surprised to know that Mr. Verhoeven's films include historical dramas about a poor family in 19th-century Amsterdam ("Keetje Tippel") and Dutch resistance fighters during World War II ("Soldier of Orange"), a swashbuckler set in 16th-century Europe ("Flesh and Blood") and a gritty look at a Dutch motorcycle gang ("Spetters"). In "The Fourth Man," Mr. Verhoeven created a new genre, the psychosexual religious thriller.
"In my mind -- and Paul and I have had a real Sturm und Drang relationship -- he is the most viscerally exciting director in the world," said Mr. Eszterhas. "He takes chances. He doesn't go with the formula. Most Hollywood directors are gutless, but he has guts."
It is therefore plausible when Mr. Verhoeven, who seems to be game for anything, says he took on "Showgirls" for the simple reason that he always wanted to direct a movie with singing and dancing. For a tantalizing year or so, it looked as if he was set to direct Arnold Schwarzenegger in a big-budget epic, "The Crusades," but the bigness of the budget -- at around $ 100 million, more than enough money to have financed the real crusades -- has put the project on hold.
"Showgirls," which Mr. Verhoeven had begun developing with Mr. Eszterhas even before the script was written, suddenly moved up to the front burner, just in time to rescue Mr. Verhoeven from doing a remake of "Moby-Dick." It was a close call. "Big whales," he said, wincing. "No, thank you. Shooting would be a nightmare."
Lose the whale. And bring on the dancing girls.
Even if the ratings board doesn't pounce, Mr. Verhoeven's stylistic study in excess may earn him and Mr. Eszterhas another round with some of the same groups that attacked "Basic Instinct" as a cheesy exercise in exploitation. Mr. Verhoeven shrugged off the critics, but Mr. Eszterhas, badly rattled, tried to change his own script to defuse the accusation that he had linked bisexuality and homicidal tendencies in an unseemly way. The attempted rewrite led to a bitter public argument between the two men.
This time, Mr. Eszterhas is talking a tougher line. "In the 90's especially, clubs featuring lap dancing are very successful across the country," he said. "That is an interesting phenomenon, one that is worth exploring artistically.
"Frankly, I'm tired of people looking at books or movies within the narrow politically correct confines. We are not saying all women are lap dancers, or that all lap dancers behave the way they do in this picture. If it means we are going to take certain political groups on, Paul and I are ready for it."
Ms. Gershon points out that her character and the one portrayed by Ms. Berkley (familiar to viewers of the television series "Saved by the Bell" as the goody-two-shoes overachiever Jesse) are tough, independent-minded women who play by their own rules. They just happen to play with no clothes on. Where's the problem? "When you go to see a Las Vegas show, you're not going to see people dancing in mumus," she said. "People will just have to accept that."

RICH RELATIONS
The American Occupation
of Britain, 1942-1945.
By David Reynolds.
Illustrated. 555 pp. New York:
Random House. $30. 
"IT is difficult to go anywhere in London without having the feeling that Britain is now Occupied Territory," George Orwell wrote in 1943. There have been other books about the impact of some three million American troops on Britain in 1942-45, but they have been based on reminiscences. David Reynolds, a fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, uses recollections, interviews and memoirs for "Rich Relations," but he has also made immense use of archival material in Britain and the United States, most of it hitherto neglected. He deals not only with the soldiers and the British man in the street, but also with British and American high politics and strategy, especially with the relations between Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt and between top generals on both sides. This is international history in the broadest sense, embracing power and culture, policy and society, high politics as well as "real life," to provide an illuminating account of what the "occupation" meant to ordinary people.
"Rich Relations" is impressive in its authority and scope, yet very readable -- a remarkable feat. Many of the quotations are amusing, the comments witty but warm. It is hard to imagine a more comprehensive look at this extremely interesting and important subject, and it is not surprising to learn that Mr. Reynolds has been working on it for 13 years.
Nobody -- well, hardly anybody -- wanted the G.I.'s in Britain. That certainly included the majority of soldiers themselves, who were largely conscripts. Their parents did not want their sons, or daughters, sent into a war zone. Nor did Roosevelt; it might well lead to defeat in the next election. His Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, was only too aware of the complex political and social problems the occupation would create. The G.I.'s hated the damp, dreariness, cold and mud of life in huts in winter on Salisbury Plain; they hated the "class" in their own Army that required them to salute their own officers, and initially many of them found British civilians cold and standoffish.
Only two groups of Americans relished being in Britain: a few top generals, who saw prospects of swift promotion in being overseas and feuded enthusiastically to get it, and the black soldiers, who, in spite of the occupation's de facto segregationist policy, found themselves better treated in Britain than they could ever have thought possible in their own country. Most British people didn't want an American occupation, either. In principle, yes; they sensed what the British Chiefs of Staff told the War Cabinet in May 1940 -- that without "full economic and financial support" from America, "we do not think we could continue the war with any chance of success" -- and they saw that such support would entail an occupation. But, in practice, the presence of the Americans brought many irritations, the main ones conveyed by that old crack: the Yanks were "oversexed, overpaid, overfed and over here."
The American was paid about three times as much as the British private. The differential also affected relations between G.I.'s and civilians; when thousands of British men were serving overseas, many of the sweethearts and wives they left behind were susceptible to American spending power. Even the difference in uniform caused problems. Off duty in a pub or on the dance floor, the British soldier wore battle dress and black hobnailed boots, quite different from his officer's service dress; but off duty the American in his service dress and rubber-soled brown shoes was almost indistinguishable from his officer -- at any rate, to many British women.
The main complaint of the British civilian from 1942 to 1944 was the amount of time the Yanks spent hanging around in Britain apparently doing nothing. Would they ever fight? Could they? Britons living near airfields knew that the Americans were doing plenty, of course, flying B-17's and B-24's in almost nonstop shifts to bomb German military and industrial plants, and suffering appalling casualties. D-Day changed everything. Almost overnight the British people became aware that the Americans could fight, that they had played the major role in the success, and suffering, of the invasion of France. Well before the end of the war in Europe, Mr. Reynolds says, the British people knew that "victory in the West was overwhelmingly an American triumph."
IN his opinion, there are at least several ways "in which the American occupation worked with other prewar, wartime and postwar trends to shape or sharpen British images of the United States." What was foremost, he says, was "the impression of American wealth." Few Britons, he points out, realized that most G.I.'s were having a far better life in the wartime Army than they had lived only a short time before in the years of the Depression. General Marshall believed that it was essential for morale to "coddle" soldiers who, in Mr. Reynolds's words, had been "sent far from home for a somewhat nebulous cause." Mr. Reynolds believes that the sight of the Americans enjoying their abundance confirmed the "glittering movie images" Britons had absorbed before the war. He maintains that it promoted in the British a sense of what came to be known as "consumerism . . . the endless production of goods and labor-saving devices, with demand encouraged by advertising," though the British had to put up with many years of austerity after the war before they could indulge their new acquired appetite for that.
Culturally, he says, "the G.I.'s -- jitterbugging and gum-chewing -- accentuated a trend that began during the Jazz Age of the 1920's and continued on via the gyrations of Elvis Presley to the present day." Finally, the British were made aware as never before of American might -- "the truly awesome sight of American power wending its way down to the ports of southern England; the news coming back from Normandy and the Ardennes to show that G.I.'s were real soldiers; the growing evidence . . . that America was the dominant partner in the alliance."
As for the G.I.'s, they had learned what it was to be comparatively wealthy and how much they owed that to being American. They returned home from bomb damage everywhere to a homeland booming with high employment. They were aware of America's power and prestige as never before. They shared a general superiority complex. Citing a 1945 poll of American servicemen reported in the Harvard Educational Review, Mr. Reynolds says, "Contrary to the hopes of publicists, war service abroad 'had not after all provided an education in internationalism.' " In fact, he concludes, "one might hazard the view that they returned even more American than when they departed."

HEADLINE: Small Businesses, Global Markets

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AS a partner in a small but expanding manufacturing business, Herbert Schwartz sometimes sweeps the floors, makes the morning coffee for his 20 employees and answers the phones. At the same time, he monitors the fortunes of the peso's rise and fall in Mexico, keeps close tabs on politics in the former Soviet republics and stays abreast of the latest trade policies in India -- countries where the engineer-turned-businessman markets temperature-resistant, ceramic-based products.
Aremco, Mr. Schwartz's Ossining-based firm, sells adhesives used in assembling everything from B-2 Stealth bombers and women's hair dryers to factory equipment in developing markets. One of the products, called Pyro-Putty -- a glue that can be used to repair steel machinery and car manifolds -- has become a hot-ticket item in recent years at automotive centers throughout the world, especially in countries where replacement parts for older vehicles are not available. 
 His business is typical of many other small and medium-size companies in Westchester that increasingly are marketing products and services worldwide. "Global is the big word today for us," Mr. Schwartz said, explaining that 25 percent of his business last year was exports -- up from just 8 percent several years ago.
Global is also the latest buzzword among large corporations in Westchester, like Reader's Digest in Pleasantville, where the first Polish edition of the magazine is about to be published.
During a speech last month to the World Trade Council of Westchester, a subsidiary business organization of the Westchester County Association, James P. Schadt, president and chief executive officer of the Reader's Digest Association, the parent of all Digest business, said the company's mission was to become "a truly global operator."
After the fall of the Berlin wall, the company began distributing its magazine in East Germany, and in 1991, it entered Hungary and Russia. Two years later, it was circulating Reader's Digest in the Czech Republic.
Mr. Schadt said that the Polish edition, to begin in May, is expected to expand his company's international operations, which account for more than 50 percent of its $3 billion in sales. Reader's Digest now publishes in 17 languages to 100 million readers worldwide.
Joel W. Barkan, New York district director for the United States Department of Commerce, said: "It's a small world after all. You can't travel the globe now without finding a Bayer aspirin in the medicine cabinet or a Pepsi or Coke in the refrigerator." He continued: "Not too many years ago it was esoteric to expand even to Chicago or Harrisburg, especially for small and medium-size companies. In the 1990's, expansion means foreign markets, especially as the domestic ones become saturated."
In response to the growth of international trade in Westchester, the Commerce Department is opening an export assistance center next month in White Plains, which will be staffed by a full-time world trade specialist to help businesses find markets and obtain financing, Mr. Barkan said.
He said the strongest emerging markets for domestic businesses include Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Chile in Latin America and Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea in the Pacific Rim.
At Citibank in Manhattan, Aftab Ahmed, director for trade, finance and global products, also cited Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Ivory Coast and Eastern Europe as key export destinations for many New York area businesses.
In its last fiscal year, which ended in July, Reader's Digest as an example reported $396 million in sales in its Pacific Rim destinations, including Australia, India, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong and Japan. It also reported during that period $1.3 billion in European sales.
At Aremco, which is privately owned, Mr. Schwartz would not release sales figures, but he said some of his strongest markets were Japan, Poland, Israel and Greece. He said his business also sells products to former Iron Curtain countries in addition to Poland where temperature-resistance glues are being used to repair deteriorating power plants and factories, and to India.
For most businesses, though, the former Soviet republics continue to be "tough markets," Mr. Barkan said, because their infrastructure -- transportation, roads, legal services, telephone systems and banks -- are poorly developed.
"It's O.K. for a large multinational company like Pepsico to get involved," Mr. Barkan said, "but for a small-to-medium company, it's still rough. They have to be able to move goods from Point A to Point B, make a telephone call or make sure a contract is enforceable."
Pepsi-Cola International, headquartered in Somers, maintains a staff of 75 people in its Moscow office and oversees 19 franchised Pepsi plants, which are locally operated and managed throughout Russia.
Mr. Barkan credited passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement with accelerating the pace of expansion globally and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with setting trade standards that are enforceable through the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
He also said the devaluation of the peso would prove to be only "a temporary setback" and that Mexico would "become more like the 51st state than a foreign country."
The following types of companies are faring best in the international market place, said Stephen Koller, director of the international division of the New York State Department of Economic Development: food-processing firms, manufacturers of medical equipment, imaging and optical companies, small electronics parts manufacturers and suppliers of telecommunications equipment and services.
The owner of one manufacturing company, Kings Electronics in Tuckahoe, reported, however, that business was down from 10 years ago because of new foreign competition, especially in Europe. Leon Fassler, vice chairman of the company, said he was turning to new markets in Canada, Latin America and the Pacific Rim to market coaxial and triaxial connecters and related products used in communications systems and for broadcasting.
Also, manufacturers of auto parts, printers and publishers, financial service providers and software developers are finding strong international markets, Mr. Koller said, adding that the growth of many international businesses has been spurred by advances in telecommunications, which allows them to communicate easily with companies overseas.
In White Plains, for example, Dr. Alan Teck, an international economist, edits three publications on global trade from a home office, surrounded by computers and fax machines, which keep him abreast of the latest world market developments. Teck Enterprises' publications include The Financial Times Currency Forecaster and The Financial Times Global Investor.
But the shifting political scene in Eastern Europe and the reduction of tensions in the region, while a boon to some businesses, has meant less trade for others.
Jan R. Endresen, president of the family-owned Aerotech World Trade Corporation of White Plains, said the fall of the Berlin wall signaled the beginning of a slowdown for his company, which distributes aviation parts and equipment for commercial and military applications.
"We watch the politics all over the world very carefully," Mr. Endresen said. "Conflicts are good for businesses." Also, he said, the company has been affected by "the huge shakeout in the airlines industry" in the United States and Europe. In addition to expanding markets for his company in the Far East, Mr. Endresen said, the company was expanding into telecommunications, electronics and fiber optics to compensate for its other losses.
In response to increased activity abroad by local companies, banks reported that they were providing new services to help businesses negotiate in foreign markets.
James B. Joyce, president of the Westchester-Putnam division of the Bank of New York, said there were more than 100 commercial customers in Westchester doing business overseas -- about a 20 percent increase in the last several years. The bank provides letters of credit and loan and collection services and helps customers "navigate through the maze" of international business, Mr. Joyce said. "A lot of our job is educating companies about how international business is done."

A Song for Products Long Unsung

BYLINE: By PAUL LUKAS; Paul Lukas is the editor of Beer Frame: The Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption and a columnist for New York Press. This article is adapted from material that originally appeared in those publications.

 BODY:
GRUMBLE, grumble, grumble. Everyone complains about bad products, and often this criticism is richly deserved. But far too many praiseworthy products are unjustly ignored. It is time to redress the balance.
 
* Why the Shoe Fits. How many of us have taken a moment to appreciate the Brannock Device? This is the gizmo, invented decades ago by one Charles F. Brannock, that measures your shoe size. A workaday function, sure, but its chrome-and-black metal design, sliding parts and remarkably balanced asymmetry (much like the human foot itself), combine perfectly the industrial and the aesthetic. 

* Marlin Perkins and More. The mere mention of Barnum's Animal Crackers sends Shirley Temple's prepubescent voice warbling through my brain. But despite such annoyances, Animal Crackers always deliver the goods. The simplicity of shortbread, the kick of creating animal amputees and decapitatees as you eat -- who could ask for more?
True, these Nabisco products are not perfect. For example, the Animal Crackers menagerie includes a black panther, a leopard and a tiger, three felines that look distinct enough on the box but are virtually indistinguishable in cookie form. Just try to tell which is which when you're sitting in a dark bar, washing down your Animal Crackers with a 75-cent short beer.
Such minor quibbles, however, are no match for the feature that sets Animal Crackers head and shoulders above such snacks as Cracker Jack and Gummy Bears. I refer, of course, to the very satisfying string handle attached to each box.
The string was not part of the original 1902 package; it was added later that year to encourage consumers to hang the boxes from Christmas trees. While this marketing angle seems far-fetched to me, the string is charming, soft and 100 percent cotton. And if you remove it from the box and make a miniature lasso, you can even play Marlin Perkins with your Animal Crackers, which goes to show that interactive media are not limited to the Internet.
 
* Chutes and Letters. Mail chutes bring a bit of fun to even the dreariest high-rise, and the key is that they are transparent. Cutler Mailing Systems of Rochester might have made the whole chute out of steel or aluminum. Then, when you dropped your letter in the slot, that would be the last you'd see of it, the same as with a normal letter box. Big deal. But during those few moments when I see my letters begin their trip down the chute from the 39th floor, I can appreciate the magic of the postal system and, of course, worry that my letter will somehow get stuck on the 17th floor.
 
* Peddlers and Poker. Or consider the McGill High-Speed Changer, invented in the 1930's and distributed today by the J. M. Galef Company of New York. I first noticed this sturdy change-making device on a Good Humor man's belt in 1969. He just pressed the little levers and out came a seemingly endless supply of coins. As a 5-year-old with no concept of money, I found the light-industrial sound -- ka-chunk, ka-chunk -- even more satisfying than the coins themselves. So I dubbed the device a ka-chunker.
Today I have my own ka-chunker, a used one. How much money has ka-chunked its way through this object, I wonder. Was it used by a Good Humor man? And when did the pennies rack fall into disuse? It surely must have, once peddled products fell under the pricing tyranny of five cent increments.
Also, the ka-chunker is an unbeatable accessory for low-stakes poker ("I'll see your 50 cents" -- ka-chunk, ka-chunk -- "and raise you 75" -- ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk). And in an economy ruled by electronic fund transfers and credit cards, the ka-chunker reminds us that cash isn't just liquid, but also solid.

HEADLINE: Toy Fair Is Facing Challenges

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
On its sparkly, fun-loving surface, at least, all is well and business is booming at the American International Toy Fair, which opens today in Manhattan.
The venerable trade show, with its festival of news releases and celebrity-party invitations, has signed up more exhibitors this year, 1,640, than last year to hawk their Barbies and Power Rangers and Matchbox Lamborghinis. 
 Indeed, in its 61st year in Manhattan, the toy fair is expecting 20,000 buyers from 30 countries, just as many as last year. And its exhibition space in the Jacob K. Javits Center was booked solid by November, with a waiting list of 300.
Yet today, as fairgoers -- the public is not invited -- jam the famously overcrowded elevators in the Toy Center at Fifth Avenue and 23d Street before heading to exhibits in the Javits Center later this week, the toy fair is facing worrisome new challenges. Industry executives and experts say the New York toy fair is in danger of having its scope and influence sharply reduced in the future.
One problem, they say, is the relatively small size and high costs of the Javits Center, compared with show halls in other cities. An even bigger problem, they agree, is the fundamental evolution in retailing patterns in the $18 billion United States toy industry -- where many toy orders are placed well before the toy fair offers itself as a showcase. This trend may have already discouraged the participation of Hasbro, America's second-largest toy company after Mattel Inc.
"The potential is that we may not show in New York next year," said Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro, which has three showrooms in and near the Manhattan Toy Center. "The publicity and high profile may not be enough for the expense."
He said the company, which was surpassed by Mattel in sales last year, for the first time since 1985, would "save in the millions" if it left the toy center. "Toy Fair is becoming less important, except as a showcase, because by this time the major retailers, and even nonmajors, have already had two or three looks at our line," he said.
Yet another challenge comes from the little-noted but fast expansion of an upstart, the Dallas International Toy Import Show held in the Dallas Market Center in January. That show has the potential to siphon off important elements of the New York toy fair in future years, some industry executives say.
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development in New York, calls the Dallas show "a serious competitor that is trying to lure our toy industry." In an interview last week, he said of the New York fair's exhibitors and buyers, "We hope that they won't take too seriously Dallas's siren song."
Any diminishment of the New York fair would be a blow to more than just the prestige of New York City, which derives $175 million of economic benefit from the trade show, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Beyond the revenue-generating year-round presence of the toy center, the toy fair itself accounts for 50,000 room-nights in hotels and helps fill restaurants, taxis and department stores. Thousands of display builders, designers and other vendors get work, as well as 1,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild who are hired as toy demonstrators.
The New York toy fair "is very healthy, and certainly we are committed to New York for the moment," said David A. Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group of 235 toy manufacturers and importers that sponsors the show. "But in 1998 and 1999, we would have to study whether Toy Fair is still the most efficient way to do our job."
The New York fair has long been the industry's annual carnival, showroom and high-stakes crap shoot, in which buyers traditionally place their bets on new products. In the old days, the fair was the equivalent of opening night for many a toy and toy line.
"But all of the major companies show their product lines more than six months before Toy Fair," said Sean P. McGowan, a toy industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company. "No new major categories are unveiled at Toy Fair."
"Toys 'R' Us and the other mass retailers want the opportunity to get in early and be part of the new introductions," he added. "For the large companies, Toy Fair is more about showing toys to the press and to Wall Street and their smaller customers."
Michael Goldstein, chief executive of Toys "R" Us, said his buyers spent "considerable" time at the toy exhibitions in the Javits Center. "But we are buying all year round," he said, "and we're not using the New York toy fair to get down orders. For us it's not an order-writing time."
Mattel remains loyal to the fair. "We have no plans to change our commitment to Toy Fair in New York," said Glenn Bozarth, a company spokesman. "The New York toy fair continues to be the major toy venue. For buyers and Wall Street, New York is the one time of year when all eyes are on the toy industry."
But that unqualified enthusiasm is hardly universal, in part because of the Dallas show. Frank Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings magazine, a monthly trade publication, said a lot of the major retailers were doing "serious buying" in Dallas, adding, "I think Dallas is definitely going to be a factor this year."
In Dallas, where the toy show ran from Jan. 19 to 27, "the reaction to our show has been phenomenal and our impression is that we will expand," said Bill Winsor, the chief executive of the Dallas Market Center, which has 850,000 square feet of exhibition space, in contrast to 770,000 at the Javits Center.
The show takes advantage of the Dallas Market Center's status as a free-trade zone, allowing exhibitors to bring in showroom samples through United States Customs without paying import duty.
Mr. Winsor said 300 foreign manufacturing companies attended last month. Toys "R" Us, the only retailer participating during the show's first two years, was joined this year by 85 others, including Target, Sears, Caldor and Bradlees. Mr. Winsor said manufacturers including Hasbro, Tyco and Mattel's Fisher-Price unit have rented permanent toy showrooms in the market center.
The Dallas event is a letter-of-credit show that gives domestic manufacturers a price break with producers in Hong Kong, Shanghai and other foreign ports if they can buy in advance, without the need for Toy Fair.
Mr. Winsor was diplomatic when asked if the Dallas show was trying to supplant New York's. "The toy fair fulfills a very important purpose," Mr. Winsor said of the New York event. "But what's happened is that there has been a migration of major buyers from it. And that handful of buyers is controlling 80 percent of the market."
Mr. Goldstein of Toys "R" Us, the most important toy buyer worldwide, said of the Dallas show: "It's not comprehensive like the show in New York. The major manufacturers only show lines related to their importing divisions."
Mr. Miller of the Toy Manufacturers of America said that while some people in the industry "would like to see Dallas as a substitute for the show in New York, it's a great leap in the imagination to take it that far." Dallas is a specialty show, he added, and, unlike the New York show, has "no sizzle."
"A number of our members who exhibit there have said that this trend is the way it's going to go," Mr. Miller said. "It will possibly become more important, and if it does, then we'd get involved because our members would want us to," he said. The Toy Manufacturers of America was invited to be a sponsor of the Dallas show this year, Mr. Miller said, but declined.
In the short run, Mr. Miller foresees little change. "But in 1998, who knows, maybe things will be different," he said. "We're doing a major study of our toy fair, and we'll try to chart a course that will keep this fair viable."
Deputy Mayor Dyson said New York was working hard not to lose the toy fair. The Giuliani administration has already offered assistance to the trade show, he said, and has arranged for extra police help.
He spoke proudly of the reduction in the combined city and state hotel occupancy tax to 15.25 percent from 21.25 percent (in Dallas, the comparable tax is 13 percent). And, in a plea to the fair's visitors, Mr. Dyson said: "Give us a little more time to turn the place around. We're trying to lower the cost of doing business here, and to address the quality-of-life issues, making the streets still safer and cleaner and freer of graffiti and the other things that detract from people's enjoyment of the city of New York."
For many toy exhibitors, the conditions of concern are not the world outside but the crystalline spaces of the Javits Center. Many toy industry executives, who insisted on anonymity, complained about the center's limitations, citing problems that have plagued the hall since its 1986 opening, including limited space, high costs and wasteful labor rules.
"If Javits were twice the size, it could handle any trade show in the United States," Mr. Miller said. Last spring, Fabian G. Palomino, former president of the center, which is a state authority, proposed that the center's floor space be doubled. But after the defeat of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Palomino stepped down and plans are on hold until a replacement is named.
Mr. Dyson said he sympathized with critics of the Javits Center, adding that exhibition costs were 50 percent higher than in the McCormick Center in Chicago and that the cost of labor "is 280 percent higher than at the McCormick Center, as a result of archaic work rules and too much continuing mob influence in what goes on at the Javits Center."
Mr. Dyson said the Guiliani administration "would like the Governor to give us control of the Javits Center so we can do what we did with the Fulton Fish Market, so we can put in management reforms that will make it competitive with convention centers in other cities."

HEADLINE: A Son Sees Reflection in the Water;
Kennedy Scion Shuns Public Office for Beloved Reservoirs

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Feb. 12

 BODY:
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. walked into Andrew Cuomo's bachelor party in June 1990, his eye was drawn to the bar: there, sitting alone on a stool, was the groom's father, then the Governor of New York.
But rather than just exchange pleasantries, Mr. Kennedy was seized by an urge to buttonhole Mario Cuomo about his pet concern, New York City's giant watershed. And so he did, for the better part of an hour. 
 "Nobody else was talking to him," Mr. Kennedy recalled. "So I made him sit and listen to me."
Bobby Kennedy Jr. has been making a lot of people listen to him these days, even though he has not followed the political path taken by his older brother, Joseph Kennedy, a Congressman from Massachusetts, and his older sister, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the recently elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland.
Instead, the third of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children has carved a less conventional niche, becoming a zealous advocate for the protection of the upstate reservoirs that provide New York City with its drinking water. Over the last decade, he has developed a reputation as a bit of a nuisance when it comes to making his point.
He has done so using a combination of tools: his extensive contacts, a law degree, an intimate understanding of the environment and, of course, his name.
"I have enough friends and family who are in the House and Senate," he said, "so if I want legislation, I have the access."
His role has become increasingly high profile in recent months, as New York City has come under pressure from Federal officials to devise a better way to keep its reservoirs clean or face an order from the Environmental Protection Agency to build a huge filtration plant that could cost $4 billion to $8 billion.
While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, like his predecessors, has been eager to avoid the costs of filtration, the alternatives he is pursuing -- buying land that abuts the reservoirs and restricting development within the 2,000-square-mile watershed -- have met resistance in the Catskill communities that rely on the area for their livelihood.
But if there is one thing on which the city and the Catskill towns can agree, it is that Mr. Kennedy, 41, has been a thorn in their side. Although he agrees with city officials that a multibillion-dollar filtration system can and should be avoided, he has chided the city for "stalling" in its commitment to buy tens of thousands of acres of Catskill land as a buffer around the reservoirs. (City Department of Environmental Protection officials say that the delay has come at the state level, not theirs.)
Mr. Kennedy has also labeled as "weak" a series of proposed watershed regulations that the city drafted recently, with Catskill advice, including measures that would allow treated sewage to continue to flow into the reservoirs.
Mr. Kennedy has been willing to resort to radical tactics to state his case: in the fall of 1993, he oversaw the creation of a public service campaign that speculated about how much of Amy Fisher's urine was seeping into a city reservoir from the sewage of the nearby Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, where she was an inmate. At the urging of the Dinkins Administration, which was in the midst of a re-election campaign, Mr. Kennedy never ran the ads. But he said the incident caught Mr. Dinkins' attention and won Mr. Kennedy a two-hour talk with the then Mayor.
This spring, he plans to turn up the heat on the Giuliani administration and the Catskills by filing nearly 40 lawsuits on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper, an environmental watchdog group that employs him as a lawyer. His targets: nursing homes, schools, hospitals and others within the watershed that, he has charged, have been pumping untreated sewage into the reservoirs without penalty from the city.
"We're doing something Marilyn Gelber ought to be doing," he said, referring to the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection.
His aggressiveness has brought results in the past. His first target, in 1985, was a dank seven-mile creek in Newburgh, N.Y. He put together a list of all the polluters simply by walking the creek, end to end, then filed two dozen lawsuits against various businesses and agencies that had been dumping waste there. His actions drew the attention of the Department of Environmental Conservation and led to the clean-up of the brook, said Judith Ferry, a D.E.C. lawyer who worked on the case.
"He was the genesis of this happening," Ms. Ferry said.
Four years later, he successfully sued New York City to stop it from adding Hudson River water laden with chlorine and alum sludge to the dwindling West Branch reservoir because, he maintained, the chemicals were polluting the drinking water.
"He is relentless," said Albert F. Appleton, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection in the Dinkins administration. "He is very dedicated to his goals, always keeps coming at you and is not easily put off."
But his bearing has not prevented him from collecting his share of detractors, including Ms. Gelber, who said she admires his "passion" but not his resistance to compromise. "Intellectually, I think his arguments are often good and provocative," the Commissioner said. "However, as a practical matter, he is not a consensus builder. He is not someone who wants to see more than one side of an issue."
Numerous Catskill residents and developers agree. To them, his call for tighter regulations within the watershed threatens the economic growth of their region.
"I characterize him as a carpetbagger," said Orville A. Slutzky, whose family-operated ski resort, Hunter Mountain, sits within the watershed. "Let me get Webster's dictionary because I never remember to quote it right: a nonresident who meddles in politics."
But Mr. Kennedy, who lives within the watershed in the Westchester community of Bedford, remains unfazed. Indeed, he has not ruled out a run for office some day. For now, however, he says he remains content with his work, which has included environmental advocacy expeditions to British Columbia and Latin America on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"Until I get some sign to do something else," he said, "I'll keep doing this."
Mr. Kennedy, who is also a professor of environmental law at Pace University in White Plains, says he regards his name as "a gift," one that he has not hesitated to use to open doors at places like the E.P.A. He also has a presence that is, to some, evocative of his father, who was assassinated in 1968 while seeking the Democratic nomination for President. Senator Edward M. Kennedy sees the likeness in his nephew's "piercing eyes," which he describes as "somewhat sad.'
As a child, Mr. Kennedy wanted to become a veterinarian. But that ambition was sidetracked at age 14, when his father was killed. Feeling an obligation to "pick up" where his father "left off," he attended Harvard, graduating with a degree in history and literature in 1977, and the University of Virginia, where he earned a law degree in 1982.
After marrying a fellow law student, Emily Black, he briefly worked as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, a job he had left by early 1983. And then his personal problems became national news. In September of that year Mr. Kennedy was arrested in Rapid City, S.D., and charged with possessing two-tenths of a gram of heroin. His photograph was on the cover of People magazine.
He had, he said at the time, traveled to South Dakota to seek help for drug dependency. In February 1984, after completing a five-month treatment program, Mr. Kennedy pleaded guilty to the heroin charge and was sentenced to 800 hours of community service. Asked recently what he had learned, Mr. Kennedy declined to answer.
"That's not something I want to talk about with the press," he said. "I have other places where I talk about that." But in an earlier conversation, he described 1984 as the year he "reevaluated" his life, deciding: "I was going to do what I wanted to do."
Mr. Kennedy said that his love for nature had begun early. His curiosity, according to his mother, was apparent as early as at 6 months old, when a beetle flew into his playpen on the patio at Hickory Hill, the family homestead in Virginia.
"He was creeping toward it, trying to check it out," Mrs. Kennedy recalled. "I just thought, wow, most kids would have been trying to get away from it."
Soon, he was rounding up snakes, raccoons and rats as pets, and accompanying his father on hikes in the Olympic Mountains with Justice William O. Douglas and on whitewater rafting trips with John Glenn.
And then there are his hawks. Mr. Kennedy received his first pet hawk from his father when he was 12, and has kept a succession of them since. To see him run through the woods following his hawk, Kucheen, as she pursues a squirrel is to see the ordinarily reserved Mr. Kennedy at his most animated.
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!" he shouted on a recent Saturday, alerting the brown and gray bird to a nest in a walnut tree. "See how smart she is," Mr. Kennedy said, beaming. "She sat on that dray and drove out four squirrels."
Asked if falconry was an appropriate pastime for an environmentalist, Mr. Kennedy responded that not all environmentalists were animal rights activists. "You're not really interfering with what they would be doing if you weren't there," he said. "They're letting you come with them on a hunt."
Mr. Kennedy believes that the wilderness should be kept pollution-free for the benefit of people.
"We are not protecting the environment for the fishes and the birds," he said. "We're protecting it for the sake of humanity."
To that end, Mr. Kennedy approached John Adams, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who hired him in 1984 to set up an advocacy center in Garrison, N.Y. Soon after, he met John Cronin, the head of the Riverkeeper organization, and he has been drafting environmental lawsuits for both organizations since.
Mr. Kennedy has a son, Bobby, 10, and a daughter, Kathleen, 6, both with Ms. Black, from whom he was divorced last spring. He has since married Mary Richardson, a Manhattan architect. They have a 5-month-old son, Conor.
Mr. Kennedy realizes that comparisons with his father are inevitable. He is approaching 42, the age his father died. By 42 his father had served as Attorney General and as a United States Senator.
"I'm proud of what my father and uncles did," he said. "I don't have to do what they did. I love what I do."

HEADLINE: Pakistan Officials Hope to Repair Ties With U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 12

 BODY:
After Pakistan's swift deportation of the suspected mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing, the Government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is hoping that its action will give a new impetus to Pakistan's bid to improve frayed relations with the United States.
By allowing American agents to join in a raid on a rooming house here on Tuesday that led to the capture of the suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, and by approving his return to the United States on an American military aircraft eight hours later, "Pakistan has been able to prove our cooperative and friendly attitude toward the United States," said Husain Haqqani, an aide to Ms. Bhutto and the Government's chief spokesman. 
 For decades, officials here had few reasons to worry about relations with the United States. But a combination of factors in the late 1980's put an end to the era in which Pakistan received favored treatment as Washington's most important ally in the region. Those factors included the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union, the rise of Pakistan as a major center for heroin trafficking and Islamabad's covert nuclear weapons program.
Now, the hope among top Government officials is that the case of Mr. Yousef, in which Ms. Bhutto waived procedures that could have delayed the deportation for weeks or months, will stimulate efforts by Pakistan to mend ties with Washington. With Prime Minister Bhutto due in the United States in April for her first official visit since returning to power in an election 17 months ago, Mr. Yousef's capture here came at an ideal time for the Pakistani Government.
Five days after Mr. Yousef was flown to New York, officials involved remain reluctant to speak openly about the case, partly out of a desire not to provoke radical Muslim groups that have stirred anti-American passions in the past. So far, the low-key policy appears to have succeeded, with no public demonstrations on the Yousef affair and scant coverage of it in most major newspapers, some of which relegated the story to inside pages from the start.
One top official, who discussed the case on condition that he would not be identified, said that the relative quiescence of groups like Jamaat-i-Islami, a hard-line Muslim group with seats in Parliament, reflected the reluctance of even strongly anti-American politicians and Muslim clerics here to be seen as supporting what the official described as "the worst kind of terrorist."
The official added, "Who wants to stand up and argue the case of somebody who tried to blow up a building with thousands of innocent people in it?"
But another reason for the Government's reticence has been its hope to avoid too close a review of its handling of the deportation. Setting aside procedures that had previously delayed deportation proceedings for drug traffickers and others wanted in Western countries, Ms. Bhutto approved a shortcut in which a middle-level judicial official signed the deportation order, apparently without ever seeing Mr. Yousef, and at a point when the American plane was already on stand-by for the flight to New York.
A Justice Ministry official familiar with the events said that besides Ms. Bhutto, no high-ranking Cabinet minister even knew of Mr. Yousef's arrest, which the official said had been coordinated by the United States Embassy and officials of Pakistan's military intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency. Perhaps most striking, said guests at the rooming house where Mr. Yousef was seized, American agents with handguns in holsters underneath their suit jackets were allowed to join the raiding party that stormed Mr. Yousef's second-floor room. Previous reports said he had been seized in a hotel.
By acting as she did, Ms. Bhutto was following a policy of reaching out to the United States on a broad front of issues. Since returning to power for her second stint as Prime Minister, she has abandoned the socialist legacy of her Pakistan People's Party and emphasized economic policies that rely on selling off nationalized industries and providing incentives for foreign investors, a turn that has been strongly supported in Washington.
With Clinton Administration encouragement, American energy companies have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in projects to build coal-fired power plants that are seen laying the base for new industrial growth. Under prodding from the Washington-based International Monetary Fund, the Pakistani Government has made new efforts to cut the deficit spending that has run up large international debts. It has also pledged to crack down on widespread tax evasion by wealthy Pakistanis that is said to have resulted in a shortfall of about 60 percent in Government revenues.
Of more immediate concern to Washington, Ms. Bhutto has also ordered a crackdown on some of the drug barons behind the trafficking that sends hundreds of tons of heroin to Europe and the United States each year. While deportation proceedings against seven suspected drug barons wanted by the United States have moved slowly, the Government has taken another step long sought by Washington, freezing or sealing bank accounts, properties and other assets of top traffickers and carrying out heavily armed raids in remote frontier areas to arrest other top drug figures.
These steps have been taken as the United States, under a 1990 Congressional law forbidding aid to Pakistan as long as it continues with its secret nuclear weapons program, has cut off all economic and military aid, except for programs that assist with family planning and narcotics enforcement. Although the cutoff has stanched an aid flow that was worth nearly $600 million a year in the late 1980's, Ms. Bhutto has said that there will be no abandoning of the nuclear program unless India, Pakistan's traditional enemy, does likewise.
A Foreign Ministry official said that bitterness over the aid cutoff had given way to a recognition that Pakistan has no choice but to seek the best possible relations with the United States.
"There is nowhere else to turn to," he said. "We need investment, and with our relations with India at a dead-end, we can't afford to be on the wrong side of the United States."

HEADLINE: Price Rises By Factories On Increase

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 11

 BODY:
After months of trying, the nation's manufacturing companies, in a growing number of cases, are managing to increase the prices of some of their products, although rarely by as much as they would like.
The reports of price increases were much more frequent at the winter meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, which ended today, than they had been at the fall meeting, in September. In many cases, the manufacturers passed along their higher costs for materials. But strong demand in a robust economy made the price increases possible, and the manufacturers expressed concern that the Federal Reserve, by raising interest rates, might kill off the demand. 
 "If you assume that incomes are relatively fixed, then when rates rise for car loans and mortgages, there is less money left over for discretionary spending," said William D. Marohn, president of the Whirlpool Corporation, which recently raised the prices of its appliances by 2 percent on average, the first general increase in a while.
The Fed's goal, by reducing demand and spending, is to keep the annual inflation rate from rising. It is now less than 3 percent, but if the manufacturers were to raise prices by more than 3 percent a year, that would help to pull up the inflation rate. In interviews with nearly two dozen of the 130 executives gathered here for the two-day directors' meeting, very few said their price increases exceeded the inflation rate.
Nevertheless, they seem to expect that to happen. In an informal poll, slightly more than half of the 88 executives who participated said they expected the annual inflation rate to rise this year to 3 to 4 percent, an increase they said would not lead to a major acceleration of inflation. By a two-to-one margin, they also said the Fed should hold off on any further rate increases until the economy absorbed the impact from past increases. In the interviews, a few said the impact was already evident.
"Our orders suddenly fell in January," said J. Richard Derickson, chief executive of the Hiwasse Manufacturing Company in Jacksonville, Ark., which makes aluminum trim for refrigerators and other kitchen appliances. "I am not seeing orders canceled, but they are being pushed out into the future."
In Mr. Derickson's view, the appliance manufacturers are suffering from falling sales, and that is why they are slowing their purchases from Hiwasse. The appliance manufacturers say this is not so; their business is good. Whatever the case, Mr. Derickson sought an 8 percent price increase late last year -- his first increase in four years -- to help cover the rising cost of the aluminum used in his trim.
"You would have thought I had asked for their first-born; they hollered," he said of the appliance manufacturers. He settled for 5 percent.
Tire manufacturers, beset by a similar rise in materials prices, have had better luck. Until last fall, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company's price increases had averaged less than 2 percent a year. But an increase of 3 to 4 percent in the fall and another next month of 3 to 5 percent are changing the pattern. Goodyear was the first to act, but other tire makers soon followed, and the increases have stuck.
"It would appear that we are all in the same predicament," said Stanley C. Gault, Goodyear's chairman. "There are only a few raw materials that go into tires, and they are all moving up in price."
Cooper Industries Inc., which makes numerous products, is more typical of the manufacturing experience as described in the interviews here. Prices have risen recently by 2 percent or so for its hand tools, lighting fixtures, fuses and other electrical products, says Robert Cizik, the chairman. "The business is strong, but we have to hold our market share," he said. "If we go up too much, foreign competitors will move in and then it will be a long process to get the markets back."
Cooper also makes spark plugs, competing in particular against Japanese and European manufacturers, and that has prevented any price increase. "If the auto companies don't get the prices they want they go to someone else," Mr. Cizik said. "Price increases come where there is clearly limited competition and strong demand and you don't have to deal with a lot of manufacturing capacity elsewhere in the world."

HEADLINE: Rights Group Issues Criticism Of Arafat Rule

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Human rights are in a "perilous state" under Palestinian self-rule, threatening the prospects for regional peace, the United States-based Human Rights Watch/Middle East said today.
In a 50-page report, the monitoring group accused Yasir Arafat's police force in the Gaza Strip of arbitrarily rounding up political opponents and mistreating some of them. Press freedoms have also been violated, it said, and the Palestinian Authority, which administers self-rule, has failed in its first nine months to show "a commitment to installing a rule of law." 
 The study broke little new ground, for most of its findings had already been reported by foreign news organizations. Nonetheless, it was the first full assessment of the authority's performance by an international group, and it was important also because charges of human-rights violations were long a basic component of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.
"The perilous state of human rights in the Palestinian self-rule areas poses a grave threat to the prospects for a durable peace in the region," Human Rights Watch said in a separate statement. It was referring to conditions both in Gaza and the autonomous West Bank district of Jericho, but its main focus was on the crowded, poverty-ridden coastal strip, where Mr. Arafat has put his headquarters.
An Arafat spokesman, Nabil Abu Irdeineh, waved off the report as "inaccurate" and said it was "done in a short time," but he did not specify what errors he saw in it. Mr. Abu Irdeineh added that "the Palestinian Authority is still in the beginning of its rule" and is "serious about implementing law and order in Gaza and Jericho."
Human Rights Watch did not spare Israel in its study, pointing out that it remains the occupying power throughout most of the territories.
In particular, the group denounced Israel for the border closings it periodically imposes on the West Bank and Gaza, including one ordered after a Palestinian suicide bombing that killed 21 Israelis on Jan. 22. Such restrictions, which keep tens of thousands of Palestinians from low-paying jobs in Israel, amount to collective punishment and have "devastating effects" on the territories' fragile economy, the report said.
As the latest border closing entered its fourth week, the Israeli Government announced that it would be continued for at least seven more days, making it one of the longest bans ever imposed on Palestinian entry into Israel.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said Israel had "solid information about possible terror events" expected in the days leading up to Feb. 25, the first anniversary of the massacre in which a Jewish settler killed 29 Muslim worshipers in the West Bank town of Hebron. No "responsible person" could lift the ban this week, Mr. Sarid said.
But Israeli officials acknowledge that the restrictions are inflicting serious harm. For instance, Gaza is reported to have only a two-day supply of gasoline left. Israeli fuel deliverers stopped going there after a security guard accompanying a truck convoy was killed by Palestinian gunmen.
In its report, Human Rights Watch devoted a good deal of attention to Palestinian police roundups of Islamic militants and others opposed to Mr. Arafat. These sweeps have usually followed assaults on Israeli targets, and almost invariably those arrested are released after several days. Nearly all, the study said, "appear to have been targeted for their suspected political affiliations rather than because they were accused of direct involvement in the attacks."
Most of the political targets are not mistreated, the report said, but some prisoners, especially those accused of collaborating with Israel, have been beaten. Two men have died in custody.

HEADLINE: Mayor Seeks Aid Reduction For Hospitals

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
As part of his effort to close a $2.7 billion budget gap, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to ask Gov. George E. Pataki to reduce the amount of money hospitals receive for treating the poor and disabled under Medicaid, officials said yesterday.
Because New York City pays part of the cost of Medicaid, the cuts would help it balance its budget, but would also cause even deeper reductions in financing for its municipal hospital system. 
 The cut in hospital reimbursement rates, to be unveiled with the Mayor's preliminary budget on Tuesday, represents a major part of Mr. Giuliani's plan to ask Albany to go much further than the Governor proposed in slashing spending on public assistance and Medicaid.
The harshest effects of the cuts would be felt by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which would lose $300 million under the Mayor's plan, according to one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The corporation, an independent agency that operates the city's 11 municipal hospitals, already stands to lose an estimated $800 million in financing under the Governor's plan. The combined blow would total $1.1 billion, more than a third of the corporation's $3.2 billion budget, and could hasten the closing of one or more of the city's 11 municipal hospitals.
The reductions, officials said, would also add new impetus to Mr. Giuliani's effort to sell or turn over the operation of some of those hospitals to private, nonprofit organizations. "All we're doing is accelerating what's already happening," said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Mayor's aides declined to discuss the details of his budget plan or to specify a percentage cut in hospital rates.
In all, Mr. Giuliani's preliminary budget plan is expected to propose $1.2 billion in savings in public assistance and Medicaid, otherwise known as entitlement programs, by asking the Governor to go much further than the reductions he proposed in his budget earlier this month. The additional cuts would save the city $400 million more -- $300 million in Medicaid and $100 million in welfare -- than the estimated $800 million in savings under the Governor's budget proposal.
To achieve the added savings, the Governor and the State Legislature would have to agree to increase the state's overall cut in welfare and Medicaid from $1.9 billion to roughly $2.5 billion, officials said. Because the Legislature sets the rates for hospital reimbursements statewide, the Mayor's reductions would affect spending not only in the city, which accounts for two-thirds of welfare and Medicaid spending, but around the state, squeezing public hospitals and, to a lesser extent, private ones as well.
Mr. Giuliani's Medicaid proposals could face an uphill battle in Albany, where the Democrats in the Assembly have long fought to protect health care for the poor while the Republicans in the Senate have fought to protect the rates for hospitals.
The Mayor could also face resistance from the City Council, whose members, while glumly acknowledging the need for painful measures, could balk at cuts that force municipal hospitals to close.
"It's pretty clear, based on what H.H.C. officials have said, that closings can't be ruled out," the Council's spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said yesterday. "If that happens, it will show that these kind of cuts hurt not only the poor, but also working people and a significant part of the city's economy."
The Mayor's plan underscores the extent to which he now relies on Mr. Pataki, the Republican Governor whom he vilified during last year's campaign. And it shows how much Mr. Giuliani's fiscal policies parallel the Governor's, even as Democrats in the Capitol and City Hall warn of disaster for the city.
Speaking generally of his plans after watching a basketball game at Manhattan College on Saturday, Mr. Giuliani said, "What we will demonstrate is that we'll be able to take advantage of the direction that the state is going to find some rather huge savings for the city."
Mr. Giuliani is scheduled to appear this morning before the joint fiscal committees of the Legislature to express support for Mr. Pataki's budget and, aides said, to make a personal pitch for further cuts. The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, Democrat of Queens, will testify, but is likely to offer a starkly different analysis of the budget.
In addition to the cut in hospital reimbursement rates, officials said, the Mayor's plan is expected to propose additional restrictions in the complex regulations governing Medicaid payments. These would be similar to Mr. Pataki's proposal to limit payments, for example, for home care for the disabled or elderly.
Mr. Giuliani will also call on the Governor to make still deeper cuts in welfare, even though Mr. Pataki has already proposed the deepest cuts in the 60 years the state has offered welfare programs, officials said.
The Mayor, they said, would propose larger cuts in grants for able-bodied single adults and mothers with children than the 25 percent reductions proposed by Mr. Pataki, as well as added restrictions on eligibility. The Mayor is also expected to call for limiting benefits to 90 days every two years, rather than 90 days every year, as Mr. Pataki proposed, producing savings for the city in the future as welfare rolls decline.
The cuts in social services are only a part of the budget plan that Mr. Giuliani will present on Tuesday to close a projected $2.7 billion budget gap in the fiscal year that begins in July. Today, he will deliver a speech on the budget at 5:40 P.M., which will be broadcast live on Channel 1.
The Mayor has already met with the city's union leaders and received a pledge to help find $600 million in savings on health care, pensions and work rules, in exchange for a pledge by Mr. Giuliani to avoid layoffs of municipal workers once again.
His plan will also, officials said, cut spending in the city's myriad agencies by $600 million, exempting few areas of service, and include $300 million in privatization proposals and other initiatives. This year's plan, for example, will move ahead with a plan abandoned last year to sell the commercial licenses of WNYC, the city's radio and television stations, the officials said.
Still, the most dramatic effect of the Mayor's plan could be on the hospitals corporation, which receives 72 percent of its funding from Medicaid. The agency has already cut the size of its work force by 3,600 workers, to 47,000, and closed some beds to cope with reductions in the city's contribution to its budget, which now stands at roughly $250 million.
A spokeswoman, Audrey Kelly, said the corporation expected to shoulder reductions as the city and state grappled with their fiscal difficulties. "We've already said the reductions we're looking at from the state will force us to restructure our health care system," she said. "The restructuring process is already under way. These cuts are going to hasten the process."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDEST CASES;
Single Father Receives Help in Meeting His Children's Needs

BYLINE: By ROBERT WADDELL 

 BODY:
Mickey Irizarry has been a single father for his three children since 1986, the year he said his life was nearly ruined. That year, two of his sons were killed in a fire, all his possessions were destroyed, he lost his job, his wife of 15 years became addicted to crack and he had to go on welfare.
After the fire, Mr. Irizarry said, his wife became distraught. She neglected her children, stole money and stayed out with her friends until 2 or 3 in the morning, he said. 
 Mr. Irizarry and his wife divorced, and he gained sole custody of his children, Marcie Ann, 13, Jeffrey, 6, and Melanie, 4. He now cares for them himself in their apartment in the Audubon housing project in Harlem.
"Who he is is so rare," Marcie Ann said. "That's what makes his so unique. He can relate to you, and he's so patient. When you find these kinds of people, you try to hold on to them."
While attending family counseling with his children, Mr. Irizarry learned of Girls Vacation Fund Camp. He felt that his daughter would benefit from camp, as he did when he was a child. Marcie Ann attended camp for four years in a row, hiking, swimming and learning archery. She gained so much confidence in her swimming that she tried out for her school's team, and made it.
This summer, Marcie Ann hopes to return to camp as a counselor-in-training. "I feel boxed in in this apartment," she said. "How many times can I go around this ugly block on my bike without getting bored?"
Girls Vacation Fund Camp receives funds from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The fund's 83d annual appeal began on Thanksgiving Day and will continue through February. Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, Neediest Cases has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled.
So far this year, the fund has received nearly $4 million from thousands of individuals and foundations. All the contributions go directly to the charities, which use them to help people like Mr. Irizarry and his children.
"I always thought bad things would happen to me, but not at this magnitude," said Mr. Irizarry, an unemployed printer. "I haven't had a life since the fire. All my savings went to pay for funeral bills and hospital bills. Now I have no savings, just welfare."
But he said it made him happy to see his children happy, and he concentrates on his children's needs and their education.
As the oldest child, Marcie Ann helps her father care for the two younger children. Even though neither admits it, Marcie Ann is kind of a surrogate mother to her younger siblings.
"I don't want to happen to her what happened to me," Mr. Irizarry said. "I had to take care of my three younger brothers and sisters. I don't want that to happen to her. As long as she's happy, I'm fine."
Mr. Irizarry gives a lot of credit to single mothers. He says that single parenthood is a real job. "These are my kids. My mother's too old. My grandmother's too old. If I don't do it, who will?"

HEADLINE: A Tight Race to Head the World Bank

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Three prominent Americans are angling to replace Lewis T. Preston as president of the World Bank. Mr. Preston, 68, disclosed this month that he has cancer, and he is widely expected to retire soon.
The principal contenders for the post, which has always been held by an American, are Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and a former chief economist at the World Bank; Stanley Fischer, also a former chief economist at the bank and now a deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, and James D. Wolfensohn, a New York investment banker who is chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
 Insiders at the World Bank say Mr. Wolfensohn, 61, has been campaigning actively for the job, promising additional cuts in the World Bank's large and well-paid staff. Mr. Preston has already announced a 12 percent reduction over the next two years in an effort to answer accusations that the bank is overstaffed.
Mr. Summers, 40, has a reputation for intellectual brilliance, but his manner can be abrasive. In 1992, when at the World Bank, he infuriated environmentalists by drafting a sarcastic internal memo arguing that because many developing countries are underpolluted, dirty industries should be encouraged to move to them. The memo was promptly leaked by staff members seeking to embarrass him.
Mr. Summers helped orchestrate the Clinton Adminstration's Mexican rescue package, which may have damaged his standing with members of Congress who opposed the measure.
While Congress has no formal role in choosing the World Bank president, the Administration is currently engaged in delicate negotiations with Congress over financing for the World Bank's International Development Agency. The I.D.A. is supported by taxpayer money from the aid-giving industrial world and provides inexpensive loans to the poorest developing nations.
The Administration is asking Congress to pay the last installment of America's $3.75 billion contribution to the 10th I.D.A. agreement -- worth a total of $18.5 billion -- which expires at the end of this year. It also hopes to win Congressional backing for an 11th agreement.
Mr. Fischer, 51, is the least known of the three. But he is highly respected as an economist and administrator.
The sudden rush to lay claim to the World Bank's top post -- which pays $190,000 a year plus a $90,000 expense allowance -- comes as the institution has been under sustained attack from a variety of critics.
Environmentalists accuse the World Bank of backing large development projects that create havoc with the balance of nature. Others doubt the efficacy of development aid in general. While a third school argues that the bank still prefers working with bureaucratic and often corrupt governments, rather than directly helping individuals in the private sector.
Last year, when the World Bank and the I.M.F. observed their 50th anniversaries with a joint ministerial meeting in Madrid, the critics tried to disrupt the celebrations with a protest campaign using the slogan "50 years is enough."
To secure a long period of stable management, officials of the bank say the Clinton Administration is looking for a president young enough to serve at least two five-year terms.
Mr. Preston and his two predecessors, Barber B. Conable Jr. and A. W. Clawson, each served a single term. The World Bank's previous head, Robert S. McNamara, served from 1968 to 1981.
The Administration had started looking for a World Bank president before Mr. Preston disclosed his illness on Feb. 1; Mr. Preston was scheduled to retire in 1996, before the end of the President's current term.
Mr. Preston has decided to appoint his deputy, Ernest Stern, as acting head. Although Mr. Stern had resigned from the bank before Mr. Preston's announcement, he agreed to stay on an extra month. He is joining J. P. Morgan, the big New York investment bank.
In the nearly three and a half years that Mr. Preston has led the bank, he has placed less emphasis on increasing the volume of lending to the developing world and more on improving the quality of the projects it finances.
In particular, he has emphasized lending for health, education, family planning and social issues, as well as for environmental protection and private-sector development. The World Bank has become the largest single source of external financing for AIDS programs in the developing world. Last year, it lent more than $2.4 billion for environmental safeguards in poorer countries.
The World Bank president is formally appointed by the representatives of its shareholder governments who sit on the executive board. By custom, however, the candidate is nominated by the executive director from the United States. All appointments have been by consensus and without a vote.
Under an informal agreement, the World Bank job goes to the United States and the directorship of the I.M.F. to Europe.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
The Mayor's Housecleaning: Past Deeds or Future Fears?

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
USUALLY, when a mayor dismisses people from their jobs, there is a tangible reason. A bridge collapsed. Or a budget wasn't balanced. Or someone was accused of malfeasance. What's so baffling about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's housecleaning is that there is no clear explanation of what most of the dozens of people dismissed did to attract his ire.
Some spokesmen were caught telling the truth, awkward as the truth may have been, and the Police Department's spokesman not only balked at trimming his staff but also burnished to a bright shine Police Commissioner William J. Bratton's image, which apparently did not please the Mayor. 
 But what wrongs did everyone else commit, exactly?
Answers to that question have been ambiguous at best, which suggests that the dismissals of about 40 people so far may reflect less about past deeds than the Mayor's fears of what is to come as he prepares to announce his latest budget.
THE economy is no better, spending cuts are getting deeper, the state and Federal governments are cutting, too, and city agencies are already suffering. The Mayor prides himself on being a good manager, but some of his agencies, including the Youth Services Department and the Human Resources Administration, are in disarray, and with a city budget gap of $2.7 billion, more may follow.
That has to have an impact. The poorest New Yorkers, so dependent on city services, tend to feel budget cuts immediately. The poor generally do not vote in large numbers, but members of the middle class do, and while it takes longer for service reductions to hit them, the cuts certainly will affect them by 1997 -- the Mayor's re-election year.
Under those circumstances, Mr. Giuliani's strategy looks increasingly like one that many of his predecessors favored in tough times. It is known as circling the wagons, making sure that city government, as much as possible, is made up of loyalists.
Right now, as the Mayor sees it, according to one adviser, "he's out there, he turns around and the whole team isn't behind him. Or, as the First Deputy Mayor, Peter J. Powers, said, "a lot of people are off agenda" -- meaning they are not sufficiently committed to shrinking government.
If some have dragged their heels, it is easy to understand why: the mission of people who work in city agencies is not to shrink government but to deliver services. That may not be as valid a premise today as it used to be, but it certainly was in what no w seems a different era, when Edward I. Koch, David N. Dinkins and Abraham D. Beame were Mayor.
Most of those who were dismissed joined government in those days. It is probably less a matter of ideology than one of human nature that some have been unenthusiastic about withholding or reducing services to people who need it, which is the impact most budget cuts have, despite the ubiquitous propagandizing about "streamlining" and "downsizing."
ACCORDING to one mayoral adviser, Mr. Giuliani wanted commissioners to make staff changes last fall. But, probably because the Mayor was distracted by his role in Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's re-election campaign, the message was not delivered firmly, and the commissioners "were out there dawdling," the adviser said.
They are "dawdling" no longer because their choice comes down to following the Mayor's orders or, it would appear, leaving -- the intention speculated about Mr. Bratton. The Police Commissioner says he is staying for now, but whether he and other commissioners will tolerate City Hall's intervention in the long run is unclear.
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines submitted his resignation last year, when the Mayor insisted that he dismiss his press secretary and budget director. But the Board of Education, which is not under the Mayor's direct control, supported Mr. Cortines and he stayed. So did his two appointees.
Mr. Giuliani does have the power to order any personnel changes he wants in non-Civil Service jobs. And getting tough with his own staff might help with the municipal labor unions, from whom the Mayor wants $600 million in concessions. But will the staff changes give him what he expects?
Certainly it cannot be difficult to reduce the number of public information officers in the Police Department -- now up to 38 -- and replace some police officers with civilian employees. Perhaps the Mayor will also reduce the size of his own press office, which, at 17 employees, is more than double the staff of 8 in that office during Mr. Koch's first term in the late 1970's.
But is it really likely, as the Mayor seems to think, that public information directors who are handpicked by City Hall can put a more positive light on the news in a town with such competitive news media? The events of the last few days raise an even more fundamental question: whether commissioners who have been denied the most elementary responsibility of office -- selecting their own staffs -- will be as enthusiastic about reinventing Mr. Giuliani's government as Mr. Giuliani is.

HEADLINE: New York Striving to Become Technology's Creative Center

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
For years, New Yorkers watched passively as the San Francisco, Boston and Seattle areas became technological giants, building powerful high-tech industries that attracted the country's best technical minds.
But New York is a part of the latest technology wave. As a mecca for writers, graphic artists, musicians and film makers, it is poised to become one of the country's centers for the emerging multimedia industry, which combines visual and audio elements like animation, video and music to create films, CD-ROM's, television programming and virtual reality. 
 In recent months, membership in a New York group for people interested in these new media forms has mushroomed. Tiny companies are sprouting, mainly in downtown Manhattan, to cash in on the appetite for virtual reality, which uses interactive three-dimensional images, and CD-ROM's, souped-up compact disks that combine audio and video.
New York University has started a center devoted to these new media. Microsoft, the giant software company, is looking to set up a special office here to scout out these projects.
"The early phase of the evolution of multimedia was focused on developing the technology and infrastructure," said Chris Jones, a director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research organization. "Now, the ability to wire everyone is in place and the focus is shifting to developing the content. For that, you need artists, musicians and writers. That's where this area has a diversity of talent that is unmatched."
Recognizing this foundation for growth, city officials and major local corporations have been meeting to discuss ways to help turn New York into a bigger magnet.
The New York City Partnership, a business and civic group, has joined Nynex, Con Edison and the International Business Machines Corporation in an effort to open a multimedia incubator in a downtown Manhattan building. The 350,000-square-foot center will provide office space, equipment and conference and research facilities at a discount for about 150 emerging firms.
"What we're trying to do is create an environment and a facility that will make it more attractive for these companies to be here in the New York City area instead of going somewhere else," said Carl Symon, I.B.M.'s vice president and general manager for the northeastern region.
Another group, which includes Time Warner, McGraw-Hill and Forbes, has been meeting at I.B.M.'s midtown office each month since last summer, discussing ways to finance and build a base for new media companies in the area.
"Content is becoming king, and New York is where that content is developed," said Joseph Ripp, the chief financial officer for Time Inc. "We're discussing how do we start promoting that idea and how do we get venture capitalist to invest in this area."
For these big entertainment and communications firms, there is plenty at stake. Growth is slowing in traditional forms of media like publishing and broadcasting, leading companies to look to multimedia as a new avenue for expansion. With the advent of affordable digital technology, industry analysts estimate that about 60 million homes will have personal computers with CD-ROM drives by 1998.
While media companies already own major book, magazine and movie divisions, most lack the expertise to turn them into multimedia projects and thus are seeking the help of smaller new media companies that have these capabilities.
For example, Scholastic, the New York-based publisher of children's books, took its popular Magic School Bus series to Music Pen, a small New York new media company. Together, the two produced a CD-ROM titled "The Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body."
"The large companies bring brand recognition and consumer franchises to the party, and the smaller companies bring the technical skill and the understanding of how to mix it all together," said Brian T. Horey, a general partner at Lawrence, Smith and Horey, a New York venture capital firm interested in investing in new media companies.
New York is hardly expected to supplant Northern California's Silicon Valley or Boston's Route 128 as the nation's leading centers of high technology. But a growing multimedia industry is taking shape here. At New York University, for example, a Center for Digital Multimedia has been established with the help of a $1 million state grant.
The New York New Media Association, an organization of business owners, consultants, graphic artists, actors, musicians, lawyers and accountants, has grown from 8 members to more than 600 in less than six months.
And although its economic impact on the city is still unclear, the multimedia industry is certain to provide new avenues for the more than 800 companies that produce commercial software.
Not long ago, it would have been unheard of for a fledgling entrepreneur like Sandra Newton to leave the Silicon Valley for Manhattan. But at a Cybersuds, the term members of the new media association use for their meetings, Ms. Newton, a self-proclaimed "valley girl," explained why she just moved her multimedia consulting business from San Francisco to New York.
"I'm here to get artists wired," she said. "You know, New York is the place to start building a virtual community of artists."
Other evidence of the growth can be found in the number of major corporations, including the Sony Corporation and Microsoft, that are setting up divisions in the city to create and develop multimedia businesses. "Because music and book publishing companies are looking for ways to distribute their products interactively, I think you'll see more people coming in here," said Olaf Olafsson, president of Sony Electronic Publishing in New York. "There's a great talent pool in New York."
As part of Microsoft's multimedia developers group, employees in the office are seeking "to jump-start all the publishers and content owners into doing multimedia," said Frederic De Wulf, Microsoft's manager of new business.
But perhaps the most visible evidence of new media growth can be found in downtown Manhattan, where much of the city's creative community is concentrated. From the Flatiron district to TriBeCa and SoHo, dozens of new media entrepreneurs are hanging out shingles. In fact, so many are now situated in these neighborhoods that some in the business have taken to calling the area "Multimedia Gulch" and Business Week magazine dubbed it "Silicon Alley."
One such company, Music Pen, epitomizes the phenomenon. Founded by Yee-Ping Wu and Philip Lui, a couple who met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music, the company has grown from seven employees to 50 over the last year.
Inside Music Pen's sprawling loft overlooking Union Square, designers, writers, animators, producers, composers and technologists are working on some 15 new CD-ROM titles scheduled for release this year. Besides The Magic School Bus series, the company also is working on projects with Bertelsmann Music Group and Viacom New Media.
Reflecting the marriage of disciplines in the industry, Music Pen's offices are furnished with computer terminals, sound studios and a baby grand piano. "Back when I was performing as a concert pianist," said Mrs. Wu, the company's president, "if you had asked me if I thought I'd be in the technology business, I would have said you were crazy. "It's delightful to see that the future of technology has so much to do with creativity. In New York, you have a wide variety of culture, race and ability, and a wide variety of businesses. This is all making multimedia a part of the city."
Among other successful companies in the area, Byron Preiss Multimedia has produced numerous CD-ROM titles, including "The Seinfeld Screen Saver." And Curious Pictures, which uses digital technology to create television commercials, has combined live action, computer generated graphics and three-dimensional animation for products including Dannon yogurt and Taster's Choice coffee.
But despite New York's advantages, the idea of setting up shop in the city remains a daunting prospect for many new media outfits. They choose to locate elsewhere because of real estate prices, restrictive small business regulations, high taxes and quality-of-life concerns.
Skeptics say that initiatives like the multimedia incubator, the downtown Manhattan building expected to open later this year, will not provide nearly enough support to small new companies trying to get a foothold in a business environment as difficult as New York's.
"The city is not offering as many incentives or as much support as company's like ours with the potential for high growth need to survive here," said Wilbert Murdock, who operates two companies, Motiontronics for Sports Multimedia Inc. and Rap Multimedia Inc., from his home in the Bronx.
Mr. Murdock's companies are developing CD-ROM titles through a joint venture with I.B.M.
But city and corporate planners are hoping that The New York Information Technology Center, as the incubator will be called, will not only offer critical support, but will centralize the city's new media companies and serve as a focal point for the industry. "When people think of high-tech in other cities they think of specific areas, but New York multimedia doesn't have a center of gravity," said Edward Martino, an I.B.M. executive involved in the incubator project.
Project organizers won't divulge the address of the building because negotiations with the city on a tax abatement are holding up the lease and preventing tenants from being signed. The center is expected to house about 150 companies. "A large number of companies are interested in a center like this," Mr. Martino said. "This can be the latchkey needed to help them grow."

HEADLINE: Queens Man Shoots 3, Killing His Wife, Police Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A Queens man who relatives said had recently been released from prison shot his wife to death and wounded two other relatives yesterday in the couple's Far Rockaway home, the police said.
The man, Peter Garcia, 33, was arrested at the couple's home, at 541 Grassmere Terrace, by police officers who heard the shots. 
 His wife, Evelyn Garcia, 35, was pronounced dead at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway shortly after the 9:45 A.M. shooting, the police said. Her son, Michael Aliciea, 17, was shot in the face, and her nephew, David Aliciea, 19, was shot in the arm. Both teen-agers were listed in stable but guarded condition yesterday at St. John's, said Ilonia Mostel, a hospital spokeswoman.
Sgt. Francis Haimeck-Mladinich, a police spokeswoman, said the officers arrested Mr. Garcia as he was leaving the couple's house, and he was charged with murder and assault. While the officers were making the arrest, Mrs. Garcia's pit bull terrier attacked the officers, and they shot and killed the dog, Sergeant Haimeck-Mladinich said.
The police said it was not clear what led to the shootings. But Ms. Garcia's brother, Joe Aliciea, said that the couple had had a stormy relationship for more than four years and that Mr. Garcia had repeatedly threatened violence.
"She was going to tell him to leave," said Mr. Aliciea, who added that his sister had provided a home and financial support for Mr. Garcia, who was unemployed.
The couple's 3-year-old daughter, Venus, was not injured in the shooting.
Mr. Aliciea described Mr. Garcia as a large, muscular man who was released from prison about a month ago. He said Mr. Garcia had served a one-year sentence for ransacking Ms. Garcia's house and threatening the couple's infant daughter with a knife.

Dumb And Dumber

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
We are told that we are moving to a knowledge-based society. The future will belong to the individual and the country that can best make the transition from brawn to brain.
No one is more committed to that vision of the future, or more convincing in expounding it, than Newt Gingrich. So it is a puzzle when he also says that he wants to wipe out the most effective instrument we have for spreading knowledge of ourselves and our world. That is public broadcasting. 
 Destruction of public television and radio has been made a cause by many voices on the right. Over recent weeks the arguments have been heard with increasing intensity. They seem to me to miss the point.
It is said, for example, that we no longer need public broadcasting because there are so many commercial broadcast and cable outlets. The market will work best, giving the customers what they need.
Market theory has, happily, triumphed in economics around the world. But it is hard to believe that those who say it can work in broadcasting, giving us all we now get from public stations, really mean what they say.
What commercial network or channel would conceivably make the investment that public television did to create and broadcast nine hours on the Civil War? Yet those Ken Burns programs told more Americans more about a formative chapter in the nation's history than anything else has.
Then there is the strictly educational role of public television. On WNET, the New York-New Jersey public station, 60 percent of all programs are for schools or for children at home. WNET has 100,000 viewers a day who are learning to read or earning high school equivalency diplomas.
Commercial broadcasting at its best cannot be expected to perform such functions. They fill a public need, one especially compelling in a knowledge-based society.
But it is not just programs designated as educational that matter in public broadcasting. Bringing large audiences to Trollope or Dickens also does. And anyone who thinks commercial television in this country will undertake such ventures cannot have watched a great deal of it lately, with its Gresham's law of violence and greed and tabloid tittle-tattle.
To that kind of rationale for public broadcasting, the critics respond with cries of "elitism!" Why, they ask, should the public pay for programs watched only by a well-to-do elite in New York and Boston and San Francisco?
What condescension toward the American people that argument reveals. Eighty percent of all Americans watch public television at least once a month. It may be more widely used by the public than anything the Federal Government supports except interstate highways.
The point is that public broadcasting offers, or can offer, higher values to everyone, rich or poor, on the coasts or in Iowa (which has exceptional public stations). It is the very opposite of elitism.
In today's terms -- and tomorrow's -- public broadcasting is the equivalent of Andrew Carnegie's public libraries. It is open to all and offers all a chance to expand their minds and enrich their lives. And the Federal contribution costs each of us about $1 a year: one of the greatest bargains around.
The comparison with public libraries was made in a thoughtful column on the public broadcasting controversy by David Warsh of The Boston Globe. He went on to another intriguing point.
Conservatives like to talk about reviving Victorian values, Mr. Warsh said: morality, industry and the like. But it was also a Victorian project to spread culture and learning to the masses through libraries, museums, public education. Why would those who profess to admire the Victorians want to suppress today's great mechanism toward those ends? Why would they want to dumb the society down?
Of course public broadcasting does not reach the ideal. But it does some things well. National Public Radio provides the only in-depth news in this country that compares with the BBC In any event, if public broadcasting is less than it could be, improve it, don't kill it.
Underneath the critics' arguments, I think, is a premise that everything in America should be commercial. If that is the value the voices of the right are really asserting, they should say so. But somehow I do not think it is Speaker Gingrich's vision. Let us see what he does, in the end, about public broadcasting.

HEADLINE: Invest in Day Care

 BODY:
In 1991 more than half of American women with children under 6 worked. Many more would surely like to, and are surely destined to -- if the Administration and the states succeed in changing welfare by requiring recipients to commit themselves to education, training and jobs. Millions of American youngsters are spending, or will spend, several of their most formative years in the charge of strangers. They are going to be cheated -- because their country has yet to give day care the serious attention it deserves.
According to a recent study of hundreds of day care centers in California, Colorado, Connecticut and North Carolina, conducted by child psychologists and economists at four universities, the care provided by most is so poor it threatens the youngsters' emotional and intellectual development. As for the parents, 90 percent of whom rated the care as "good," they were sadly misinformed, either because they did not recognize quality care or did not demand it. 
 Where quality was high -- 1 out of 7 instances -- it was in centers that could pay higher wages for highly trained workers, and more of them. Invariably, such centers had access to money beyond parental fees from Federal or state governments, universities or employers providing on-site care.
Youngsters who have had high-quality day care, the study found, have better language, premathematical and social skills than those who have not and are better prepared for school. For too long the debate over day care has been centered on how best to help working mothers. It is well past time to shift the debate to how best to help their children.

Counter-Punch Strategy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When three White House speechwriters quit in disgust, unable to get access to or direction from the top man;
When the President is rightly treated as irrelevant after submitting a weak-kneed, punt-and-pray budget that helplessly runs up another trillion dollars in debt; 
 When his staff has to explain that his bonehead play to end the baseball strike failed at night and not during working hours -- then a good case can be made that we are witnessing the disintegration of this Presidency.
But it's too soon to write him off as a half-term President. To get an inkling of any strategy, grand or petit, to resuscitate the Clinton political fortunes, I went to the White House to see George Stephanopoulos, his loyal aide, who turned 34 years old that day. As a sign of his maturing humility, we dined in the declasse "B" Mess.
"From now on, you're going to see the Liberated Clinton," George said, determinedly optimistic. "We've got a good hammer in the Republican Contract."
But didn't Clinton's notion of campaigning as a liberal against the Gingrich Contract With America nationalize the local elections and backfire in the '94 campaign? His reply: "A flawed campaign strategy is not necessarily a flawed long-term strategy."
From his responses, and from other Clinton well-wishers less inclined to talk on the record, a pastiche of plans and hopes and guesses emerges that can generously be labeled the Clinton Comeback Strategy:
1. Concentrate on espousing "responsible" middle-class tax cuts that do not increase the deficit and boast of "cutting the deficit as a percentage of G.D.P." Negotiate tolerable welfare reform, some health fixes and at year's end come up with one hot new Topic X.
2. Do the gutsy "unpopular thing" by resisting the anti-government thrust; use the veto, as in defending the popular portions of the crime bill. Hit the conservative disentitlement brigade as "weak on work, tough on kids" and use Republican majority excesses as a foil.
3. Press foreign economic policy to generate jobs; though stupefyingly dull and unpopular, it shows leadership, as in the Mexican bailout, and drives a wedge between Republican internationalists and isolationists.
4. Exploit the new majority's mistakes: for example, tie G.O.P. regulatory reform to fat-cat contributors, undermining Republican populist appeal.
This is the politics of centrist counterpunching. George makes no bones about it: "Whoever gets to the middle first, and holds it, is the winner." No wonder speechwriters like liberal David Kusnet took flight (literary agents take note). Clintonites who experienced the angry voter reaction to their lurch to the left now pray the Republicans will veer far to the right.
Arguments supporting counterpunch strategy:
1. In Clinton's first two years, necessary compromises hurt his profile as a leader, but next year the media focus will be more on Presidential effort than on legislative results.
2. He will not be responsible for every act of Congress, can sharpshoot at failures and -- most important -- lay blame for any economic downturn on Republicans.
3. The G.O.P. candidates must hit the campaign trail early in '95, while Clinton can seem to wait a year, making their actions look politically motivated and his look Presidential.
4. The nature of popularity's pendulum is to swing: "Six months ago, Bob Dole was Darth Vader and now he's Mr. Rogers," says George, answering those who think Clinton's problems will get worse before they get worst.
Clintonites used to pretend they most feared Dan Quayle, in the hope of encouraging a nomination triumph of the far right. In reality, most worry most about California Gov. Pete Wilson, because "that puts the mother lode in peril," but doubt he'll be chosen. They see the new, genial Dole as a problem; Phil Gramm less so; Lamar Alexander more so. Newt Gingrich? "We should be so lucky."
The idea is to present Clinton in 1996 as possessing the energy of youth combined with the experience of the Presidency -- "the safe choice."
Sounds bizarre; ignores the looming Whitewater and Tyson investigations; precludes more staff appointment foul-ups or a Mexican standoff; relies on a third party splitting the Republican vote.
But no old Nixon hand will say they never come back.

HEADLINE: ELITE HOSPITALS OF NEW YORK CITY IN FINANCIAL BIND

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
New York's elite medical centers are facing their worst financial crisis in decades, caught between newly powerful health maintenance organizations demanding deep discounts and state and Federal legislators planning to cut millions of dollars in hospital payments to balance budgets.
Some of these teaching hospitals may not survive the decade, health-industry analysts say, and those that do will emerge transformed: from ivory tower institutions focused on research, training and high-priced specialty care to vast health-care networks whose main task is to provide cost-conscious basic medicine, a pursuit that many have performed only as an afterthought -- and then grudgingly. 
 Already, they are scrambling to reshape themselves for leaner days: closing departments, training fewer specialists and hiring less-skilled labor to replace nurses and doctors. At Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, officials are thinking about reducing services to the poor. At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, some nurses are being replaced by nurses' aides.
But some hospital executives worry that this overnight transformation, under threat of bankruptcy, will result in a dangerous deterioration of care for the poor, as well as a local recession caused by huge layoffs in an industry that is the city's largest employer.
"We've just gone through a period of expense reduction and cut $50 million from our budget, so there's not a lot of fat," said William Speck, president of Columbia-Presbyterian, which lost $22 million in 1993 and, after a cost-cutting campaign, only $2 million in 1994.
He said the hospital was contemplating curtailing psychiatric and dental services to the poor, if these are not covered after Medicaid cuts. Some private hospitals are now considering whether their uninsured patients should instead be stabilized and transferred to public hospitals.
Hospitals also worry that they will have to curtail the basic research that has sustained their reputations and brought the world new drugs and cancer cures. "Research will have to be self-supporting to be preserved," said Dr. Spencer Forman, president of Montefiore Medical Center, who added that research doctors would probably have to see more patients in hospital clinics to underwrite their research time. Such pressures have already caused some longtime scientists to close their laboratories.
New York's academic hospitals have long teetered on the brink of insolvency, due in part to the state's tight regulation of fees, which guaranteed survival but made it hard to flourish. Severely limited in how much they could charge patients with conventional insurance, they have relied on generous payments and subsidies from government insurers, as well as a state fund to underwrite charity care and to pay for unprofitable activities like teaching. This system is under attack.
The growth of local H.M.O.'s, which demand and receive hugely discounted fees, is already hurting revenues. Now, newly elected state and Federal legislators plan to reduce vast channels of money from Medicare and Medicaid, which cover two-thirds of patients at hospitals like Columbia-Presbyterian.
"We are in assault mode, caught in the crossfire of demands for reductions from Albany, reductions from Washington and a market that demands discounts," Dr. Forman said.
Administrators who spoke last year about preserving their academic health centers are now figuring out how to revamp them, focusing instead on survival in any form.
All the hospitals are cutting costs and aggressively expanding their primary-care capacity for paying patients, ignoring for the moment the specialty departments -- the liver transplant teams and the cardiac intensive care units -- on which their august reputations rest. New research is now more likely to focus on how to deliver care more efficiently than on basic science, with test tubes and petri dishes.
Mount Sinai Medical Center, which finished 1994 with a surplus of only $200,000, plans to borrow $100 million to put 400 new front-line doctors in satellite clinics across the area. It needs to transform itself from an "academic health science center to a regional, accessible, cost-competitive health care system," said Dr. John Rowe, the center's president. He said that the medical centers would probably have to rely more heavily on drug companies to support basic science.
To prepare for the squeeze, the New York Hospital Care Network is combining departments at its 13 member hospitals so that specialized services like radiation treatment will be closed at some hospitals and offered only at certain sites.
"Survival is going to be the name of the game for a while," said Dr. David Skinner, president and chief executive of New York Hospital.
The upheaval is all the more traumatic because it has taken the hospitals by surprise. Just six months ago, hospital presidents were easing gently into the world of managed care, anticipating some form of universal coverage as well as subsidies for teaching under a national health plan. They spent many hours and thousands of dollars lobbying for changes in President Clinton's health-care proposal, arguing that they needed more money, and persuaded legislators like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to revoke their support of the Clinton plan. The strategy backfired, as all plans for health-care revision evaporated.
"The academic medical centers did what doctors did and what businesses did: They fought about details," said Dr. Raymond J. Baxter, senior vice president of Lewin-VHI, a health-care consulting firm based in Fairfax, Va. "No one anticipated that in doing so they would lose the whole game."
New York hospitals are already among the weakest financially in the nation, with bond ratings so poor that most are unable to borrow on the open market. Eighty percent of the hospital bonds insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a Government guarantee program for high-risk borrowers, are for hospitals in New York State. Sixty percent of the bonds are those of hospitals in New York City.
While hospitals around the country average surpluses close to 5 percent, successful hospitals in the city generally finish each year with surpluses far less than 1 percent -- often only several hundred thousand dollars -- and some perennially fail to meet their budgets.
Their financial trouble results in part from the large number of poor and uninsured patients they serve, as well as their extremely high overhead, since they emphasize research and rely on patient revenues to help finance classrooms and labs.
Although many of these hospitals have endowments and receive millions of dollars in private insurance money, they depend heavily on a variety of public funds: payments for patient treatment from Medicaid and Medicare, as well as millions of dollars in educational grants from Medicare, supposedly to compensate them for training new doctors. Those with large numbers of nonpaying patients also receive millions of dollars from the state's so-called bad debt and charity pool, created from a surcharge on all patient care in which the relatively rich hospitals shore up their poorer counterparts.
Through this intricate system, regulators assured that hospitals in the city could accomplish the sometimes incompatible tasks of producing world class research and ministering to the poor and uninsured who walk through an emergency room door. Neither mission is likely to remain unchanged.
For one thing, the fees from paying patients are dropping fast because of growing H.M.O. enrollment in New York, which is expected to surpass 25 percent this year. H.M.O.'s negotiate with hospitals for discounts, which are growing deeper. Hospital executives say they have agreed to huge bargains for fear that the H.M.O.'s, who control hundreds of thousands of patients, will take their business elsewhere.
"The bargaining has been so aggressive that the Medicare rate, which once was the floor for what we could charge, is now the ceiling," said Dr. Forman.
All of New York's academic centers are scurrying to put together networks of doctors and services to offer to H.M.O.'s. But it has not been easy for the distinguished academics who run New York's premier medical centers to bow to the business requirements of the newly powerful buyers.
"Managed care is looking for the lowest possible price in the market," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group. "They are not concerned about whether a hospital covered the uninsured and how well it serves its community."
On top of that, public funds -- both Medicare and Medicaid -- are almost certain to plummet within the next two years.
The new proposed state budget includes Medicaid cuts to hospitals estimated at more than a billion dollars. Beyond that, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani hopes to trim Medicaid reimbursements even more. Hospitals find the state cuts particularly galling because they come from Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, who only last year, as an analyst with the Manhattan Institute, was the darling of the medical community for her detailed criticism of the Clinton plan.
Medicaid payments are the lifeblood of many of the city's hospitals, where 25 percent to 75 percent of patients are covered by this form of insurance. The proposed cuts could cost Montefiore $17 million, Mount Sinai $10 million and Columbia-Presbyterian $20 million, leaving all three institutions millions of dollars in debt. After intensive restructuring and cost-cutting, Montefiore finished 1994 with a surplus of $6 million, Mount Sinai with a surplus of $200,000 and Columbia-Presbyterian with a loss of $2 million.
Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said that such cuts would result in widespread closings and "layoffs the scope of which we've never seen before."
Within the next two years, most health policy experts expect cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars in Medicare grants for education as well, a loss that will affect hospitals in New York far more than those elsewhere.
New York hospitals train 15 percent of the nation's doctors and receive well over $100,000 each year per resident for that pursuit. In theory, these payments are supposed to compensate the hospital for costs associated with teaching: call rooms for sleeping, extra blood tests that might be ordered for teaching purposes, a slightly slower pace of an operation so that an experienced surgeon might explain his technique.
But in practice, doctors in training at urban hospitals today more than pay for themselves, providing extraordinarily cheap labor in clinics, wards and emergency rooms. And many health-industry experts say that the Medicare educational payments have become yet another indirect subsidy to prop up hospitals that serve the poor and uninsured. Columbia-Presbyterian receives $60 million in Medicare payments related to education; Mount Sinai $40 million.
"The risk in a marked reduction of teaching dollars is not that teaching will stop; it's that the institution will have to close," said Dr. Forman of Montefiore. "Maybe you are giving us enough to train residents, maybe you aren't. But if you take $30 million or $40 million out of these institutions, they are in trouble."

HEADLINE: Clinton Intervenes to Help Revive Stalled Mideast Peace Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton stepped into the stalled Middle East talks today to try to give them new momentum as Palestinian leaders promised strong new efforts to crack down on terrorism against Israel.
There were no breakthroughs, but modest steps were taken to resuscitate peace efforts, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. 
 Mr. Clinton met today in Washington with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Israel and Jordan and a senior Palestinian diplomat. At the meeting, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed to set up industrial zones in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to provide more jobs for Palestinians. They also vowed to negotiate promptly an accord that would redeploy Israeli troops in the West Bank and allow Palestinian elections to proceed.
Administration officials said that Palestinians got the message more emphatically than ever that greater self-rule was contingent on combating terrorism.
Before talks began at Blair House, Mr. Clinton told reporters: "It is no secret to anyone in the world that we are in a critical moment in the peace process. We cannot allow the rise of terror again to threaten this peace."
In a statement issued by Mr. Christopher, the Palestinians committed themselves to "preempting terror, punishing those responsible and denying those who plan and carry out terror or violence any safe haven." The peace talks have been stalled since Jan. 22, when a suicide bombing in Israel claimed 21 lives.
Much of today's talks sought to show the Palestinian people that peace efforts would bring tangible benefits. The major announcement was the creation of two Israeli-Palestinian industrial zones in Gaza and four in the West Bank. Mr. Clinton said he would ask Congress for authority to make imports from those zones duty-free, to encourage investment and create markets.
American officials said they would seek to do the same if Egypt, Jordan and Israel decided to set up a joint industrial zone near the Gulf of Aqaba.
"It is clear that we have to bring some economic benefits of peace as quickly as we possibly can," Mr. Clinton said. "And the United States is prepared to do its part."
In their communique, the United States and the four Middle East participants said they would "do all they could to support the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process."
Speaking with uncharacteristic emotion, Mr. Christopher said it was crucial for the peace process not to fall short of its goals. "Despite all the difficulties, the parties know that there is no turning back," he said. "This is irreversible. Conditions have been changed permanently in the region, and the parties must measure up to their responsibilities."
Those responsibilities, officials said, included an end to the border closings that have kept 50,000 Palestinians from their jobs in Israel.
At a news conference after the meeting, Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, said: "We ought to make sure the Palestinian Authority will try to do what it has undertaken to do to prevent terror. We don't ask for 100 percent success, but we ask for a clear effort -- a visible, convincing effort that they are really trying to stop terror."
The negotiators also sought to address Egypt's concerns that Israel had nuclear bombs and was refusing to sign the Nucleaer Nonproliferation Treaty. In the communique issued here, Israel and Egypt agreed, in vague terms, "to pursue a mutually verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological."

 BODY:
Depite Budgetary pressure and community opposition, group homes and community residences for the mentally ill have mushroomed as states have moved people out of large psychiatric hospitals. The deinstitutionalization has proceeded despite the difficulty of providing sevices for the mentally ill in their communities. It is more economical to keep a patient in a group home, which typically houses a dozen residents and has a 24-hour-staff, costing New York State about $35,000 a year, compared with $120,000 a year for hospitalization. Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget has alarmed advocates for the mantally ill, as it cuts community mental health programs while accelerating the release of patients from state hospitals.

HEADLINE: Russians and Chechens Agree to Truce and P.O.W. Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Russian and Chechen commanders agreed today on a cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners in the civil war in Chechnya, with more talks scheduled for Wednesday, the day before the Russian President makes an important speech to Parliament.
The overall Russian commander, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov of the Interior Ministry forces, met for five hours today with the Chechen chief of staff, Col. Aslan Maskhadov, at the airport in the small town of Sleptsovsk, in Ingushetia. The Russian Army commander, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, and the Ingush Vice President, Boris Agapov, also attended the talks. 
 There was no indication of how long the cease-fire might last or how extensive it might be. As a gesture, General Kulikov ordered an immediate halt to the use of heavy artillery by Russian forces in Chechnya, the semi-official Itar-Tass news agency reported, though doubtless the order will take time to relay. And there was no immediate indication that regular Russian bombing raids would stop.
"During the first stage of negotiations, an agreement was reached on a mutual cease-fire concerning heavy weapons," the Russian Government Press Service confirmed tonight, implying that further talks would try to broaden the truce.
"The sun is showing us that it is time to start sowing," General Kulikov told Russian television, referring to a still-distant spring. He seemed to imply that the time for wreaking destruction may be past, and that Russia felt strong enough to enter real peace talks with the Chechens, who have put up fierce resistance to the more than 40,000 Russian troops trying to crush a three-year-old Chechen claim to independence.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said, "The first steps have been made toward achieving mutual understanding."
President Boris N. Yeltsin is preparing a major report about Chechnya that he is to deliver to a joint session of Parliament on Thursday. He has announced that the operation in Chechnya is moving into a new, less-warlike phase of pacification by Interior Ministry troops, and it is likely that he wants a cease-fire in effect when he gives his speech.
Western nations like the United States have been urging Mr. Yeltsin to negotiate over Chechnya. The Americans have pushed him at least to make an offer to the Chechen side, senior diplomats said.
In the speech, Mr. Yeltsin is expected to make a "critical assessment of the military approach" to Chechnya, Kremlin officials told Interfax, which may mean trouble for the beleaguered Defense and Security Ministers, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev and Valentin N. Stepashin.
Mr. Yeltsin is also expected to repeat his commitment to economic reform and announce measures to curb inflation better, Kremlin officials say, another indication that he is trying to move beyond the Chechnya issue and reassure the West that Russia remains an eager partner.
The West and its fiduciary agent, the International Monetary Fund, are contemplating a vital $6.25 billion loan to Russia, but want to be assured that Moscow has a serious plan for economic stabilization and sharply lower inflation, which reached a year-long high of 17.8 percent in January.
Parliament, for instance, recently approved a near tripling of the minimum wage, on which many pension and other payments are based, that would blow a big hole in the budget. Mr. Yeltsin may announce that he will veto the measure.
At the cease-fire talks, the Chechen commander, Colonel Maskhadov, stressed that he had been empowered by the Chechen leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, to discuss "exclusively military issues," like a prisoner exchange and a cease-fire to collect and bury bodies.
The Russian Government has said it will not negotiate with Mr. Dudayev, only arrest him as a "state criminal." Moscow has said it would negotiate with individual Chechen commanders, however, to get them to lay down their weapons.
Colonel Maskhadov, who moved the Chechen military headquarters out of the wrecked capital, Grozny, last week, has promised a long partisan war against Russian forces. Many Chechen fighters fill villages near Grozny and are harassing Russian troops in the central city itself with hit-and-run raids and sniping.
The new Russian-appointed leadership of Chechnya has postponed its move to Grozny, but may try to implant itself there this week.
Mr. Yeltsin is eager to turn the war over to the Interior Ministry, a step that is important in Russian eyes because using the army domestically is unpopular here. But army troops will remain until they take the Chechen strongholds of Gudermes, Shali and Argun, Interfax said. There is no chance that those towns can be taken without the use of artillery and air power.
The last cease-fire, in early January, while Russian troops were struggling to take the presidential palace in Grozny, lasted two hours instead of the scheduled 48.

HEADLINE: Texas Joins Parade of States Colliding With Clean Air Act

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Early last month, Texas began a program to help reduce smog by 15 percent in its biggest cities. Auto-exhaust inspections were to be required during the next two years for nearly every car and truck in the Houston and Dallas areas. If Texas did not clean up the air, it stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal money.
The state signed a contract with a company that invested $127 million in private money to set up test stations. "The skies of Texas are upon you," proclaimed bright blue billboards, informing motorists of the new $23-a-car inspections. 
 Then the testing began. A revolt ensued. And now the program is on hold.
It is the same firestorm that has swept through several other states in recent months as the wrath of motorists has combined with a wave of anti-Federal Government sentiment in state capitals to form a potent challenge to the Federal Clean Air Act, the most comprehensive environmental legislation ever enacted.
Some governors and other state leaders argue that in the controversy lie the seeds of a new approach to environmental regulation, in which states will be given far more flexibility to design ways of meeting Federal pollution standards. And indeed a middle way may emerge. But for now, even as the inspection programs are running smoothly in half a dozen states, in many more they are stalled.
In the most thorough tests, the ones that have been strongly preferred by the Environmental Protection Agency, cars are put on treadmill devices, dynamometers. The exhaust and fuel systems are then tested at a variety of engine speeds. When the equipment is working as designed, the test takes only a few minutes.
Although about 80 percent of all cars on the road pass -- that is, meet the standards imposed for a given model year -- the ones that fail can cost their owners anywhere from $50 for a tuneup to hundreds of dollars for major repairs.
In Texas, the uprising against the new inspection program was swift. Newspapers and television news programs were full of reports featuring motorists objecting to the cost or inconvenience of the tests, or both. State lawmakers said they were deluged with complaints. And many drivers said they would refuse to take the tests altogether.
Within days of the program's kickoff, the Legislature rushed to pass a three-month moratorium, which became the first measure the state's new Governor, George W. Bush, signed into law. Several legislators said they hoped the Republican-controlled Congress would amend the Clean Air Act to make the tests unnecessary or, at most, voluntary.
In Maine, intended to be a kind of pilot project for the emissions tests, the program begun last summer has collapsed. In Pennsylvania, the Legislature voted to delay its inspection program late last year, and when Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat who has since left office, vetoed the measure, it promptly overrode him.
In Virginia, Gov. George F. Allen, a Republican, recently sued to block the E.P.A. from enforcing any provisions of the Clean Air Act, including a testing program. And Gov. Pete Wilson of California, also a Republican, railed against major elements of the Clean Air Act at a Congressional hearing late last week.
"We're the ones who breathe our air," Mr. Wilson said, "not the Federal bureaucrats in Washington."
The Clean Air Act also requires reformulated gasoline, a cleaner-burning fuel blend, in most major metropolitan areas, but Pennsylvania has pulled 28 counties out of that program, and New York and Maine are considering withdrawing several counties each.
The open rebellion in Texas and elsewhere against the tests has become a major headache for the Clinton Administration, which has been under relentless pressure to grant delays in the emissions program.
The E.P.A.'s Administrator, Carol M. Browner, has granted delays to several states, including New Jersey and New York. Connecticut's program is operating without major complaints.
The E.P.A.'s approval is required for all pollution reduction programs, and Ms. Browner said she is happy to work with states to make testing procedures, and subsequent repairs for cars that fail, more convenient. But she is adamantly opposed to amending the pollution-reduction goals in the Clean Air Act.
"I do not think the standards should be weakened," Ms. Browner said in a telephone interview. "And I do not think the timeliness should be changed. The American people were told they would have clean air. We are making significant progress in that direction."
Still, if states simply refuse to carry out the tests, the Clinton Administration could be in the awkward position of having to impose sanctions under the Clean Air Act -- including withholding huge chunks of highway transportation aid -- at the end of next year, around the time of the Presidential election.
On the other hand, the emissions program could get a political boost from an unexpected source. A provision of the Republicans' Contract With America calls for the Federal Government to find the most cost-effective way to carry out its programs. When it comes to cleaning up the air, there is probably no cheaper way to do it than by fixing people's cars.
Removing smog-causing pollutants from the air costs roughly $500 a ton through a vehicle-emissions program. Removing pollutants from industrial smokestacks costs anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 a ton, according to E.P.A. figures.
Ms. Browner said that despite a 24 percent reduction in air pollution since the 1970's, 2 out of 5 Americans live in areas that do not meet the air quality standards set by the act.
"We have protected millions of Americans from cancer, heart disease and premature death," she told a House Commerce subcommittee last week. "But more still needs to be done."
The E.P.A. has long favored centralized inspections, arguing that they are both more accurate and less prone to fraud than tests at neighborhood service stations. And most tests at neighborhood stations cannot measure nitrogen oxides, which together with hydrocarbons and sunlight form ozone at ground level. Pollution from cars can be a major lung irritant, especially among children and the elderly, and can inhibit blood circulation.
The tests were to be required in all or parts of roughly half of the states, including almost all of the Northeast. But centralized testing centers proved irritating to motorists, especially in states like Texas, where people whose cars failed were subject to what lawmakers and bureaucrats call "the Ping-Pong effect" -- having to go elsewhere for repairs and then return to inspection stations for a sticker.
Some governors and lawmakers say the clean-air standards are too onerous and should be changed. Still, in Texas and elsewhere, many lawmakers who supported testing moratoriums insist they want to use the time to set up more palatable testing programs.
State Senator John Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston who was the chief sponsor of the moratorium, said Texas ought to create "one-stop" centers where drivers could get emissions and safety inspections and renew registrations.
"What we want, obviously, is a plan that is user-friendly, that will address our clean-air concerns, but not on the basis of inconveniencing the public to the point that they do not support the program," Mr. Whitmire said.
Proposals in other states include "cash for clunkers," in which the government would pay people to trade in old cars. But there are two problems: first, it is not clear just how many miles such cars are actually driven, and second, the programs risk being excoriated as government handouts.
Still, there is logic to the approach: about 15 percent of the cars on the road cause up to 80 percent of the pollution.
The city of Sacramento, Calif., recently completed a four-mouth trial of a promising new technology known as remote sensing. Inspectors hold a device that resembles a radar gun to measure the exhaust of cars passing on the street. Cars that pollute excessively can be pulled over by the police, or a violation notice can be mailed to an address traced through the license-plate number.
The virtue of such a program is that it does not inconvenience the majority of drivers with cleaner cars; the drawback is that the technology is expensive and relatively untested.
Winston Harrington, a senior fellow and economist at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan environmental research group in Washington, said car inspections and repairs were a sound approach to reducing pollution.
"We're looking in the right place," he said. "It's just that we haven't figured out the best way to do this."

HEADLINE: Health Costs Paid by Employers Drop for First Time in a Decade

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Medical costs paid by employers, which had been rising as much as 18 percent annually in recent years, fell last year for the first time in a decade. A decline of 1.1 percent for companies with at least 10 workers was reported yesterday by a widely followed annual survey.
Economists attributed the decline to the growing number of employees covered by cost-conscious health plans that try to eliminate unnecessary tests and procedures and negotiate lower fees with doctors and hospitals. 
 These economists said that by the Labor Department's measure, prices for such services as hospital rooms, doctor fees and X-rays still increased by nearly 5 percent last year, almost double the general rate of inflation. But employers' health costs have declined because they are simply using fewer of those services. For instance, cataract eye surgery no longer requires a hospital stay and is now typically done less expensively at walk-in clinics.
Employers' medical costs have been rising more slowly in the last few years than in the late 1980's, but not until yesterday's report was there evidence of an actual decline. Indicating that the trend might be gaining steam, a separate survey found that health maintenance organizations had lowered their 1995 premium rates, on average, by 1.3 percent.
But the employer cost survey said the declines were most often registered by large employers -- those with more than 500 people -- which cover two-thirds of all insured workers. Taken alone, smaller employers, which have been slower to turn to cost-conscious health plans, reported an increase of 6.5 percent in their medical costs.
Hospitals and doctors may be making up some of their losses when they reduce their fees for large employers by raising charges to smaller concerns.
Some companies are shifting part of their costs to workers by requiring them to reach into their pockets and pay a larger share of their medical bills.
Henry J. Aaron, direct of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, the Washington research center, said the lower employer costs could result from "offloading costs onto employees or curtailing their coverage." But David Rahill of Foster Higgins, the New York benefits consulting firm that conducted the survey, said it "didn't see much evidence of either massive cost-shifting to employees or decreases in coverage."
According to the survey of 2,097 employers, the percentage of employees and their families who were enrolled in the managed care plans jumped to 63 percent last year from 52 percent the year before.
Representatives of business said the survey's results showed they were on the right track last year in helping to defeat the Clinton health plan on the ground that the marketplace was already working to restrain medical costs. They also said that the Medicare program, which is expected to have cost increases of 9 percent annually to 2000, was still generally lacking in the kind of cost-sensitive approaches that businesses had adopted.
The survey results were "really good news," said Helen Darling, a health care economist at the Xerox Corporation, which has moved 73 percent of its employees into health maintenance organizations. She said the company's main H.M.O.'s had reduced their charges by 1.9 percent for 1995.
Mr. Rahill, a principal at Foster Higgins, said, "This is a good year for employers to be pushing for price rollbacks, especially from the H.M.O.'s" and other health plans that had big enrollment increases.
Several economists said the results were an important development, but they warned that the upward climb in costs might resume when the savings from the big switch to managed care plans were absorbed.
"Once everybody is in managed care, are you going to see a pattern of everybody's costs moving up again?" asked Stuart H. Butler, a vice president of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research group in Washington.
Uwe E. Reinhardt a health economist at Princeton University, said, "Very few economists would bet their marbles on this being a permanent trend."
Spokesmen for small businesses said the survey did not deal with the problems of thousands of companies with fewer than 10 employees. Many of these companies dropped health insurance for their workers as prices rose. The number of working-age people without insurance rose by 6.5 million in four years to 40.9 million in 1993, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington.
"The survey doesn't indicate that there are fewer small firms with health care today," Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, said. He has been lobbying Congress to authorize nationwide voluntary employer groups that could buy health care on the same terms as big companies.
Mr. Faris's federation and the United States Chamber of Commerce, which has both large and small employers as members, are also seeking reinstatement of a tax break for medical insurance for small businesses that Congress allowed to expire.
The Foster Higgins survey showed that the average cost of health benefits declined to $3,741 for an employee in 1994, from $3,781 in 1993. Employees with traditional fee-for-service insurance declined to 37 percent from 48 percent. Those enrolled in health maintenance organizations, which typically assign each member to a primary care doctor who must approve tests and referrals to specialists, rose to 23 percent from 19 percent.
Those surveyed were chosen to reflect the working population, so the results are valid for 550,000 employers with 68 million employees, Foster Higgins said. In earlier surveys, the firm simply polled a large group of big companies, mainly its own customers.
H.M.O. enrollment was swelled by "a significant number of retirees" for the first time, particularly in the West, where health maintenance organizations are strong, Mr. Rahill said. Jon Gabel, research director of the Group Health Association of America, a Washington trade group for health maintenance organizations that conducted a survey of H.M.O.'s in November, said 50 million Americans now had H.M.O. coverage, up from 41.4 million at the start of 1993.

HEADLINE: Latest Endangered Species: Natural Habitats of America

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
In the first full review of the health of the American landscape, a new Federal study has concluded that vast stretches of formerly vibrant natural habitat, once amounting to at least half the area of the 48 contiguous states, have declined to the point of endangerment.
Although the plight of individual species has been the focus of public interest, the health of the larger interconnected community of plants, animals and microbes of which they are a part -- the ecosystem, nature's functional unit -- is perhaps more important as a gauge of vitality. 
 The new report finds that scores of ecosystems, of widely varying types and sizes, have declined on a grand but largely unappreciated scale. If the remnants should vanish, say the study's authors, species adapted to them would probably vanish as well.
Thirty of the imperiled ecosystems, including some that dominated and characterized whole regions before Europeans first landed in America, have declined over more than 98 percent of their area and are considered "critically endangered," the study found. Decline was defined as destruction of a natural area, conversion of the area to other land uses -- agriculture, for example -- or "significant degradation" of ecological character or function.
"We're not just losing single species here and there, we're losing entire assemblages of species and their habitats," said Dr. Reed F. Noss, one of three biologists who conducted the study for the National Biological Service, a research organization created within the Interior Department by Secretary Bruce Babbitt in 1993. The study is to be issued by the agency within a month.
"The time is ripe for a concerted effort to identify and protect ecosystems across the United States," the authors wrote. They suggest that conservation plans be developed for each ecosystem by region, "starting with types and regions that sustained the greatest losses and are at greatest risk of further loss."
The study's findings have important implications for Federal policy at a time when laws dealing with conservation, particularly the Endangered Species Act, are under challenge by property-rights advocates and their conservative allies who now control Congress.
The concept of protecting whole ecosystems, rather than single endangered species, which is being increasingly emphasized by conservationists, is embodied in a number of laws governing Federal lands and in several public-private conservation efforts. It has also been promoted by Mr. Babbitt as the Clinton Administration's central strategy for keeping species off the endangered list while accommodating private economic interests.
But the concept is under sharp attack by conservatives who see it as a threat to private property and also fear that the mere act of identifying habitats to be protected may reduce property values.
"We can bury our heads in the sand and say we don't want to be well informed on these issues, or we can say we want to be well informed and have a database that gives us a logical rationale for making decisions," said Dr. J. Michael Scott, an author of the study who is a research biologist with the National Biological Survey. The third researcher, also from the survey, was Dr. Edward T. LaRoe 3d, who died recently.
Among the largest imperiled ecosystems, the study found, are the tallgrass prairies and oak savannas that characterized most of the Midwest before Europeans came to America, along with the original deciduous forests of the Eastern United States and more than 60 million acres of longleaf pine forests that formerly blanketed much of the Southeastern coastal plain. All of these, according to the study, are among the 30 such communities considered critically endangered.
Fifty-eight such areas have declined by 85 to 98 percent and are classed as "endangered," the study says, while 38 others have declined by 70 to 84 percent and are listed as "threatened." The 126 imperiled areas are concentrated most heavily in the eastern half of the country.
As is commonly done by ecologists, the report's authors conceived of ecosystems as relating to each other in hierarchical fashion, with smaller systems existing as elements of larger ones. In this formulation, the global biosphere is at the top of the hierarchy.
Two of the larger types of critically endangered American systems, the Midwestern prairie-savanna and the Eastern forest, together probably covered about 40 percent of the country before Europeans arrived, according to Dr. Scott.
Critically endangered systems toward the smaller end of the scale include localized ecological communities, usually named after their dominant feature as, for example, the Hempstead Plains grasslands on Long Island, the wet coastal prairies in Louisiana, sedge meadows in Wisconsin, lake sand beaches in Vermont, native grasslands in California and streams in the Mississippi alluvial plain.
Some ecosystems, like the Midwestern grasslands, have nearly been destroyed, in this case by conversion to agriculture. Others, like the oak savannas, have suffered what the report defines as degradation. This includes, for example, the suppression of fire, which many ecosystems historically depended on for their biological character and variety. Without periodic clearing by fire, a few invasive foreign species often take over an ecosystem and choke out the original and more numerous array of native plant species.
Still other areas, like the longleaf pine ecosystem, have suffered both types of decline: great swatches have been cut down, and most of the rest has been transformed by fire suppression from pine forests into hardwood stands.
The report's conclusions were based on an extensive, yearlong survey of the scientific literature, of conservation agencies and professionals and of databases maintained by the states. The survey sought to determine first what percentage of a given ecosystem had survived relatively intact; the remainder was judged to be either destroyed, degraded or both. The authors acknowledge that the data are incomplete and of "highly variable quality," that much more research lies ahead, that some of their findings should be treated as hypotheses for further investigation and that their report is not the final answer.
Still, the study, which was reviewed for scientific validity by scientists whose identity was unknown to the authors, represents the first known effort to pull together existing data and provide a continent-wide profile of the health of the natural landscape. And despite "uncertainties and unevenness in the data," the authors wrote in their report, the information "portrays a striking picture of endangerment." The documented unraveling and shrinkage of natural systems, said Dr. Scott, offers a preliminary answer to people who have questioned whether the country's natural assets are really in jeopardy.
Although much of the American landscape may look lush and green, the authors say, this is in many cases deceiving. While it is encouraging that forest cover is increasing in many parts of the Eastern United States, they say, second-growth forests may take centuries to regain their biological richness. The tree plantations that are common in many parts of the country are "structurally and biologically less diverse than natural forests of any age and contain impoverished faunas," the study report says. Replacing an old-growth forest with a tree plantation, it says, causes changes so severe that it qualifies as an absolute loss of habitat.
As ecosystems shrink and unravel, the authors say, the species adapted to them become increasingly imperiled as well. The longleaf pine ecosystem of the Southern coastal plain, for instance, is now home to 27 species on the Federal endangered list and another 99 proposed for listing.
Protection need not be restricted to pristine areas, the authors say. Indeed, they say, degraded but restorable areas may warrant more attention than those that have suffered less severe losses and are not faced with an immediate threat.
In determining which deserve priority, the authors argue, the extent of decline and the seriousness of the threat ought to take precedence over rarity as such. Instead, they wrote, conservation agencies "often focus on the curiosities" -- small, peripheral types of ecological communities, like bogs left behind by the ice age, that have never been numerous and are not facing any special threat.
Many conservation biologists advocate preserving substantial examples of remaining ecosystems as the most efficient strategy for saving as many plant, animal and microbial species as possible. They argue that this will protect many relatively common species that might otherwise become endangered, including many tiny organisms that are now unknown. At the same time, many conservationists see focusing on a relatively large area as the best way to arrange trade-offs between conservation and development.
"You need not declare an ecosystem totally off limits," Dr. Noss said. But in light of the findings about endangerment, he said, the burden of proof ought to be on developers to demonstrate that their activities will not be harmful.
Early in his tenure, Secretary Babbitt endorsed the holistic strategy based on an ecosystem approach. It quickly fell afoul of the property-rights movement, however, which had many allies on both sides of the aisle even before the Republicans won control of Congress in November. The property-rights movement has attacked the National Biological Survey as well, and Mr. Babbitt was forced to create the organization administratively when Congressional approval could not be obtained.
Those issues have not gone away, and indeed promise to resurface strongly as Congress confronts reorganization of the Endangered Species Act later this year.

HEADLINE: Urging Dose of 'Reality Therapy,' Giuliani Sets New Round of Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Saying the city's fiscal problems required a dose of "reality therapy," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told New Yorkers yesterday evening that he would reduce city spending for a second year in a row and cut public assistance and health care for the city's poorest residents.
Although he offered few details in a brief televised address, Mr. Giuliani said the preliminary budget that he is to unveil today would wrench $600 million in savings, or 7 percent, from the city's agencies, and ask the city's unions to agree to an additional $600 million in concessions on benefits and work rules in exchange for a pledge to avert layoffs. 
 The cuts are expected to touch virtually every municipal service, but the deepest reductions will fall on the city's Board of Education. The Mayor's plan, officials said yesterday, will propose $290 million in new cuts to the board, nearly 9 percent of the city's $3.3 billion contribution to the board's overall budget, which totaled $7.7 billion last year. The officials said the Mayor would also look to the powerful teachers' union for $190 million of the union concessions.
In his address, Mr. Giuliani said that the city still faced a projected $2.7 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that begins in July, in spite of the austerity steps taken last year to reduce spending and cut the city's payroll by nearly 20,000 workers by the end of this fiscal year. And the city, he said, could no longer turn to the state and Federal governments for help.
"We must confront the reality that we cannot continue spending substantially more money than other American cities," he said in the address, which was broadcast live on local television and radio stations. "We must confront the reality that the city's fiscal problems will not be solved by Albany or Washington."
While not asking for new aid, Mr. Giuliani called on Gov. George E. Pataki to go further to reduce spending on welfare and Medicaid than the $1.9 billion in reductions Mr. Pataki has proposed. Since the city must match state spending on those programs, more cuts by the state would further ease the city's fiscal crunch.
Sounding the conservative theme he has repeated ever since Mr. Pataki swept into office after a campaign in which the Mayor supported Mr. Pataki's Democratic opponent, Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Giuliani said that he and the Governor shared a belief that spending on welfare and Medicaid needed to be cut. He called for eliminating overly generous benefits, fighting fraudulent claims and making able-bodied welfare recipients work.
In all, Mr. Giuliani's plan will include $1.2 billion in cuts to these "entitlement" programs, $400 million more than the city's estimated savings under the Governor's budget proposal. Even with the cuts, the Mayor said the city and state would still provide among the most generous benefits for the poor in the nation. "We really have no other choice," the Mayor said of cuts in those programs.
The Mayor's preliminary budget represents only the first step toward producing a budget for the 1996 fiscal year that begins in July, serving merely as a broad plan for balancing the city's budget. Many of its proposals -- particularly those in the area of Medicaid -- could face fierce resistance from Democrats on the City Council and from advocacy groups.
Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said yesterday that the Mayor's cuts in education and the concession he seeks from her union members would hurt the system that teaches the city's one million schoolchildren.
"It's hard to see how the system is going to take this cut with another 25,000 additional students coming in," Ms. Feldman said. "We understand the city has big problems, but this would be terrible for education."
Even as he continues to cut spending, the Mayor also said he would move ahead with the tax cuts he first outlined last year -- mentioning specifically an elimination of the city's 4.25 percent sales tax on clothing that costs less than $100 -- as a way to stimulate the economy. That reduction would cost the city $98 million in revenue next year.
Officials also said the Mayor would begin to phase in cuts in property taxes on co-ops and condos, which now pay much higher taxes than single-family homes, totaling $70 million a year. For the owner of an average $200,000 co-op, the Mayor's proposal would save about $180 a year, officials estimated.
In all, the Mayor will propose tax cuts of $184 million, more than the $35 million in hotel and business taxes he cut last year, but modest compared to the deep cuts in income taxes proposed by the Governor.
The Mayor did not specify how he would achieve the $600 million in spending cuts to the city's myriad agencies on top of roughly $2 billion in reductions over the last year. But he did say he would ask his commissioners "to reduce the size of the city's management staff as much as they can and to embrace modern management techniques of doing more with less."
The Mayor's preliminary budget is also expected to move ahead with proposals to restructure municipal government, cutting still more jobs, consolidating smaller agencies and turning more services over to private companies.
Among the proposals, officials said yesterday, the Mayor will propose merging the construction divisions of many agencies into one capital construction agency and combining several smaller economic development agencies, moves intended to eliminate dozens of duplicative administrative jobs.
Before his televised address, the Mayor delivered essentially the same message of austerity in Albany. His appearance before the joint fiscal committees of the Legislature underscored the importance of the state's budget to the Mayor's plans, even if Mr. Giuliani did not call for new aid.
During his testimony, he repeatedly praised Mr. Pataki's budget as beneficial to the city because of the reductions in welfare and Medicaid, which account for roughly 17 percent of the city's spending.
"I see this crisis as a historic opportunity," the Mayor said of the projected deficits bedeviling the city and state budgets. "It is a chance to do what was politically unthinkable just a few years ago."
While most lawmakers treated the Mayor's proposals respectfully, State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Democrat from Manhattan, signaled the potential opposition Mr. Giuliani could face in his efforts to win even deeper cuts in from Albany.
"Frankly, I'm a bit confounded because this is one of the only times that I've been here and a mayor has come and he hasn't asked New York State for more direct assistance," Mr. Leichter said. "Frankly, I think you could have urged that the state budget be fairer to the City of New York."
The City Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, also appeared in Albany yesterday and, in contrast to the Mayor, warned that the Governor's cuts in education, reimbursements for hospitals and money for the mentally ill would hurt the city and belonged in a category of "cuts that don't make sense."

Treasuries' Prices Mixed; Trading Thin

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in thin trading, as investors worried that economic reports this week would show that the Federal Reserve had not raised interest rates enough to reduce the threat of inflation.
Few traders were active ahead of today's report on retail sales for January; that report could set the direction of interest rates for the next few days. Among the other data due, are reports tomorrow on consumer prices, industrial production and capacity utilization. 
 The price of the 30-year bond inched up 1/32 , to 9918/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 7.66 percent, from 7.67 percent on Friday. Short-maturity bills were mixed, as the Treasury held its regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills.
Dealers said the average rate at auction for a new three-month issue dropped 1 basis point, to 5.82 percent, while the average for a six-month bill rose 5 basis points, to 6.15 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The bond market may be paying particular attention to January retail sales, traders said, because they may be one of the first indications that the economy may be changing direction.
January retail sales are expected to rise three-tenths of 1 percent, or six-tenths of 1 percent excluding autos. December sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent and were unchanged when autos were excluded.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, noted that the retail number for November showed a significant downward revision, giving market participants the impression the economy was slowing.
He said the numbers in November and December might have overstated any weakness in retail sales.
"My feeling is that this number will show a small increase for January, but forecasts of January retail sales have been made more difficult because of the lack of confidence that most economists have about the December figure," Mr. Fine said. "As a result, the market may well pay as much attention to the December revision as it will to the January estimate."
The Consumer Price Index will be out tomorrow, and while it is a lagging indicator, its importance is measured by its effect on inflation expectations.
Another source of market concern yesterday, but not a chief one, was the strength of the dollar and how it might be affected by the Mexican Government's military action against the rebels in Chiapas. Supply was another, as some of the $40 billion in new securities auctioned last week have still not been distributed, and consequently many dealers are holding more than they would like.
In addition there is the $500 million global bond offering that the Federal National Mortgage Association plans to sell, competing with government securities for investor interest.
In the municipal bond market so far this year, demand coupled with fewer available new issues, has helped tax-exempt issues outperform benchmark government bonds. Tax-exempt yields as measured by the Bond Buyer's municipal bond index of 40 issues had fallen 37 basis points, to 6.55 percent yesterday, while the yield on the Treasury long bond had fallen only 21 basis points.
Some of the deals due this week that are more than $250 million include the New York State Thruway Authority and Texas Public Finance Authority.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Despite Tough Battle, Fiscal Recovery Is Still Eluding Giuliani

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took office 14 months ago, he set out to solve, once and for all, the city's underlying financial problems, whose resolution had eluded his successor, David N. Dinkins, for four years.
He prepared a budget last spring that eliminated a projected gap of $2.3 billion. When major holes opened in that plan, he imposed more than $1 billion in additional cuts and related savings. 
 He slashed 14,000 jobs from the city payroll, or about 7 percent. He consolidated some agencies. He pressed municipal labor unions for productivity measures and other concessions to make the work force more efficient.
But after all that, as he begins the long process of enacting a budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in July, Mr. Giuliani still finds himself facing a gap estimated at $2.7 billion -- $400 million higher than a year ago.
Financial experts say there are many reasons that the Mayor needs to tighten the screws further, despite a year of aggressive actions intended to curb the fiscal distress that has plagued the city since late 1989.
Foremost, perhaps, is that a brief recovery in the local economy dissipated almost as quickly as it began, leaving Mr. Giuliani and his aides scrambling to offset tax revenues that came in lower than anticipated. A sustained local recovery would have made it far easier to balance next year's budget.
But it was not just a decline in revenues that burdened the Mayor. The areas of city spending that increased most rapidly during the Dinkins administration -- debt service, Medicaid and municipal workers' fringe benefits, particularly health care -- continued to grow under Mr. Giuliani.
The continued growth of those three areas may ultimately offset most of the savings Mr. Giuliani achieved in his first year, some fiscal experts contend. Removing 14,000 jobs from the city work force, for example, could save as much as $700 million a year, when benefits and salaries are taken into account.
But the cost of benefits for the remaining 200,000 city workers in the next fiscal year is likely to grow by more than $700 million, said Jeffrey L. Sommer, acting executive director of the Financial Control Board, the state agency that monitors the city budget.
"It solves your budget problems in a given year," Mr. Sommer said of the Mayor's job cuts. "But it doesn't solve next year's growth in benefits."
Similarly, Mr. Sommer said, the city's debt service continues to grow, in part because Mayor Edward I. Koch, Mr. Dinkins and even Mr. Giuliani sometimes solved short-term problems by refinancing city debt. Debt service accounts for about 13 percent of all city tax revenues in the current fiscal year, Mr. Sommer said. In the next fiscal year, 18 percent of city tax revenues will go for debt service, he said.
"That 5 percent is a big cause of the new gap that they have to close," Mr. Sommer said. "That's why it keeps popping up."
When Mr. Giuliani and the leaders of the City Council begin this spring to debate the final shape of the budget for the next fiscal year, it will mark the fifth year of continual fiscal distress. It is a quiet fiscal crisis, compared with the the city's collapse of the mid-1970's. Then, New York was nearly forced into bankruptcy when it was unable to pay almost $800 million in short-term notes.
Dangling on the precipice, city officials discovered that their bookkeeping had been so sloppy that it was impossible to gauge the exact extent of the deficit. Investors lost confidence, and the city lost access to the financial markets.
By that measure, the current fiscal distress is relatively tame, several budget experts said. But that does not guarantee that its impact on services might not also be severe.
About 60,000 city workers lost their jobs at the height of the fiscal crisis, including thousands of police officers. Tuition was imposed for the first time in the City University.
This time, after five years of budget cutting, the effect on municipal services has been noticeable, but for many residents not so severe. But as the budget gaps get larger -- and the Mayor's options diminish -- the impact could grow sharply in coming months.
In this crisis, unlike the one 20 years ago, the city does not have partners in Albany and Washington to whom it can turn for a bailout. In the 1970's, the state government was in relatively sound financial condition, and Gov. Hugh L. Carey made the city a high priority.
He created two state agencies, the Financial Control Board and the Municipal Assistance Corporation, to help the city get a better handle on its financial condition and to instill confidence in the financial markets. He led a state takeover of several major city services, including the court system and the four-year colleges of the City University.
The Federal Government also helped with loan guarantees that which bought time for the city to install new accounting and fiscal monitoring systems, to trim its expenses and to pay back its short-term debt.
But this time, neither the Republican-controlled Congress nor Gov. George E. Pataki appear willing, or able, to help Mr. Giuliani with new aid. Mr. Pataki faces a budget gap even larger than the Mayor's: $5 billion, including about $1 billion for a promised reduction in state income tax rates.
The major assistance that Mr. Pataki and the Congressional Republicans are offering Mr. Giuliani is relief from spending required by Albany and Washington, especially on Medicaid and welfare. But it is unclear whether that would produce substantial long-term savings for the city, enabling it to eliminate the underlying budget deficit -- or whether it would seriously harm the local economy by throwing out of work thousands of hospital and social service workers, while also depriving the poor of health care.
The Mayor is likely to continue to shrink the size of the city's work force, and many fiscal experts say he also must figure out how to make the remaining workers more productive.
"Rudy Giuliani gets high marks for reducing the size of the government," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit fiscal monitor. "But I don't think you can give him high marks yet for making the government more productive."

For Car Dealers, Familiar Medicine

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 13

 BODY:
It may be of some comfort to anyone who has ever bought a car that few people fall for a sales pitch as easily as auto dealers do.
"They're fish," said Jim Edwards, a Ford dealer from Louisville, Ohio. "The easiest mark in the world is salespeople, because they're unable to stand the pressure." 
 Mr. Edwards had just succumbed to a blistering sales pitch, buying a Little Giant Ladder -- "One Ladder Does It All" -- for only $349 (with freight charges and two, count 'em, two free accessories thrown in), at the annual National Automobile Dealers Association Convention here.
About 6,000 dealers and sales managers -- and some 12,000 family members, exhibitors, and assorted auto groupies -- are gathered here for four days to celebrate a banner 1994, share anxieties about an uncertain 1995 and fall for the occasional offer from one of the more than 440 exhibits of car washing machines, car lifts, screwdrivers, advertising strategies, canopies, license plate garnishes and, of course, ladders.
A record number of salespeople were flogging products to the nation's premier salespeople, amazing even some experienced attendees.
"There are even companies that take off the parts that we put on cars to put on other parts, and you kind of wonder what it's all about," said John F. Smith, Jr., president and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, who addressed the dealers on Saturday.
 
From Chrysler, Ceviche
 Because almost all auto dealers made money in 1994, there has been considerable celebration here. Perhaps the most elaborate party was given at a downtown hotel by the Chrysler Corporation.
In the lobby, one woman in a red tafetta-esque gown strummed the harp, while another played the organ, warbling "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" and other favorites. At the door, a man with a fox skin on his head and a rifle in his hands introduced himself as Davy Crockett, while other actors in period dress portrayed other notable Texans.
Inside, as an 11-piece band blared and neon cactuses glowed, hundreds of dealers visited the free bars and gobbled shrimp, ceviche, salmon and tamales.
"Thank the Lord, Chrysler products have been well received," said Jim Rutledge, a dealer from Hampton, S.C.
 
Of Sales and Pitches
 But how long will the good times last? Far more pessimistic than the domestic auto makers, the auto dealers' association predicts that 1995 will be the last strong year of this recovery. Tom Webb, the economist for the association, said here that car and light-truck sales would rise by less than 3 percent this year, to 15.4 million.
"I'm guaranteeing that this year is going to be good," Mr. Webb said. "I'm not guaranteeing that next year will be good."
All auto sales are local, so dealers have widely varying opinions about the state of the business. Dealers in southern Texas are worried about the devaluation of the Mexican peso, while northern dealers are worried about the cold snap.
Most remain optimistic, however. "The sky is not falling, Chicken Little," said Patrick Tynan, a Denver dealer who sells Isuzu, Volkswagen, Kia and Nissan vehicles.
But they share one worry. "Everybody lives in fear of added interest rate increases," said Keith E. Crain, publisher of Automotive News, a trade weekly, who uses the convention to study dealers' views. But, he said, "the attitudes are bullish."
Mr. Crain paused, then added, "That's the ultimate ladder," nodding across the aisle to the Little Giant Ladder exhibit. "But I feel like I'm watching a Veg-O-Matic demonstration."
Steven W. Steenblik, the slightly sweaty salesman, was balanced atop one of his products, showing a cluster of rapt dealers the way it enabled him to reach more than 14 feet in the air.
With one day left in the show, Mr. Steenblik, of Wing Enterprises in Springville, Utah, said he had sold 36 ladders for an average of $400 each. "Entice 'em, get 'em on the ladder and ask for their order," Mr. Steenblik said, summarizing his technique.
Mr. Steenblik had some of the best training imaginable for his job. He put himself through college selling Chryslers and Saabs.

HEADLINE: Mr. Yeltsin's Health

 BODY:
No one in Russia understands the power of political imagery better than President Boris Yeltsin, who consolidated his leadership when he helped stop the August 1991 coup by standing on a tank and urging his countrymen to resist the attempted takeover. That makes his stumbling appearance last Friday at a meeting in Kazakhstan with the leaders of 12 former Soviet republics all the more shocking and puzzling.
At a moment when his presidency has been badly shaken by the brutal Russian attack on Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin wobbled across the sidewalk in the Kazakh capital of Almaty, desperately gripping aides for support. His face was puffy and sallow. Before canceling a later news conference, he attempted to answer questions at a photo session and was barely able to speak. These scenes were filmed by Associated Press Television, but not broadcast on the main Russian television news. 
 After years of dodging questions about his health and his drinking, Mr. Yeltsin owes his country and the world a candid accounting. The performance in Almaty moves the issue beyond the discreet conversation of diplomats, because Mr. Yeltsin's ability to govern Russia is now in question.
Russia, which has been moving into a more democratic and open era, seems eerily similar to the pre-Gorbachev Soviet Union when the faltering health of three consecutive Communist Party leaders -- Leonid Brezhnew, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko -- was considered a state secret.
Mr. Yeltsin has complained of a bad back, and may be on medication to ease the pain. He reported a "physical breakdown" in 1987 when he was hospitalized after a confrontation with Mikhail Gorbachev that led to his dismissal from the Politburo. Supporters say Mr. Yeltsin has a low tolerance for alcohol and can disable himself for days with an evening of heavy drinking. The last sign of trouble came in the fall when Mr. Yeltsin snubbed Irish leaders waiting to greet him during a refueling stop in Ireland. Aides said he had overslept.
Whatever the problem, or combination of problems, Mr. Yeltsin cannot expect to retain authority when he seems incapacitated and offers no explanation. Moscow's political culture, beginning long before the Bolsheviks, has not been kind to wounded leaders, and even in this more democratic day the piranhas will strike swiftly. Hiding the truth about Mr. Yeltsin's health will only increase the chances for plotting and instability.
For the United States, the International Monetary Fund and others considering expanded financial assistance for Russia, Mr. Yeltsin's behavior can only encourage doubts about the condition of a developing democracy where something as critical as the health of the president is cloaked by his staff. If Mr. Yeltsin remains committed to untangling Russia from its authoritarian past, he and his doctors must quickly come clean.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Shows Little Change As Batch of Data Is Awaited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday as dealers anticipated that this week's economic reports would show signs of accelerating inflation, hurting American stocks and bonds.
The dollar slipped against the yen as Japanese exporters sold dollars and bought yen to bring money home before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31, traders and analysts said. In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 98.72 yen from 98.93 on Friday. 
 In early trading, the dollar fell to 1.5161 German marks, its lowest level since Feb. 2. The dollar later recovered to 1.5212 marks, up from 1.5192 on Friday. The dollar edged up to 1.2855 Swiss francs from 1.2820. The British pound slipped to $1.5625 from $1.5630.
The currency market's concern about inflation revived after the producer price report for January, released on Friday, showed a 1 percent rise in raw materials and semifinished goods, sending bond prices lower.
Dealers said yesterday that they were expecting more clues about inflation from a spate of economic numbers due this week, including January retail sales figures today and the consumer price report tomorrow.
"Everyone will look at the bond market to see which way it's going, and then the dollar will probably follow," said Jim Raphael, currency trader at NatWest USA Bancorp in Jersey City.
But more signs of inflation could also reignite speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again soon, currency traders and analysts said. Higher rates often help the dollar by making interest-bearing deposits in the United States more attractive, but in recent weeks currency traders have been focusing on the possibility of higher inflation and how that would be bad for bonds.
Dollar sales by Japanese exporters depressed the dollar against the yen yesterday, traders said. The exporters earn money in dollars, which they must sell for yen when they send revenue home.
Japan runs a $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, leaving its exporters with a hoard of dollars to exchange for yen.
In each of the last two years, the dollar has declined against the yen during February and March because of the repatriation of funds, said Joe Francomano, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York.
"There's nothing you can put your finger on that's going to help the dollar against the yen with repatriation looming," he said.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Huskies' Men Join Women as Leaders of the Pack

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
More than two decades after the passage of Title IX called upon universities to provide equivalent athletic opportunities for women, Connecticut created an unprecedented form of equality yesterday: two teams in the same place, from the same place.
The Connecticut men (19-1), one day after their emotionally taxing victory at Syracuse, were voted No. 1 in the Associated Press news media poll and the CNN/ USA Today coaches' poll for the first time. The women's team (21-0) retained the top spot it has held for a month with its victory at Seton Hall. 
 The surprise is not that it happened, but that the same school had never appeared at the top of both lists since the first women's poll 19 years ago. Not at Chapel Hill, where North Carolina's women's team won the 1994 national collegiate championship and the men won their tournament the year before. Not at U.C.L.A., where the dynastic achievements of the men overshadowed outstanding female athletes. Not at Virginia or North Carolina State or Iowa, where the accomplishments of the women have built upon the traditions established by the men.
"It's rarefied air," said Dee Rowe, a special adviser for athletics at Connecticut, the men's basketball coach from 1969 to 1977 and a part of the Storrs campus for 26 years. "It's stratospheric. I don't know that I'm a wordsmith, but it is stratospheric."
And yet the response to the accomplishment was muffled by the absence of either team on campus during Sunday afternoon, and perhaps by the tasks to come. A part of campus that has been the scene of spontaneous bonfires in the past was reportedly quiet on Sunday, and gathering places, while crowded and loud, were not unusually crazy.
"They were excited," said Sean Scraba, an owner of Huskies, a bar and restaurant on the Storrs campus. "But I don't think you'll see anything until Tuesday night. People kind of go on their merry way. Maybe kids are more civilized these days."
The women's team, which learned of the victory at Syracuse before the trip home from Seton Hall, did not practice yesterday and players were unavailable. "It's almost like it was expected," said Geno Auriemma, the coach of the women's team. "It's like they thought: 'Of course we're going to win. Of course they're going to be No. 1.' It wasn't: 'Can you believe what happened?' It hasn't been that way at all."
Or maybe the status of Storrs as the center of the basketball universe, while temporarily directing attention away from the state's economic problems, could not obscure the immediate task of the men.
The game tonight between Connecticut and Georgetown at Landover, Md., will mark the third time in 11 days that the nation's top-ranked men's team appears in the Washington area. The last two games caused the No. 1 teams to forfeit their ranking, following the Massachusetts loss at George Washington on Feb. 5 and North Carolina's defeat at Maryland a week ago tonight.
On Sunday evening, as the Huskies traveled south following their victory at the Carrier Dome, the meeting with Georgetown was a challenge for some other day. "I'm not sure we needed wings to get from Syracuse to Washington," Jim Calhoun, the men's coach, told reporters before practice yesterday. "The flight didn't seem bumpy. The food was great. People slept wonderfully.
"Somehow, an hour-and-20-minute flight seemed to take 50 minutes. If we lost, it would have seemed to be over two hours. It was just a special night."
Last night, the Huskies planned a private tour of the White House, an experience that will make fans nervous even if the plans began long before the No. 1 ranking took shape. If the White House is normally a destination that follows a championship season, so is Disney World, where the team rested during spring vacation last year on the way to Miami for a regional semifinal loss to Florida.
Even if a loss to Georgetown could cause the Huskies to become another disposable No. 1 team, the longtime followers of the program could appreciate being there. Decades before the bright campus arena, the sellout crowds for men and women and the command of the Big East conference, New England's best teams were usually considered less worthy than established powers from traditional leagues.
Rowe remembered his senior year of high school, 1947, when Holy Cross won the national championship at the old Madison Square Garden and the train station at Worcester, Mass., became the scene for an unforgettable celebration. Now comes a season in which Massachusetts and Connecticut have taken their turns at No. 1.
"If you've never been there," Rowe said, "and Connecticut has never been there, to be No. 1, it's very special. It's a great accomplishment, even if you're just queen for the day. Nobody in my neighborhood has been there."

Empty Stadiums, but Very Full Coffers

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Hooray for public financing of baseball stadiums!
Three cheers for lotteries and wine, booze, cigarette, hotel and sales taxes! Without 'em, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Jacobs Field, The Ballpark at Arlington, Coors Field and Comiskey Park would not exist. And without 'em, they wouldn't pay for themselves, even during the baseball strike. 
 The philosophy behind municipalities bankrolling new stadiums is not to rely on the revenues from team rent or other ball park revenues, but to have cities and states issue bonds that are paid off via taxes or a lottery.
What makes this method of financing so alluring is that the public keeps paying when there are no fannies in the seats, in the off season or during a strike. The taxes will even keep flowing during replacement baseball.
Public financing does not judge the quality of play. Even if the fans will.
And while there will be fans or legislators who will squawk that taxes keep paying for stadiums shuttered by a strike, the relatively painless forms of taxes (and lotteries) will probably keep any rebellion at bay.
"If this goes on a lot longer, I can envision people saying, 'We won't support this,' " said Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois and a critic of public spending on sports facilities. "But getting governments to turn things back won't happen very easily."
If not for the dollars guaranteed by taxes and lotteries, the stadium bond issues would not exist. Rent or other stadium revenues are far from enough.
"We don't have to worry about bond failures," said Bruce Hoffman, the executive director of the Maryland Stadium Authority, operator of Camden Yards.
"The effect of the strike doesn't affect our ability to service our bonds," said John McMichael, the vice president of business operations for the Texas Rangers, who moved into The Ballpark last year. The $135 million bond issue that provided most of The Ballpark's backing comes from a half-cent sales tax. Each year, the cost of paying, or servicing, the debt is $11 million. Tax collections for the past year are running at $15 million.
And the sales tax keeps paying and paying and paying.
The biggest problem caused by the strike is that, games or no games, the Rangers must pay the city its annual rent of $3.5 million a year. But it's not so bad. Player salaries and operating costs are way down, too.
"It's a burden, but the rent was important for our financing," McMichael said. "It affects our cash flow, but not the financing of the ball park."
To run Chicago's Comiskey Park, the state provides the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority with $18 million a year for maintenance costs and debt service on $150 million in bonds. Proceeds from a 2 percent hotel tax, enacted to finance the stadium, provides $8 million; $5 million, each, comes from the state and Chicago. No rent from the White Sox is needed to pay the debt.
Because the strike reduced the White Sox's payments to the authority from $2.6 million in 1993 to $912,670 in 1994, however, the state will get a smaller rebate.
Last week, three Illinois legislators who are upset over the strike threatened to cut off the hotel tax to help force a settlement. But the stadium authority said that cutting off the tax would only hurt its ability to send the state a surplus.
At Cleveland's Jacobs Field, "sin taxes" on alcohol, wine and cigarettes back the $117 million in stadium bonds that financed the bulk of construction.
Of $16 million collected in taxes, $10 million went last year to pay debt on the bonds. Another $1.4 million went to pay the debt on a bank loan, and the rest went to pay debt on the stadium's sister facility, the Gund Arena.
Of course, sin taxes are strike-resistant because people drink and smoke regardless of the state of Donald Fehr and John Harrington's relations. Collections have fallen a bit over the past two years because people are smoking less, said Tom Chema, executive director of the Gateway Economic Development Corporation, which operates Jacobs Field and the Gund Arena.
Although the strike slashed the Indians' rent payment by about $1.1 million, to $3 million, the shortfall did not harm Jacobs Field rent payments. It did give Gateway the chance to pay off some debt on the Gund Arena, however.
There are no financing woes in Baltimore. The Orioles paid only $7.5 million in rent, below the expected $10 million. But the $20 million needed to cover debt service and operating costs at Camden Yards were more than covered by rent, other stadium revenues and a whopping $26.7 million raised by instant lottery sales. Surplus revenues go toward financing a football stadium.
"We can do without any rent from the Orioles," said Hoffman.
Has the strike had an impact on the credit worthiness of the stadium bonds? Hardly, said Mitchell Zietz, senior management consultant for Public Financial Management, a Philadelphia financial firm, said: "All it does is make credit analysts sharpen their pencils a bit and say, 'What if?' "
Sam Katz, a prominent consultant on stadium financing, said: "Although an element of risk that's a little more real now, the rationale for public financing of sports facilities will continue to overwhelm the criticism."
That, of course, is a 900-word lesson in why George M. Steinbrenner 3d has never offered to spend his own money to get himself a new stadium for the Yankees.

Quoth the Audience, 'Nevermore'

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER 

 BODY:
By the final, frigid day of the New York men's fashion collections last Wednesday, audiences no longer looked as if they were taking notes on the clothes on the runway. Rather, they might have been composing their own personalized versions of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven." Never has fashion presented a vision as dark, dreary, weak and weary as this one for men for fall 1995.
What was most significant in this uninspired group of almost 30 shows, produced for the first time under the auspices of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, was that the drabness seemed completely unintended. There was no coded message about a treacherous economy nor any new resolve to blend in with the concrete city landscape. As comforting as such rationales may be, it seems the designers used fashion week mainly to show the clothes that men already wear, with no coherent vision of what men should be wearing. 
 The shows operated heedless of headline news that even the International Business Machines Corporation is no longer "suiting" its employees. They operated in flagrant disregard of an emerging body consciousness among men, who, like women, look bulky in draped clothes and heavy fabrics. Ignoring the less commercial fashion directions from Europe, the shows offered no fashion direction of their own.
Which was why Ralph Lauren's off-the-runway vision -- a solid, impeccably fitted suit hugging the shoulders and nipped at the waist -- drew such raves from viewers. Mr. Lauren's newest suit, which he modeled himself in his showroom, is the antithesis of a languid, loose Italian one: it enhances the upper body, chiseling it. Mr. Lauren said that even if I.B.M. was retiring the suit, men would still want to look powerful, an effect his suit provided. Under a new purple Ralph Lauren label, the suits will run $2,000 and will be tailored in stores.
What Mr. Lauren has in common with the other two designers in the New York triumvirate, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, is that he has succeeded in creating a Ken for his Barbie. A woman who wears these designers' clothes will want her man to wear the counterpart collection.
Ms. Karan's men's show was, like her women's collections, for aspirational New Yorkers. If the stereotypical New Yorker wears black, so did her models. Her collection was cool and subtle, with models in shades, and colors to match -- black leather peacoats, black shirts with dark ties under suits, sharp black double-breasted suits with bright white shirts beneath, all ready to be photographed for a moody New York movie. It was also one of the few shows with sex appeal: perhaps Ms. Karan understands best how women want to see their men.
Mr. Klein's men looked as if they had been shot from a petroleum-jelly-coated vacuum tube. Their hair was straight and plastered to their heads (think Marcia Brady), their clothes stripped of all excess. The only color was an occasional slash of a jazzman-thin tie, in a burgundy he called "bloodstone." As with his women's collection, the strength was in the subtraction. But there was a sadder quality to these clothes, like the dress of the poet who wanders the world asking, "Is that all there is?" before tying his tie in a noose and heading for a tree.
The most directional clothes -- sometimes directional to a fault -- were by Richard Tyler, Jon Weiser for Artifact and John Bartlett.
Mr. Tyler, still aching from his break with Anne Klein, showed a resolute collection, redolent of the velvet days of the Rolling Stones. Suits were fitted to accommodate exhaling only, each outfit combined with a calculated eye on the applause meter: a purple velvet jacket with purple tie and shirt, a silver sheen washed over tweed, a rusty spread-collar suit, a trench belted over bright red plaid tapered trousers. The models all looked like rock stars skulking out the stage door after a concert, a fake fur thrown over a shoulder, a fedora pulled low, shoulders hunched to avoid recognition.
It is perhaps no surprise that Mr. Weiser, who combs all of Europe for distinctive clothes to set his Charivari boutique apart, produced one of the most successful shows in New York. There was nothing bleak here, and a lot that was new: pullovers in Persian lamb and fake fur; colorful Chinese silk brocades cut into vests, shirts, jeans and jackets; Carnaby suits with silky shirts beneath, and sculptured Mad Max leather trousers and jackets.
John Bartlett's libretto was a little hard to follow this season. Was the inspiration Luke Skywalker, the hero brought to mind by swashbuckling suspenders that crossed the body? Was it Bambi, suggested by models in aqua suits with antlers stuck into their coiffed hair? Was it gangsters gone soft in gray suits with candy-colored shirts and pink fedoras? Mr. Bartlett has a fine mind, but he left most of his audience behind this season. What looked right were body-enhancing trousers, slim fitted one-button jackets and trim cardigans and striped sweater vests.
Robert Massimo Freda has been promoted as a tailor in the publicity surrounding his award this year from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Yet, that seems to translate only into a love of fabrics, not fit. One pair of pants was so voluminous it dragged on the runway. Others were rolled at the cuff two or three times to avoid that fate. The result over all was of small men in big men's clothes, not a look many men would understand.
Tommy Hilfiger often seems to fashion what the Monkees were to music: a creation of marketing. While no one can argue with his financial success (his company, which is publicly owned, reported his salary at $3.5 million for the year ending March 1994), he has much to prove as a designer. The strongest message from his show was "Men can mix." Three-piece suits, in plaids, pin stripes and tweeds, were swapped back and forth in every combination. It's a game most men can play with what they already own. The Hilfiger line, the Nautica collection designed by David Chu, and Hugo Boss all seemed to be more about flexing commercial clout than advancing fashion. What was lacking was what every designer label needs: a signature.
There was an identity at Tommy Zung, where the designer played with proportions and Asian influences to create men's clothes with the cinched waist of a kimono and the seduction of a smoking jacket. New Republic, designed by Thomas Oatman, showed a zealously Anglophile collection right down to black velvet knickers and Norfolks for evening. Richard Edwards, designed by Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick, perfectly captured the demands of hip dressing, with nudges to sports jerseys and clothes in just-got-paid bright white and vivid colors, and flattering jean-cut trousers. Industria was at its salt-of-the-earth best, this season adding belted back jackets to its sumptuous staples.
But there was no stronger signature for men's wear than that of Wolfgang Joop, who matches the money he spends on advertising and runways with ideas and humor, dollar for dollar. A magenta satin suit with a red turtleneck! A purple one with electric-blue turtleneck! Leopard fedoras with pin-stripe suits!
Here was something to watch. As for most of the other shows, watching the models walk down the runways was like watching men walk down the street. And no one needs to set aside four special days, indoors, under hot lights, to accomplish that.

HEADLINE: White House Forecast Says Rates Could Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton's economic advisers, suggesting that the Federal Reserve's drive to slow the economy to a more sustainable growth rate is on the right track, predicted today that short-term interest rates could start to fall before the end of the year.
Also, disputing the assertions of a vocal minority, the economic advisers reluctantly concluded that the long-run growth potential of the American economy had not substantially improved. 
 "The preponderance of the available empirical evidence supports the conventional wisdom that the economy's productive capacity is expanding at roughly a 2.5 percent annual rate," the President's Council of Economic Advisers said in its annual report on the economy. A slight rise in productivity in recent years, the report said, is being offset by slower population growth.
Some analysts say the economy can expand much more rapidly without causing inflation to accelerate. That position makes them critical of the Federal Reserve's yearlong policy of trying to slow the economy by raising interest rates.
The council predicted that with the higher interest rates, the economy would achieve a "soft landing" this year. Indeed, by bringing the actual growth rate of the economy -- which reached 4 percent last year -- closer to its long-run potential, the Federal Reserve will not need to keep raising interest rates, the advisers said.
"The moderation in growth, we think, will lead to some easing in short-term interest rates," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the three-member panel.
The Administration forecast that the economy would expand 2.4 percent in 1995, measuring from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year.
The report disputed the predictions of some analysts from the auto industry and elsewhere that an overdose of higher interest rates might tip the economy toward recession.
Among the council's predictions were that the yield on three-month Treasury bills would drop to 5.5 percent in 1996 from the current 5.95 percent; that the rate of increase in consumer prices would climb six-tenths of a percentage point, to 3.2 percent, and that the unemployment rate would average between 5.5 and 5.8 percent, or about the same as the January rate of 5.7 percent.
At a photo session in the Oval Office to highlight the report, President Clinton attacked Republicans who have said his budget does not do enough to curb the budget deficit.
"I find it amazing," the President said, "that people who were here digging the country in the hole I've been digging us out of are now saying I'm not getting us out quick enough. Where were they, and where are they?"
Citing House Speaker Newt Gingrich among other Republican leaders, Mr. Clinton said that "all those people, including the Speaker" helped quadruple the deficit during the Republican Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Mr. Clinton did not mention that Democrats had control of both houses of Congress for 6 of those 12 years and that they ran the House of Representatives for all 12 years.
In its detailed analysis of how rapidly the economy can expand on a sustained basis without driving up inflation, the council noted that some analysts said output could grow perhaps as much as 5 percent a year, or about twice the 2.5 percent accepted by "most mainstream" economists.
Such analysts point to an increased growth of productivity in the last five years or so, perhaps the result of new technology being effectively harnessed by a new generation of middle managers operating in slimmed-down corporations.
But the council, while finding a "hint" that productivity growth has picked up, said it "pales in comparison to the decline that occurred earlier in the postwar period."
Over all, the council concluded, there is no basis yet "for adjusting one's view of the appropriate stance of monetary and fiscal policy."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Economic Forum Set
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (Reuters) -- President Clinton said today that he would convene an economic conference for the end of March similar to the one he held during his transition to the Presidency two years ago.
"I think it would be a good thing to get those people back together, not only to review the progress that has been made, but more importantly, to look at the thorny problems that remain," Mr. Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office.
He said that two years ago the focus was on getting the nation out of recession. Now, he said, the emphasis should be on the "squeeze" facing the middle class and the need to "spread the benefits of economic recovery" to a wider group.
The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said the forum would be held in late March at a site still to be determined.

HEADLINE: Mexican Economic Slide Has Only Begun

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Mexico's Banks: A Weak Link in the Rescue Plan" (Business Day, Feb. 9): 
 The weakness of the Mexican banking system was pointed out by the economist Carlos Heredia at a Jan. 13 news conference we organized at the National Press Club. Mr. Heredia, a former Government economist who now works for Equipo Pueblo, an independent think tank, also predicted the mortgaging of Mexico's oil reserve to guarantee a United States bailout plan.
Unlike your coverage, Mr. Heredia saw the pending banking crisis
as a symptom of an economy crumbling at its very foundation after 12 years of "structural adjustment" promoted by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury.
The changes brought about during this "adjustment" have resulted in the economic polarization of Mexican society with a score of new billionaires, a shrinking middle class and a burgeoning number of poor. Removal or restriction of Government support and tight credit have devastated small and medium-size industrial and agricultural producers, while imports have increased (even more under the North American Free Trade Agreement), further undercutting local production.
Mr. Heredia called on the international financial institutions and the Mexican and United States governments to admit that the "structural adjustment" policies -- privatizations, wage restraint, cuts in social services and subsidies, elimination of trade barriers and removal of restrictions on foreign capital -- had failed. He warned that a United States bailout would only postpone the collapse of an export-oriented, import-dependent economy reliant on speculative foreign capital.
But the Clinton Administration and the I.M.F. have accompanied bailout funds with requirements to intensify policies that first caused the crisis.

HEADLINE: Strategies on Mexico Cast Aside

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The peso's crash has knocked American businesses off course, forcing many to postpone their dreams of exploiting the vast market to the south. At the same time, other companies are rushing to expand investments in Mexican factories that will increase their exports to the north.
These shifts suggest that the North American Free Trade Agreement's second year will have far fewer benefits for many American companies and their workers than its first year. 
 Wal-Mart Stores, which has seen Mexico as the next stage after its push across the United States, has cut shipments to Mexico and stopped work on 25 new stores, many already well under construction. American beef prices have fallen as Mexican ranchers, desperate for dollars, unload their herds north of the border, while Mexican consumers buy much less American meat. The Mexican auto market, where American-made vehicles account for half of all sales, has seen sales fall about 40 percent since the devaluation.
These days, trucks still back up on the Mexican side of the border, but seldom on the United States side.
"Very much less southbound; no decrease northbound," said Michael Miles, executive vice president of the Miles Group of El Paso, which handles trade shipments and warehousing.
The effects of the peso's fall, which makes American goods more expensive in Mexico and Mexican products cheaper in the United States, are too fresh to document with figures. But reports from companies so far confirm the predictions of many analysts. As Mexico suffers a slump expected to turn last year's American trade surplus with Mexico into a large deficit, the United States economy is likely to suffer job losses of tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands.
Some companies are forging ahead, confident of Mexico's long-term growth. The trade pact's critics, however, are claiming vindication. "The U.S. trade surplus with Mexico was a function of the high value of the peso rather than the liberalization of the economy," said Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research center that has been critical of the North American trade accord.
The pact was billed as much narrower than Europe's broad economic union. But the drop in the peso highlights how much more closely the fortunes of Mexico and the United States are bound together than they were before.
To support the Mexican economy, which late last year virtually matched Japan's as the second-largest market for American exports, after Canada, the Clinton Administration has been forced to offer $ 20 billion in loans as part of a $ 50 billion international rescue package. Mexico -- barred by the trade agreement from reviving past protectionism -- responded to the crisis by speeding the opening of transportation, communications and finance to foreign investors, even committing once-sacrosanct oil revenue to secure the American loans.
"Has Nafta turned out to be more all-embracing than we expected?" asked Sidney Weintraub, director of the United States-Mexico Project at the University of Texas in Austin. "Yes, once you have a partner of that nature, you have to come to the rescue in a way you wouldn't have earlier. The two countries, like it or not, are deeply intertwined."
Many companies have coordinated their North American operations so closely that labor unrest in Mexico resulting from the peso's plunge led to production shutdowns far to the north. A wildcat strike that began two weeks ago at a Thomson Consumer Electronics plant making television components in Juarez, Mexico, threw 1,300 workers off the job at a television assembly plant in Bloomington, Ind., and another 500 at a factory making plastic cabinets in Indianapolis. Thomson sells television sets under the General Electric and RCA brand names.
The Mexican workers, outraged over the plunging value of their money, demanded a 30 percent raise. They returned to work last week with a 13 percent raise, but the American workers were idled for a week.
"You must recognize that Juarez is a dollar-based economy" just across the border from El Paso, said Richard J. Knoph, a company spokesman. "Workers are paid in pesos."
The peso's fall, making it cheaper to export to the United States, has fired the interest of several companies in building or expanding factories just across the border. Bryan Cook, director of business development for the Parque Industrial del Norte in Reynosa, Mexico, said a number of large companies have called him since the currency's collapse. 'They were looking, but now we've crunched the numbers again," he said. "At least five companies want to accelerate their plans."
The trade pact, which took effect in January 1994, produced gains that surprised even its supporters. Shipments between the United States and Mexico rose more than 20 percent, in both directions. Last year's momentum, however, has stalled.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that the peso's collapse will cost 20,000 to 30,000 American jobs this year, in part because exports to Mexico will decline by $ 10 billion, or more than 20 percent. Some private economists expect the job losses to run much higher.
Labor leaders contend that the predicted job losses fail to reflect the full impact on American workers. They point out that the threat to move south of the border, made more tempting by the peso's fall, can lower wages or force unions to swallow bitter settlements.
Last summer, the Leviton Manufacturing Company got a thousand members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers at a Warwick, R.I., electrical outlet plant to accept a two-year wage freeze. Otherwise, the company said, the production would move to Mexico, where Leviton already has several factories.
"The intent of the negotiations and the agreement was to preserve their jobs in Rhode Island by sharing cost concessions with the company," said Richard Millar, Leviton's vice president of marketing.
Despite the present turmoil, which makes forecasting so difficult, American companies from General Electric to Nike still see vast opportunities emerging in Mexico.
G.E.'s exports to Mexico, for example, rose 68 percent last year, to about $ 300 million, with locomotives, electrical and medical equipment selling briskly. Its Mexican plants increased their sales about 18 percent, to more than $ 1 billion, with about half of that total exported to the United States.
General Electric, which has learned to shelter much of its earnings from currency storms, now plans to invest even more in Mexico, especially to take advantage of accelerated Mexican privatization in power generation, transportation and finance.
"In the long run we see the importance of the market," said Kenneth Brown, chairman and chief executive of General Electric of Mexico. "It means our strategy of investing in the country stays the same."
To protect against the volatile currency, G.E. tries to balance peso and dollar costs and revenue. Among other things, it finances factories aimed at the export market and real estate projects with leases payable in dollars.
Even if Mexican workers win some raises, companies wanting to build Mexican plants to export their products stand to come out ahead. Investment and production costs in pesos have fallen while they can reap revenues in dollars. The advantage could even lead to a shift of some low-wage production from Asia to Mexico.
Nike is negotiating to make its athletic shoes in Mexico, for the 90 million people in the Mexican domestic market first, Latin America more broadly, and ultimately perhaps the United States.
Lower labor costs resulting from the peso's plunge are one attraction, said Keith Peters, a Nike spokesman. But the long-range lure of the Mexican market inspired the company's look at the nation more than a year ago. Nike makes more than a quarter of its shoes in China, but Mexican tariffs and a United States trade dispute threaten to price Chinese imports out of Mexico.
Companies like Nike and the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, a poultry processor in Pittsburg, Tex., say they are not about to let a short-term currency crisis chase them out of a region they see as ultimately destined for much greater prosperity.
Pilgrim's Pride put its chickens in so many more Mexican pots in 1994, thanks in part to the trade pact, that the company aimed to increase its sales by 40 percent in 1995.
Then the peso plunged. A resulting $ 4.3 million loss nearly wiped out the company's quarterly profit, and the expansion plan is under review.
Still, Pilgrim's Pride says it will persist. Mexicans, who have doubled their per-person consumption of chicken from eight years ago, still eat less than half as much as Americans.
"We still have faith in our long-term decision," said Clifford E. Butler, the chief financial officer. "One month does not make a year, and one year does not make a career."

HEADLINE: Batter Up, Already

BYLINE: By Andrew Zimbalist; Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College and author of "Baseball and Billions," is a founder of the United Baseball League, a partnership among players, owners and cities that plans to begin play in 1996.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
With two days to go until spring training, and with the Republican leadership in Congress apparently unwilling to lift a finger to settle baseball's paralyzing six-month labor dispute, fans must be in a state beyond despair. But the situation is not hopeless -- at least not yet.
To get real baseball in 1995, Congress needs to get involved now. It won't do to wait until June, when some have said they plan to revisit the issue, to see if the players and owners come together. The current negotiations were opened by the owners in December 1992, and the sides are little closer today than they were then. The most significant movement has been toward ever greater rancor and distrust. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich and his Republican colleagues have offered several arguments for staying out of the baseball dispute. None hold water. Perhaps the silliest is that Congress has better things to do with its time.
President Clinton proposed to submit the baseball dispute to a panel of arbitrators whose decision would be binding; passing such a bill would establish a fair fact-finding process and get real baseball back on the field, and it would take Congress half of an afternoon to pass it -- far less time than Mr. Gingrich spent saying he didn't want to get involved.
Republicans say Congress does not belong in the baseball industry, but that argument comes more than 70 years too late. Congress has repeatedly sanctioned baseball's anachronistic exemption from the antitrust laws, and rather than setting a clear and consistent policy, it threatens baseball with lifting the exemption every time a new senator wants an expansion franchise in his or her state.
Last June, the Players Association said it wouldn't strike during the season if the owners promised not to impose a salary cap unilaterally after the season, but the owners said no deal. The players then told Congress that if the antitrust exemption was lifted (even only the part related to collective bargaining), they would not strike because they would be able to defend themselves in court. The bill died in committee, and the players went on strike. So Congress is not only involved; it is complicitous.
 There is precedent, too, for imposing binding arbitration in labor disputes. Congress did so as recently as 1992, ending a dispute between the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and a freight rail company. No, baseball is not crucial to the economy. But it is the only unregulated, legal monopoly we have in this country. If the Republicans really care about free markets, why do they have nothing to say about the baseball owners' attempts at price fixing through salary caps and intra-industry salary taxes, which directly affront the idea of free labor markets?
Binding arbitration is a short-term solution. Lifting baseball's antitrust exemption -- as proposed in limited form last week by Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Orrin G. Hatch -- would help in the long run, especially if it is a comprehensive measure that puts baseball on an equal footing with the other sports. (It would not, however, settle the labor dispute: the Players Association would lift the strike, but the owners would almost certainly impose a lockout and go ahead with their plan for "temporary replacement" players.)
 So to get real baseball back on the field in April, Congress must quickly revisit the issue of binding arbitration. And though the leadership's refusal to do so may have seemed final a week ago, perhaps the sight of overweight and undertalented athletes on exhibition fields in Florida and Arizona this week will give Mr. Gingrich & Company an ice-water bath of common sense.
 As long as baseball faces neither competition nor regulation, the industry will remain in turmoil. If Newt Gingrich truly understood the teachings of Adam Smith, he would know this.

HEADLINE: Peru and Ecuador Halt Fighting Along Border, Claiming Victory

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
With each side claiming victory, a cease-fire between Peru and Ecuador went into effect at noon today and appeared to halt border fighting that had raged for the past 20 days.
"The Peruvian flag waves in Tiwinza," Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, said in a speech televised Monday night, asserting that Peruvian commandos had occupied Tiwinza, the last of three border posts Peru says it has taken back from Ecuador. 
 "All Peru should know that, at this moment, the Ecuadorean troops organized in our territory have been dislodged," Mr. Fujimori said.
On the other side, Ecuador's Defense Minister, Jose Gallardo, flew to the region this afternoon with military attaches from Embassies of the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. He carried a satellite-activated positioning device that he said would prove that Ecuador still holds Tiwinza and the two other posts.
Prior to the trip, the Ecuadorean military high command asserted that they "are under the control of the Ecuadorean Armed Forces."
In Lima, newspapers hit the streets today with headlines blaring: "Total Victory," "Tiwinza is ours," "The Invaders were expelled," "Mission Accomplished" and "Invincible Peru."
At Bagua, Peru's military headquarters for the campaign, reporters were shown Ecuadorean "war booty" said to have been seized at the three posts: uniforms, radio equipment, grenade launchers and rifles. Officials at Bagua said Ecuadorean forces shelled Tiwinza 90 minutes after the cease-fire deadline, but Ecuador denied this.
While politicians, generals and cartographers are expected to wrangle for weeks over the war's outcome, business executives reacted to the cease-fire with relief. In Peru, Lima's stock exchange index rose by 8 percent; and the Ecuadorean exchange in Quito jumped by 9 percent.
For nearly three weeks, a part of the world unaccustomed to war for decades became transformed. Soldiers mined international bridges, thousands of civilians fled border areas, police urged citizens to denounce "enemy" spies, and jets engaged in dog fights. The fighting left an estimated 50 people dead and 100 wounded.
Reviving old nationalist alliances that had split the region in past decades, Peruvians accused Chile of helping Ecuador, and Ecuadoreans accused Argentina of tilting toward Peru.
On both sides, security personnel assaulted "enemy" television crews. Last week, El Comercio, an influential Lima daily, cited patriotic reasons for censoring an essay by Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian novelist who lost to Mr. Fujimori in the 1990 presidential race. The offending column was titled "The Absurd War."
With Ecuador less than one-fourth the size of Peru, the war weighed most heavily on that tiny nation straddling the Equator.
Thrown on a war footing, Ecuador called up reservists, announced fines for food "speculators," tried to stem a run on banks and imposed draconian energy conservation rules.
In contrast, Peru took the war largely in stride. With double the population, double the economy and $6 billion in reserves, Peruvians were not visibly inconvenienced by the fighting.

HEADLINE: Allies Agree On a Proposal To Belgrade

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Officials of the five-nation working group seeking peace in Bosnia agreed today on the outline of a plan to suspend most of the sanctions on Serbia in exchange for its recognition of Bosnia and Croatia, a French Foreign Ministry official said.
"The principle of an exchange of sanctions relief for Serbian agreements in other areas is accepted by everyone," said the official, who insisted on not being identified.
Those other areas, he said, include Serbian recognition of Bosnia and Croatia, formal acceptance by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of the five nations' peace plan for Bosnia, and an agreement to use an American-backed peace plan for Croatia as a basis for negotiation. 
 A senior American official confirmed that the United States had agreed to lift all trade sanctions on Serbia if Mr. Milosevic met the conditions, and also agreed to tighten his somewhat porous blockade of the Bosnian Serbs. But the official added that Serbia would not immediately become eligible for loans from the World Bank and other international lending institutions.
Complete Serbian cooperation with international efforts to resolve the conflicts in the Balkans would presumably remove any reason to continue the United Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, which form all that remains of the Yugoslav federation. But the Milosevic Government has never received an outright promise that the sanctions, imposed in 1992, would end if certain conditions were met.
The American official said that under the plan, sanctions would be quickly reimposed if Mr. Milosevic were seen to be giving military aid to Serbian nationalists in Bosnia or Croatia.
Western officials are expected to travel within the next week to put the proposals to Mr. Milosevic. American officials are generally skeptical of the possibility that the plan will be accepted.
Of the conditions set for Mr. Milosevic, the most difficult is recognition of Bosnia and Croatia. About 70 percent of Bosnia and close to a third of Croatia are held by Serbs who were long supported by Mr. Milosevic in their refusal to join the new countries created since the old Yugoslav federation began to break up in 1991.
It would be a high-risk political course for the Serbian President, and one he has shown no sign of being prepared to take.
But the options of the so-called contact group, made up of the United States, France, Germany, Russia and Britain, appear to be dwindling as it attempts to head off a wider Balkan war in the spring.
The Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, has said he will end the mandate of United Nations troops in Croatia on March 31, awakening widespread fears that war will soon spread to the Serb-occupied areas that Mr. Martic controls. The 1991 war in Croatia ended in a tenuous truce policed by the United Nations.
In addition, a four-month cease-fire that came into effect in Bosnia at the beginning of the year appears close to breakdown.
United Nations officials said the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, had written to Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, threatening "to open new fronts" if what he called a Serbian offensive in the northwestern Bihac area did not cease.
Mr. Milosevic gained some minor relief from the sanctions -- including a reopening of Belgrade airport -- last September when he promised to impose a blockade on the Bosnian Serbs. Despite the widespread evidence that the blockade is a sham, the contact group has persisted in trying to use him because it has made no headway with the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic.
The Bosnian Serbs continue to reject a map prepared by the contact group that would oblige them to give up a third of the territory they hold and accept 49 percent of Bosnia, with the rest going to a Muslim-Croat federation. The Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament reiterated this rejection today.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAN: THE OVERVIEW;
GIULIANI SEEKS DEEPEST CUT IN CITY SPENDING SINCE 1930'S

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday proposed a financial blueprint for New York City that included the largest percentage reduction in overall spending since the Great Depression and that together with state cuts would drastically reshape municipal government and slash its services to the poor.
Embracing the philosophy of Gov. George E. Pataki's austere budget for the state, Mr. Giuliani said that the city would reduce for the first time public assistance and health care for the city's poorest residents. In fact, he called on the Governor to go further to cut those costs, which the city and state share. 
 Saying the city had been too generous for too long, the Mayor proposed a budget of nearly $ 30.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July, a reduction in spending from the current fiscal year of $ 1.3 billion, or 4 percent.
Not since Mayor James J. Walker cut spending by 16.5 percent in 1933 has the city seen a greater reduction.
Fourteen months into an administration already noteworthy for rounds of sharp budget cutting that simply kept spending from growing, Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican Mayor in a generation, went further and proposed to cut and restructure government in ways that would effect virtually every New Yorker, although not evenly.
In his statement accompanying the budget plan, Mr. Giuliani portrayed the "tough measures" of his plan as a necessary correction to the failed liberal policies of the past, which he said had led the city to spend beyond its means year after year.
Later at City Hall, he called it a historic change in course for New York, made possible by the new political landscape in Washington and Albany. "New York City needed to change," he said. "It needed dramatic change."
In addition to the cuts in welfare and health care, the Mayor also asked the city's municipal unions to agree to $ 600 million in savings on health care, pensions and work rules, in exchange for a pledge to avert layoffs. And he announced that he would reduce spending in city agencies by an added $ 600 million, affecting services virtually across the board -- from summer youth programs to prevention programs for thousands of troubled families to money for the City University of New York.
Beyond the spending cuts, the Mayor also proposed raising revenues in a variety of novel ways. The city would raise $ 10 million by selling advertising space in parks, although officials immediately ruled out the prospect of, say, billboards in Central Park.
At the same time, the plan proposes a few modest tax cuts, including eliminating the city's 4.25 percent sales tax on clothing that costs less than $ 100 and the first phase of a plan to reduce property taxes on co-ops and condos, as well as reductions in business taxes that the Mayor said would stimulate job growth.
The Mayor's preliminary budget -- the first step in a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of a final budget by the City Council in June -- is very likely to provoke a more pitched ideological battle over the city's priorities than his budget proposals last year.
The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat from Queens, said his members recognized the severity of the projected $ 2.7 billion budget gap the Mayor's plan would close. But he said the Council would resist drastic cuts in education, youth services, welfare and Medicaid, lobbying against them at the State Capitol and at City Hall. He said that many of the cuts, while expedient, would ripple disastrously through the city's economy.
"Make no mistake that many of the cuts advanced by the Mayor and the Governor would hurt not only the poor," Mr. Vallone said. "They would hurt working people. They would hurt the elderly. And they would hurt a significant part of New York City's economy."
Other Democratic Council members and representatives of liberal advocacy and social welfare organizations responded even more angrily. They said the Mayor's budget reflected the conservatism of Mr. Giuliani's fellow Republicans in Albany and Washington and the drive to roll back the city's historic mission to provide a social safety net.
"It's an unprecedented attack on the poor," said Penelope W. Pi-Sunyer, the executive director of the City Project, a liberal advocacy organization. "This Mayor is escalating the war by the Federal and state governments on the poor."
The Mayor's preliminary budget -- and the need for more cuts on top of the $ 2 billion in spending that Mr. Giuliani and the Council cut last year -- underscored the depth of the city's enduring shortfall between tax revenues and expenses, a disparity known as the "structural deficit."
The projected gap for the 1996 fiscal year has mushroomed steadily over the last year, due in part to a $ 500 million decline in tax revenues because of the flat economy on Wall Street and a $ 265 million drop in anticipated aid from the state and Federal governments.
The city's fiscal monitors and bond raters responded positively, although they cautioned that much of the Mayor's plan still required approval from the State Legislature and the unions.
Richard P. Larkin, the managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that the plan could avert a downgrading that his agency had threatened last month. But to do so, he said, the Mayor had to win agreement from Albany to reduce the state's spending on Medicaid and welfare by $ 400 million more than even the Governor has proposed. And he would need the unions' approval for the $ 600 million in givebacks. He described both issues as "wild cards."
Jeffrey A. Sommer, the acting executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, said the budget plan signaled an honest attempt to address the structural deficit. "It's ambitious," he said, "and it's moving in the right direction."
The city has had to make deep cuts in spending and raise taxes before to close projected deficits in the billions of dollars. But in most of those cases the city cut spending against projected growth and did not reduce the budget in absolute dollars, as Mr. Giuliani has proposed.
Since modern New York was incorporated in 1898, the city's budget has actually fallen from one year to the next only nine times, according to Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization, who studied the issue under the auspices of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University.
Even after the depths of the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the city actually cut spending only once, in 1980, when the total budget dropped $ 68 million, or half of 1 percent, to $ 14.3 billion.
By far, the deepest cuts in Mr. Giuliani's budget would fall in welfare and Medicaid, which account for 15 percent of the city's spending and which the Mayor proposed cutting by $ 1.2 billion.
In his state budget, the Governor proposed cutting those programs by $ 1.9 billion, saving the city an estimated $ 800 million since it shares the costs. Mr. Giuliani asked Mr. Pataki to cut a total of $ 2.5 billion to save the city an added $ 400 million.
The cuts in Medicaid could have a profound effect on the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the 11 municipal hospitals, as well as nursing homes and community clinics. The combined blow of the cuts in Medicaid -- estimated to total $ 1.1 billion, or a third of the corporation's budget -- would hasten what the Mayor called a necessary restructuring of the system and, quite possibly, the closing of one or more hospitals.
"New York City has too many hospital beds," Mr. Giuliani said. "It has too many hospital beds -- on the public side and on the private side -- and New York City spends way too much money on Medicaid. It's going to have to make that correction anyway."
The city's contribution to the Board of Education would be cut by $ 230 million, or 7 percent, from this year's budget. The Department of Sanitation's budget would be reduced $ 60 million, or 10 percent, while the Department of Correction would lose $ 50 million, or nearly 9 percent.
The Mayor's budget also made permanent last year's $ 128 million cut in money for the Transit Authority for providing free subway and bus rides for the city's schoolchildren. Gene Russianoff, the senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the reduction further raised the prospect of a fare increase for all riders.
The Mayor also proposed merging the Sheriff's Department into the Department of Finance, which collects taxes, and the Arts Commission into the Landmarks Preservation Commission. He would consolidate the legal functions of four agencies into the Law Department, and construction units of many agencies into one new agency.
While the Mayor said the spending reductions and the $ 184 million in tax cuts he proposed would stimulate growth and create new jobs in the private sector, the budget plan offered a grim view of the city's economy, saying there was little hope for a major expansion.
Still, the Mayor said the city had no other choices. Asked what he would say to the city's youth after proposing $ 20 million in cuts in youth job, education and training programs, he replied:
"What I would say to them is that New York City would still be providing more money in each of these programs than any other city in America and that one of the things New York City was not doing for you by over-spending in these areas is not providing the future for you. Youth programs are not a future. A job in a mostly private sector industry or business presents a future for you."

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects U.S. Antitrust Pact With Microsoft

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
In a decision that throws the Federal Government's biggest antitrust case into turmoil, a Federal judge here rejected today the Justice Department's agreement to settle allegations that the Microsoft Corporation, the world's biggest software company, unfairly competed with its rivals.
The decision is a considerable embarrassment for the Justice Department, which last July described its settlement as a victory that would rein in one of the most feared companies in the computer industry and which now must rebut criticism that the accord was too tame. 
 The decision reopens a huge array of antitrust issues concerning how Microsoft obtained its overwhelming domination of the software now used on more than 50 million personal computers.
As such, the ruling is a big setback for Microsoft. Most investors in Microsoft greeted the settlement with relief last summer, noting that Microsoft would only have to modify a narrowly defined array of licensing practices and that the Government had decided not to push for much more severe restrictions.
In a blunt ruling today, Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin said the proposed settlement failed to address a number of the issues raised about Microsoft during a four-year investigation and he chastised the Government for refusing to explain itself.
"The picture that emerges from these proceedings is that the U.S. Government is either incapable or unwilling to deal effectively with a potential threat to this nation's economic well-being," Judge Sporkin wrote. If he was to approve the deal, he wrote, "the message will be that Microsoft is so powerful that neither the market nor the Government is capable of dealing with all of its monopolistic practices."
Saying he could not rule that the settlement would be in the public interest, Judge Sporkin said he would convene a status hearing on March 16 to consider the next step.
Neither the Justice Department nor Microsoft would comment much on the decision. "We are disappointed to learn what is being reported about the order," Microsoft said in a terse statement this evening. Anne K. Bingaman, the Assistant Attorney General for antitrust issues, would say only that the agency was reviewing the decision.
Broadly, the Government has four options. It can appeal Judge Sporkin's decision, arguing that he abused his discretion, and seek approval for the settlement as it was originally written.
Alternatively, the Justice Department can try to negotiate a new and tougher deal with Microsoft that takes account of the specific criticisms made by Judge Sporkin. If it cannot reach a new agreement, it would then have to sue Microsoft and prepare for a court case likely to last several years. Finally, the Justice Department could choose simply to drop the case entirely.
At issue in the investigation was whether Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., had stifled competition in software, particularly in the operating systems that provide the basic instructions for all I.B.M.-compatible personal computers.
Microsoft manufactures MS-DOS, the operating system used on about 70 percent of all personal computers. It also produces Windows, a program that allows a computer user to navigate between scores of applications, like word processing or entering data bases, simply by placing an electronic "mouse" on easy-to-understand graphic icons.
Rival companies, like Borland International and the Lotus Development Corporation, have contended that Microsoft tried to block companies offering other operating systems by using unfair licensing practices and other tactics. Some companies have also said that Microsoft used various dirty tricks, including what the industry calls "vaporware," to leverage its expansion from MS-DOS into almost every kind of software for desktop computers.
At one point, antitrust investigators at the Federal Trade Commission suggested that Microsoft should be forced to split itself up -- somewhat as the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company was forced to separate its local and long-distance businesses 10 years ago. Some of the Government's lawyers envisioned one Microsoft company in the operating-system business and another in the market for applications like word-processing and spreadsheets, but the whole breakup idea never progressed very far.
In July, the Justice Department reached a fairly narrow agreement that was limited primarily to licensing practices. Under that deal, Microsoft agreed to drop the practice of licensing MS-DOS to computer manufacturers on the basis of the number of computers they sold, regardless of whether the computers actaully used MS-DOS.
"We were all pretty delighted that the legal issues seemed to be behind them," said David Readerman, a computer analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. Indeed, Microsoft sales jumped 31 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, to $1.5 billion, and the company's profit rose 29 percent, to $373 million.
Microsoft's stock surged immediately in July on news of the settlement and has since climbed from $48.625 to its closing price today of $61.875, down 12.5 cents for the day in Nasdaq trading. Judge Sporkin's decision was announced after the close of trading.
The judge, who said he had read a book about Microsoft as well as articles in magazines and newspapers, wrote today that he was particularly concerned about evidence that Microsoft had deceptively tried to block one rival's product by using "vaporware" -- announcing a product of its own that would not actually be ready for at least several months.
Judge Sporkin wrote that the Government's proposed settlement was too narrow and would be ineffective at achieving all of its stated goals. He said the deal would not require Microsoft to adhere to any restrictions on operating systems used for high-powered work stations. He also said the Government had failed to show how its agreement would help open up the market for rivals to MS-DOS and Windows.
"What the Government fails to show is that the proposed consent decree will open the market and remedy the unfair advantage Microsoft gained in the market through its anti-competitive practices," he wrote. "Simply telling a defendant to go forth and sin no more does little or nothing to address the unfair advantage it has already gained."
Gary Reback, a San Francisco lawyer who represents a group of computer companies that have remained anonymous and have challenged the settlement, praised today's decision.
"The judge did the only thing he could have done," he said. "He was given no choice but to reject the decree because he wasn't given any information about whether the decree is valid or not."

HEADLINE: American Express and PNC Become Favorites of Buffett

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett, the widely followed Omaha investor, is betting $2 billion that there is money to be made in money. He disclosed yesterday that his holding company had purchased stakes in two major financial services companies: 9.8 percent of the American Express Company and 8.3 percent of the PNC Bank Corporation of Pittsburgh.
 Many investors like to mimic Mr. Buffett's investments, and shares of both companies surged yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock of American Express rose $1.375, to $33.50, its highest level in eight years. Shares of PNC, the nation's 12th-largest banking company, jumped 87.5 cents, to $25, a high for the year but well below the $31.50 level reached last June. PNC has suffered unusually large investment losses resulting from the rise in interest rates. 
 Mr. Buffett is known for making large long-term investments in companies whose stocks are out of favor but whose management he holds in high regard. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and its various insurance company subsidiaries own big stakes in such corporations as Capital Cities/ABC, Coca-Cola and the Washington Post Company.
 Mr. Buffett has long had an interest in financial services stocks, buying positions in Geico, an insurer, Wells Fargo & Company, a San Francisco bank, and Salomon Inc., the brokerage firm. When the top management of Salomon was forced to resign in 1991 after the firm covered up false bids made in Government bond auctions, Mr. Buffett stepped in as chairman for several months.
Mr. Buffett is fond of companies with well-established brand names. The ubiquitous blue box and stern green centurion of American Express fits that bill. The company, based in New York, has also been recovering from a string of problems relating to its former Shearson and Lehman brokerage subsidiaries and losses from unpaid balances on its Optima credit card.
Mr. Buffett first bought $300 million in preferred stock in American Express in 1991 as the company was recapitalized to compensate for large losses at Shearson. That investment was converted last August into 14 million shares of common stock.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, Berkshire Hathaway said it held 27.76 million shares of American Express as of Dec. 31. In a subsequent statement yesterday, American Express said Mr. Buffett had purchased an additional 20.74 million shares this year. That gives him a total of 48.5 million shares, which are worth $1.6 billion based on yesterday's closing price.
"We are delighted with the vote of confidence that the Berkshire Hathaway share purchase represents," American Express said.
 Many investors, including those intending to take over companies, are required to disclose large stock purchases within 10 days. But Berkshire Hathaway, as an insurance company, only has to disclose its large holdings once a year. Thus the stock holdings disclosed by Mr. Buffett as of the end of 1994 could have been purchased any time that year. Shares of American Express traded between $24 and $31 in 1994.
As for PNC, Berkshire Hathaway said in its filings that it owned 19.5 million shares as of Dec. 31, worth $504 million at yesterday's closing price. PNC declined to say whether Mr. Buffett had bought or sold any shares this year. Mr. Buffett, according to market rumors, has been buying PNC shares since the end of 1993, and it is unclear how much of his investment was made before the bank's losses from rising rates were disclosed.
Many bank stock analysts are quite bearish on the prospects for PNC. Sally Pope Davis of Goldman, Sachs has rated the stock of PNC as "underperform," a Wall Street euphemism for "sell."
She conceded that there might be value for someone with Mr. Buffett's long-term view. "If you wait three years for them to get out from under their interest rate problems," she said, "the company is probably attractive."

HEADLINE: In Slow-Growth Sign, Retail Sales Inch Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Fresh signs of an economic slowdown appeared today as retail spending at department stores, auto dealers, supermarkets and the like rose in January by a relatively small amount for the second straight month.
"It seems as if consumers have slowed up on their purchases," said Kenneth T. Mayland, chief financial economist at the Keycorp National Bank in Cleveland. "Something has changed." 
 The Commerce Department reported that retail spending rose just two-tenths of a percent last month, echoing a similar rise in December. Earlier, the December figure was reported as a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent, but more complete data showed that the Christmas season was not quite as poor as first thought.
Not surprisingly, the biggest drag in January was motor vehicles and other big-ticket items that typically are among the first casualties of rising interest rates. The durable goods category fell four-tenths of 1 percent, the second straight decline after a skimpy November rise.
"Consumers look like they're pulling in their horns," said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at the Boston-based Shawmut National Corporation. "I'm increasingly thinking that the Federal Reserve has done about all that it's going to do."
The Fed has raised short-term interest rates seven times over the last 12 months, doubling the overnight rate among banks to 6 percent. Economists are divided over whether the central bank will lift them again in early or late spring, but the latest report suggests that it may be inclined to halt its step-by-step credit tightening as evidence accumulates that the previous rate increases are starting to do their job. The Fed's goal is to brake the economy, which expanded at an annual pace of 4 1/2 percent in the final three months of 1994 -- too fast a rate to be sustainable without higher inflation.
Bond prices climbed today on word of the January sales figures, pushing long-term rates below 7 5/8 percent, or roughly one-half point off their recent peaks.
But even as analysts cautioned that the initial results in retailing were subject to substantial revision, they pointed to other evidence that the economic expansion was slackening. This includes sluggish payroll expansion last month, a prolonged buildup of inventories and narrower growth in consumer installment debt.
Still, consumers show some life, raising purchases of nondurables five-tenths of 1 percent last month despite flooding in California and exceptionally warm weather in much of the East that hurt sales of winter clothes.
"This year, retailers were highly promotional during the month of January and consumers obviously took advantage of even better values on top-quality goods," said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation.
Department stores and others selling general merchandise enjoyed a sales gain of 1.1 percent last month, while sales rose 1 percent at drug and variety stores and seven-tenths of 1 percent at food stores. Much of a 1.9 percent jump at gasoline services stations, however, reflected higher prices.
Sales declined six-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and five-tenths of 1 percent at stores selling clothes and accessories.
Among retailers of durable goods, sales at automotive dealers slumped six-tenths of 1 percent while sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent for merchants selling furniture and other equipment for the home.
Excluding the automotive group, which accounts for about 24 percent of the total, retail sales climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in January, the report showed.
At $193.22 billion, retail sales were 8 percent higher than in January 1994, or a little more than 5 percent after allowing for inflation.
In all, consumers account for two-thirds of the American economy, with about half of this spending at retail counters and the other half going for such things as car insurance and hospital care.

HEADLINE: Getting This Oil Takes Drilling and Diplomacy

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Several billion barrels of oil under the Caspian Sea lie waiting to be tapped off the stony coast of this former Soviet republic. No technical difficulties preclude a daily oil output that could eventually be equal to a tenth of what is produced each day in the United States.
But a Western-led consortium that is spending $7 billion to develop the huge new oilfields has found itself frustrated by the political realities of a region of Central Asia where Russia, Iran, Turkey and the West have historically competed for influence. 
 Over vigorous objections from the United States, Iran is on the verge of acquiring an interest in the consortium from cash-starved Azerbaijan. Even if Washington blocks Iran's direct participation, Azerbaijan will bring Iran in through the back door, oil company executives and Western diplomats here said. Iranian involvement could make the participating American oil companies ineligible for tax credits or loan guarantees from the Federal Government.
The consortium, in which four American companies hold 40 percent of the shares, faces another politically charged problem: how to get the oil to Western markets. Washington recently announced that it preferred a pipeline that runs through Turkey. That does not sit well with Moscow, which wants a pipeline that goes through Russia. But that does not suit Turkey or Azerbaijan. The other options are through Georgia, which is politically unstable, or through Iran, a route that Washington opposes.
The offer by Azerbaijan to let Iran have a stake in the project is motivated not only by money but also by a need to satisfy its nettlesome southern neighbor. Azerbaijan has already placated Russia to the north by cutting it in on the deal, which became final late last year.
The problem of shipping out oil, in the face of climatic as well as political obstacles, also affects other remote corners of the old Soviet Union, including the Russian Arctic and Central Asian republics like Kazakhstan, where the Chevron Corporation has begun pumping from the Tengiz field after investing up to $1 billion.
[Chevron, which has trouble moving its oil from Tengiz, disclosed on Monday that it would slash spending on the oilfield this year to $50 million from the $500 million originally budgeted.]
The decision on the pipeline must be made very soon, oil executives said -- though they doubted it would be -- if construction is to be completed by the time the wells start pumping an estimated 600,000 barrels a day. That is equal to 10 percent of the daily production from all the wells in the United States, including Alaska, oil executives here said. At today's prices, such production would bring the consortium something like half a billion dollars a month.
It is not surprising then that with the word out that Azerbaijan is looking to sell off part of its interest, men in pressed white shirts representing big American and European oil companies -- Exxon, Mobil, Shell, the French oil company Elf Aquitaine and the Italian company AGIP S.p.A.-- took up rooms in run-down Soviet-era hotels in this dilapidated port city this month, scrambling to join the consortium.
Western oil executives and Azeri officials have avoided disclosing details of the deal, but some oilmen said the production costs would be quite low because the reserves of 3.5 billion to 4.5 billion barrels were already proved, meaning there would be little need for exploration. The water is also relatively shallow for offshore drilling, about 500 feet.
Moreover, taking advantage of the Government's inexperience, the oil companies struck a deal far more favorable to the companies than to Azerbaijan. "They're not very good at economics," a senior Western oil executive said.
The consortium's members, in addition to the Azeri oil company Socar, include British Petroleum and Amoco, with 17 percent each; Lukoil of Russia, which has 10 percent, followed by Pennzoil, Unocal and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which have about 9 percent each. McDermott International, an American oil equipment manufacturer, and Ramco Energy, a British company, each have about 2 percent, while Delta International, the Saudi Arabian group, and the Turkish Petroleum Corporation each have just under 2 percent.
This latest chapter in the politics of oil is being written where a century ago the family of the Swedish industrialist Robert Nobel began the first serious foreign exploration for oil. During World War I, the Germans, Russians, Turks and British fought for control of the oil here. After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the oil fell into Soviet hands. In World War II, Hitler coveted and failed to capture Baku's oil.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, another oil rush began, led by Western capitalists. They were welcomed by Azerbaijan, which acquired its independence from Moscow in 1991. But Moscow wanted to keep control of the oil, and it argued that the rights to exploit the resources of the Caspian Sea did not belong solely to Azerbaijan, but to all the countries on the Caspian -- Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as well as Azerbaijan.
Wishing to placate the Russians, Azerbaijan, which started with 30 percent of the consortium, assigned a 10 percent stake to Lukoil of Russia.
In now offering a quarter of its 20 percent share to Iran, Azerbaijan is motivated partly by its need for money, which is why it may sell some or all of its remaining stake to foreign oil companies. Socar is bankrupt and must come up with $1.4 billion for its share in the project. It does not even have the $5 million it needs to pay its share for this financial quarter, some consortium members said.
But the Government's decision to sell to Iran "is not entirely connected to finances," said Ilham Aliyev, a vice president of Socar, during an interview in his shabby office with a view of the Caspian. On his desk were calling cards from the latest representatives of oil companies who made their pitch to him.
"Iran is our neighbor," said Mr. Aliyev, whose father is Azerbaijan's President, Heydar Aliyev.
If the consortium turns down Iran's direct participation, which Mr. Aliyev said he expected because of Washington's objections, Socar would offer to bring Iran in as what Mr. Aliyev called a "sleeping partner." Under this arrangement, Iran would not have a seat at the table or a vote in any negotiations, but it would exercise political influence through Socar and share in the profits, according to oil officials and diplomats familiar with what Socar offered Iran.
The British Government, which is a major player here because of British Petroleum's lead in organizing the consortium, has no objection to Iran's participation. "What is good for B.P. is fine by us," said Britain's Ambassador, Thomas Young.
But Washington does object. The United States is opposed to Iran's acquiring "political influence or financial gain," Richard Kauzarlich, the American Ambassador here, said in an interview.
Under United States law, American companies are not barred from doing business with Iran, which its proposed participation technically would entail. But if they do, they are not eligible for any financial support from Washington, like tax credits for investments or loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank. Under the law, Washington would also be obligated to vote against loans to the project from international financial institutions to which the United States belongs, like the World Bank.
This threat becomes a serious one when construction begins on the pipeline, which is expected to cost at least $2 billion.
The most straightforward route for the oil to reach the Mediterranean, from where it would then be shipped to American and European consumers, runs through Armenia. But Azerbaijan would not tolerate that because it is at war with Armenia over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Armenia could be bypassed by running about 30 miles of the pipeline through Iran, but Washington opposes that.
A third option would be to run the line through Georgia, then down and across Turkey, but Georgia has been plagued by war and political instability.
A fourth way favored by Moscowwould take the oil through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, then on barges through the Bosporus to the Mediterranean. But such a pipeline would run through the battleground of Chechnya.
Also, Turkey is opposed to this route, arguing that it cannot allow more tankers through the Bosporus for environmental reasons. But no one doubts that Turkey, which has had a long rivalry with Russia for control of this region, is also motivated by politics.
When Mr. Aliyev of Socar was asked where he thought the pipeline would eventually be built, he said, "It will be a political decision."

Retail Report Pushes Bond Prices Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government debt securities surged yesterday as a Government report on retail sales eased concerns over inflation. As prices rose, the yield of the 30-year bond fell to a five-month low.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in January, less than expected. Analysts said that the data provided further evidence that the economy was slowing. 
 For the bond market, the report reinforced the idea held by some that the Fed would not raise interest rates during the next meeting of its policy-making committee in March. Indeed, a growing number of market participants now expect the next rate increase to come in May.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management, a Washington-based money management firm, noted that the weak January sales report followed weak numbers in December and November.
"What it suggests from an intermediate to long-term perspective and from a Fed point of view is that the one-year of interest rate increases by the Fed has, or is, in the process of achieving the desired slowdown effect," he said.
Other analysts, however, noted that because retail sales were often subject to large revisions, market participants were eager to see the report on consumer prices in January, which will be released today.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 26/32 , to 10012/32 for a yield of 7.59 percent, down from 7.66 percent on Monday. The yield was the lowest since Sept. 8, when it was 7.56 percent. Shorter-maturity bills were also down an average of 6 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The yield on the long bond has traded in a range of 7.60 percent to 7.80 percent in the last few weeks. It is expected to remain in this pattern, Mr. Carpenter said, until the market is convinced either that the slowdown is truly in effect or that previous indications of a slowdown "have been false signals."
While encouraged by the retail sales report, the bond market largely ignored a more narrow economic report. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta released a survey yesterday that showed that its finished goods price index for the Southeast rose to 22.4 points in January, from 14.3 in December. This suggested that inflation could accelerate in the region.
Today, traders and investors turn to the report on consumer prices. Mr. Carpenter expects a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in both the overall and core numbers of the Consumer Price Index. "Remember, we also had decent producer price numbers on Friday, which foreshadows a decent C.P.I. number," he said.
The reports due today, which include data on industrial production and capacity utilization, can be viewed as lagging indicators, he said.
"They may continue to be strong even after consumer spending has begun to retrench," Mr. Carpenter said. "We probably need to see one or two more months of soft retail sales reports to confirm that the much-heralded economic slowdown is a prospect, and the much-hoped-for soft landing is feasible."
In the municipal bond market, one of the largest issues priced yesterday was a $324.1 million negotiated sale by the New York State Thruway Authority that was sold through Paine Webber. Because of good investor demand, the bonds were repriced, lowering yields about 3 basis points on the term bonds and 5 basis points on the serial bonds.
The maximum yield was 6.222 percent for an issue due in 2025. Most of the bonds are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. For those not insured, the underlying ratings are A1 by Moody's and A by S.& P. Serials ran from 4.60 percent in 1996 to 5.90 percent in 2010.
In another large bond sale, the Texas Public Finance Authority sold $300 million of general obligation refunding bonds through Grigsby Brandford & Company. These securities, like those of the New York Thruway, were repriced, lowering yields about 5 basis points on some maturities. Yields ranged from 4.75 percent in 1996 to 6.10 percent in 2015. Dealers said the bonds were rated AA by Moody's and AA+ by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows to Oppose Cut in Student Loan Program

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Throwing down another gauntlet to the Republican Congress, President Clinton vowed today to oppose any efforts to scale back direct Federal loans or interest subsidies for college students. And he implored leaders of the nation's colleges to help fight for his proposed tax deductions for post-high-school education.
Though Mr. Clinton made no mention of the word "veto," his speech to a sympathetic group of officials from more than 1,600 colleges and universities meeting here today was the latest in a series of efforts to define the ground on which the White House will fight -- from crime to welfare to foreign policy -- to preserve the President's priorities and prerogatives in the face of Republican alternatives. 
 Mr. Clinton attacked various Republican proposals for limiting direct Federal loans or eliminating Government subsidies that pay the interest costs on loans to lower-income students while they remain in school. He asserted that such notions meant that some Congressional leaders regarded education as "just another area to cut and gut" to help finance reductions in capital gains taxes for the well-to-do.
"Their proposals will cut investments in our future and increase the costs of student loans to our neediest students to fund tax cuts for the wealthy," the President told the American Council on Education. "I will fight these proposals every step of the way, and I want you to join me in fighting them, too. The fight for education is the fight for the American dream. It is the fight for America's middle class. It is the fight for the 21st century."
By portraying his stance on education as the key to providing economic security in the 21st century, Mr. Clinton expressed concern about traditional Republican concepts like safety and security even as he sought to draw a contrast between his views and theirs.
Last weekend he used the same kind of language in vowing to veto Republican plans to restructure the 1994 Federal crime bill so that local governments might use money for purposes other than hiring 100,000 additional police officers.
Similarly, the White House contends that Republican legislation to limit the President's authority to commit United States forces to international peacekeeping operations could jeopardize national security.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, told reporters traveling with the President that Mr. Clinton might discuss his concerns about the peacekeeping proposal when he played golf in Palm Springs, Calif., on Wednesday with former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic tournament.
Mr. Clinton himself said he was looking forward to redeeming a longstanding invitation from Mr. Hope to play in the tournament.
"This year he called me and said, 'I really liked your State of the Union, but you'd speak better if you'd come out and play golf with me,' " the President told reporters.
But his preferred topic this morning was education. The White House hopes to use such occasions to highlight Mr. Clinton's achievements in his first two years in office, for which it believes he did not win enough public credit, by arguing that those achievements are now in jeopardy.
The President is also seeking support for his new tax proposals, including one that offers deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college or technical training, and he urged the college officials to call and write Congress in support of his proposals.
Mr. Clinton spent much of his time defending the changes he won in federally guaranteed college loan programs. In 1993, over the objections of commercial banks, Congress passed the President's proposal to let the Government begin making college loans directly to students, and allowing them to repay them over a longer time. The intention was to eliminate the bank middleman and save money, and more than 250,000 students and 104 institutions now participate. But many Republicans remain skeptical that a Federal bureaucracy can deliver on that goal.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAN: THE AGENCIES
Schools and Hospitals Are Among the Hardest Hit in the Budget Slashing;
THE ARTS

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
The proposed city budget calls for an 17 percent reduction in the budget of the Department of Cultural Affairs, from $96.1 million this year to $80.2 million next year.
The largest chunk -- $11 million -- would come from the budget for the Cultural Institutions Group, which consists of 31 cultural organizations that occupy city buildings -- from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Queens Botanical Garden. 
 These cuts represent a dose of bitter medicine, coming as they do after several years of static or declining Federal support for the arts, recessionary belt-tightening and a proposed 21 percent arts cut in the state budget announced earlier this month.
Additional cuts of $2.5 million would be made in grants to more than 400 arts organizations that receive city money through their boroughs, or through direct application to the cultural affairs department. Those organizations actually face $7.5 million in additional cuts, but the additional cuts would be offset by a matching-grant program that allocates some public money to match private money raised specifically for projects that increase public access to the arts or make an economic impact on the city.
In the first year of a similar matching-grant program, arts organizations found it very difficult to raise the private money. So they were skeptical that the program would succeed. WILLIAM GRIMES

HEADLINE: Mixed Signals Cause Stocks to Barely Move

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The financial markets went in different directions yesterday. Bond prices went up, the dollar went down and stocks were little changed.
It is rare for the three markets to diverge in their judgments since traders all examine the same economic data at virtually the same time. Usually the currency market, which trades around the clock, influences the bond market, which influences the stock market. 
 But it was every market for itself yesterday. The bond market appeared to focus on a retail sales report that seemed to suggest little inflation. Some currency dealers appeared to focus on a regional Federal Reserve survey that seemed to suggest more inflation. Stock traders apparently ignored both reports.
Stock traders also resisted buying stocks in advance of market-moving economic reports due today, including the Consumer Price Index, and what is expected to be a turbulent session on Friday.
Trading volume yesterday, while still light, was beginning to rise as traders started to exercise stock options, which expire Friday in a so-called double witching hour.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.04 points yesterday, to 3,958.25, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.90 point, to 482.55. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.20 points, to 790.62.
January retail sales rose just two-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, a bullish signal for bonds because it indicated little incentive for companies to raise prices. Bonds rallied.
But the dollar, which has lately been tracking the movement in United States bonds, failed to do so yesterday, and fell to a two-week low against the German mark. While currency dealers attributed the decline largely to technical selling and concerns over Mexico, others noticed a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The survey showed a sharp rise in a regional price index for January, to a record 22.4 from 14.3 in December.
What stock traders are paying attention to, however, are the figures on capacity utilization, industrial production, business inventories, and, above all, the Consumer Price Index, due from the Government this morning. The figures are essential to stock traders in deciding whether to bet on rising stock prices.
After accurately predicting that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point on Feb. 1, Wall Street has failed to reach a similar consensus about the future course of interest rates and hence the course of stock prices. If the Fed raises rates again in March and indicates that other rate increases are possible, stock prices may be stuck in a narrow trading range for months.
Nonetheless, several stocks rose sharply. Cigna, a large insurance company, hit a 52-week high of 74 3/4 and closed at 74 3/8, up 3 1/8. It reported that operating net income in the fourth quarter rose to $2.54 a share from $1.98 in the 1993 period. A Goldman, Sachs analyst raised his assessment of the company to "moderate outperformer" from market performer.
Boston Bancorp rose 2 1/2, to 33 3/4, in a continued response to the resignations on Friday of Richard Laine, the chairman, and Paul Archibald, the president. The company said only that the resignations "were voluntary by mutual agreement" with the company board.
Dart Group shares fell 4 1/2, to 75 1/2, after the son of the founder, Herbert Haft, cut off his father's $800,000 salary. Integrated Health Services, a hospital management company, dropped 3 3/8, to 38 5/8, after The Wall Street Journal published an article contending there was self-dealing and other abuses at the company. Revco D.S., a drugstore chain, was off 2 7/8, to 19, after an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey cut his earnings estimate for the company.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Exodus Part II

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As Middle Eastern shouting matches go, the one last weekend at Blair House between Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, and the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, was probably in the top ten, said one observer. While their host, Warren Christopher, watched in pain, Mr. Moussa and Mr. Peres ripped each other apart. Mr. Moussa told Mr. Peres that Israel had started the 1967 war, fulminated that Israel, with its nuclear weapons, still wanted to dominate the Middle East, and insisted that Israel was entitled to "normal" relations with Egypt, not a "special relationship."
Mr. Peres lashed back that Egypt was trying to "destroy" the peace process, and with a voice rising in anger told Mr. Moussa that before Egypt got the whole Arab world riled up about inspecting Israel's nuclear facilities, Cairo should inspect Iran's. 
 The hapless Russian observer at the session, Viktor Posuvalyuk, listened to the shouting and said: "I thought relations between you two were more amiable."
Well, Viktor, think again. There is a new rivalry for leadership of the Middle East, and it's between Egypt and Israel. Yes, 3,000 years after the Exodus, the offspring of Pharaoh and Moses are at it again.
Ever since Egypt signed its peace treaty with Israel in 1979, Egypt has worked to get more Arab states to make peace with Israel, primarily to ease Cairo's isolation in the Arab world for having been the first to walk the walk with the Jews. Over time, though, Egypt discovered that its treaty with Israel was actually a source of status and money. Egypt became the interpreter and mediator between Israel and the other Arabs, and it became the Arab address through which the U.S. conducted its peace diplomacy.
And then came the handshake. Israel started dealing directly with Yasir Arafat. Israel signed a treaty with Jordan without either country consulting Egypt (which drove the Egyptians crazy). And lately Israel has been forging economic ties with the likes of Oman, Bahrain, Morocco and Tunisia without anyone dialing Cairo. The Egyptians aren't amused. They know that an Israel at peace with the Arab world is actually more powerful than Egypt. It has more to offer technologically, it has better entree with the U.S. and, because Israel's economy is bigger than Egypt's, Syria's, Jordan's and Lebanon's combined, it will dominate any Middle East common market.
So Egypt struck back. It initiated an Arab crusade to pressure Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which meant Israel either had to reveal its bombs in the basement or risk alienation from its new neighbors. Then the Egyptians put together a summit in Alexandria, with Syria and Saudi Arabia, where they flashed a yellow light to other Arab states thinking about normalizing relations with Israel.
After Israeli and U.S. complaints, the Egyptians hastily arranged a kiss-and-make-up summit in Cairo with Jordan, Israel and the P.L.O., and then attended the Blair House session. But these were just 20-second timeouts, where the Egyptians and Israelis made nice for the cameras.
Egypt today is going through an identity crisis. It had hoped that peace would shrink Israel to its natural size. Instead, peace has made Israel larger -- by giving it diplomatic and economic opportunities in Asia and the Arab world that are making Jerusalem, not Cairo, the region's center of gravity. But peace is making Egypt smaller than its natural size, because it is no longer inflated by its diplomatic role and must now compete with Israel and other Arabs as a real country.
Egypt has a choice: It can try to reassert its leadership by spoiling everything it helped to build. Or it can recognize that Egypt remains special, in its standing with the U.S., the Arab world and Israel -- but just not as special as before -- and learn to live with a medium-sized diplomatic ego, instead of extra large.
Egypt today cannot afford the Nasser model, where it leads by fighting the West, and it cannot sustain the Sadat model, where it leads by bridging to the West. It will have to find a new model for a new era.
I don't know where Egypt's search for identity will lead, but I do know that the identity of the Middle East and the peace process will be heavily influenced by where it ends.

HEADLINE: In America;
Cruel Homeless Policy

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The night air was stupefyingly cold. If you walked directly into the wind it felt as if someone were holding cubes of ice against your forehead. The easiest thing in the world to imagine was that someone could freeze to death out there.
The man in the wheelchair had only one leg. With his back against the frigid wind that whistled through the intersection of Vanderbilt Avenue and 46th Street, not far from Grand Central Terminal, he waited in a long line for the small meal being served by volunteers from the Coalition for the Homeless. An orange. A plastic cup of chili. A half-pint of milk. 
 I asked the man if he had a place to stay for the night. He shook his head.
Two young women were handing out blankets from a coalition van. Shivering hands reached for them, as if grasping at a lifeline.
"We're doing as much as we can right now," Michael Polenberg was saying. "But the way they're cutting public assistance, the ranks of the homeless are guaranteed to swell, and we can't really handle any more."
Mr. Polenberg is the director of the coalition's food program. Even as he and his volunteers worked among the destitute on Monday night, a madcap gaggle of Republican politicians (major strategists in America's all-out war on the poor) were partying in splendor at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for Senator Alfonse D'Amato. The party, at the Sheraton New York Hotel, was a smash, raising $2 million.
Earlier in the day Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (as well known for his compassion as Senator D'Amato is for his ethics) traveled to Albany to plead for cuts in state welfare programs that would go deeper than the Draconian cuts urged by Gov. George Pataki. Mr. Giuliani must balance his budget. Since the city has to match state welfare and Medicaid spending, any cuts in state spending result in reduced city costs. This is fine for the Mayor and the budget, but catastrophic for the many thousands of New Yorkers whose meager housing money will vanish, and thus will find themselves setting up light housekeeping under a streetlamp.
The welfare policies of Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki are more than inhumane, they are economically unsound. It is widely understood by social service administrators (Republicans and Democrats) that the contemplated cuts will result, as Mr. Polenberg noted, in a substantial increase in homelessness. That will force an expansion of the city's woefully inadequate shelter system, which is far more expensive, bed for bed, than welfare.
It costs $55 to house one person one night in a city shelter. Home relief, by comparison, is a bargain with its monthly housing allowance of $312.
As one official said when Governor Pataki announced his proposals, "There are no savings there."
But politicians are politicians, and their concerns are with power and ego and ambition. They would be shocked -- shocked! -- that anyone would expect them to be concerned about the survival of people sleeping on sidewalks in dangerously cold weather. Hah! they would exclaim, between mouthfuls of tender and succulent roast beef. Hah-hah-hah!
After feeding nearly 100 people at Vanderbilt and 46th, the volunteers from the Coalition for the Homeless drove off in two vans to distribute meals to men and women in grotesque homeless encampments around Manhattan. One stop was beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, where half-frozen men sat as still as death amid piles of tattered clothing, worn-out blankets and debris.
Another stop was in the parking area outside Housing Court, on Centre Street. "It's so cold I can't feel my feet," one man said. "I get scared when I can't feel my feet."
Other stops included a brutal, rat-infested, windswept encampment next to the East River, beneath the Manhattan Bridge; the Staten Island Ferry Terminal; City Hall Park, and the area just south of the United Nations Building, where several people were living in cardboard boxes, and at least one man was lying without a blanket or any other kind of covering on the sidewalk.
A volunteer shook his head. "When you meet someone who has been out here for awhile," he said, "you shake their hand and it's hard to believe that human flesh can get that cold."

HEADLINE: Letting Wall St. Off Easy

BYLINE: By Herbert Stein; Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Several themes run through the Contract With America: promotion of free markets, objection to government regulation, concern for the middle class, strengthening of property rights. But when it comes to the passage on reforming securities law, the contract is oddly in conflict with those objectives.
Adam Smith, in the most famous sentence in economic literature, said that "it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." It is significant that the examples Smith used all refer to daily purchases. If the baker puts sawdust in my bread I will know it immediately, I will not buy from him anymore and I will tell my friends not to buy from him anymore. So it is in his own interest not to put sawdust in the bread. 
 But suppose that I, a member of the middle class, am buying stock in a corporation with which I have no personal connection -- hardly a daily transaction. How is it in the interest of the corporation's executives (and their accountants, lawyers and investment bankers) to make a diligent effort to tell me everything I ought to know?
How will my property rights be protected? If they are not, am I likely to know what has happened? Will I be able to distinguish between the inevitable vicissitudes of the market and inadequate performance of the people he relied on? If I find that I have been disserved, what difference will it make (as I probably wasn't going to have any more business with them anyway)? How will I tell other investors not to deal with them? And by the time I do tell enough people, won't the executives, lawyers, accountants and investment bankers be sipping their Cuba libres in Costa Rica?
Still, it is essential to the efficient functioning of our economic system that the passive investor be willing to put his money in private enterprise. To give him confidence to do that, we rely on three forces: the trustworthiness of the people who manage the money, which is generally sufficient but, alas, not always; government regulation, which is expensive, ineffective and unnecessarily intrusive; and the power of the legal system.
Although the wronged investor can seek redress in the courts, he cannot, of course, do it by himself. So there is a market demand for people who can assemble the injured investors, perform the necessary research and pursue the claims in court. A supply of people -- mainly lawyers -- exists to meet this important demand.
But the Contract With America proposes to interfere with this market. Its creators intend to interpose a court-appointed trustee between the plaintiffs and their lawyers, and to limit the ability of lawyers to seek out cases of likely misfeasance and to organize suits to obtain redress.
The House Republican leadership also wants to limit court action to cases where deliberate intent to mislead or reckless disregard for the truth can be proved. This would let responsible parties off the hook for failure to exercise the diligence that the law requires of them.
The contract presents its suggestions as if the urgent problem is to protect corporations from middle-class investors' lawyers. True, frivolous lawsuits can be an unnecessary drain on the system. But a much more serious problem is assuring the middle-class investor that the people to whom he entrusts his money will look after his interest honestly and diligently. The possibility of recourse to the judicial system is integral to that assurance, and the proposals in the contract would weaken it.
In 1993 there were 238 class-action suits in securities cases. If America is being drowned in an ocean of litigiousness, this tiny number of suits is but a drop in the ocean.
In fact, some might say that the number of suits is so small that the whole thing does not make much difference either way. But what counts is not the number of suits but the amount of dishonesty and negligence that is prevented by the possibility of stockholder suits. And that could be a lot.

Tales of Times Square: Rowboats and Ice Cream

BYLINE: By Michael T. Kaufman 

 BODY:
HERE are three final stories from Times Square:
BOATS. If it were not for guerrilla activity in the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Mike Davis would probably not be building 25-foot-long rowboats on the ground floor of the old McGraw-Hill Building on 42d Street. 
 He is an archeologist who has spent many years working on a dig at Diyarbakir, near the Euphrates, but because of unrest, work on the project has stopped, and Mr. Davis can now spend time building boats with other volunteers.
"We have great water, but no one uses it very much," the archeologist said as he took a break. "In Istanbul, there are small boats everywhere. Anyone can rent a boat and row on the Bosporus. That's the way it should be on the Hudson."
He said that "as late as 1933 there were 41 boathouses in Manhattan, while now there is just one."
He went on to explain that the project to reverse this trend is called Floating the Apple, and that it originated after articles in boating journals urged New Yorkers to take to their waters. Like-minded people found one another. "Originally, all we wanted was to stimulate rowing on waterways that form the city's biggest open space and wildlife preserve," he said.
One thing led to another, and the group, by then sponsored by the Open Space Institute, decided to build its own boats and offer them for public use to neighborhood teams, school groups or office workers, starting this spring. A boat was designed that could accommodate as many as 10 people. Tools were contributed and the work space was provided by the 42d Street Development Corporation.
"People have come in off the street," said Mr. Davis, whom the other workers call the "chief instigator." He said foreign tourists come in to spend a few hours working. There are homeless volunteers as well as yacht club members. "We've had a few people who have built boats before and many who have never built anything." The only conflict came in deciding what colors to paint the boats.
ICE CREAM. Sembala Batchilly had never tasted ice cream during the first 22 years of his life, which were spent with his family of rice farmers in Gambia. Today, he is the assistant manager of Ben & Jerry's Times Square outlet, at 43d Street and Eighth Avenue, and an ice cream scooping champion.
"I came to New York in 1990," he said in the store. "I had an uncle in the Bronx. I spoke Saroule, my tribal language, and Mandinka and Fula and Wolof. I learned Arabic in my village. Three days a week, I worked on the teacher's farm. But I did not speak English."
After eight months of unemployment, he became a dishwasher. Somebody told him about the Common Ground program at the Times Square Hotel, which provided housing and job counseling for people on narrow margins. He got a room, and when Ben & Jerry's opened last summer, he got a job. "I started to learn English. I learned Cherry Garcia, Rocky Road and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough," Mr. Batchilly said.
His English improved quickly. He was made assistant manager. He enrolled in a word-processing course. He was chosen to represent the store in a scooping contest, where the object was to dish out just the right amount of ice cream while rapidly filling a variety of orders. He beat everybody in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region, and last month went to the nationals in Vermont, the home of Ben and Jerry's. He was the only Gambian.
"We had to scoop three small cones, two waffle cones, two medium cones, one large cup, one hot fudge sundae, one banana fudge royale, and we had to write 'Happy Birthday, John' in icing on a cake. I did it in two minutes and 40 seconds. It was not fast enough. I lost by 10 seconds." He said he loved Vermont, where he visited the company's stockholder meeting. He said he was saving his money for a place of his own.
PORN. The Times Square Adult Shoppers Center on 42d Street near Eighth Avenue differs from its neighboring vendors of pornographic videotapes and sex paraphernalia by offering shopping carts to customers. A few of the suits actually use them as they move through aisles arrayed in categories that, in addition to the obvious, included spanking, tickling, slaves and shoes.
By the cash register, store workers chatted casually about the cold. When they were asked if anything was selling particularly well in advance of Valentine's Day, one replied that yes, metal-studded dog collars were proving popular.
Asked where he was from, the man said he had come four years ago from Bangladesh. The conversation turned to the female Bangladeshi writer who fled her country after being threatened with execution for writings that challenged taboos on female sexuality. Did he know of her case?
"Oh, you mean Taslima Nasrin," said the man, surrounded by tons of pornography at what may still be the Crossroads of the World. "Yes, I know of it. The modesty of woman, it is a problem everywhere in the world."

HEADLINE: When Congress Faced Baseball and Struck Out

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Orrin Hatch's suggestion that it is possible the Senate might consider lifting a part of organized baseball's antitrust exemption (some editions, Feb. 9) may mark the end of a 73-year masquerade in which organized baseball pretended it was not in interstate commerce. 
 To my knowledge, the last time a Congressional committee seriously considered legislation affecting organized baseball began with a hearing before the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Study of Monopoly Power, on July 31, 1951.
In the chair was Representative Emanuel Celler, who was also the chairman of the full committee. John Paul Stevens was the subcommittee's associate counsel, and this writer was its general counsel. Ty Cobb was the leadoff witness.
Before the subcommittee were three bills, introduced by Representatives Wilbur D. Mills, A. S. Herlong Jr. and Melvin Price. These bills would, if they had been enacted, exempt baseball and all other organized sports from the antitrust laws.
They were introduced because organized baseball feared that the decision of the Supreme Court in a 1922 case, Federal Baseball Club v. National League, would be overturned.
In that case the Court held that baseball involves "purely state affairs," with only incidental effects on interstate commerce. Consequently, baseball contracts, which were in restraint of trade, were outside the purview of Federal laws such as the antitrust laws.
In 1951 it was factually clear that baseball was big business having an impact across state lines in a multitude of ways. Moreover, the Supreme Court had decided the Federal League case on the basis of an 1868 case, which was overruled by the Court in 1944.
In 1951 the owners were defending a number of cases in the lower courts, and they expected that their exempt status would end, so they turned to Congress to save them.
Larry McPhail's testimony closed 16 days of hearings, with 33 witnesses, more than 50 exhibits and a total of 1,643 pages of transcript. The subcommittee was never able to agree on a report or to report out the bills.
All the members were lawyers. There were those who looked at the question from a legal standpoint and opposed the bills. There were others who recognized the legal argument but who advanced a concept based on the belief that baseball was more of a sport than a crass commercial enterprise. There was deadlock.
Contrary to expectations, the Supreme Court in 1953 decided Toolson v. New York Yankees in favor of the owners. It held that where a business has for 30 years developed in reliance on a Supreme Court ruling, it was not subject to the antitrust laws. Also, where Congress has not by legislation overruled the Court's decision, the Court would not reverse itself, with potentially severe retrospective effect.
Subsequent cases involving other sports and the arts did not follow Toolson. Thus, baseball has received special treatment not given to any other sport.
There is now the possibility that the adverse effect of baseball's deadlock on the general economy will result in the legislation that the club owners have so long feared and fought.

Baseball's Harmonious Environment

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ariz.

 BODY:
THE best professional baseball teams in the United States are conducting spring training in this flat Phoenix suburb, morning through night, rain or shine. Their seasons begin April 1. There will be no strike, no lockout, not this season, not any season.
"Not for 2,000 years," said Ito Yanagi, in a soft rain outside the Chiba Lotte Marines clubhouse. He waved his hand, as if in disgust. "We don't have that stuff." 
 Yanagi, a no-nonsense interpreter for the Japanese League's Pacific Division team, kept his head dry with a white cap that had a blue "M" on the front. The caps were everywhere on the San Diego Padres' side of the Peoria Sports Complex, on the heads of 60-plus players clattering around in their spikes and even the Japanese reporters striding alongside.
Across the complex, on the Seattle Mariners' side where the Chunichi Dragons were making similar use of an inclement day, an American father and son strolled the grounds, wearing blue Chunichi caps with their stylish white "D's". The father explained how they got the caps at the Dragons-Marines exhibition game last weekend.
"It hit me that 2,500 American fans watched two Japanese teams play, and it's the only legitimate game they may see for a while," said Dr. Tom House, nonpracticing psychologist and the Chiba Lotte pitching coach under the new manager, Bobby Valentine. "Is that crazy, or what?"
To the Japanese, the major leagues' bitter strike is simply that, another example of a gun-crazed society's shooting itself in the foot. "People have to find a way to get along," said Yanagi, who makes sure the Japanese reporters understand the three foreign (American) players, or gaijin, Julio Franco, Pete Incaviglia and Eric Hillman.
If Yanagi didn't come to that conclusion by watching our television evening news, or listening to Bud Selig and Donald Fehr, a van carrying a group of Japanese reporters in Phoenix was recently shot at by a car of youths as they shouted racial slurs.
Hillman, a Mets left-hander who had a job with the post office in Port St. Lucie, Fla., lined up had he not been signed by Valentine, was suddenly eager to move on to Japan.
"The labor situation had nothing to do with me being here," he said. "My wife and I have always wanted to see Japan, to live in a society where people have respect for one another."
Outside the United States, but still very much in the global economy, House was recently in Seoul, South Korea, finding Los Angeles Dodgers merchandise on every corner. The Dodgers have a Korean pitcher, Chan Ho Park, and have also signed a Japanese pitcher, Hideo Nomo. Their rotation could soon include a Korean, Japanese, Mexican and Dominican.
"If that's not a statement, I don't know what is," House said. "I don't know when, but I can see a couple of major league teams in Japan, one in Seoul and one in Hawaii, as the stopover on the way. Think of the potential."
Think of the potential global-generated revenue, and this labor war might seem like a battle over sand castles in the desert. "It's so nonproductive, so self-destructive that the Japanese can't relate to it at all," Valentine said.
Yes, there is a Japanese players' union. No, there isn't a snowball's chance in Arizona of the Japanese game shutting down. The minimum salary for a Japanese player is $160,000, higher than the major leagues'. There are $4 million Japanese players but they negotiate their own deals. No agents. And no free agency until after 10 years.
The difference, said House, is that Chiba and the other corporations that own the teams traditionally offer players lifetime employment. Unlike the resentment bred by imperious American owners, baseball labor relations in Japan have historically been cordial.
"The players are much less individualistic," House said. "Discipline is a way of life."
It's a harmonious working environment, occasionally disturbed by headstrong gaijin.
"We had Mel Hall last season," Ito Yanagi said, of the former Yankee, now a Chunichi Dragon. "He was a pain."
Later, with reporters from both countries waiting in the rain for Incaviglia and Franco, the two American stars slipped out a side door, and disappeared. The embarrassed Chiba Lotte public relations people apologized profusely. This sort of conduct baffled them, too.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weak Against Mark But Is Barely Off vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped against the German mark yesterday as technical selling and concerns about the stability of Mexico combined to offset the positive effects of a rally in the American bond market.
But the dollar ended only slightly lower against the Japanese yen. Selling of yen for marks and reports of large-scale buying of United States Treasury securities by Japanese investors helped provide a floor for the dollar, analysts said. The dollar slipped to 98.50 yen, from 98.72 on Monday. 
 The dollar fell as low as 1.5065 marks, its lowest since Jan. 31, when it reached 1.5025. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 1.5091 marks, down from 1.5212 on Monday.
The British pound slipped to $1.5623 from $1.5625. The pound, which fell sharply against the mark yesterday, has been weakened by concerns about a rift in Britain's ruling Conservative Party over further economic integration within the European Union.
The dollar's decline against the mark and other leading European currencies surprised many people in the market, who had expected the dollar to continue tracking American stock and bond markets in the absence of other guiding factors. Rising stock and bond prices tend to push the dollar higher, because it means higher demand for the dollars needed to buy the securities.
"The decoupling of the dollar and bond prices wasn't what most people had anticipated," said Kevin Harris, international economist at MCM Currencywatch Inc. "It's been an easy bet to watch the bond market for the past few weeks."
Bond prices rallied yesterday after the Commerce Department reported a small increase in retail sales and made lower-than-expected upward revisions in sales data for November and December. But the gains in bonds failed to benefit the dollar.
Dealers said the dollar's drop below 1.52 marks in midmorning trading in New York set off a wave of technical selling by large funds, which moved out of dollars and into marks, Swiss francs and other European currencies.
"Technically speaking, the dollar is very soft," said Rob Fullem, a trader at National Westminster Bank P.L.C. in New York. "Add in a bit of uncertainty about Mexico and you have a negative day for the dollar."
Yesterday, the Governor resigned in Mexico's troubled southern state of Chiapas, an auction of short-term Mexican Government debt produced mixed results and the peso fell sharply to close at 5.845 to the dollar from 5.695 on Monday.

HEADLINE: A Stolen Homer Returns Home, But Less Authentic Than Before

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Now you see them, now you don't.
Any way you look at it, there are two extra sailboats and some flying sea gulls in a Winslow Homer watercolor that weren't there when the American master painted the seascape in 1880. The ghostly additions materialized sometime after the painting, "Off Gloucester Harbor," was stolen in 1969 and before it reappeared in 1992. Thereby hangs a bittersweet tale, one that ended yesterday with the return of the defaced painting to its owner more than a quarter-century after its theft but with a central mystery still unsolved.
"They're not dead sure it can ever be restored," said Sophia L. Truslow, the lawyer for the owner, Ellen Jennings of Ipswich, Mass. Insurance companies, she said, won't touch the painting now. "It's not a Homer," she said. "It's a Homer and Joe Blow." 
 As told in Federal court papers and interviews with Robert Van Etten, the United States Customs Service special agent in charge in New York, the work, which had been valued at about $125,000, was one of four Homer works -- two watercolors and two drawings -- that were stolen from the home of Mrs. Jennings and her late husband, Frederic, on Jan. 16, 1969. Nothing else was taken in the break-in.
The painting is of two boys in a rowboat on calm water looking at a schooner passing in the distance to the right. (In an unusual footnote, a woman who saw the picture on loan to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1959 was able to name one of the boys as Charles O. Brigham, who had become her father-in-law. She said Brigham had told her that the boys were out rowing when the artist asked them to pose, paying one boy 10 cents and writing out a signed I.O.U. for 10 cents to the other.)
In March 1992, court records say, Peter Juvelis, an art broker from Mexico and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., consigned for sale by Christie's auction house in New York a Homer watercolor for a client, Georgina Maldonado. When Christie's asked about the history of the picture's ownership, Mr. Juvelis "stated he had no bill of sale because his client received the watercolor as a gift from a Mexican official," a Customs Service agent, Bonnie Goldblatt, declared in sworn statements.
When Christie's sought authentification from a Homer expert, whom the authorities sought to keep anonymous, she identified it as the long-missing Gloucester Harbor scene. She also noticed the addition of two smaller sailboats on the left and sea gulls in the sky, apparently to disguise the work as a painting other than the one that had been stolen.
The expert then recalled, Ms. Goldblatt's affidavits said, that two years earlier she had authenticated a Homer drawing consigned by the same Mr. Juvelis. This drawing -- "Boy Sitting on a Stump," from 1879 -- was also one of the Homers stolen from the Jennings home, but by oversight it had not been registered as missing. In that case, the court papers said, the sale went through unnoticed, at a price of $54,000.
When Customs Service agents interviewed Mr. Juvelis about the drawing in Fort Lauderdale in 1992, he again named the owner as Ms. Maldonado, who, he said, had received it from friends 20 years before, the affidavits stated.
Further investigation showed that Mr. Juvelis was married to Ms. Maldonado, Ms. Goldblatt said.
Furthermore, the agent testified, when the Customs Service asked for the commercial form documenting the importation of the Homer painting from Mexico, as required for sale transactions, Mr. Juvelis said there was none because a friend had carried it in for him.
Soon afterward, the agent's account continued, Christie's received a letter from Enrico Beteta, the economic attache at the Mexican consulate in Miami, stating that the painting had been shipped out "through diplomatic channels" to New York for Mr. Juvelis.
The investigation then showed, Ms. Goldblatt stated, that Mr. Beteta was married to the daughter of Mr. Juvelis and Ms. Maldonado. The daughter and Mr. Beteta gave the Customs Service conflicting accounts of the painting's ownership, the agent declared.
Michael I. Rose, a Miami lawyer for Mr. Juvelis, said his client had been "duped" into buying the stolen works from an art dealer in Ipswich who died years ago. Mr. Rose said he did not have the dealer's name or other details; nor, he said, could he immediately reach Mr. Juvelis in Mexico City. He described Mr. Juvelis as "an elderly gentleman in his 70's, retired and living off his children" and the money from the sale of the Homer drawing.
Mr. Juvelis maintained that he had no idea who altered the watercolor but that it had happened before he bought it, Mr. Rose said.
The lawyer said the reason that Mr. Juvelis did not originally identify Ms. Maldonado as his wife was so he could collect a brokerage commission on the sales.
The Mexican consulate in Miami was closed yesterday afternoon and there was no residential listing for Mr. Beteta.
Asked whether Mr. Juvelis had the other two missing Homers -- the watercolor "Going Berrying" and the drawing "Bo Peep" -- Mr. Rose replied, "Not to my knowledge." He said that no criminal charges against Mr. Juvelis were pending but that he faced costly civil lawsuits.
When the drawing was identified as stolen, Christie's bought it back from the buyer and returned it to Mrs. Jennings. The watercolor, which had been seized from Christie's by the Customs Service, was handed back to Ms. Truslow for Mrs. Jennings at the Customs House in the World Trade Center yesterday.
Because the defaced work was a delicate watercolor rather than an opaque oil painting, experts say it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove all traces of the phantom additions.
"It's not the first time people tried to disguise works of art," said Mr. Van Etten, although he and his agents said they could not recall a similar instance of vandalism.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Elisabeth Maxwell;
Questions Without Answers

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL 

 BODY:
SHE arrives, apologizing.
The driver took her first to the old La Goulue and she had to ask directions to the new La Goulue, and that is why she is late. "I don't know the town," Elisabeth Maxwell says in her French-accented English. "When I've come I've had to rely on other people's experience. Like a parcel, really, in the hands of my hosts."
As she sits, the women at the surrounding tables don't recognize her. In fact, they look right through her. The royal blue suit and watercolored silk scarf at the throat are on the wrong side of chic for the Upper East Side (where it's taupe or die), and her level of concentration is too grim even for the would-be business lunchers, male and female alike, who sneak admiring glances at their own profiles in the mirror as soon as their guests look down. 
 Mrs. Maxwell has come to discuss her autobiography, "A Mind of My Own" (HarperCollins, $25), which officially marks the end of her life as a parcel. It was an image reinforced by her late husband, the publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, to quash her attempts at independence and establishing a career of her own.
In large part, he succeeded. During 46 years of marriage she gave birth to nine children, helped Maxwell start and build Pergamon Press, a science publishing house that grew to such proportion it was sold in 1991 for $766 million, and even in the last decade of his life, as her husband's behavior grew progressively more eccentric and cruel, she remained loyal, despite his prolonged absences and repeated threats of a legal separation. Which he never acted on.
What she has to show for her efforts is spectacular ruin; debt, dishonor and the potential destruction of two sons' careers. When Maxwell died in 1991, at 68, falling overboard from his yacht, his holdings were vast, including The Daily News in New York and Macmillan Publishing, and the rush of questions was immediate. Was it murder? Suicide? Or just a heart attack? Was he trying to escape the consequences of accumulating a $5 billion debt? Did he purposely leave Ian and Kevin Maxwell liable for the pension funds of thousands of employees that he had illegally used as security against other businesses? (The other children were not employees.)
The trial for Mrs. Maxwell's sons, who have been accused of conspiracy to commit fraud, begins this spring in England. She says she is not allowed to talk about it but proves willing to talk about everything else, even the early deaths of two of her children. Her eldest, Michael, was in a car accident in 1961 at age 16 that left him in a coma until he died at 23. A daughter, Karine, died of acute leukemia in 1957 at age 3.
Mrs. Maxwell speaks with a candor and dignity that can come only from a wrenching self-scrutiny, the kind most people spend a lifetime avoiding. At 73, she radiates strength. She radiates survival.
"Once the book was written, it was out of my system, so to speak," she begins. "As soon as my husband died, I never was allowed any time to grieve. I was hoisted on a public platform from Day One. At long last I feel I've buried my husband. I have relived the whole of my life, the good and the bad, and I can speak with a certain amount of detachment. I couldn't talk about Michael's death for years. Now I can because the cutting edge of suffering is gone. It's similar with Bob's death and the circumstances surrounding it."
The most pressing issue is the fate of her sons, who she insists are not guilty. She says the financial losses she has sustained since her husband's death, including her own pension and the auction of her Oxford home and personal belongings, weigh on her far less. (For the last two years, she has lived in a borrowed apartment in London.)
"Kevin has said to me, 'Mummy, if it comes to pass, I will atone for my father.' " Her look pierces. "This is the overwhelming sadness of my life," she says. "Being left in these circumstances means nothing to me. I have had an extraordinary life. I could have had the moon if it was accessible. But to see my sons' careers in ruin, knowing their character and the kind of men they are, is unacceptable and unforgivable. That they should be left by their father in this mess." Her china blue eyes glint angrily.
If she could speak to her husband now, what would she say? "I just would like to ask him what went wrong," she says. "He was a very intelligent man, a gambler, but he knew when to stop to make a good deal. I don't understand how he could make his companies so vulnerable. It seemed very deliberate."
Her green salad and Parmesan souffle are served. "It's strange," she continues. "Toward the end of his life he wanted no constraint of any kind. I was a constraint. I was his soul. Looking at me he knew I disapproved of his life style. I was a perpetual reproach. I really have thought a lot about that. The lust for power. I regret now that he didn't die on his 65th birthday because he would have died a hero. He had a great many assets, the banks at his feet. I don't think he was ever liked, but he was admired. What demons pushed him to acquire Macmillan? He didn't need it. Why?"
I don't know," she answers herself helplessly. "Power mad. If the world recession hadn't settled in, Maxwell Communications would have become one of the largest companies. He was very modern. He saw things like Internet at a time no one else did. To be able to communicate to the entire world from a desk was a vision he had. He really was a communications man," she says proudly.
B UT when it came to personal communications, he seemed to fail. She smiles. "That was really the irony, you know. To communicate between two human beings is a very humble level, and an extremely complex affair. He didn't like doing it."
She is formidable, really in her clear-eyed assessment of where she is and how she got here. As she speaks of her family's disgrace, her reserve never falters. Yet, she is not cold. She is not uncaring. She is a realist.
Well-born to a French Huguenot family, Mrs. Maxwell studied at the Sorbonne during the Second World War, hoping to become a lawyer. She met Mr. Maxwell in Paris while working for the Welcome Committee for Allied Officers. She was Protestant, he was Jewish, she was rich, he was poor, she was educated, he was not. They married. While he traveled the world, building the business, she stayed at home helping to recreate his family, as he put it, since his parents, three sisters and one brother had been killed in Auschwitz. As their children grew, she continued to work in the company, primarily with the editors, though he refused ever to formalize her position.
In the 1980's she returned to college, at Oxford, where she earned a doctorate in French history and became a historian on the Holocaust, with an emphasis on its meaning for Christians. Maxwell still called on her to help with the business, and she always complied, in spite of his flagrant womanizing (which she writes about plainly) and increasingly erratic personal behavior.
"We had a very strange relationship," she says, sipping her coffee. "With all the ups and downs, he kept his love for me enormously protective. He was really a very sick man at the end of his life, and I couldn't imagine anyone else looking after him, although he had been very beastly with me in that last year. At the time it broke something in me, but I couldn't have stopped looking after him. It was 1987 or 1988 when our paths really diverged. His style of life was too big, too shallow, for me. I embarked on a much more spiritual path. He admired what I was doing, and I didn't understand what he was doing. I couldn't understand the reaching for more and more and more. It frightened me."
"So, yes, I feel betrayed," she says flatly. "I cannot imagine he willingly would want me or his children or the pensioners to suffer. I was left only with debts, and I can't repay them. If my friends hadn't lent me money I would have gone bankrupt myself. People like these, to me, redeem the world, and it's not only a question of money. People have been kind without a bean to give me. There is no pattern to the courage to care. Some are marvelous, while some have no heart, no brain. Cowards."
Knowing what she knows now about her life, would she do it again? She thinks. "I'll give a mixed answer," she says. "Yes. Bob has given me a life of such dimension that has stretched me so far, he has got the best out of me." She seems unaware of the present tense. "For all this I feel very grateful. I do regret now not to have left him. We would all have been better for it.
"And knowing what I know to the bitter end now, well, no one would want to see their children suffer that much. That is not acceptable."
H ER tone soon grows philosophical. "Ah, it is wonderful to pick and choose the things in life to do better." She shrugs. "The worst years of my life were 1981 to 1991. I was at his beck and call with no kudos, nothing was right. What saved me was my work on the Holocaust. From there I started a new world of studies and also a rethinking of my faith. At the time, I was really suffering a lack of confidence in myself to go it alone. It was stupid, really, the feeling" -- she bites her lip -- "that I couldn't possibly manage. To think now I'm in even tougher circumstances! That is perhaps what I reproach most to him in this putting down of my abilities, demeaning me. He really shouldn't have done that. It wasn't true. Very often my own children said, 'Why not run away?' I very bitterly regret it now," she concludes, though no anger lingers in her voice. "C'est la vie. Nothing is black and white, and with all the difficulties that came there were some great moments."
She keeps drinking her coffee, the light shining on her reddish hair. She is fearless, serene. How has she managed it?
"I tell you I had made up my mind a long time ago that lies have very small feet," she says. "I find my life is made so much simpler being myself, saying the truth. One's innocence of a misdeed gives extreme strength. And that keeps you relatively free and above the fray."
Still, she circles back, once again, to her husband. "What are the driving forces that make people do things?" she wonders. "I hope one day there will be a balance. That time passes, passions fall and eventually some truths emerge. It was really a Greek tragedy that his path should have finished the way it did. And after a lifetime, what did it take, a few months to turn it around." She shakes her head and opens her hands. "Ah, voila!" she says. The questions have no end.
After she leaves, the hostess grows curious. "Where is she from?" she wants to know. France, originally, she is told. But she lives in London now. She wants to know more, but a table of regular customers gets up to leave, and they each kiss her on both cheeks as she helps them on with their coats and sees them out the door. She returns, looking quizzical. She had a question about someone, didn't she? Ah, voila! She smiles prettily. She has forgotten.

HEADLINE: The Invasion of the Chinese Truffle

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
THE prized, richly fragrant black truffles of France have been called black diamonds. But for some swanky dishes this season, zircons may be more like it.
Another, cheaper kind of black truffle, the tuber himalayensis from China, has been flooding the market. This influx has created a problem because unscrupulous dealers in France have been mixing the two and selling them all as French truffles, tuber melanosporum, to restaurants. Dealers in the United States have been doing the same. 
 Although the two types look the same, the Chinese truffles, when cut, are likely to be blacker, with less veining. They tend to have a chemical odor and very little flavor.
Good French black truffles have an intense, slightly musky fragrance, with a hint of sweetness, and a rich, earthy flavor. They are as much as four times the price of the Chinese ones.
"Right after Christmas I started getting some truffles that I thought were overripe at first," said Daniel Boulud, the chef and owner of Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan. "They were very dark and had very little veining. They smelled of benzine and tasted like cardboard. Then I began hearing about the Chinese truffles." Mr. Boulud said they were mixed in with French truffles.
He buys his truffles from four suppliers and said he would not name the ones that might have sent him the Chinese truffles. "It's getting better now," he said. "But we check every truffle that comes in."
In his restaurant, he uses black truffles to make sea scallops "in black tie," an appetizer costing $21. A baked potato or a salad lavished with black truffles is from $35 to $40, depending on the cost of the truffles.
Mr. Boulud is not the only chef who has been ambushed by Chinese truffles. David Waltuck, the chef and co-owner of Chanterelle in Manhattan, said the Chinese truffles look very good. And mixed into a box containing French truffles, the aroma of the better truffles masks the smell of the Chinese ones. "You can tell them apart, but if you're not expecting to have to, you might not realize the difference."
In the United States the wholesale price for European black truffles, which are usually available fresh from January through March, is around $400 a pound. The Chinese truffles are about $120 a pound wholesale.
Once the truffles are sliced or slivered and cooked, mixed in with other ingredients like a splash of good truffle oil, a Chinese truffle would be harder to spot than Waldo.
No Chinese truffles seemed to be mixed in with fresh French and Italian black truffles sampled from Balducci's, Dean & DeLuca and Urbani Truffle in Manhattan over the last week. These retailers were selling fresh European black truffles for $29 to $49 an ounce. At Grace's Marketplace, the Chinese truffles are labeled and sold for $250 a pound, compared with $640 for the French or Italian.
Like other expensive delicacies, including caviar and saffron, black truffles have long invited fraud and mislabeling. Cheaper grayish summer truffles have been dyed black and passed off in jars as black truffles. Diluted or chemically concocted truffle juice has been sold as the real thing.
Truffles have always been a luxury, now more than ever. In recent years, the annual harvest in France in the Perigord and Provence has been down to 20 tons from the 800 tons gathered annually at the end of the last century. Attempts at cultivating truffles, a fungus that grows around the roots of oak trees and is sniffed out by pigs or dogs, usually at night, have not been successful.
In China, truffles have been used as feed for pigs. The Chinese do not eat them. Recently they discovered that the fungi might have real value in Europe and elsewhere, and they began exporting them. Small quantities of the Chinese truffles began showing up in France last year, but nothing like this winter's shipments, which the Parisian newspaper Le Monde estimated were equal to France's annual harvest. This is the first season that Chinese truffles have appeared on the American market.
Most restaurants simply identify one dish or other on the menu as "truffled" or say that the lobster, foie gras, soup or sauce is served "with truffles."
But Jean Joho, the chef at the Everest Room in Chicago, compared serving Chinese truffles without identifying them to "selling American paddlefish caviar for Russian sevruga."
In fact, there are plenty of people who are happy with American sturgeon caviar. And evidently some who do not mind Chinese truffles either. On Monday, Joe Doria, an owner of Grace's Marketplace, said he had been carrying them but had sold all and was waiting for another shipment. "They're good and they're cheaper," he added.
Chris Pappas, an owner of Dairyland, a cheese and delicacy wholesaler in the South Bronx, said he was importing the truffles from China and selling them to restaurants. "They taste wonderful," Mr. Pappas said. "It's an economical way for a restaurant to put black truffle on the menu."
At Arqua, Sistina and Sette Mezzo, three Manhattan restaurants that serve polenta, risotto or other dishes with the Chinese truffles, they are usually described simply as black truffles. At Sette Mezzo, the chef, Pino Coladonate, said, "We tell the customers what kind if they ask."

HEADLINE: Fewer Women Are Said to Use Contraceptives

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
After many years of increasing contraceptive use in America, the number of women who say they use contraceptives has begun to drop, according to Government figures made public today.
The National Center for Health Statistics, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, issued the study on contraceptive use by women from 1982 to 1990, the latest year for which data have been analyzed. 
 The figures show that overall, contraceptive use declined to 59 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 in 1990, from 60 percent in 1988.
The report also shows that among those who use some method of contraception, condoms have become much more popular and use of birth control pills has declined.
Dr. Jacqueline Darroch Forrest, senior vice president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York, a research group working on reproductive issues, said that the figures confirmed a trend that other data had suggested: "We were moving toward greater prevention of unintended pregnancy, but now the figures look as though they are being reversed," she said.
Dr. Forrest said that sexual activity had continued to increase, but at the same time many women had stopped using contraceptive pills. Although condom use is up, a majority of those using condoms say they do so inconsistently, she said.
The most popular method of contraception remains sterilization, which in 1990 accounted for 42 percent of the methods used, compared with 28.5 percent for the pill, and 17.7 percent for condoms. New, long-acting methods of contraception like implants or injections were not included in the data because they were not available in 1990.
In 1982, only 7 percent of women 15 to 44 used condoms. But in 1988, the figure had risen to 9 percent, and by 1990 it had risen to 11 percent. The pill was used by 30.7 percent in 1988, but by only 28.5 percent in 1990.
"A major question is why some women have stopped using the pill," Dr. Forrest said. "Many of the women who have stopped are in the low-income groups. It may be that their increasing lack of access to family planning programs, as budgets for those have not kept up with inflation, is part of the reason. The cost of pills has gone up; maybe it is harder for them to afford."
One of the most dramatic trends noted in the study concerned young women who were having intercourse for the first time. In 1982, about 28 percent used a condom at first intercourse, but by 1990 the figure had risen to 55 percent.
These women are among those most at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, said Linda S. Peterson of the Center for Health Statistics, the author of the report.

HEADLINE: Despite Efforts, Building-Site Violence Still Occurs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The shooting yesterday on 42d Street, which the police have tied to crews of extortionists claiming to seek construction jobs for minority workers, comes after prosecutors have worked in recent years to crack down on groups that use violence to demand jobs and money at construction sites.
It could not be determined whether the two groups in yesterday's clash have come under previous scrutiny, but law-enforcement officials said the incident showed that despite attempts to crack down on the crews, violence by such groups is still common. 
 "It's clear with an episode like today's that the coalitions are still out there," said Ruth Nordenbrook, an assistant United States attorney, who prosecuted two cases last year against members of groups that shake down contractors with the claim that they are obtaining jobs for black and Hispanic workers.
Ms. Nordenbrook said that the Government does not accept the legitimacy of groups that use violence at job sites.
"The Government's position is that they are not civil rights activists and never have been," Ms. Nordenbrook said. "They have merely used that as an excuse for their otherwise extortionate behavior."
Ms. Nordenbrook said that in 1993, when 31 people were indicted in the Eastern District for running eight groups, more than 40 such organizations were operating in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens and, to a limited extent, on Staten Island.
"We're into the second generation," she said. "They've been going on for, I'd say, 20 or 25 years." But, she said, as the economy worsened, complaints increased and some people were hurt at sites at which extortion was resisted.
The groups, she said, "range from two guys who go out on foot from the subway and go to a construction site and say, 'We're the coalition, and this is our neighborhood and you have to put somebody to work; or you have to pay us to keep other people away, or you have to give us the security job on your site or you're going to have problems.'
"It ranges from that to the coalitions that were involved in our indictments, which typically would arrive at a job site with as many people as they could find -- one school bus or sometimes more, filled with so-called members.
"And by the early 90's, when these school buses arrived and leaders got off and said, 'We're the coalition, stop the work,' the work would stop. The contractors would tell their workers to stop. If they didn't, the coalition members would overrun the site."
She said that the fruits of the shakedowns often came in the form of contracts for companies run by the coalition leaders.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Senate Democrats Fail to Shield Social Security Fund From Deficit-Cutters

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The most serious Democratic attempt to alter the proposed balanced-budget amendment, one that would have excluded the vast Social Security trust fund from being tapped for future deficit reduction, went down to solid defeat today in the Senate.
Whether that signaled fresh support or trouble for the budget amendment depended mostly on which senator was talking. But the closeness of the contest was undisputed, and it was hammered home by the Republican National Committee. It moved into the states of seven wavering Democrats today with broadcast advertisements implying that they might oppose further deficit-cutting for political reasons. 
 That burst of grass-roots strategy, and other developments, suggested that the long debate on the amendment was reaching the home stretch and that a final vote in the Senate could come this month. The House passed the measure last month.
Elsewhere in Congress, Republicans talked of abolishing four Cabinet departments and, under fire, stuck by their choice of a conservative economist to run the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Today's major action was the Senate's 57-to-41 rejection of the Social Security change, with 7 Democrats joining the Republican majority. It followed a lengthy effort by each side to cast the other as intent on robbing Social Security's billions to finance big government or to provide a quick fix for the deficit.
The Social Security proposal, sponsored by Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, would have placed Social Security income and expenses off limits for deficit-cutters, depriving them of $560 billion in surplus retirement taxes that are to flow into the Treasury between now and 2002, when the amendment calls for a balanced budget.
Democrats allowed that the prohibition would make the budget immensely more difficult to balance; eliminating the deficit is already estimated to cost more than $1.2 trillion in the next seven years. But without the Reid exemption, they said, the temptation to use Social Security as an easy source of spare change for budget balancing would be almost irresistible.
"If the Reid amendment is rejected," said Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat, in Monday's debate, "it will be the equivalent of posting a danger sign in front of every household that counts on Social Security."
For their part, Republicans argued that Social Security would be in far worse trouble if the deficit continued to mount. The Government, which buys Treasury bonds with the surplus Social Security money, will be unable to pay the debt it owes Social Security when the trust fund stops running a surplus in another 25 years or so, they said.
"The debt of our Government is the threat to Social Security," Senator Larry E. Craig, a Republican from Idaho, said.
The effect of Mr. Reid's defeat was unclear. Mr. Craig called it "a strong vote for us," echoing Republican reasoning that support for the balanced-budget amendment would have dropped if its cost had risen hundreds of billions higher.
But Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who supports the amendment, said the loss made it appear that the Senate had signed off on the bankrupting of Social Security. Had Social Security been exempted, he said, "there would have been in excess of 70 votes for the balanced-budget amendment."
"Now it's a much tougher situation," he said.
Most nose-counters believe the amendment has 65 or 66 of the 67 votes, or two-thirds of the Senate, required for adoption. Today the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, moved to end a weeks-long filibuster, scheduling a vote to shut off debate for Thursday. Republicans expect that vote to fail, but they said they will prevail later.
Democrats were not eager to help. Some reacted angrily to the Republican National Committee commercials, which targeted the minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and six others who previously backed balanced-budget amendments but now are on the fence.
The commercials depicted the amendment as a gift to future generations that must pay for today's Federal borrowing. "Tell Senator Ford you support the balanced-budget amendment," urged one advertisement, aimed at Kentucky's Wendell H. Ford, the minority whip. "Tell him, 'Don't put the Democratic Party first -- put our children first.' "
Mr. Ford said through a spokesman that he was pleased Republicans were "spending their thousands" on him.
In the House, Republican freshmen already known for deep-cutting fiscal policies went a step further today: they proposed abolishing four Cabinet departments.
A group led by Representatives Sam Brownback and Todd Tiahrt, both of Kansas, urged Congress to abolish Housing and Urban Development, Energy, Education and Commerce. They were joined at a news conference by two older-generation Republicans, Jack F. Kemp and Robert A. Mosbacher, who ran the Housing and Commerce departments under President Bush.
Mr. Brownback said the agencies were centralized bureaucracies of the sort that did not work in the Soviet Union and "won't work here."
At least one Republican had reservations, however: Senator Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, made it clear that the Energy Department would never vanish as long as he was in charge. Mr. Domenici represents New Mexico, a center of Energy Department weapons and research establishments.
Democrats were prickly about another fiscal matter as well: the Republicans' selection of a conservative economist, June O'Neill, to run the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Ms. O'Neill is a favorite of House Republican deficit-cutters. Today a top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Exon of Nebraska, fretted that Ms. O'Neill "may be overly controlled by the Republican leadership to the point where she may not be able to be objective."
The point is important because the office's analyses underlie most Congressional spending decisions. MICHAEL WINES

HEADLINE: Two Faces of Mexico

 BODY:
Mexico's near-term political future will be shaped by two events this week -- the decisive opposition electoral victory in the state of Jalisco and the Government's military drive against Zapatista rebel leaders in Chiapas.
The Jalisco results, which have been accepted by a ruling party once notorious for defrauding successful challengers, signals a step toward political pluralism. Jalisco will be the fourth and most important state to come under the rule of the conservative National Action Party since 1989. Chiapas, however, represents an ill-considered effort to solve political problems through military force. 
 Governments have the legal authority to suppress armed rebellion within their borders. But Americans have a right to question the wisdom of such a move. Given the Clinton Administration's political and financial investment in the Mexican Government, Washington should insist that President Ernesto Zedillo insure respect for the human rights of civilians in the conflict zone and make every effort to reach a negotiated solution.
The army has now halted its drive to reclaim rebel territory, and so far there is no clear evidence of human rights abuses. Still, the army has restricted access to the area, raising suspicions. The issue needs monitoring, and the State Department did well to raise it publicly. According to Department reporting, serious abuses took place when the Government set out to suppress the Chiapas revolt last year.
The declared goal this time was to hunt down five top leaders of the revolt, including the ski-masked Subcommander Marcos -- now identified as Rafael Sebastian Guillen Vicente. Two were captured before operations were halted yesterday. The guerrilla leaders are self-appointed revolutionaries who launched a violent insurrection in which at least 145 people were killed. But over the past year the Chiapas movement has developed a broad civilian base, including peasants who pressed their legitimate economic and social grievances under the Zapatista banner.
For the past year, the Government and rebels have negotiated over issues like land reform, cleaning up local elections and directing government aid to those most in need. Mr. Zedillo says he wants the talks to continue, and yesterday the ruling party governor, elected in a disputed vote last August, resigned. That is a significant conciliatory gesture. But having broken a 13-month cease-fire, Mr. Zedillo may now have trouble re-establishing dialogue.
The Government explains that it resorted to force only after it uncovered rebel arms caches outside Chiapas. More plausible is the theory that Mr. Zedillo, politically weakened after the recent peso crisis and rebellions within his own party, decided to look tough on the eve of the Jalisco election. By restraining its troops and resuming good-faith negotiations over peasant grievances, the Government may be able to limit damage.
Meanwhile, honoring the opposition victory in Jalisco contributes to social peace. Once Mexicans come to believe they can redress political and social grievances through the ballot box, the day of the ski-masked guerrilla will be over.

 BODY:
MARIANNE GINGRICH, wife of Speaker Newt Gingrich, visited the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, in Jerusalem yesterday while continuing to stress that her trip had no political overtones, The Associated Press reported.
Mrs. Gingrich had been asked repeatedly during her weeklong visit to Israel whether her job with the Israel Export Development Company, an Israeli company that is building an industrial park in the southern part of the country, posed a conflict of interest for her husband. Both Gingriches have said that her $2,500-a-month-position seeking American commercial tenants for an Israeli free-trade zone did not involve any lobbying or other dealings with the United States Government. 
 She met with two lawmakers in the Knesset who had helped pass a bill in June enabling her employer to operate mostly tax free.
David Yerushalmi, chairman of the company, termed her visit to the Knesset "a courtesy call." NADINE BROZAN
