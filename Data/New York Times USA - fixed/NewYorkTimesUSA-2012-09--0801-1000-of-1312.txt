HEADLINE: Veterans' Jobs Bill Blocked in the Senate

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Eager to shoot down President Obama's legislative agenda just weeks before the election, Senate Republicans blocked a measure that would have provided $1 billion over five years to help veterans find work. 

 BODY:
Eager to shoot down President Obama's legislative agenda just weeks before the election, Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked a measure that would have provided $1 billion over five years to help veterans find work in their communities. 
The measure, which would have potentially created jobs for up to 20,000 veterans, was blocked on a procedural point by Republicans, who argued that the bill was unpaid for. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and the bill's main sponsor, said the bill would have covered the costs in part with fees on Medicare providers and suppliers who are delinquent on their tax bills.
The procedural vote was 58 to 40; 60 votes would have been required to waive Republican objections. 
The bill was opposed, by, among others, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who said he believed the bill duplicated existing job programs for veterans that are not well run, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has been seeking amendments on bills that would cut off funding to Egypt and to Pakistan until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.
"It's both shocking and shameful that Republicans today chose to kill a bill to put America's veterans back to work," Ms. Murray said in a statement. 
"At a time when one in four young veterans are unemployed," she said, "Republicans should have been able, for just this once, to put aside the politics of obstruction and to help these men and women provide for their families."
She added that the vote was "stark reminder" that Mitch McConnell, Senate minority leader from Kentucky, and Senate Republicans "are willing to do absolutely anything to fulfill the pledge he made nearly two years ago to defeat President Obama. It doesn't matter who gets in their way or which Americans they have to sacrifice in that pursuit, even if it's our nation's veterans."
Some Republicans, five of whom voted for the bill, also seemed disappointed about the failure of legislation that had the veneer of bipartisan support. "These men and women have worn our uniform, shouldered the burden and faced unthinkable dangers in forward areas during a very dangerous time," Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said. 
The vote was met with a strong rebuke from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. "Once again, this Congress let partisan bickering stand in the way of putting thousands of America's heroes back to work," said Paul Rieckhoff, the organization's founder. "Lowering veteran unemployment is something both parties should be able to agree on - even in an election year."

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans Not Eager to Discuss Romney Video

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Republican Senate leaders declined to answer questions on the Romney video. 

 BODY:
Republican leaders in the Senate on Wednesday were intent on showing Mitt Romney how it's done: blast President Obama for his lack of leadership, castigate his economic record, then flee.
It is a time-honored ritual, while the Senate is in session, to hold mini-news conferences after the two parties break away from their weekly policy luncheons. Party leaders spout the party line. Reporters ignore their opening statements and ask questions about the issue of the moment. Everyone leaves happy.
But on Wednesday, Republican leaders broke tradition. The party line stuff was well-represented, by Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, John Thune of South Dakota, John Barrasso of Wyoming and Roy Blunt of Missouri. But when the last word was spouted, they turned en masse and fled, no questions taken.
The reason was obvious: While the senators wanted to stay on message, the throng of reporters had one question in mind - the senators' thoughts on Mitt Romney and his 47 percent musings. 
Before the lunches, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, a Republican in a tough election fight, joined other embattled candidates and broke with Mr. Romney. 
"I have a very different view of the world having grown up with a father who was an auto mechanic and a mother who was a school cook and five brothers and sisters," he said.
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, reiterated his feelings about his nominee's notion that nearly half of Americans view themselves as victims entitled to government handouts.
"A lot of those people don't want to be in those situations. They want to work, and I'm going to continue to do the things I think will help them," he said.
Democrats were gleefully twisting the knife. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, continued to needle Mr. Heller, whom, he has made clear, he would just as soon not return to the Senate next year.
Mr. Heller "recognized how toxic Romney's comments are, but that's interesting coming from someone who just a short time ago compared the unemployed people to hobos, that was his word, hobos," Mr. Reid said. He was referring to a 2010 comment when Mr. Heller, then a House member, questioned extending unemployment benefits by asking, "Is government now creating hobos?"
"We have a long line of people who are running from Romney as if the Olympics are still on," Mr. Reid added.
Chased down in flight, Mr. Blunt declined to say how much the Romney comments were roiling the Republican conversation. "I just don't think we ought to talk about what was said at lunch," he said.

HEADLINE: 'The Romney Plan'

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: A new ad lays out a rosy, albeit vague, vision of what the country would look like under Mitt Romney's leadership. 

 BODY:
Here's something exceedingly rare in presidential campaign ads: A 100 percent positive commercial. No swipes at the president, no grenades lobbed at the other party's policies. This ad is just 30 seconds of Mr. Romney laying out a rosy, albeit vague, vision of what the country would look like under his leadership.
"My plan is to help the middle class," Mr. Romney says directly to the camera as he ticks off a to-do list: getting tough on China, balancing the budget, cutting the deficit and championing small business.
As Mr. Romney talks about the need to support small business, all of the people shown on the screen - presumably small-business owners - are women.
He says he will be able to create 12 million American jobs over four years. That's 250,000 jobs per month, or higher than the average monthly job growth for the last two years by about 100,000.
But some economists say that figure is not very ambitious. Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, already predicts that the economy will add 11.8 million jobs from 2012 to 2016.

HEADLINE: I Know Why The Caged Bird Shrieks

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: As a presidential candidate, Mitt Romney has lost himself. Co-opted convictions will always betray you. 

 BODY:
"When people show you who they are believe them; the first time."
That comes from the inimitable Maya Angelou (via the equally inimitable Oprah). And I agree.
So I'm inclined to take Mitt Romney at his word when he disparages nearly half the country to a roomful of wealthy donors on a secretly recorded tape.
As I'm sure you know by now, Romney said that the 47 percent of Americans who pay no income taxes are people who are 
dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.
He also said: 
My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.
There is no amount of backtracking and truth bending that can make this right. It's just wrong. It's not just the patently false implication that half the country is parasitic. It's not just the bleak view that they wallow in victimization. It is also his utter dismissal of this group: "my job is not to worry about those people."
Those people? Those miserable peasants scrounging around the castle entrance? Those lay-abouts with mouths open for a spoonful of rich folks' bounty? Those fate-forsaken unwashed with dirty hands outstretched for help unearned? Those ingrates who bring in a pittance but reap a premium?
Only a man who has never looked up from the pit of poverty could look down his nose with such scorn.
At the event Romney also said:
By the way, both my dad and Ann's dad did quite well in their life, but when they came to the end of their lives, and, and passed along inheritances to Ann and to me, we both decided to give it all away. So, I had inherited nothing. Everything that Ann and I have we earned the old-fashioned way, and that's by hard work.
Can this man truly be so blind as to believe that being the son of an auto executive and governor played no role in his development and access to opportunity? Can he truly believe that having a family with the means to send him to a prestigious boarding school and then on to some of the best colleges in the country had nothing to do with them and everything to do with him? Can he truly be willfully ignorant enough to not acknowledge the huddled masses at the bottom of the hill just because he started his climb half way up?
Now the Romney campaign is in full damage control mode, feverishly trying to convince Americans that they didn't hear what they heard, that there was some confusion. Romney first said that his comments were "not elegantly stated," then he tried to pivot to an argument against the redistribution of wealth, saying he believed in an America where "government steps in to help those in need." He continued, "we're a compassionate people."
Those in need? Would those be the ones "who believe that they are victims," the ones who it's not your job to "worry about," the ones who you'll never be able to persuade to "take personal responsibility and care for their lives"?
Romney's feeble explanations reek of insincerity and desperation.
And I think I know why: he's terrified.
Romney is trapped by a desperate desire for legitimacy. He is a square - in more ways than one - trying to squeeze himself into the conservative circle of trust.
In so doing, he says all the right things the wrong way. His facts are off. His timing is off. His pitch is off. He's just off. Try as he may, he just doesn't fit in. But he's now so lost in his thirst for high office that he has also lost himself. Co-opted convictions will always betray you.
Romney, whose economic plan is titled "Believe in America," demonstrated with brutal efficiency that he doesn't in fact believe in America.
I once wrote the following:
I have no personal gripe with Romney. I don't believe him to be an evil man. Quite the opposite: he appears to be a loving husband and father. Besides, evil requires conviction, which Romney lacks. But he is a dangerous man. Unprincipled ambition always is. Infinite malleability is its own vice because it's infinitely corruptible by others of ignoble intentions.
But Romney's taped comments open the door to doubt. I'm no longer confident in the basic goodness of his constitution.
One doesn't have to operate with great malice to do great harm. The absence of empathy and understanding are sufficient. In fact, a man convinced of his virtue even in the midst of his vice is the worst kind of man.
Mitt Romney keeps showing America who he is. When will we start to believe him?

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at 'Redistribution'

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: It remains unclear precisely how Mitt Romney's views on redistribution differ from those of Barack Obama. 

 BODY:
Amid the fallout over Mitt Romney's comments that 47 percent of Americans believed they were "victims" and are dependent upon government, the Republican Party is stepping up attacks that President Obama favors redistributing wealth, citing a 1998 audio clip of him saying, "I actually believe in redistribution."
The Republican National Committee released a video Wednesday that plays a carefully clipped audio segment containing the remark. The Romney campaign also seized on the quote, with its campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, saying Mr. Romney "has a different idea" - "to foster growth and create wealth, not redistribute wealth, if our economy is to grow the way it has in the past."
Part of the recording, though, might surprise critics who believe Mr. Obama has an unalloyed love of government largess: He also suggested in his comments that he agreed, at least to some degree, with attacks on "the possibility of government action and its efficacy."
"I think some of it has been deserved," Mr. Obama said, citing poor policymaking at the Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago public schools.
Moments later, Mr. Obama, then a state senator speaking at Loyola University in Chicago, uttered the words Republicans are using against him: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution, because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot."
But what still is unclear is precisely how the two candidates' views on redistribution differ. Does Mr. Romney, for example, believe the current federal tax system is too redistributive? If yes, does that conflict with his assertion that his own tax proposal will retain the progressivity of the tax code?
An aide to Mr. Romney did not respond to those questions on Wednesday. Instead, the aide repeated attacks on Mr. Obama's economic record and his "vision of a government-centered society" that includes redistributing wealth.
What is paradoxical about the sudden focus on redistribution worries is it seems to ignore data that demonstrates that the nation has seen a significant redistribution of incomes over the past generation - from the poor and middle class to the rich, and especially to the very rich - all while government policies have also become less redistributive over the same period.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in 1979, for example, 7.4 percent of after-tax income flowed to the wealthiest one percent of the population, but by 2009 that figure had grown to 11.5 percent. (This rise came despite a stock market crash that decimated portfolios of the wealthy at the tail end of the period surveyed: In 2007, the richest one percent had received 16.7 percent of income.)
Over the three decades the share of income received both by the poor and middle class fell. Only the wealthiest one-fifth of Americans saw their share of after-tax income rise, with gains concentrated among the richest five percent. In a report last year, the C.B.O. found most of the shift was due to trends in salaries, business income, capital gains, pensions and other "market income."
But the C.B.O. also noted that "government transfers and federal taxes became less redistributive." Of course, the government continues to redistribute wealth, such as through progressive income taxes: The more you make, the higher your bracket. But on Wednesday, the Romney aide did not say whether Mr. Romney believes the current federal tax system - or specific policies Mr. Obama has enacted - are too redistributive.

HEADLINE: Creative Destruction

BYLINE: By JENS BALZER. 
Jens Balzer is the pop culture editor at the newspaper Berliner Zeitung and a columnist for the German edition of Rolling Stone.

 BODY:
Berlin
THE marshal came in the early morning hours, accompanied by a locksmith and a police officer. After playing a funeral march on a piano, the last tenants left peacefully. Their eviction earlier this month marks the end of the 22-year history of Tacheles, a world-famous artists' center in Berlin's Mitte district.
Tacheles long ago lost its edgy cachet within Berlin's creative scene. But as a symbol, it stood for the city's commitment to culture over or at least alongside capital. Its demise should be a call to arms for those who want to make sure Berlin stays that way. 
Located in the heart of Berlin, just a short walk from Parliament and the chancellery, Tacheles was housed in the romantically dilapidated wreck of a former East German department store. After the Berlin Wall came down, the site quickly emerged as a locus of the burgeoning Berlin underground, providing a meeting point for musicians, artists, gallery owners and theater people.
Tacheles's fate was always in question -- its occupants were squatters, with no firm legal claim to the property. For Berlin's inhabitants and visitors alike, then, its very existence stood for the idea that the newly unified city could and would provide space for creative experiments. The art center also stood for the harmonious relationship between the anarchic underground and the official culture of the capital, which is why its eviction resounded prominently in the international news media.
Berliners, on the other hand, could hardly be bothered. It has been at least a decade since the house and its tenants have produced any kind of relevant creative impulse. The cluster of underground galleries and clubs that appeared around Tacheles in the 1990s has long since moved on, driven out by rising rents to neighborhoods in the former east and, later, to less expensive parts of former West Berlin. Bars and clubs sprang up in unused industrial buildings and along the fallow banks of the Spree River.
But this era is now ending as well. The rapid sale of the city's profitable land to real estate developers, often by the notoriously broke city itself, has led to the expulsion of the creative scene from the shores of the Spree, while hypertrophic gentrification is driving up prices in neighborhoods that, only a few years ago, were just beginning to be settled by artists and musicians.
Within this context, the shuttering of Tacheles is symbolic. The toppling of a living monument to subculture comes at a time when similar spaces in every Berlin district near the center of the city are disappearing as well.
Not that the procedure itself is unusual: In New York, creative types have fled from Manhattan to Brooklyn and will move on from there when prices rise. Gentrification is part of the normal development of every city in the world.
But development in Berlin over the last 20 years hasn't followed the normal path. The creative scene was formed during the anything-goes years after the fall of the wall. Part of its identity has been the certainty that new spaces will open up when older ones close down. Somewhere, somehow, there was always an abandoned building or lot -- the next Tacheles -- to be appropriated, if for only a limited amount of time. During the last two decades, ''Zwischennutzung,'' or ''temporary use,'' was the magic word for Berlin cultural policies.
This era is now coming to an end. Call it the ''closing of the frontier.''
What next? Berlin basks in the international attraction that all those spaces for subculture provided. In no small part, this attraction comes from the fact that life in Berlin, compared with other cities, is still quite cheap. In the words of the city's mayor, Klaus Wowereit, ''Berlin is poor, but sexy.''
Should official policy aim at keeping Berlin poor enough to encourage the further influx of sexy hipsters? The majority of Berliners say no. Most would prefer more prosperity for the city and for themselves. They would rather see fewer tourists and more business development.
On the other hand, what happens if the tourists stay away and the international public turns its back on Berlin? The prosperity of the famous night life depends on the young tourists of the so-called Easy Jet set, and the still blossoming gallery scene wouldn't survive without solvent collectors from abroad.
And it's not as if the global corporate elite are clamoring to get into Berlin. There is no growing industrial or financial sector to drive the city's wealth. Berlin still has the highest unemployment rate among German states, and its few booming industries, like Web development, belong to the creative sector. Thus the paradox: the more development, the less attractive Berlin will be to the creative classes, which in turn fuel the city's development.
That's why members of the subculture aren't the only ones who fear the end of the ''Berlin myth.'' Even conservative politicians have started to fight for it -- and of course have to face a quandary: you cannot institutionalize the anarchic freedom of the early years after the fall of the wall. In the end, this conundrum can be solved only by the protagonists of the subculture themselves. After 20 years of anarchy, of squatting and relying on a sympathetic City Hall to keep away the eviction notices, they must learn to professionalize, to find a long-term perspective for cultural visions and lifestyles.
Generation Tacheles, entrenched in a spirit of total opposition against capitalist structures, is in no position to achieve this. The generation that succeeds it just might be. The owners of Berghain, a world-famous dance club near the Spree, bought their site from its previous owner, a power company, and are now remodeling it, transforming the space into a multifaceted cultural site.
The original owners of Bar 25, another renowned night-life spot, have forged a broad alliance within the local economy and politics, aimed at installing an innovative artists' colony on their former site by the Spree, complete with galleries, clubs and theaters, but also with apartments, kindergartens and schools. With this project, the tail end of the anarchic phase in Berlin's creative scene could provide for a lasting permeation of art and life, long after Tacheles has fallen to the developers' shovel.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Bills Stores as Small-Business Solution

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
FEWER people are mailing their own packages these days, so shippers are looking for innovative ways to win new customers and persuade current clients to spend more. And what could be a more enticing image than homemade pie?
In its new campaign, United Parcel Service retail stores focus on how a small business like the ''pie lady'' can get help from her local store to specially package, promote and ship her bakery creations.
''I make the crust by hand. I make the filling by hand. But to build my business, I need a hand,'' said Sandy Poehnelt, who runs the Right Slice bakery in Kauai, Hawaii, in a print, television, radio and online campaign that started this week. 
Her local U.P.S. retail store designed a shipping box to ensure that her mango passion fruit, blueberry piña colada and dozens of other pie varieties arrive fresh and intact. That has enabled her to expand her business from Hawaii to other parts of the United States.
Officially known as the UPS Store, the retail locations are independently owned and operated by franchisees of Mail Boxes Etc., a subsidiary of U.P.S., and are being revamped to offer a broader range of business services. In addition to packing and shipping items, UPS Stores are also supplying printing services -- banners, brochures, menus and many other products -- as well as faxing, direct mailing and mailbox services.
Owners and employees of the stores have been retrained and have new uniforms. Stores have a bright aqua and teal color scheme, and some locations have new equipment. But U.P.S. is keeping its distinctive brown and gold corporate shield.
''Our research shows that the majority of small businesses feel they don't get support to cope with their challenges,'' said Michelle Van Slyke, vice president of marketing and small business solutions at the UPS Store headquarters in San Diego.
Using focus groups, surveys and techniques like journals kept by small-business owners, the company found last year that most small-business owners wanted to work with other local business people because they felt they could trust them more and because their economic health was linked, Ms. Van Slyke said.
But many did not know that their community UPS Store was a franchise operated by a local owner, she said. Nor did they always know the full range of services the store provided, she added.
Even so, she said, a third of the customers of the 4,300 UPS Stores are small businesses -- with 10 or fewer people or individuals -- that accounted for 75 percent of overall revenue.
To attract more small enterprises, the UPS Store's ''Small Business Solutions'' campaign emphasizes that its new services can be customized, like the specially designed pie box, to meet a specific business need. In a two-minute video, Ms. Poehnelt traces how she arrived from Wisconsin three years ago, then opened a pie shop to make use of her baking skills and, with the help of her local UPS Store, a mail-order business that ships pies around the United States.
The local UPS Store also does her printing, including business cards, menus and gift certificates, the video notes. The stores, which compete with FedEx Office, Office Depot and even the local post office, say their services can be bundled into accounts for monthly billing.
Doner, an advertising agency based in Detroit, designed the multifaceted campaign to underscore the message that the neighborhood UPS Store is the ''repository of solutions to help small businesses,'' said Clint White, the agency's brand leader for the stores.
Three television commercials, by Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, humorously highlight the UPS Store's connection to small and individual business owners. One, called ''Mailboxes,'' shows various box renters peering into ''their office'' and explaining why it is valuable to them. Another shows a building contractor, who relies on his UPS Store's services to meet demands from clients, including a woman who commissions a doghouse that is a replica of her elaborate house. The 30- and 60-second commercials will appear on prime-time shows like ''The X Factor,'' and on cable, late-night shows and N.F.L. games and ESPN Monday Night Football. The CBS anchor Charles Osgood will voice the campaign's ads on his radio broadcasts.
The campaign also will advertise on digital media, mobile video and video on YouTube, Hulu and other online sites. Customers will be able to submit their stories of how a UPS Store has helped their enterprise, and those stories could be featured in a future ad campaign.
The company spent $30 million on advertising in 2009. The UPS Store did not disclose what it would spend this year, but Ms. Van Slyke said it would be the company's largest annual outlay.
Last year, U.P.S. spent nearly $40.4 million to promote the stores, and almost $23.4 million in the first six months of 2012, according to figures from Kantar, the unit of WPP.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rate Rose in August to a 2-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales of existing homes rose in August to their highest rate in more than two years and new housing construction also climbed last month, providing signs that a budding housing market recovery is gaining traction.
The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that existing home sales increased 7.8 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.82 million units. That was well above economists' expectations and the fastest rate since May 2010 when activity was being supported by a homebuyer tax credit. 
The American economy has grown at a lackluster pace this year and has struggled to create jobs, but the housing sector is a relative bright spot for the first time since the 2007-9 recession. ''Housing is clearly in recovery mode,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
Prices for previously owned homes also rose when compared with a year earlier, a factor that could spur consumer spending by helping homeowners feel more confident about their finances. The median price nationwide for existing home resales rose 9.5 percent, to $187,400, the association said.
The Federal Reserve is trying to help housing build more momentum, and last week it started a program to buy tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities, a move that could push interest rates lower for both new and refinanced mortgages.
Many economists expect construction of new homes will contribute to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005, and a separate report from the Commerce Department buttressed that view. Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 750,000 units last month, an increase of 2.3 percent, the department said.
''Today's data are another indication of improvement in the U.S. housing market,'' said Andrew Grantham, an economist at CIBC World Markets.
Still, housing starts fell short of expectations as groundbreaking on multifamily home projects fell and July's pace was revised downward. At the same time, building permits slipped 1 percent.
Home sales have been creeping up and the steep decline in prices since 2006 appears to have bottomed. That has helped homebuilder sentiment, which this month touched a six-year high.
The National Association of Realtors said the share of so-called distressed sales -- which include foreclosures and sales in which the owner owes more on a home than it is worth -- fell last month, a factor that probably contributed to the rise in prices.
Distressed sales tend to go with a heavy discount, and the share of existing home resales in those conditions dropped to 22 percent last month, down from 24 percent in July. In August 2011 the distressed sales rate was 31 percent.
The nation's inventory of existing homes -- those for sale on the market -- rose 2.9 percent during the month to 2.47 million. But at August's sales pace, that would supply the market for only 6.1 months, down from 6.4 months in July.
Although the Federal Reserve is moving to keep mortgage rates low, it may have limited success in bolstering the housing market. Part of the reason is that lending standards for mortgages have tightened significantly since before the recession.
''While rates are at historical lows, borrowers still have a very difficult time accessing the mortgage markets,'' said John Tashjian, principal at Centurion Real Estate Partners.
Last week, the average interest rate for a fixed 30-year mortgage fell 3 basis points, or three-hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.72 percent, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.

HEADLINE: Endeavour's Last Journey, Through Contentious Space

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The space shuttle Endeavour traveled 122,883,151 miles during its 25 missions, bursting out of the atmosphere at more than 17,000 miles an hour. On the last flight of its 20-year career, a three-day victory lap across the country on the back of a transport aircraft, it will log a few thousand miles more before touching down for the final time on Friday at Los Angeles International Airport.
But the final segment of Endeavour's journey has proved perhaps the toughest yet: 12 miles through the dense urban landscape of Los Angeles, past streetlights and trees, to say nothing of city bureaucracy and politics, on its way to retirement at the California Science Center. 
A path was cleared just days before the shuttle's scheduled arrival, but not without controversy. A storm of criticism and threats of legal action arose in low-income neighborhoods in South Los Angeles over plans to remove hundreds of trees to make way for the bulky aircraft.
''We would all like the space shuttle in Los Angeles; it's a great asset,'' Carl Morgan, a longtime South Los Angeles resident and member of the local neighborhood council, said last week. ''But you don't have to destroy the community to get the thing there, this disenfranchised community of color, which is just repeatedly disrespected.''
This week, the science center agreed to donate more than $2 million to those communities.
For all the jacarandas that fill the city and the palms that line the streets, South Los Angeles is low on shade and green space, and residents of this overwhelmingly black and Latino community remember when South Los Angeles families were forced from their homes to make way for the freeways.
Convinced that their community had too often been shunted aside by city power brokers, some residents threatened to sue to prevent the tree removal, forcing the last-minute concessions.
The science center, which has had to cut down 400 trees to clear a path for the shuttle, said it would replace the trees in South Los Angeles at a rate of four for each one removed, twice the rate of replacement in the neighboring city of Inglewood. It will also pay to repair thousands of feet of sidewalks, trim existing trees, train and hire local youths, and fund scholarships for hundreds of neighborhood children to attend its summer camp.
All told, said Jeffrey Rudolph, president of the center, more than $2 million will be spent in South Los Angeles, where the science center is located.
Los Angeles issued permits on Monday to allow the science center to begin taking out the trees.
''We know that some residents continue to be concerned and unhappy with the loss of trees, but we are doing everything we can to minimize the impact,'' Mr. Rudolph said. ''We will also be adding to South L.A. one of the most incredible educational resources and economic development resources in the world.''
Three other retired shuttles have taken their places at other locations: Enterprise is at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York, Discovery is in the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Va., and Atlantis is at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla.
Planning for Endeavour's final trip, which will take place Oct. 12 and 13, was complicated from the start. ''We've had this challenge of the logistics since NASA awarded us the Endeavour,'' Mr. Rudolph said. ''They said, 'How are you going to get it from the airport to the science center?' ''
Transporting the shuttle on the freeways was quickly ruled out, because it was too large to fit through an underpass. An airlift was impossible because of the shuttle's weight: two helicopters could not lift it, and using more than two was considered too risky.
So planners turned to surface streets through Los Angeles and Inglewood.
The Endeavour is not the first famous oversize object to make its way through the streets here. Earlier this year, a 340-ton piece of rock art was hauled along public streets from a quarry in Riverside County to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a trip that took 11 nights, with travel only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Endeavour, though not nearly as heavy, is far larger -- 122 feet long, with a wingspan of 78 feet and a tail that is 57 feet tall.
The aircraft will be carried aboard a 160-wheel carrier, designed to move bridges and ships, that can rotate 360 degrees in its own footprint. Trees will be felled, streetlights will be moved, telephone lines lifted.
And if all goes well, Endeavour will be open to the public, free of charge, by the end of October, housed in a temporary exhibition at the science center until a permanent display space is built.
Edward Conley, who lives nearby, said he planned to take his 8-year-old son, Jack, to see the shuttle as it makes its way through South Los Angeles.
''It's historic,'' Mr. Conley. ''We didn't get to see any of the takeoffs, and we'll be able to see the space shuttle up close when it comes through the neighborhood.''
At least Endeavour will not have to fight the notorious Los Angeles rush-hour freeway traffic. But as it travels at just 2 miles per hour, it will be moving at about the same pace.

HEADLINE: Talk to Iran's Leaders, but Look Beyond Them

BYLINE: By RAY TAKEYH

 BODY:
The latest tussle over red lines and deadlines on Iran's nuclear program obscures some of the genuine dilemmas now confronting the international community.
For a long time, the major powers had hoped that imposing strenuous sanctions on Iran could produce an interlocutor willing to negotiate honestly and to adhere to an exacting arms control agreement. But time may no longer permit the patient exercise of coercive diplomacy.
To temper Iran's nuclear ambitions we may need not one strategy but two. The immediate challenge is to obtain an agreement that imposes some limits on Iran's more disturbing proliferation activities. However, this cannot be the end of the story, but an interim step to provide time for a strategy that broadens Tehran's ruling coalition and injects some moderate voices into its deliberations. 
It is important to note that the Islamic Republic has persistently violated all aspects of its nonproliferation commitments. Both of Iran's known enrichment installations began as surreptitious plants that were later discovered by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Iranian regime continues to operate and expand these facilities in violation of six United Nations Security Council resolutions that call for their suspension. Tehran has refused the I.A.E.A.'s requests for information on previous weaponization activities or to grant access to its scientists and many of its facilities. Given this history, one can count on Tehran to similarly violate any agreement that it may be compelled to sign. For the Islamic Republic, as currently constituted, treaties are but diversions on its way to greater nuclear empowerment.
The international community should adopt a similar outlook in negotiating with Iran. As a first step, the focus of the major powers should be an agreement that may not necessarily address all of their concerns but puts some restrains on Iran's nuclear surge. An attempt to curtail Iran's higher grade enrichment activities, ship out some of its stockpile and close the Fordow facility would not end Iran's nuclear conundrum, but it would at least hamper its goal of getting the bomb.
Given Iran's nuclear progress, sabotage and sanctions may no longer be enough to slow the program; an agreement, however deficient, may be the only way to achieve this goal. The challenge would be to relinquish as little as possible of the sanctions regime to obtain such an accord.
Once an interim deal is in place, the United States must take the lead in devising a coercive strategy to change the parameters of Iran's domestic politics. A strategy of concerted pressure would seek to exploit all of Iran's liabilities. The existing efforts to stress Iran's economy would be complemented by an attempt to make common cause with the struggling opposition.
The purpose of this policy would be to so weaken the Islamist regime that it would be forced to abandon its objectionable policies abroad and negotiate a new national compact with the opposition at home. In essence, this policy would compel the Islamic Republic to make painful concessions in order to preserve its power. The international community would not be creating new realities, but exploiting and accelerating existing trends.
Under such intensified pressures, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, could acquiesce and negotiate with the opposition. There are members of the Iranian elite who appreciate the devastating cost of Iran's intransigence and want a different approach to the international community. The problem is that these people have been pushed to the margins. If Khamenei senses that his grip on power is slipping, he might broaden his government to include opposition figures who would inject a measure of pragmatism and moderation into the system.
The history of proliferation suggests that regimes under stress do negotiate arms control treaties: Both the Soviet Union and North Korea signed many such agreements. But history also suggests that without a change of attitude, these compacts promised much but delivered little. Once there is a new outlook -- as there was in the Soviet Union when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power -- then it is possible to craft durable arms limitation agreements.
As with the Soviet Union, the United States will make genuine progress with Iran only when moderate leaders assume greater control of the state. An interim accord may provide time, but that time must be used to broaden the contours of Iran's political system.

HEADLINE: Japan Central Bank Acts To Aid Fragile Recovery

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Japanese central bank moved to ease monetary policy Wednesday, saying it would buy more government bonds and other assets, following the United States Federal Reserve in a show of resolve to shore up a shaky economic recovery.
The central bank, the Bank of Japan, will expand its asset purchase and loan program by 10 trillion yen, or $126 billion, to 80 trillion yen, the bank announced after a two-day board meeting that ended Wednesday. The purchase program was also extended six months, to the end of 2013. 
The program aims to stimulate economic growth by adding to bank reserves and driving down the cost of lending, prompting more money to flow through the economy.
The Bank of Japan downgraded its assessment of the country's export-driven economy, citing slower global demand and fresh uncertainties caused by anti-Japan protests this week in China, a big trading partner.
As expected, the bank kept its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.
Markets climbed after the bank's announcement, with the Nikkei 225-share index rising 1.19 percent. The yen slipped to a one-month low of 79.20 to the dollar, offering relief to Japanese exporters, who benefit from a weaker home currency.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi praised the central bank's move. ''The measures taken were bolder than I had expected,'' he said. ''The government welcomes this decision to more drastically ease monetary policy.''
But some analysts said the move fell short of what was needed to head off a slowdown in the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China. ''The basic point remains with this easing as we have seen before -- too little, too late,'' ING analysts said in a note to clients. They still detected ''a lack of conviction'' at the bank that its monetary tools would work, which they said would reduce the effect of the bank's action.
The Bank of Japan has come under intense pressure from government officials to maintain its support of the fragile Japanese economy. The bank set an inflation target of 1 percent in February and increased asset purchases in April. Masaaki Shirakawa, the central bank governor, has refrained from further easing since then as economic growth has appeared to gain momentum, buoyed by reconstruction demand since the tsunami disasters last year.
But the outlook has worsened in recent weeks, with sluggish exports causing an unexpected dip in industrial production. Gross domestic product for the April-through-June quarter grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, according to government data released this month, far slower than initially estimated.
And Japan continues to be mired in deflation, with its core price index having fallen 0.3 percent in July from a year earlier. Government figures released Wednesday showed that commercial and residential land prices in Japan dropped in the 12 months that ended July 1, the 21st consecutive year in which they fell, though at a slower pace.
''The pickup in economic activity has come to a pause,'' the Bank of Japan said in a statement. ''There remains a high degree of uncertainty about the global economy,'' including continued debt problems in Europe and lackluster growth in the United States, it said.
At a news conference, Mr. Shirakawa said that he expected softening exports to delay the Japanese economic recovery by about six months and that the new round of monetary easing was aimed at keeping Japan on the path to sustainable growth and price stability. ''Japan achieved high growth in the first half of this year, but we have to be cautious about whether this growth will continue,'' he said.
The impact of the protests in China on the Japanese economy was uncertain, he added. Set off by competing claims to a group of islands in the East China Sea, angry mobs vandalized Japanese businesses and forced some Japanese manufacturers to close their factories to protect their workers.
The central bank governor's concerns echoed those expressed by economists in recent weeks.
''Incoming data suggest that the Japanese economy is now losing steam much more rapidly and sharply than we expected,'' Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo, said in a note to clients before the bank announced its move. ''The possibility of recession cannot be ruled out, especially if recovery of global demand in the coming quarters fails to materialize.''
Fears of an economic slowdown appear to have overridden worries at the central bank that too loose a monetary policy would lead to runaway inflation. Takuji Aida, an economist for UBS in Japan, said it would probably be ''a few years'' before the bank's 1 percent goal could be reached. He said that any recovery in overseas demand would depend on the United States economy.
Japan also faces political uncertainty. The governing Democratic Party, which has had defections amid plunging ratings, is under pressure from the main opposition party to call nationwide elections. A standoff in Parliament has blocked the government from issuing deficit-financing bonds, forcing the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to postpone scheduled public spending -- the first time in decades a prime minister has done so.

HEADLINE: An Earthy Take on a Heavenly Book

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
God moves in unmysterious ways at the Flea Theater these days. There he was, manning (if that verb may be so applied) the box office on the night I arrived to see Thomas Bradshaw's ''Job,'' in which he plays an important supporting role to the notoriously afflicted title character. And there was God's son, Jesus, serving as an usher downstairs.
Of course I didn't realize then that was who they were. Their identities were made known later, when this ultimate father-and-son team (as embodied by the actors Ugo Chukwu and Grant Harrison) showed up in the place you expect them to be, heaven. That's heaven as imagined in Mr. Bradshaw's short, sharp and vigorously comic tragedy, which opened on Wednesday night. But even then there was no avoiding the feeling that these guys are just like us -- only more so. Which in Mr. Bradshaw's universe isn't necessarily a good thing.
Or a bad thing. The 32-year-old Mr. Bradshaw -- one of the most deliberately and effectively confrontational American playwrights of his generation -- specializes in portraits of an id-driven world in which crimes against nature are more or less natural and presented without obvious moralizing or head shaking. 
Incest, pedophilia and racially motivated murder all figured matter-of-factly in his ''Burning,'' staged in Manhattan last year, as they had in previous plays like ''Southern Promises'' and ''Purity.'' Mr. Bradshaw has described his deadpan sensational style as ''hyperrealism,'' or ''reality without the boring parts.'' In his universe, human behavior is unedited, uncensored, often uncivilized and largely unexplained.
So it seems fitting that when Mr. Bradshaw looks for the divinity that governs this old vale of tears, he should simply find more of the same. The Book of Job, which asks the eternally troubling question of why good people must suffer, may have inspired more elaborate theological and philosophical debate than any other part of the Old Testament. But in Mr. Bradshaw's ''Job'' God's motives are as simple, blunt and opaque as those of the mortals he created in his image. On earth as it is in heaven, indeed.
The plot of ''Job'' hews closer to the Bible than you might expect. As in the original version God decides to test the faith and constancy of his most loyal servant, the righteous Job, by stripping him of his wealth, his family and his health. And as in the original version it is Satan who urges God to do so. Mr. Bradshaw's script also uses passages of human lamentation and divine utterance taken more or less directly from the Old Testament, some of the most beautiful poetry ever written.
Much of the rest of the play, which runs roughly an hour and is directed by Benjamin H. Kamine, suggests a riff that the Book of Job might inspire in an imaginative, latter-day adolescent who reads it for the first time. And it's this sense of seeing something familiar and epochal with wise-virgin eyes that makes ''Job'' a jolting treat. Mr. Bradshaw tears away centuries' worth of interpretations and debate to tell the story of Job (a magisterially stern Sean McIntyre) as a bloody, Quentin Tarantino-esque tale, laced with graphic violence and fillips of frat-house humor.
Yes, ''Job'' occasionally seems like a goofy, impious blackout sketch by a 21st-century undergraduate. (Aaron Green's set and Ashley Farra's costumes archly bring to mind a religious pageant in a high-end boarding school.) But the script also evokes a more distant time, when deities were mortals magnified. And it shrewdly elicits the similarities between ancient Greek mythology and Old Testament theology. In this version God (Mr. Chukwu) is a jovial, Jovean figure, hanging out in eternity with his sons Jesus (Mr. Harrison) and Dionysus (Eric Folks), whom their father plans to send to earth some day, though at different times and to different places.
Satan (a perfectly smug and resentful Stephen Stout), God's brother, drops in to visit, and this heavenly household is filled with laughter and bickering, sibling rivalry and fraternal bear hugs. If these beings are more capricious and less careful than the people on earth, with whose destinies they play as if they were video games, that's because they need never fear painful consequences. (You may infer parallels with today's economic 1 percent, if you choose, but Mr. Bradshaw isn't asking you to.)
Job, in contrast, registers as almost forbiddingly responsible. We first encounter him meting out justice with a severity tempered by kindness to a world that is just this side of bestial. Jeremy Bloom's sound design is filled with the bleats and moos of livestock, some of which, we are always aware, are fated to be holy sacrifices. And the supplicants who come to him are dirty, sometimes bloodied and, you suspect, filled with the potential for violence.
When God unleashes Satan on the tenuous order of Job's world, things fall apart fast, in the lurid style that Mr. Bradshaw favors. (This is not, repeat not, a play for children.) The calamities that befall Job are no poetic abstractions but graphically rendered atrocities that include the murder and posthumous rape of his daughter by his son and Job's castration and blinding by mutinous former subjects.
These horrors, punctuated by lively ritualistic dances on both heaven and earth (choreographed by Joya Powell), are given unflinching and unwinking life by the Bats, the Flea's company of young resident actors. As overseen with a smart, unswervingly straight-ahead style by Mr. Kamine, their performances are unusually free of psychological flourish, as they deliver dialogue that, even in moments of great crisis, is often as banal and everyday as a grocery list.
The critic Margo Jefferson has astutely observed that Mr. Bradshaw operates on the principle that ''our psyches speak in what our egos and rational selves call clichés.'' Our depth, it would seem, is only on the surface; we're all one in our most basic desires.
Mr. Bradshaw has often said that he writes dialogue that has no subtext. In his plays people are as they are, hungry creatures who act on appetites and itches and urges. In ''Job'' he logically extends that description to embrace their maker as well.
By the way, Job does learn from his sufferings in this version. The man we see restored to power and glory at the end is more Godlike than ever. That in itself is a cause for Job-like lamentation.

HEADLINE: Housing Market Reports Give Lift to Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Wednesday, lifted by two positive reports on the housing markets.
Housing stocks were among the day's leaders after the reports, one on stronger-than-expected home sales and an increase in prices, and the other on an increase in housing starts.
The PHLX housing sector index rose 2.2 percent, led by a 4.3 percent advance in the PulteGroup, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, to $16.43. 
Home resales rose 7.8 percent in August, the biggest increase in more than two years, and the median price nationwide for existing home resales rose 9.5 percent from a year earlier, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.
Housing starts also climbed. The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 750,000 units last month, an increase of 2.3 percent from a month earlier.
The reports came as investors looked for improving economic data to help a rally of 5.9 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since August began.
''The recent pullback in prices was all about healthy profit-taking after the big rally we had last week,'' said Neil Massa, senior United States trader at MFC Global Investment Management. ''Now people are buying.''
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,577.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.73 points, or 0.12 percent, to finish at 1,461.05. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.82 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 3,182.62.
Last week, the S.& P. 500 reached its highest closing level since December 2007 after the Federal Reserve announced its intention to provide a new round of economic stimulus.
On Wednesday, 3M was the latest major company after FedEx to sound caution about the economy. 3M said the ''economic environment has changed'' since it set its long-term revenue growth target of 7 to 8 percent, and it now viewed that range as a ''stretch target.'' Shares of 3M edged up 0.2 percent to $93.63.
Both 3M and FedEx are viewed as economic bellwethers because they operate in so many parts of the economy. Their warnings come as S.& P. 500 companies' earnings are expected to fall 2 percent in the third quarter.
As of Friday, 88 major companies had cut their profit expectations and 21 had raised theirs, the weakest ratio since the third quarter of 2001, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Oil-related stocks fell as crude oil in the United States slid for the third consecutive day after Saudi Arabia said it would act to keep prices in check.
General Mills reported higher earnings on Wednesday and stood by its full-year outlook. The shares rose 1.8 percent to $40.02.
Questcor Pharmaceuticals fell 47.8 percent to $26.35 after Aetna dropped coverage for the company's only product, Acthar Gel, for all but one condition.
Interest rates were lower for a third consecutive session. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 11/32, to 98 21/32, and the yield fell to 1.77 percent from 1.81 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Judge Details a Rule Requiring Pro Bono Work by Aspiring Lawyers

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

 BODY:
The state's chief judge on Wednesday announced the details of a new rule -- the first of its kind in the nation -- requiring law students to perform 50 hours of unpaid work as a condition of practicing in New York. 
The rule requires law students to do pro bono work for the poor, nonprofit or civil rights groups or any of the three branches of government, between the first year of law school and the time they apply for a license. The work can be performed anywhere in the world but students must be under the supervision of a practicing lawyer, a judge or a member of a law school faculty. The law goes into effect for new students in law schools on Jan. 1.
When the judge, Jonathan Lippman, proposed the rule in May, some in the legal community said it might be burdensome for new lawyers in a tough economy. Others voiced concerns about using those new to the profession to fill what Judge Lippman calls the justice gap: the growing number of people who cannot afford legal services.
But an advisory committee that formulated the final version of the rule answered some of those criticisms: students have a full three years to complete the work and they must be under the counsel of more experienced lawyers.
''I see absolutely no reason why aspiring lawyers can't do this without greatly burdening themselves,'' Judge Lippman said in an interview. He added, ''This idea that you have to be a lawyer with 25 years experience to provide a service doesn't make any sense to me.''
The financial crisis and a slow economy have increased the demand for civil legal services. A task force convened by the judge in 2010 to evaluate the need in the state found that only 20 percent of the legal needs of New York residents were being met. Among those who rarely have the help of a lawyer are people involved in eviction, child support and consumer credit cases.
The Legal Aid Society, the largest provider of those services in the state, turns away eight of every nine people seeking help, said Steven Banks, the chief lawyer of the organization. Mr. Banks said the pro bono requirement would give his lawyers some much needed assistance.
''This is literally a shot in the arm to help address a very serious gap in access to justice,'' Mr. Banks said.
The chief judge also obtained $40 million in this year's state budget to help finance civil legal services. With the rule change, the judge said, the state will set a new standard for the provision of civil legal services.
''We're going to write the script nationally,'' Judge Lippman said. ''I think what we're doing will be replicated around the country.''

HEADLINE: From Surviving Katrina To Spreading the Word About Entrepreneurship

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
Hurricane Katrina wiped out Kevin Langley's New Orleans construction business. As both the city and the business struggled to recover, Mr. Langley came to believe that entrepreneurship was the solution to many of New Orleans's -- and the world's -- ills.
A member of the New Orleans chapter of the Entrepreneurs' Organization, Mr. Langley poured his energy into developing the organization's Accelerator program. A few years later, he was elected E.O.'s global chairman and embarked on a Forrest Gump-like entrepreneurship tour, popping up in places from Egypt to Pakistan where history was happening.
Is entrepreneurship really the answer to the world's problems? The following conversation with Mr. Langley, 47, has been condensed and edited.
Q. In 2004, a company you helped found, Ellis Construction, was ranked one of the fastest-growing inner city companies in America, with $13.7 million in annual revenue and four-year growth of 261 percent. How did you do that? 
A. Hard work. Recognizing the need. Hiring very good people. And partnering with our clients to build the best projects we could.
Q. Then Hurricane Katrina struck.
A. We had five feet of water in our business. It took four months before we had power turned back on in the office and nine months before we actually had phone lines.
Q. What happened to your business?
A. Overnight our revenues went down more than 50 percent. We did what we had to do to survive. We gutted a lot of buildings and fixed a lot of roofs. You have to take the jobs that are out there.
Q. You've said that Katrina was a huge turning point in more ways than your business. How so?
A. For me, Hurricane Katrina was basically a very dramatic backdrop to what was happening in the rest of the world. Katrina didn't cause the problems; it revealed the problems in my personal life, my family life, my community, my state, my nation and the world. And I made a commitment that as I rebuilt my life I was going to help other people rebuild theirs.
Q. Can you connect the dots for us between the problems you saw in your personal life and in the world?
A. I spent more time educating my kids and making sure they heard the right stories of inspiration and overcoming adversity and not becoming a victim. I had 3-year-old triplets at the time. When we evacuated, we went to eat at a restaurant in Baton Rouge. My son was crying and tired and said he wanted to go home to his bed. We explained to him that home was where we are and that he had a new bed. We lost our house but home is where the family is.
Q. How did that lead you to think about entrepreneurship?
A. Some of the first people back in New Orleans after the life safety issues were taken care of were the small-business owners and entrepreneurs, to restart their businesses and the supply chains to provide quality of life. Seeing the important role entrepreneurs played in the community in the city I love, that was it.
Q. Of course, your city has never needed construction services more than it did right after Katrina. Wasn't it tempting to focus on rebuilding your business and your city?
A. It was tempting, but what I do is more of a life mission than a job. I did stay and rebuild the business, but I did it in parallel with this other stuff.
Q. Is your co-founder, Bret Ellis, still involved in the business? What are your revenues?
A. Yes, he's actively managing it. Our gross revenues are over $20 million annually.
Q. At the time of Katrina, you were one of the early members of the New Orleans chapter of E.O. How did you get to be global chairman?
A. It was a huge jump. The Accelerator program I worked on as curriculum chair has expanded to 26 cities and four countries. The board said, ''We love what you're doing and the vision -- take this thing global.'' For the last three years I've traveled to 25 countries and engaged with entrepreneurs.
Q. Who are these entrepreneurs?
A. I traveled to Egypt after the revolution to help some young technology entrepreneurs. I spent three or four days mentoring them and then they took me to Tahrir Square. And this young female entrepreneur walked us right into the middle of Tahrir Square. She told me that her brother had been killed there during the revolution.
This Egyptian woman wants to develop an app, a 911 service for traveling in third world countries. You can use the app to identify and find medical help close to you and it will alert social networks that you have been injured. That one female entrepreneur could create opportunities for hundreds of people in Egypt, which is why the revolution happened.
Q. How so?
A. The Arab Spring was started by a young entrepreneur. The guy who set himself on fire in Tunisia, Mohamed Bouazizi, was a young street vendor who had a vision of having multiple fruit carts and had a goal of buying a Toyota pickup truck to haul his fruit carts around. What was lost was his hope.
Q. Wasn't the Arab Spring also about people in the Middle East being tired of not choosing their own leaders?
A. The point I'm making is that no one talks about the fact that he was someone who aspired to create his own economic opportunity, and because that was limited, he lost all hope.
Q. You've also served as chairman of E.O.'s Global Student Entrepreneur Awards.
A. We're identifying some of the best student entrepreneurs, engaging them in regional competitions, networking them with successful entrepreneurs and giving them feedback. We're in 358 universities in 42 countries. The last winner was Ludwick Marishane from South Africa, who invented waterless and soapless body wash because of some of the hygiene problems in Africa.
Q. What do the students get out of these award competitions?
A. They go from thinking parochially to thinking globally, and realize that they can build businesses that have these dramatic impacts. Ludwick Marishane now is thinking global distribution and that his body wash could be used on airlines or in natural disasters, not just in Africa. Now his product could have a global impact.
Q. You also took part in the Group of 20 summit meeting in Mexico.
A. We went to Mexico City and hand-delivered a communiqué to President Calderón. It was a huge milestone that the voice of entrepreneurs was heard at the G-20 summit.
Q. The communiqué talks about lower taxes and regulatory barriers, better funding, more promotion of youth entrepreneurship. How much can a boilerplate document like that really do?
A. At the G-20, Mexico made a commitment to generate more access to funds for small and medium businesses. Now they're talking about launching a capital fund for entrepreneurs.
Q. What else have you accomplished?
A. At the E.O., we're the largest we've ever been. We have 8,700 members, 1,700 more than the previous year, and our members collectively employ more than two million people. We're also expanding into areas of the world that desperately need entrepreneurs -- Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Latin America.
Q. You recently finished your chairmanship at E.O. What's next?
A. Less than 1 percent of U.S. businesses are engaged in any type of import or export. That's a startling number.
Q. What can you do about it?
A. I'll be volunteering with the U.S. State Department as an entrepreneurial envoy.

HEADLINE: China's Economic Lesson

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With luck, those who tout infrastructure construction as the surefire path to economic recovery in the United States will find the emerging situation in China sobering (''Construction and Real Estate Hinder China's Growth,'' Business Day, Sept. 10). 
What China is now discovering is what many have known for a long time: we build infrastructure to provide services that foster things like economic growth, public health or environmental enhancement, not solely to keep people busy.
Although construction of needed infrastructure will certainly reduce unemployment in a hard-hit sector of the economy, ultimately ports must move freight, high-speed trains must carry passengers, and office buildings must have tenants.
Given that many projects have been financed by sales of government-owned land and with loans from government-controlled banks that are routinely rolled over rather than repaid, China's infrastructure sits on a rather shaky economic foundation.
If building new infrastructure does not provide a real economic or social return, that capital would be better deployed elsewhere.

HEADLINE: On Planet Pro enza

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA JACOBS

 BODY:
IN a world of fashion design densely populat ed by difficult, messy individuals, one can well understand the temptation to te am up and clean up, à la Dolce & Gabbana or Viktor & Rolf. You and your partner may not agree on every inch of rickrack, but he'll probably stop you from alcoho l-fueled anti-Semitic rants and affairs with a tanned pornographic-film star hal f your age.
Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the perpetually schoolboyis h duo behind Proenza Schouler, may not have an ampersand or the blockbuster bank -swelling perfumes of their predecessors, but they have accomplished a moderate hit: the PS1 messenger bag, many iterations of which appear on the first floor o f their new store on Madison Avenue. 
Personally, I think the thi ng looks like something a midlevel male account manager might use to lug his Del l laptop on a commuter flight to Buffalo, and I was glad to see many more-femini ne, beautiful purses on offer, like the Toshi, a variation on the bowling bag, w ith a lock (woven leather and nylon, $2,375; woven leather, $2,925); and a whole menagerie of what I like to call Tribble bags, after the furry creatures on ''S tar Trek.''
Actually the whole place, tucked into a frilly brownstone but w ith interiors designed by the architect David Adjaye, is kind of ''Star Trek.'' Glass doors at the entrance slide open automatically. Cactuses rear up, an alien life form in humid New York. Reached by a flight of stairs behind a triangle-pa tterned screen, the second floor has a pockmarked look, as if brutalized by a re cent meteor shower.
And many of the current clothes, like the jagged minisk irts in techno fabrics, suggest something Lieutenant Uhura might don to seduce o r confuse Captain Kirk into another clinch. A white sweater with black sleeves a nd gold zippers at the shoulders was a basic but brilliant feat of optical illus ion ($700) that would go nicely with basic black skinny jeans ($255). One Tribbl e, a gray alpaca clutch, folded out cleverly at angles, like a piece of origami ($1,500).
To their eternal credit, these items didn't conjure any particula r time or place but Planet Proenza, which means a woman of any age can wear them without dating herself.
NOT that I observed so many customers making the l eap.
''The colors are my colors, but I fear the print wears me,'' said one short-haired matron fretfully, popping out of an upstairs dressing room in a sle eveless chinoiserie ensemble one recent fetid Friday. In the shop window, a shin y PS1 showpiece was suspended in a ''block of ice'' under a whirring fan; around the corner, as a sweating model sipped iced coffee through a straw, stylists on a photo shoot were sadly arranging puffs of cotton in a hedge to simulate snow.
The concept of assembling a wardrobe for fall, let alone winter, in such c onditions seemed light-years away, and yet still I was inexorably drawn to a neo prene-coated black jacket with another gold zipper, this one off-center, and an enormous, enveloping shearling collar. It was $3,850, but I figured if I wore it until Stardate 2233.04, that would amortize down to practically nothing.
' 'It's almost frightening how great it is,'' said my sales-bot, Emerald Whipple, whose resemblance to a young Zooey Deschanel (saucerlike blue eyes, brown bangs and winsome equanimity) was also almost frightening.
With the Instagram non chalance of her generation, the talented Ms. Whipple kindly snapped an iPhone pi cture of me in the jacket for later contemplation. Upon hearing that I had had o nly four hours of sleep the previous night, she offered to make me an espresso o n the spot. And she called the next day to see if I was interested in returning ''even though it's a bit dreary outside.'' I wouldn't have been surprised if she had offered a kitten as a gift with purchase.
Recruited, she said, from th e SoHo boutique If, Ms. Whipple was part of a cadre of staff that seemed special ly chosen for their emo, chic-librarian mood. Though the stock they're pushing c an be afforded only by the very rich, the message conveyed (as with Marc Jacobs) is not one of snobbery, exclusivity or status anxiety but accessibility, sympat hy -- even a little goofiness.
On a half-dozen asymmetrically stacked telev ision monitors downstairs, cartoon brunettes in ankle boots were performing what looked like tai chi in front of a waterfall, dolphins plunging around them.
Back outside, a tinseled parade float marked ''Health Care Workers for Obama'' idling just steps from the store was a reminder that selling four-figure clothi ng in this economy, even if the clothing resembles an art piece, remains an iffy proposition.
''Would you like to buy me a pheasant-embroidered sweatshirt? '' said one Proenza shopper to her companion as they exited empty-handed.
' 'Not today,'' came the reply.
Proenza Schouler
822 Madison Avenue, (21 2) 585-3200;
proenzashoulder.com.
COOLER This attractive designing duo is a refreshing infusion of ''downtown'' talent to the moneyed Upper East Side. The staff is helpful and enthusiastic but not pushy, offering refreshments and messenger service.
CRUELER But who exactly can afford, or wants, messenger service of $2,000-plus handbags now? Especially when they telegraph luxury to su ch a small circle. If you're asking, there is nothing for you here.
BACK TO SCHOOL-ER Luscious sweaters, striking jackets and rock-star ankle boots, plus t he popular PS1 messenger bag, promise a look of Botoxless youth and vigor for th e woman who can afford them.

HEADLINE: Inspectors Certified Pakistani Factory as Sa fe Before Disaster

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Declan Walsh rep orted from Islamabad, and Steven Greenhouse from New York.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakis tan -- A prominent factory monitoring group heavily financed by industry gave a clean bill of health to a Pakistani apparel plant last month, just weeks before a fire engulfed the premises and killed nearly 300 workers, many of them trapped behind locked exit doors.
In August, two inspectors who visited the factory, Ali Enterprises in Karachi, to examine working conditions gave it a prestigious SA8000 certification, meaning it had met international standards in nine areas, including health and safety, child labor and minimum wages. The two inspectors were working on behalf of Social Accountability International, a nonprofit monit oring group based in New York that obtains much of its financing from corporatio ns and relies on 21 affiliates around the world to do most of its inspections.
Weeks later, a fire swept the plant on Sept. 12, trapping hundred s of workers in a building with barred windows and just one open exit, resulting in one of the worst industrial disasters in history -- one that killed nearly t wice as many workers as the landmark Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 in New York.
The Karachi tragedy is a huge embarrassment to the factory moni toring system, in which many Western garment and electronics companies rely on a uditing groups to provide a coveted seal of approval to their low-cost suppliers in the developing world. 
As the blaze spread -- much as the Triangle fire did a century earlier -- some workers were forced to leap from upper-floor wind ows, suffering serious injuries; many more died of smoke inhalation and from sea ring temperatures inside the building. A German discount textile chain has said its jeans were being manufactured in the plant at the time.
The calamity h as led to bitter recriminations in Pakistan, where textile exports play a vital role in a faltering economy. For international rights campaigners, the fact that the factory had been certified by a respected Western organization made clear t he failings of a controversial 15-year-old industry initiative.
''The whol e system is flawed,'' said Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights C onsortium, a monitoring group based in Washington that is financed by American u niversities. ''This demonstrates, more clearly than ever, that corporate-funded monitoring systems like S.A.I. cannot and will not protect workers.''
Socia l Accountability International said it had suspended work in Pakistan with the R INA Group, an Italian company that carried out the Ali Enterprises audit on its behalf. It added that it was engaged in a broad review of its entire certificati on process.
''We're trying to find out what went wrong,'' Eileen Kohl Kaufm an, executive director of Social Accountability International, said in an interv iew. ''It's unimaginably horrible. The only thing we can hope for is clear answe rs so as to show how to take preventive action.''
The three owners of the A li Enterprises factory, who fled Karachi in the hours after the fire broke out, appeared this week at a courthouse in Larkana, 200 miles to the northeast. The S tate Bank of Pakistan has frozen the owners' bank accounts, which hold more than $5 million, according to news media reports. Their passports have been confisca ted, and they may face criminal charges.
On Monday, a two-person governmen t commission of inquiry started investigating the circumstances around the fire. It has already uncovered evidence of gross failings in Pakistan's regulatory sy stem, which is riddled with corruption, political interference and poor manageme nt.
During a hearing on Tuesday, electrical safety inspectors struggled to define the rules and regulations of their own department. One said they had for mally stopped doing factory inspections in 2003.
Records showed that the A li Enterprises factory had officially registered just 250 workers even though in reality as many as 1,000 people worked there, said Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, senior a dviser on textiles to the prime minister. ''There is an urgent need to review ou r safety features,'' he said.
But the disaster has also revived scrutiny o f the procurement policies of the Western companies that have their clothes made in factories like Ali Enterprises.
In a statement about the fire, Social Accountability International said, ''The enormity of this tragedy points to ende mic issues in the apparel industry for decent working conditions.''
The SA8 000 certification, which was begun in 1997, is central to the work of Social Acc ountability International, whose stated mission is ''to advance the human rights of workers around the world,'' and which is supported by companies like Gap; Gu cci, in Italy; and Groupe Carrefour, in France, as well as representatives of so me labor rights groups.
Based on International Labor Organization and Unit ed Nations standards, the group says on its Web site that the certification has ''improved the lives of over 1.8 million workers in over 3,000 factories, across 65 countries and 66 industrial sectors.''
But Richard M. Locke, a professo r of political science at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who has written extensively about monitoring, said the Ali Enterprises fire suggested that such claims were exaggerated.
''Even after a decade or more of such private mon itoring efforts, these programs -- no matter how well funded or designed or how well trained their auditors are -- simply do not in and of themselves produce su stained and significant improvements in labor standards in most supply chain fac tories,'' Professor Locke said.
The RINA Group, which carried out the Ali Enterprises audit, has performed 540 factory certifications for Social Accountab ility International, according to the the international organization's Web site, including nearly 100 in Pakistan.
Although Ali Enterprises was a well-est ablished textiles plant, largely in the supply of denim products, so far just on e of its Western customers has come forward publicly: the German textile discoun t chain KiK, which operates 3,200 stores in Germany, Austria and six Eastern Eur opean countries.
KiK -- an acronym for Kunde ist König, which means the cu stomer is king -- has previously faced criticism for its supply-chain practices in Bangladesh.
In an e-mail, a company spokeswoman told European labor rig hts activists that it had obtained three independent audits of Ali Enterprises. The factory failed to meet fire safety standards during a 2007 check, but those problems were remedied by the time of a subsequent check in December 2011, she s aid.
KiK said it had started a relief fund for the families of the dead an d injured workers in conjunction with other Western producers that use the plant . But the identities of those producers remain a mystery.
One reporter fou nd a pair of jeans bearing the Diesel brand on the factory's premises after the fire, but Diesel has denied any links to the plant.
In recent years, many factory monitors have come under criticism. For instance, various audits of Foxc onn, which assembles iPhones and iPads for Apple in China, have been heavily cri ticized for failing to stop child labor, illegal amounts of overtime and dangero us conditions.
Ms. Kaufman of Social Accountability International said the two inspectors spent four days at the Karachi plant. She noted that because this was an initial audit for certification, the plant's managers had been warned of the visit. She said future inspections would have been without advance notice.< PA> Tessel Pauli, coordinator for the Clean Clothes Campaign, a European antisw eatshop group, criticized the audit process.
''Workers are often told what to tell the auditor,'' she said. ''The inspections are announced, and there is time to do things like open exit doors that other times are locked.''
After the Ali Enterprises fire, some surviving workers said they had been warned of a visit by inspectors and coached to lie about their working conditions, under th reat of dismissal.

1912 Presidential Fight Begins in Earnest
NEW YORK -- With the appearance at St. Paul of Dr. Woo drow Wilson, the Democratic candidate, who is making a ''whirlwind tour'' in the wake of Mr. Roosevelt, the Presidential campaign of 1912 has begun in earnest. Dr. Wilson's first move was significant. He eulogized Mr. Taft as a high-minded and patriotic President who, through no fault of his own, got into the bad compa ny of the Republican ''bosses.'' Then he turned his guns against Mr. Roosevelt, whose skin, Mr. Taft has just promised the American people, shall be ''nailed to the barn door.'' 
1937 Economic Cooperation for Peace
NEW YOR K -- Secretary of State Cordell Hull, delivering an important address on world p eace and economic cooperation this afternoon [Sept. 19], took up the theme of Pr esident Roosevelt's Constitution Day speech that the present-day world is too sm all for any nation to remain in complete isolation. The Secretary of State used the occasion to reiterate his belief that enlarged world trade was a far greater guaranty of peace than cannon and airplanes. Economic betterment, he said, fost ers the wish for peace, whereas want and misery end in making people hold life c heaply.
1962 U.K. Urges World Payments Plan
WASHINGTON -- Bri tain today [Sept. 19] urged adoption of a new world payments plan. Britain's Cha ncellor of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling presented the plan to the Internation al Monetary Fund. Instead of demanding gold from the United States, a creditor c ountry such as France would deposit its surplus dollars in the IMF. The United S tates would thus not have to dip into its gold reserve, but it would have to giv e France and the IMF a gold guarantee -- that the value of the deposited dollars would be maintained even if the United States was forced to devalue the dollar.

HEADLINE: Trade and Syria Top Agenda at E.U.-China Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, is expected to meet with top officials of the European Union on Thur sday amid rising trade tensions and diverging views on how to quell the conflict in Syria.
The meeting comes before a change of leadership in Beijing, making it the last meeting of its kind between Mr. Wen and Herman Van Rompuy, the pres ident of the European Council, and José Manuel Barroso, the president of the Eur opean Commission.
But with no major agreements planned, the mee ting risked being overshadowed by a dispute over censorship after the E.U. autho rities said they would not hold a customary closing news conference because of a disagreement over the format and after journalists based in Brussels expressed concerns that the Chinese authorities were planning to exclude those they dislik ed. 
The European Union is the biggest destination for Chinese exports, whic h were worth ?292.5 billion, or about $382 billion, last year, while expo rts from the Union to China were worth ?136.2 billion, making China the U nion's second-largest trading partner after the United States and a major source of wealth and jobs.
The importance of the trade relationship makes the sl owing Chinese economy and the crisis in the euro zone major concerns for both pa rties. The meeting ''allows us to discuss the state of both our economies and ho w to join forces to drive our economies out of their current difficulties,'' Mr. Van Rompuy said in a statement issued Wednesday.
As in the United States, the E.U. relationship with China has come under strain in recent years amid conc erns about unfair competition and other issues.
This month, the European C ommission began a broad investigation into whether Chinese companies had exporte d solar power equipment for less than the cost of making it. The E.U. trade comm issioner, Karel De Gucht, is expected to discuss the solar dispute with his Chin ese counterpart, Commerce Minister Chen Deming, on Thursday.
Another source of friction is a European law requiring airlines using airports inside the Unio n to account for their carbon dioxide emissions. China has stated that its airli nes should not pay any associated charges without permission from the government . The first charges fall due in April 2013.
The two sides are also expected to discuss mounting tensions between China and Japan over the disputed islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu in China and the Senkakus in Japan, wh ich could also have ramifications for trade.
China halted exports of rare earth metals to Japan for nearly two months in 2010 after the Japanese Coast Gua rd detained a Chinese fishing vessel that had slammed into a coast guard ship wh en it was intercepted near one of the islands. The halt drew international atten tion to Chinese restrictions on exports of rare earths and helped lead to the fi ling in March this year of a World Trade Organization case, in which the Europea n Union, the United States and Japan challenged China's right to limit exports o f such important minerals.
The situation in Syria is also expected to featu re prominently in discussions.
China, along with Russia, has vetoed propos ed U.N. Security Council resolutions intended to put pressure on President Basha r al-Assad to end a crackdown on the Syrian opposition. The Europeans ''will emp hasize the inability of the international community to mobilize'' in the case of Syria, an E.U. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity before the meeting.
The customary closing news conference was shelved after journalis ts expressed concerns that the Chinese authorities planned exclusions.
Ann Cahill, the president of the International Press Association, said the group had rejected a suggestion from the European Council to allow access by 50 journalis ts, photographers and camera crews. Ms. Cahill said the E.U. authorities would h ave selected 25 non-Chinese journalists and the Chinese authorities would have s elected 25 Chinese journalists, including some from the E.U. press corps, and qu estions would be limited to just two from each side.
The press association ''could not approve of any arrangement that would tacitly permit any group to di scriminate against journalists representing views of which they disapprove,'' Ms . Cahill wrote in a letter to the Brussels press corps this week.
Dirk De Backer, a spokesman for Mr. Van Rompuy, said a number of meetings had been held with the Chinese and the press association but it had been impossible to reach a compromise.
''Regrettably, it has not been possible to reach a satisfactor y agreement on the conditions for a press conference,'' Mr. De Backer said. ''Th erefore, the E.U. decided not to call a press conference.''
Ms. Cahill said the E.U. and Chinese authorities appeared to be trying to avoid a repetition of events at a similar meeting in Brussels two years ago, when Chinese authorities tried to bar some Chinese journalists from attending, leading the European Coun cil to cancel the final news conference.

HEADLINE: The United Sta tes and the Muslim World

 BODY:
The anti-Islam video that set off attacks against American embassies and violent protests in the Muslim world was a convenient fus e for rage. Deeper forces are at work in those societies, riven by pent-up anger over a lack of jobs, economic stagnation and decades of repression by previous Arab governments.
In the wake of the Arab Spring, these newly liberated natio ns have become battlegrounds for Islamic extremists, moderates and secularists, all contending for power and influence over the direction of democratic change. These forces and the attacks may be beyond the control of American foreign polic y, no matter what some might want to believe. 
Plenty of Islamis t leaders, and Al Qaeda affiliates, are eager to exploit unrest for their own pu rposes. One particularly destructive force is Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah ch ief who rallied a huge anti-American demonstration in Lebanon. He is undoubtedly trying to revive his own popularity, badly damaged by his alliance with the bru tal Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.
The anti-American extremists who mu rdered Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three of his colleagues in Benghazi , Libya, or went on rampages in other cities have reinforced the worst fears of those who see Muslims mainly through a prism of intolerance and hate. The extrem ists have also done serious damage to their economies; tourism and businesses ca nnot grow in chaos and insecurity.
Instead of demanding that their governm ents deliver needed jobs and housing, the protesters focused on a crude video pr omoted by hatemongering fanatics in the United States. With the news media mostl y state-controlled in the Arab world, the idea of the United States government r efusing to censor offensive anti-Islam material on free speech grounds remains i nexplicable to many Muslims. On Wednesday, a French magazine published vulgar ca ricatures of Prophet Muhammad, provoking a new wave of outrage.
In 2009, P resident Obama wisely sought rapprochement with Muslims. Speaking in Cairo, he e ndorsed an approach of mutual respect and promised that, while he would never he sitate to confront extremism, America never would be at war with Islam. He also challenged Muslims to establish elected, peaceful governments that respect all t heir people. Few would have predicted then how many Arab nations would now be st ruggling to meet that standard. As troubling as they are, the protests should be seen in context. Most of the crowds were a few thousand people or less. And man y leaders -- the Libyans and Tunisians, especially, but also the Turkish prime m inister, the grand mufti in Saudi Arabia and, belatedly, Egyptian leaders -- con demned the violence and promised to beef up security at American embassies and c onsulates. They need to keep speaking out and also publicly explain to their peo ple why a relationship with the United States even matters. The Libyans who trie d to save Ambassador Stevens certainly saw value in those ties.
Mitt Romney and the Republicans have leveled preposterous charges that Mr. Obama has been w eak and apologetic. They have offered only confusing and often contradictory ass ertions in place of a coherent alternative. They haven't gotten the message that Washington cannot, and should not, try to impose its will on the fragile Arab d emocracies.
But it would be wrong to retreat from supporting people in Liby a, Tunisia and Egypt who are committed to building democratic governments and pl uralistic societies based on the rule of law as some in Congress urge. The Unite d States has to stay engaged in whatever ways it can.

HEADLINE: Why Should Teache rs Do It All?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Are We Asking Too Much From Our Teache rs?'' (Sunday Review, Sept. 16):
I commend Alex Kotlowitz for hi ghlighting the issues we face in educating our most impoverished children. Askin g teachers alone to find solutions for the myriad issues students bring with the m every day, let alone teaching them to read, write and do arithmetic, is too mu ch.
But if one asks ''Are we asking too much from our schools?,'' the answe r is probably no. Rigorous studies have found schooling initiatives like Head St art, the Harlem Children's Zone Promise Academy and Project Star to have positiv e, long-lasting effects on many of our poorest youth, a feat not matched by almo st all moderately large social programs not carried out through a school environ ment. 
While quality teaching is certainly paramount to improving the lives of our youth, a broader mind-set about what schools can do, and the resources an d freedom to do it, are also needed.
DAVID BJERK Claremont, Calif., Sept. 1 7, 2012
The writer is an associate professor of public economics at Claremo nt McKenna College.
To the Editor:
I applaud Alex Kotlowitz's percepti ve article. He questions the pervasive assumption that ''with really good teache rs and longer school days and rigorous testing we can transform children's lives .'' He correctly concludes that teachers alone cannot effect this change.
T he conservative right has attacked teachers with a three-part agenda: break unio ns, beginning with teachers; create more for-profit charter schools; and cut bac k the financing of public schools, further shrinking government.
The public needs to understand the effect of poverty on education. Impoverished parents, o ften working two or more jobs, lack the time and energy to sufficiently encourag e and support their children in school. In light of this, Mr. Kotlowitz's statis tic that one of every five children in America lives below the poverty level par ticularly resonates.
As Mr. Kotlowitz notes, if America persists in failing to alleviate the pressures of poverty and to boldly invest in education, school s will continue to fail. School improvement should not be viewed through the len s of private profit but of public good. All the ills of our society cannot right fully be laid at the teacher's doorstep.
SEYMOUR SPIEGEL Jericho, N.Y., Sep t. 17, 2012
The writer worked in the New York City public schools for 33 ye ars as a teacher, dean and assistant principal.
To the Editor:
There i s no doubt that the education of children takes place in both the school and at home. Some are too prone to call those who promote the necessity of the home exp erience as ''racists'' because so many failures among children are those of mino rity groups. Others call teachers who have to battle the environment of poverty ''lazy.'' Neither is right, by a long shot.
Part of the solution could be r einventing schools as the hub of the community. School buildings, now open only for instruction and some after-school activities, should be outfitted for delive ring health, nutrition, study time, additional cultural experiences, sports and other functions necessary for positive child growth and development.
These services should be available 24/7. Teachers and other professionals could intera ct with parents in an intergenerational approach to ameliorating the difficultie s they all face.
JERROLD ROSS Dean, School of Education St. John's Universi ty Jamaica, Queens, Sept. 16, 2012
To the Editor:
Thousands of childr en start school already well behind their peers and struggle to catch up even wh en they have some of the best teachers. As Cook County's sheriff, I believe that the best policy involves front-loading resources toward early childhood, a crit ical period of brain development.
Quality preschool gives at-risk children the tools they need to succeed in school and curbs criminal behavior before it e ver begins. In fact, research on Chicago's Child-Parent Center preschools found that low-income children attending were far more likely to graduate from high sc hool and less likely to be arrested for violent crimes later in life when compar ed with their peers.
Illinois, like many states, has cut early childhood ed ucation financing. Chicago has taken some steps to mitigate these cuts. We must fight to ensure that more children have access to this critical educational oppo rtunity.
THOMAS J. DART Chicago, Sept. 18, 2012
To the Editor:
Th ree cheers to Alex Kotlowitz for his common-sense analysis of the core issues un derlying the Chicago teachers' strike. It should be required reading for all tho se who expect teachers to be miracle workers who can cure all our social ills if only they weren't too lazy to wave their magic wands.

HEADLINE: Some Religious Leaders See a Threat as Europe Grows More Secular

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
HOF, Germany -- This sleepy town not far from the Czech border, in a hilly corner of Catholic Bavaria, is an unlikely place to find an active synagogue, and an even unlikelier focal point for a controversy that some see as a threat to religious tolerance in Europe and even the place of Jews in Germany.
Rabbi David Goldberg, a jovial 64-year-old Israeli who serves a community of about 400 Jews in Hof, has become an international cause célèbre after four German citizens filed criminal complaints against him with the local prosecutor. His alleged crime, which made headlines in Israel and elsewhere, was performing ritual circumcisions.
The dispute reflects the ever deeper secularization of European life that, in the eyes of some religious leaders, has mutated into a form of intolerance. This conflict between secular and religious values has most frequently involved Islam, with bans on minarets in Switzerland and veils that cover women's faces in France. Elsewhere, a recent American-made anti-Islamic video has touched off violent demonstrations. And sensitivities were further inflamed Wednesday with the publication in a French magazine of unflattering caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, several of them showing him naked. 
But the debate over ritual circumcision shows that the tensions extend even further.
Rabbi Goldberg does not seem especially worried. Anyone can file a complaint against anyone else in Germany, and he may never face formal charges. Rabbi Goldberg has not hired a lawyer and declined an offer from one who was willing to handle the case for free.
The more serious threat, in the eyes of Rabbi Goldberg and many Jews, Muslims and Christians in Europe, comes from what they see as an attack by secular society on religious ritual, on faith itself. A seemingly insignificant decision by a lower court in Cologne, against a doctor who circumcised a Muslim boy, has fed a rapidly spreading drive to criminalize a practice that is core to Jewish and Muslim belief.
In contrast to the United States, baby boys in Germany and other European countries are not routinely circumcised for health reasons. The World Health Organization recommends circumcision as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS, but many doctors in European countries regard the practice as harmful and even barbaric.
The line of demarcation between church and state in Germany is also different from that in the United States. Chancellor Angela Merkel leads the Christian Democratic party and is the daughter of a Protestant pastor. But, in contrast to the displays of piety expected of American politicians, she rarely mentions religion or is photographed attending church.
Nevertheless, Ms. Merkel is pushing for legislation to allow circumcision to continue, and she is winning praise from Jewish leaders. And Rabbi Goldberg says some of the most fervent letters of support he has received have come from Christians.
''They know the Bible,'' he said, speaking in the renovated schoolhouse in a residential neighborhood in Hof that serves as synagogue, community center and residence for him and his family. ''They are afraid for their religion as well.''
For the more than 100,000 Jews who live in Germany, the tenor of the circumcision debate has come as a shock, undercutting confidence that they had found a secure place in society after the horrors of the Holocaust. Only a few months ago, that confidence had seemed justified when voters in Frankfurt chose their first Jewish mayor since 1933.
But now, some Jewish leaders say, the circumcision debate has exposed how ignorant many Germans are about Jewish beliefs.
''This discussion has shown that we are foreigners in our own country, doing something that Germans are not supposed to do,'' said Stephan J. Kramer, secretary general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. ''We are accused of torturing our own children.''
Muslims express similar sentiments. ''There are more than a few people who have something against Muslims and Jews, and they are taking advantage of this,'' said Aiman A. Mazyek, chairman of the Central Committee of Muslims in Germany. ''They can hide behind this discussion. They can say what they always wanted to say.''
A German pediatricians' association, as well as a children's aid group, are helping lead a petition drive calling for a two-year moratorium on circumcision. For religious Jews, such a moratorium would be catastrophic. The Bible tells them to circumcise a baby boy eight days after birth, unless there is a medical reason to wait.
But Jews in Europe, not just in Germany, say that it is difficult to convince people who are not religious that circumcision is regarded as a command from God, and that without it a young man cannot enter Jewish society.
''It's a secular society. People don't have much sense about religion or much knowledge of religion,'' said Ervin Kohn, a Jewish leader in Oslo, where a debate about circumcision is also under way. There are about 1,500 Jews in Norway, he said, out of a total population of 4.7 million.
''When people hear debate about circumcision, they have trouble connecting it with religious freedom,'' Mr. Kohn said. ''When I say that circumcision for us is an existential question, they don't always understand it.''
The catalyst for the controversy and the complaints against Rabbi Goldberg in Hof was a State Court decision in Cologne in June that found that a doctor committed criminal bodily injury by performing a circumcision on a 4-year-old Muslim boy.
Under the German legal system, the decision had no binding effect on other judges or prosecutors, even in Cologne, said Jan F. Orth, a judge at the State Court there who serves as its spokesman.
A panel of three judges, two of whom were non-lawyers analogous to citizen jurors, did not impose a punishment on the doctor. More than a month went by before the decision was picked up by the German news media. The case is not being appealed and will not go to a higher court, Mr. Orth said.
Still, the Cologne case prompted hospitals as far away as Zurich to suspend circumcisions, and it emboldened an anticircumcision movement in Germany as well as in countries like Denmark that had gone little noticed until then.
Even though the court case involved a Muslim boy, the debate in Germany quickly pivoted to a discussion about Jewish religious practice -- and then landed in Hof, a city of 45,000 that has been largely bypassed by the economic boom in the rest of Bavaria. Hof's population has been declining for decades, but the Jewish population has grown.
Gerhard Schmitt, the chief prosecutor in Hof, said he has not yet decided whether to start a formal investigation against Rabbi Goldberg, much less file charges.
During 15 years in Hof, Rabbi Goldberg said, he has never encountered anti-Semitism. A handful of neo-Nazis staged a march in May, but local citizens organized a much larger counterdemonstration.
Local Christian leaders have rallied around Rabbi Goldberg. The Rev. Günter Saalfrank, a minister who oversees Protestant churches in Hof and the surrounding region, attributed the controversy to ignorance of Judaism and said it is unfortunate that the debate has revolved around the definition of criminal bodily injury.
''It narrows the issue,'' he said. ''Circumcision is about much more than that. It has been done for thousands of years, a totally normal ritual.''
There is not much demand for circumcision in Hof. But Rabbi Goldberg said he has been called to places like Prague and Budapest to perform the ritual, and he estimates that he has carried out 4,000 in a long career. He is puzzled by suggestions that circumcisions are harmful to babies.
''In Judaism, the health of the baby is more important than anything,'' Rabbi Goldberg said. The harm, he added, would come if the baby was not circumcised. ''A man who is not circumcised cannot understand the context of the Bible,'' he said. ''It is very, very important.''

HEADLINE: 4-Year Deals For Unions At Verizon

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Unions representing 45,000 Verizon workers announced tentative new contracts on Wednesday that call for an 8 percent pay raise over four years while requiring workers to pay more for health coverage.
The contracts, covering workers from Maine to Virginia in Verizon's landlines division, come after 16 months of tense negotiations that included a two-week strike a year ago to protest the company's demands for concessions. A ratification vote is expected in the next month.
At a time when many unions are facing demands for pay and pension freezes, Verizon's main unions -- the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- were able to preserve the current pension plan for existing workers. 
But the unions did agree that future hires covered by the contracts would no longer receive traditional pensions and would instead have 401(k) accounts with a substantial company match.
The agreements, effective Aug. 1, 2011, to Aug. 1, 2015, include an $800 ratification bonus for those covered: field technicians, call center workers and cable installers.
Larry Cohen, president of the communications workers, criticized what he said was Verizon's hard-line approach, coming when the company had $2.4 billion in net income in 2011 on revenue of $110 billion.
Mr. Cohen said that while some unions have lost ground in concessionary contracts, ''we've maintained our living standards in this contract.''
''Because of what's going on in America, every employer, regardless of its financial wherewithal, believes it's obligated to cut the costs of front-line employees,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But we held our own. This is an incredibly profitable company, and the reality of today in America is if you hold your own, that's a victory.''
Verizon issued a statement praising the deal. ''We believe this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as for the future of the wireline business,'' said Marc C. Reed, Verizon's chief administrative officer. ''It provides competitive wages, valuable benefits and affordable quality health care while giving the company new flexibility to better serve customers and become more efficient.''
The contracts cover workers in Verizon's traditional landlines operation and its new FiOS Internet and cable operations, but only a handful of workers at Verizon Wireless, the highly profitable cellphone joint venture that is largely nonunion and in which Verizon Communications is the majority shareholder.
Verizon originally pushed for a pension freeze for current workers, significantly higher employee contributions for health coverage, an end to all job security provisions and freedom to do as much outsourcing as it wanted.
As part of the deal, union officials said, the company will maintain the same level of health coverage and the workers will pay 20 percent of their overall health coverage costs, roughly double the old percentage. That provision is expected to increase out-of-pocket health care costs for family coverage by more than $1,000 a year.
Verizon has repeatedly argued that it needed many concessions as a way to reduce costs in its landline business because that division's consumer base and profit margins have shrunk over the last 10 years. Many customers have dropped fixed-line phones and turned to competing options like mobile phones, cable and Internet calling.
In defending the demand for givebacks, Verizon's chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, wrote in a letter to employees last year, ''The existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today.''
Union leaders said the tentative settlement enabled them to preserve most job security protections and still limit some outsourcing, although some union members could be transferred into different Verizon jobs.
Union officials said the raises would total $5,500 over the life of the four-year contracts. They said the typical Verizon union member earns $70,000 a year before overtime.
For future hires under the tentative agreements, Verizon would provide a dollar-for-dollar match in 401(k) contributions up to the first 6 percent of pay, and then, depending on the company's performance, it might add as much as 3 percent more in profit-sharing. Union officials said Verizon also agreed to reinstate 37 workers it had fired after accusing them of misconduct during the 2011 strike.
The two unions called their members back after two weeks of striking even though there was no agreement partly because union leaders saw how dug in Verizon had become and partly because they said Verizon had finally agreed to focus on the major issues in the negotiations.
Under the settlement, there is no raise for the first year of the contract, which has already passed, a 2.25 percent raise in the second year, 2.75 percent in the third year and 3 percent in the fourth year.
The two unions cited Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and George Cohen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, for their work over the last two months in helping to reach the deal.

HEADLINE: Europe Aims to Encourage Young to Be Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- If and when the euro crisis ends, Europe will still face an existential economic question: Who will provide the jobs of the future?
In the United States, entrepreneurs have tended to provide much of the employment that fuels recovery. Even if the current rebound lags behind previous cycles, Americans can still point to Silicon Valley and its start-up culture as symbols of economic dynamism.
In Europe, by contrast, a lack of entrepreneurial gumption is widely seen as a chief barrier to growth, especially at a time when many big companies are shedding jobs. An advertising and informational campaign begun Wednesday in Brussels aims to encourage young Europeans to take charge of their economic future by starting businesses. 
''We wanted to introduce a positive voice into the European debate,'' said Moray MacLennan, chief executive of the advertising agency M&C Saatchi in London. ''The idea was to take young people and say: I will not be a victim of other people's pessimism. I will control my future.''
Shot in London institutions like the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the British Library, the ad highlights displays featuring European scientists and thinkers of the past, including Plato, Galileo and Darwin, as well as Charles Babbage, the computing pioneer, and James Watson and Francis Crick, who discovered the structure of DNA.
A narrator reads a quotation attributed to the British auto racing entrepreneur Bernie Ecclestone: ''I think Europe is finished. It will be a good place for tourism but little else. Europe is a thing of the past.''
The final ''exhibit'' is a young girl in a glass box. Instead of remaining stationary like the other items on display, she picks up a hammer and shatters the glass.
''That is not my future,'' she says, as the screen displays the address for the campaign's Web site. ''This is my future.''
The campaign was developed by the European Association of Communications Agencies, a trade group based in Brussels, in partnership with M&C Saatchi and other ad firms. It features a video spot that emphatically rejects the idea that Europe should be consigned to a museum of economic and technological history.
''Entrepreneurship is one of these things where everyone says we could do things better, but nobody gets on and does it,'' said Robert Madelin, director general for communications networks, content and technology at the European Commission in Brussels, which is supporting the campaign. The campaign, he added, sends the message that ''entrepreneurship is part of the European dream.''
The campaign, which is being run as a public service initiative by the agency association, is set to begin in five European countries -- Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and Britain -- in March 2013. In addition to advertising, it includes a Web site that will gather information and resources for entrepreneurs.
The agency group intends to hire two people in each of the five countries to run the Web sites, as well as to organize networking activities linking potential entrepreneurs with mentors and peers.
The agency association is raising funds for the campaign, and has received expressions of support from European publishers and television groups, as well as other media owners. They will be encouraged to run ads for it on a public service basis, keeping the overall budget for the campaign to 2.2 million euros ($2.9 million).
The goal, according to the agency group, is to encourage European entrepreneurs to found 500,000 start-ups over the next three years, creating two million jobs.
Mr. MacLennan, who is also president of the European Association of Communications Agencies, acknowledged that the campaign would not directly address certain structural barriers to entrepreneurial activity in Europe, which can be politically sensitive. These, analysts say, include rigid labor markets in many Continental countries, which make it costly to hire and fire workers; weighty legal and financial penalties for business failure; and a lack of access to financing.
Instead, the campaign aims to change mind-sets, including an ingrained cultural aversion to risk that, Mr. MacLennan maintained, was one of the main problems holding back entrepreneurial activity in many European countries.
''The idea is to help people surmount the emotional and cultural barriers that stop them from taking the first step to starting a business,'' Mr. MacLennan said.
Some entrepreneurs agree that this is an important first step.
''When you go to a dinner party, and people say, 'I'm a doctor, a lawyer or an accountant,' or whatever, and then they get to me and I say, 'I'm an entrepreneur,' a slightly glazed look comes over people's eyes,'' said Rajeeb Dey, founder of Enternships, a British start-up that connects students and job seekers with small companies seeking interns.
''They sort of feel sorry for you,'' Mr. Dey added, at the Brussels news conference. ''That needs to change.''
While the campaign is aimed primarily at young Europeans, external perceptions matter, too.
Europe's start-up deficit, as well as the widely held American idea that Europeans lack entrepreneurial get-up-and-go, is not just a product of the economic crisis. A befuddled quote has often been used to sum up a longstanding view from the other side of the Atlantic: ''The problem with the French is that they have no word for entrepreneur.''
In recent years, however, negative views of Europe's economic performance and potential have hardened. Mr. MacLennan said he was driven to act after reading a cover story in Time magazine about a year ago, which conflated the euro crisis, Europe's lack of economic dynamism and the riots in London under the headline, ''The decline and fall of Europe.''
''I thought, 'How dare you write off a whole Continent?' '' he said, adding that Europe had a bigger gross domestic product than any other region in the world. ''It potentially has a great part to play in the world.''

HEADLINE: Income Data Shows Widening Gap Between New York City's Richest and Poorest

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer in New York City last year as the poverty rate reached its highest point in more than a decade, and the income gap in Manhattan, already wider than almost anywhere else in the country, rivaled disparities in sub-Saharan Africa.
While the national recession officially ended in 2009 and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has repeatedly proclaimed the city's robust recovery, the census figures to be released on Thursday painted a decidedly sober view of how New Yorkers are faring. 
''To see the poverty rate jump almost a full percentage point is not a good sign,'' said David R. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty advocacy and research group. ''We're still seeing really high rates of unemployment, while jobs have been growing in an anemic way and the jobs that have been created are really low-wage.''
While Mr. Bloomberg has made reducing the poverty rate, now nearly 21 percent, a priority, administration officials acknowledged that the stagnant national economy had hurt the city.
''These poverty numbers reflect a national challenge: the U.S. economy has shifted and too many people are getting left behind without the skills they need to compete and succeed,'' Samantha Levine, the mayor's deputy press secretary, said on Wednesday. ''As President Clinton recently said, 'The old economy is not coming back,' and that's why the mayor believes we need a new national approach to job creation and education, one that gives everyone a chance to rise up the economic ladder.''
Median household income in the city last year was $49,461, just below the national median and down $821 from the year before (compared with a national decline of $642). Median earnings for workers fell sharply to $32,210 from $33,287 -- much more than the national decline.)
New Yorkers at the bottom end of the income spectrum lost ground, while those at the top gained.
Median income for the lowest fifth was $8,844, down $463 from 2010. For the highest, it was $223,285, up $1,919.
In Manhattan, the disparity was even starker. The lowest fifth made $9,681, while the highest took home $391,022. The wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites made more than 40 times what the lowest fifth reported, a widening gap (it was 38 times, the year before) surpassed by only a few developing countries, including Namibia and Sierra Leone.
Only one other county in the nation, Clarke County, Ga., where nearly a third of the 117,000 residents are college students, reported a higher income gap.
Except for a decline in the poverty rate among children under 5, virtually every indicator was grim and suggested growing inequality. Poverty rates rose most among Hispanic people, New Yorkers over age 65, married couples, residents of Manhattan and Queens, and those without a high school diploma. The citywide increase to 20.9 percent from 20.1 percent was slightly higher than the national increase, but still left the rate in New York below that of many other big cities.
Nearly 1.7 million city residents were officially classified as poor, or with an income of less than $18,530 for a family of three. Some 750,000 were subsisting on less than half the poverty level. The proportion receiving food stamps increased to 20.6 percent from 19.3. Among poor New Yorkers 16 and older, a third had worked full or part time within the preceding year.
''The statistics demonstrate quite clearly that our most vulnerable neighbors are far from a recovery,'' said Jilly Stephens, executive director of City Harvest, which helps get emergency food to hungry New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Advocate Of Democracy In Myanmar Meets Obama

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama welcomed Myanmar's oppos ition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to the Oval Office on Wednesday, amid signs that the administration was likely to further ease sanctions on her once-isolate d Southeast Asian nation. 
In the meeting, Mr. Obama paid tribute to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's courage and personal sacrifice in fighting for democracy in Myanma r, the White House said. In a speech on Tuesday, she called for American sanctio ns to be eased, saying that they had served their purpose. A senior administrati on official said the United States was likely to ease at least some of them.<T XT>
But the official cautioned that the administration would not make a ny announcements until it had consulted with Myanmar's government, which under P resident Thein Sein, a former general, has been moving away from its authoritari an past. Although the administration is eager to enlist the support of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the official said, announcing any action regarding sanctions during her visit might alienate Mr. Thein Sein.
''That's certainly a direction we 're moving in,'' said this official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. '' But we're very sensitive to the fact that Thein Sein is pursuing a reform proces s that Aung San Suu Kyi is an important part of.''
The administration has a lready relaxed some sanctions, allowing American companies to invest in many par ts of the economy of Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. But it has left othe r measures in place, in part because of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham C linton described as the threat of ''backsliding'' by hard-line elements.
Mr . Thein Sein plans to attend the opening session of the United Nations General A ssembly next week, as does Mr. Obama, though the official said a meeting was unl ikely. Another possibility is for Mr. Obama to speak with Mr. Thein Sein after t he election, at an Asian summit meeting in Cambodia in November.
The Treasu ry Department said Wednesday that it had removed Mr. Thein Sein and another seni or Myanmar official -- Thura Shwe Mann, speaker of the lower house of Parliament -- from a list of sanctioned individuals in recognition of their steps to promo te political reform.
Ms. Aung Sang Suu Kyi's meeting capped an emotional d ay in which she was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony in the Ro tunda of the Capitol. Mrs. Clinton and Laura Bush, the former first lady, were a mong the guests.

HEADLINE: Mitt's Sn ake-Bit Season

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Our topic for today is: When Bad Thing s Happen to Mitt Romney.
Really, it's been the worst run of disasters this si de of the Mayan calendar. The Republicans' woes started last Friday, when Ann an d Mitt filmed a TV interview in which they entertained the kind of personal ques tions that most candidates learned to avoid after Bill Clinton did that boxers-v ersus-briefs thing. Asked what he wears to bed, Mitt said: ''I think the best an swer is: as little as possible.''
Euww. 
Then, over the week end, Romney aides began spilling their guts about how other staffers had screwed up the Republicans' bounce-free convention. In an attempt to change the convers ation, the campaign announced that it had just realized the nation wants Romney to say what he'd actually do as president. Voters ''are eager to hear more detai ls about policies to turn our economy around,'' said an adviser, Ed Gillespie.<P A> In search of just such specificity, the scoop-hungry Christian Broadcasting Network asked Paul Ryan if he would continue refusing to identify exactly what t ax loopholes the Romney administration would close in order to turn our economy around.
''Yes,'' said Ryan, who then veered into a disquisition about somet hing that once happened to Tip O'Neill.
You may be wondering whatever becam e of Ryan, who was such a big sensation when Romney first picked him as a runnin g mate. Since Tampa, he seems to have fallen off the face of the earth, resurfac ing every now and then to put up another ad for re-election to his House seat in Wisconsin.
It's not all that unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to go low-profile. And it is totally not true that Mitt Romney strapped Paul Ryan to the top of a car and drove him to Canada. Stop spreading rumors!
Next, M other Jones published that video of the fund-raiser in Boca Raton in which Romne y said that 47 percent of the country is composed of moochers who want to confis cate the earnings of hard-working stockbrokers and spend it on caviar and dialys is treatments.
''So my job is not to worry about those people. I'll never c onvince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their li ves,'' Romney decreed, undoubtedly more in sorrow than in anger.
Then, Repu blican Senate candidates in tight races began distancing themselves from the top of the ticket.
Ann Romney suggested Mitt was ''taken out of context,'' in what was undoubtedly meant as a helpful comment.
''All of us make mistakes ,'' said President Obama, in what probably wasn't.
''Obviously inarticulate ,'' decreed Paul Ryan, popping up from a gopher hole somewhere in Nevada.
T he fund-raiser, a $50,000-a-pop sit-down dinner, was hosted by Marc Leder, a fin ancier who The New York Post reported as having a ''wild party'' last summer in the Hamptons ''where guests cavorted nude in the pool'' while ''scantily dressed Russians danced on platforms.'' You cannot blame Romney for that. If presidenti al candidates had to avoid all multimillionaires who held parties with naked gue sts and Russians on platforms, there would be no money for misleading TV commerc ials.
The video was a reminder of how ghastly this business of running for president can be. The guests seemed more interested in the breadbasket than the candidate. Romney was blathering away in the manner of somebody trying to stay a wake during the 12th hour of a cross-country drive.
On Tuesday, moving to t amp down criticism that he was a conversational disaster area, Romney told Fox's Neil Cavuto: ''Well, we were, of course, talking about a campaign and how he's going to get close to half the votes. I'm going to get half the vote, approximat ely. I hope -- I want to get 50.1 percent or more.''
With that out of the w ay, Romney explained that his real point had not been to criticize people who do n't pay income taxes, but merely to point out that he wanted them to make more m oney. ''I think people would like to be paying taxes,'' added the quarter-billio naire whose own eagerness to be part of the solution is a matter of public recor d.
How did he let things slip out of control? Maybe the answer lies back w ith that Ann-and-Mitt interview, which was on ''Live With Kelly and Michael.'' A sked about his preferences when it came to heroines of low-end reality TV shows, the future presidential candidate enthusiastically announced: ''I'm kind of a S nooki fan. Look how tiny she's gotten. She's lost weight and she's energetic. I mean, just her sparkplug personality is kind of fun.''
It could be worse. H e could have announced that he enjoys spending his free hours watching ''Hoarder s'' marathons. But, still, it's weird that Mitt Romney appears to think a lot ab out Snooki. Is it possible that while he's being dragged around from one fund-ra iser to the next, he spends his spare time watching ''Jersey Shore'' reruns in t he limo?
That would explain so much.

HEADLINE: Distortion in Tax Code Makes Debt More Attractive t o Banks

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonpr ofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-m ail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Thank s to a leaked video, we know that Mitt Romney divides the country into those who pay taxes and those who don't, the makers and the moochers.
There is one per haps surprising group you can put in the latter category: the nation's banks. Su re, banks pay taxes, but they pay a lot less thanks to a giant and underapprecia ted distortion in our nation's tax code. Moreover, this tax code distortion make s the financial system and the economy more fragile, prone to bankruptcies and r uns. Banks profit, and the economy teeters. Great bargain, huh?
It's the tax code's favoring of debt over equity. 
For businesses, debt inte rest payments are tax deductible; equity payments, like when a company pays out a dividend, are not. At the margin, this encourages entities to take on more deb t than they otherwise would, as Steven M. Davidoff noted in a Deal Professor col umn earlier this year. More debt not only makes companies more vulnerable to ban kruptcy but also makes investors more susceptible to panics, when they withdraw their capital en masse. More equity would make the world more stable.
"The worst thing the tax code can do," says Victor Fleischer, a tax specialist at the University of Colorado, "is to make it harder to use a sensible capital structu re." Mr. Fleisher, a contributor to The New York Times DealBook, testified in fr ont of Congress last year about this problem.
This distortion is well known . President Obama, in his tax reform proposal, mentioned it, though he didn't ma ke any specific proposal about what to do about it. The Republican candidate, Mi tt Romney, is proposing substantial tax cuts with the loss of revenue made up wi th the closing of loopholes. He has yet to specify any of those loopholes, but c orporate debt interest deductibility hasn't been in the conversation.
What isn't well appreciated is how much the debt deduction helps the banks. The first way is direct: Banking is a highly leveraged industry. Banks use more debt than equity to finance their activities. The tax break makes the debt cheaper and en courages banks, at the margin, to gorge on more.
Financing techniques that have become more popular in recent decades benefit from this distortion. Bundlin g of debt, like credit card receivables or mortgage debt, called securitization, turns out to give banks a tax bonanza. For accounting purposes, banks are typic ally able to treat their bundling of this debt as a sale. But for tax purposes, banks often get to call it debt. Those payments to the buyers of the securitizat ions' bonds are therefore tax deductible to the bank.
More important, there 's an indirect and unremarked benefit. Banks help companies raise money in two m ain ways: through the sale of stock (equity) and debt, either through loans or t he sale of bonds. When a company goes public, selling stock for the first time, the underwriting banks make more money than they do for a comparable debt offeri ng. But banks make it up on volume with debt. Bonds expire. Companies issue more of them all the time.
Partly because of the tax code distortion, corporate debt is underpriced and overconsumed by the bank's corporate customers. Indeed, the debt business dominates the world of investment banking these days. When co rporations raise more debt compared with equity, that fattens bank profits.
Then, too, the trading of debt is more profitable than the trading of equity. S tocks are traded on transparent markets at transparent prices. Debt is traded in opaque ways, where the spread between the offered and requested prices is wider than for stocks. That means more profit for investment banks compared with stoc ks, whose trading spreads have narrowed for decades. So, too, with derivatives a nd securities based on debt - things like collateralized loan obligations.
And these complex debt securities give society - what? The system we have subsid izes the middleman to create dubious products. Those products help the middlemen - the banks - but they make the financial system more fragile. So the tax code distortion doesn't just lead to more debt in corporate America and more leverage d banks. It also helps create a finance-heavy economy where the banking sector a ccounts for a bigger proportion of gross domestic product and corporate profits than it otherwise would. Granted, the tax code is far from the only force in Ame rican society that creates a larger financial sector or overleveraged corporatio ns. But it's one of the least recognized.
As most of us have come to unders tand since the financial crisis, having a bigger finance industry than necessary wastes resources. Banking is supposed to provide capital to help companies crea te real goods and services, not be an end unto itself.
As it is, lawyers, a ccountants and investment bankers spend thousands of billable hours analyzing tr ansactions to figure out if there are ways to treat them like debt, rather than equity.
Are there solutions to this distortion?
There are two choices: reduce or eliminate interest deductibility or introduce some deduction for equi ty.
Neither seems particularly feasible for some time. Reducing the deducti bility would be elegant but generate screams of bloody murder from corporate Ame rica.
Making dividend payments tax deductible, which would start to level t he playing field, might be easier and more popular. Of course, that would reduce revenue to the government and have to be made up somehow, though tax increases elsewhere or decreased services.
Mr. Fleischer suggests that one way to lim it the distortion would be to eliminate the deduction to the extent a financial institution exceeds a ratio of debt-to-equity of 5 to 1. If a bank has borrowed $6 for every $1 in stock, then it doesn't get to deduct the interest payments on that extra dollar of debt. That would make debt more expensive and make banks l ess inclined to borrow as much.
And it would help stop banks from being moo chers.
Debt-to-Equity Ratios for Four Largest Banks

HEADLINE: More Expected To Face Penalty In Health Law 

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly six million Americ ans, most of them middle-income workers, will face a tax penalty under President Obama's health overhaul for not getting insurance, Congressional analysts said Wednesday. 
That estimate, from analysts at the nonpartisan Congressional Budg et Office, is significantly higher than their previous projection, calculated in 2010 shortly after the law passed.
The earlier estimate found four million people would be affected in 2016, when the penalty is fully in effe ct. The budget office expects the penalty to be about $1,200 on average in that first year.
''The bad news and broken promises from Obamacare just keep pil ing up,'' said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who wants to repeal the law.
Starting i n 2014, almost every legal resident of the United States will be required to car ry health insurance or face a tax penalty, with exemptions for financial hardshi p, religious objections and certain other circumstances.
A spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department, Erin Shields Britt, said 98 percent o f Americans would not be affected by the tax penalty -- and suggested that those who will be should face up to their civic responsibilities.
The new analys is ''doesn't change the basic fact that the individual responsibility policy wil l only affect people who can afford health care but choose not to buy it,'' she said.
The budget office said most of the increase in its estimate could be attributed to changes in underlying projections about the economy and to the eff ects of new federal legislation.

HEADLINE: In Tight Race, Obama Wields All Levers of Pow er in Reach

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For months, government lawyers and economists worked behind the scenes to develop a trade ca se against China. Then last month came a eureka moment: They confirmed the exist ence of a Chinese subsidy program for automobiles and parts that in their view v iolated international trade rules. They finished a complaint, circulated it amon g agencies and proposed a time frame for filing.
That's when President Obama' s political team took over, providing a textbook example of how an incumbent can harness the power of the office to bolster the case for re-election. Rather tha n leave it to the trade office to announce the complaint, Mr. Obama decided to d o it himself. Aides scheduled it for a campaign swing to the auto-dependent batt leground state of Ohio, leaked it to the state's largest newspaper, then sent ot her journalists a link to the resulting story plus voter-friendly talking points . 
Every president lives at the intersection of policy and politi cs, never more so than during a campaign season. Locked in a tight race with Mit t Romney, Mr. Obama and his team have been pulling every lever of the federal go vernment within reach, announcing initiatives aimed at critical constituencies, dispatching cabinet secretaries to competitive areas, coordinating campaign even ts to match popular government actions and forestalling or even reversing other government decisions that could hurt the president's chances of a second term.<P A> On Friday, Mr. Obama will designate Chimney Rock in Colorado a national monu ment, preserving thousands of acres and aiding tourism in another swing state, a decision shared Wednesday with a Denver newspaper. When he flew to Iowa last mo nth, Mr. Obama arrived just as his administration announced drought relief for f armers and released a report promoting his support for wind power. After critics attacked him for inhibiting oil and gas production by considering an obscure li zard for the endangered species list, the administration decided it wasn't so en dangered after all.
Some of the most significant policy announcements of re cent months were keyed to important voter blocs. Mr. Obama reversed position to endorse same-sex marriage before attending a big-dollar fund-raiser with gay and lesbian leaders. Just before addressing a national Latino organization, he used executive power to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country if they ha d come as children.
White House officials acknowledged that they calibrate announcements and trips to maximize the advantages of incumbency but said the po licy decisions themselves were made on substance. They also noted that while cab inet secretaries travel to swing states, they also travel to states that are not competitive. And they said that on some level it is impossible to separate the candidate from the president.
''The president is not going to put off what he believes are important actions, such as protecting jobs for American workers, until after the election,'' said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. ''These decisions are made on the merits by professionals with the relevant policy expe rtise, are often months in the making and always reflect the president's longsta nding positions.''
Republicans, naturally, see it differently. ''He looks l ike he is aiding his re-election with the power of the Oval Office,'' said Matt Schlapp, who was White House political director for President George W. Bush. '' He looks worried, reactive. It's fair to ask that if this China decision was for policy issues alone then why wait until right before the first debate to announ ce it?''
Each White House tests the boundaries. President Bill Clinton used the Lincoln Bedroom to entertain financial donors. Mr. Bush's strategist, Karl Rove, oversaw an ''asset deployment team'' that managed trips and grant announce ments. Both got in trouble. Mr. Clinton's fund-raising triggered Congressional i nvestigations while the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency, conclu ded that the Bush White House violated federal law by creating a ''political boi ler room'' coordinating campaign activities.
The same agency determined las t week that Kathleen Sebelius, the health and human services secretary, violated the law by advocating Mr. Obama's re-election during an official trip to North Carolina. The trip was reclassified to political and the cost reimbursed. ''Keep ing the roles straight can be a difficult task, particularly on mixed trips that involve both campaign and official stops on the same day,'' Ms. Sebelius wrote investigators.
Other cabinet secretaries have had active travel schedules t o important electoral states. Since July, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has tra veled to at least 15 states for public events, according to his schedule, includ ing Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Florida and Colorado. During the same perio d in 2010, he traveled to 10 states, according to agency records. At various sto ps, Mr. Salazar promoted Mr. Obama's energy and conservation policies.
Mr. Salazar took an airboat tour of the Everglades in Florida days after Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited to announce $80 million for an Everglades protect ion program. Mr. Vilsack hinted at why that small chunk of Florida had received so much attention when he appeared at the opening of Mr. Obama's campaign office in Port St. Lucie. ''You win Florida and you win the presidency,'' Mr. Vilsack said at the event. ''And I have been told you win this region, you win Florida.' '
While announcing new initiatives during campaign season is standard pract ice, Mr. Obama's team also seems focused on stopping policies that may be politi cally hazardous. In June, the Interior Department rejected their own plans to de signate a lizard known as the dunes sagebrush as endangered by oil and gas activ ities. After analysis, the department declared that ''the lizard is no longer in danger of extinction.''
''The administration did not want to face criticis m from the oil and gas industry during an election year,'' said Taylor McKinnon, a public lands advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity.
Blake And roff, an Interior Department spokesman, said the decision was ''based entirely o n the best available science and in accordance with the law,'' not politics, and came only after industry and state officials agreed to voluntary conservation m easures.
He added that Mr. Salazar's travel was also extensive in non-elect ion years, reflecting the job of overseeing hundreds of millions of acres of pub lic land. A spokesman for Mr. Vilsack said his Florida trip was planned so he co uld spend one day on official business and another stumping for Mr. Obama on his own time. But on Tuesday, the same day a reporter inquired about the mixing of politics and policy on the trip, the Obama campaign sent a check for $1,606.24 t o reimburse taxpayers for airfare and hotel -- timing that Agriculture Departmen t officials said was a coincidence.
When it came to the China case, officia ls said it was in the works for much of the year but took months to find evidenc e of unfair trading practices. They went down a number of blind alleys before ge tting the first indication of the Chinese subsidy program over the summer. Then last month, they determined it was real and deemed it a violation. At that point , officials said, there was no justification to delay filing.
And if it ha ppened to help the campaign, Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, told reporte rs, ''I'll let our opponents and all you guys assess whether or not there's a po litical benefit for the president.''

HEADLINE: In China, Panetta Says American Focus on As ia Is No Threat

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and IAN JOHNSON

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Defense Se cretary Leon E. Panetta declared Wednesday that the United States was not trying to contain a rising China, and he emphasized that with patience and effort curr ent tensions between the giant rivals on opposite sides of the Pacific could be resolved.
Mr. Panetta concluded a three-day visit in Beijing with a high-prof ile session with China's presumptive next leader, Vice President Xi Jinping, an encounter that required Mr. Panetta to stay an extra day. He also participated i n a discussion with future commanders at a People's Liberation Army academy.<T XT>
The meeting with Mr. Xi in the Great Hall of the People was viewed as additional proof that Mr. Xi was clear of whatever physical or political ailm ents had pushed him from public view for two weeks and had prompted speculation about whether he would ascend to China's top post. Mr. Xi greeted Mr. Panetta wi th a vigorous handshake and a broad smile, and he said the meeting ''would be ve ry helpful in further advancing'' ties between the United States and China. 
Mr. Panetta echoed that sentiment. ''We are two great Pacific nations with com mon concerns,'' he told Mr. Xi. ''We want to begin what you have called a 'new m odel' relationship, and we can begin with better military-to-military relations. I am convinced that we will be able to improve our dialogue.''
According t o Xinhua, China's official news agency, Mr. Xi addressed the heated sovereignty conflict with Japan over several tiny islands, strongly condemning Japan's purch ase of them as ''a farce.'' Mr. Xi was also quoted as saying to Mr. Panetta, ''J apan should rein in its behavior and stop any words and acts that undermine Chin a's sovereignty and territorial integrity.''
But it appeared that the Chin ese and American delegations were more intent on avoiding conflict over their of ten-competing policies, not arguing about them. For instance, after Mr. Panetta' s meeting Tuesday with the Chinese defense minister, Gen. Liang Guanglie, the ge neral made public comments about the dispute with Japan, threatening Japan with unspecified ''further actions,'' but made no mention of the fact that the defens e secretary of Japan's closest military ally was standing next to him.
Mr. Panetta reiterated American policy that Washington would take no sides in territ orial disputes across the region and was urging all parties to seek a peaceful, negotiated settlement.
Mr. Panetta's weeklong mission to Japan, China and N ew Zealand was intended to show allies that the United States' planned strategic rebalancing toward Asia is a reality, not just talk. But he also was seeking to reassure Beijing that the new American focus on the region, which includes shif ting some military resources from others regions to Asia and the Pacific, is not a threat to China.
''Our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region is not an at tempt to contain China,'' Mr. Panetta said Wednesday in a speech to People's Lib eration Army officers and cadets. ''It is an attempt to engage China and expand its role in the Pacific.''
Mr. Panetta said at the Armored Forces Engineeri ng Academy that a Chinese warship would be invited to join a major Pacific exerc ise hosted by the United States in waters off Hawaii, and he lauded Chinese coop eration in antipiracy missions off the Horn of Africa.
Mr. Xi's meeting wit h Mr. Panetta coincided with remarks by a former chief executive of Hong Kong, T ung Chee-hwa, that Mr. Xi's earlier absence from public view had been tied to a back injury sustained while swimming.
Mr. Xi was not seen in public during the first two weeks of September, giving rise to a variety of rumors: that he ha d hurt his back, or had a heart attack or was in political trouble. Although Mr. Tung's comments in a television interview in New York were not official, they w ere the first on-the-record remarks on the matter by a person close to the Chine se leadership. During Mr. Xi's absence, Chinese officials refused to comment.<PA > Mr. Panetta was asked to assess Mr. Xi and the intrigue surrounding his absen ce from public view. ''Frankly, my impression was that he was very healthy and v ery engaged,'' Mr. Panetta said during a session with reporters. ''I guess you'l l have to ask them what issues were involved here.''
He said Chinese leader s had urged that the American rebalancing in Asia not be solely military, but sh ould include enhanced diplomatic and economic engagement as well.
''These i nteractions made it clear to me that the leaders of both of our countries are si ncerely working toward the same goal: to build a sustained and substantive Unite d States-China defense relationship that supports the broader United States-Chin a cooperative partnership,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''That is why an essential elemen t of our rebalancing effort is the constructive bilateral relationship with Chin a.'' Mr. Panetta said he and his Chinese counterparts had discussed the expandin g realm of computer network warfare. The United States has blamed people from Ch ina and Russia for many of the recent cyberattacks on American government comput er networks.
Despite the friendly official meetings this week, signs of und erlying tensions lingered. On Tuesday, the American ambassador's car was surroun ded by protesters, apparently concerned about the island-sovereignty dispute wit h Japan, as it tried to enter the compound. The car, in which the ambassador, Ga ry Locke, was riding, was quickly freed by Chinese police officers and entered t he embassy.
''It was all over in a matter of minutes,'' Mr. Locke told rep orters traveling with Mr. Panetta. ''I never felt in any danger.''
While in Beijing, Pentagon officials also announced an accord on an issue that has vexed Washington's relations with Tokyo, where Mr. Panetta visited earlier this week.
Residents on the Japanese island of Okinawa had protested the deployment of the Marine Corps tilt-rotor troop transport called the Osprey, which has had a series of crashes. It had arrived in Okinawa but had been ordered not to fly. That ban has now been lifted and the Ospreys can fly, the officials said. But it was not clear how the deal would affect tensions on Okinawa.

HEADLINE: On Air and Before Audiences, Romney Makes Push f or Hispanic Vote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Julia Preston contributed reporting f rom New York.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Mitt Romney, hunting for an electoral edge in swing states, is intensifying his push for Hispanic voters, ratcheting up his Spanish- language advertising, deploying a Spanish-speaking son to court Latino leaders a nd putting himself in front of a growing number of Hispanic audiences.
It is an uphill climb, with polls showing that President Obama holds a commanding lead among Latino voters, just as he did four years ago. But as Mr. Romney tries to build political momentum in the dwindling weeks of the campaign, aides said they viewed Hispanics, whose unemployment numbers remain higher than that of the gen eral population, as a potentially decisive constituency in states like Florida, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Romney brought his conspicuous outreach to Miami, where he participated in a candidate forum h osted by Univision, the dominant Spanish-language television network in the coun try, and attended a late night ''Juntos con Romney'' (''Together With Romney'') rally.
Greeting the forum's hosts briefly in Spanish, Mr. Romney expressed alarm over the economic struggles of Hispanic Americans and portrayed Mr. Obama as having failed to improve their circumstances.
''I am concerned about th e fact that we have gone for over 50 months with unemployment above 10 percent a mong Hispanic Americans,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I am concerned about the fact that so many young Hispanic Americans drop out of high school, don't get the kind of education they need for the skills that they have to have for tomorrow.''
Some of his most intriguing remarks, though, were not about Hispanics, but abou t gay and lesbian couples. In response to a question, he said that they should b e able to ''raise a family as they would choose.'' In the past, he has sought to avoid discussing issues like adoption by gay parents, which many social and rel igious conservatives oppose.
Asked what advice he would give his children and grandchildren if they were gay and wished to marry, Mr. Romney replied: ''We ll, my kids are all married, so I'd be surprised,'' before reiterating that he b elieves that marriage should be reserved for heterosexual couples.
Mr. Rom ney's brutal primary campaign at times put him at odds with quarters of the Hisp anic community, a fact that the hosts of the Univision forum did not shy from. T hey posed pointed questions about illegal immigrants and whether the Spanish lan guage has a place in American life. (''Spanish,'' Mr. Romney said, quoting a fri end, ''is the language of our heritage. English is the language of opportunity.' ')
Despite repeated inquiries, Mr. Romney avoided saying whether he would c ontinue a program to suspend deportations of young illegal immigrants announced in June by Mr. Obama. Instead he accused the president of using immigration as a ''political football,'' and he returned to a promise to ''put in place a perman ent solution'' to illegal immigration.
Pressed for details, Mr. Romney said again that he would support giving legal permanent residence to illegal immigra nts who serve in the military. But he also suggested he would support another bi g piece of a bill in Congress known as the Dream Act. ''Kids that get higher edu cation could get permanent residence,'' Mr. Romney said, in what appeared to be another step away from his position during the nominating contests, when he said he opposed the Dream Act.
Mr. Romney rejected mass deportation of illegal immigrants, but he sidestepped a question about whether he still supported enco uraging ''self-deportation'' -- encouraging such immigrants to leave the country by strictly enforcing immigration rules, a position he has advocated before.<PA > ''We are not going to round up people around the country and deport them,'' h e said. ''Our system is not to deport people.''
Aides to Mr. Romney said th at they are devoting significant resources to the Hispanic vote. They have quiet ly built up a sizable staff of operatives around the country, including 13 paid workers in Florida alone, a state with a large and politically engaged populatio n of Hispanics.
After lagging well behind Mr. Obama in spending on Spanish -language advertising for months, Mr. Romney has started to catch up in a few ma rkets like Miami. Between mid-April and mid-September, Mr. Romney and the Republ ican National Committee spent $1.8 million on such ads in the Miami area, just a hair below what Mr. Obama spent during that period, according to Kantar Media, which tracks television advertising nationwide.
Still, Mr. Obama has signif icantly outgunned Mr. Romney nationally, devoting nearly twice as much money on Spanish-language commercials.
Alberto Martinez, an adviser, said the Romne y campaign was organizing ''the most aggressive Hispanic outreach of any Republi can presidential campaign.''
''We are playing in a lot more states than man y Republican presidential candidates have done,'' he said.
But a national poll of likely voters, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and t he Press, found that 72 percent of Hispanics intended to support Mr. Obama, comp ared with 22 percent for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney has acknowledged that disad vantage. But during a rally on Wednesday night in Miami, surrounded by Spanish s igns and introduced by his son Craig in Spanish, he argued that the Republican P arty had earned the affections of Hispanic voters.
''This party,'' he said , ''is the natural home for Hispanic-Americans.''

HEADLINE: Underemployed and Overlooked, Struggling Young Ad ults Are a Question Mark

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Robbie Brown contributed reporti ng from Atlanta, Dan Frosch from Denver and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
OR LANDO, Fla. -- Millions of struggling working-class young adults, many in battle ground states like Florida, Colorado and Wisconsin, are up for grabs in this ele ction, making up what experts call one of the most potentially powerful but ofte n overlooked voting blocs.
Voter turnout efforts tend to focus on university campuses and young professionals who have time and money to spend on campaigns. But in several tossup states this year, legions of eligible voters are young, jo bless or underemployed, and lacking in formal education beyond high school. Unde cided between the presidential candidates, and often discouraged, they are offer ing openings for both parties to make gains, experts say.
''Wha t we know about non-college young voters is that they are tied to neither party, and they are far more independent than anything,'' said Jefrey Pollock, preside nt of the Global Strategy Group, a polling firm for Priorities USA Action, the ' 'super PAC'' that supports President Obama.
Across the country, roughly 18 million young adults -- more than 40 percent of eligible voters 18 to 29 -- do not have, and are not now pursuing, college degrees. And their unemployment rate is more than twice that of their college-educated peers. 
The Obama and Rom ney campaigns are working to tailor messages to this group, one of the most chal lenging to get to the polls. The largest segment is white, and polls suggest it favors the conservative fiscal stances of Republicans. But among young adults in general, who tend to be socially liberal, Democrats could have the upper hand.< PA> Matt Ely, 25, who works two restaurant jobs as a server and a cook in Green Bay, Wis., laments that even after a 53-hour workweek, he still lives ''paychec k to paycheck.'' Mr. Ely had enrolled in technical college, but toward the end o f his program it did not seem likely that he would find a job, so he dropped out to save tuition money.
He is opposed to the Republican plan for tax cuts for upper income earners, but does not think Democrats have good ideas, either. ''They're all a bunch of rich people that I really don't feel like care about me anyway,'' he said.
Mr. Ely's comments highlight one of the central complai nts expressed by young adults who are poor: that their concerns are neglected. < PA> A video that surfaced this week of Mitt Romney speaking critically at a pri vate fund-raiser of people who depend on government programs or who pay no feder al income tax seemed to reinforce that narrative. ''My job is not to worry about those people,'' Mr. Romney said of his campaign strategy.
How was that me ssage received by Mr. Ely, for instance? ''It was a really stupid thing to say,' ' he said. ''Definitely doesn't make him look any better in my eyes.''
Stil l, the Romney campaign is relying heavily on the Internet and social media to ma ke its pitch to financially distressed young adults, some of whom depend on gove rnment food stamps and unemployment checks.
''The Obama economy has created a lost generation,'' said Joshua Baca, the Romney campaign's national coalition s director. ''Hope is on the way. That's what we're saying. You're going to have a better opportunity to get a job and a college education and a better opportun ity to succeed if we elect Mitt Romney president.''
The Obama campaign is i nvesting in social media, too, and counting on its extensive ground operation to carry a message: ''President Obama is laying the foundation for long-term growt h of this generation,'' said Clo Ewing, a campaign spokeswoman, ''by expanding a ccess to quality, affordable health care for young people, investing in college and job training that ensures they're ready to succeed in the work force, and in vesting in a manufacturing and clean energy sector that's creating the jobs of t oday and tomorrow.''
Experts say that the segment of young working-class pe ople who are struggling may appear disengaged, but that they are also highly per suadable. ''Extensive research shows that if you ask young people to volunteer o r vote, they respond at high rates,'' said Peter Levine, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts Universit y.
In a report released in August, researchers from the center found that t he most important factor in explaining low levels of civic participation may not be apathy but merely ''an absence of opportunity and recruitment.'' The report suggested that being ''personally and explicitly asked'' is perhaps the most imp ortant catalyst that motivates young people without college degrees to take poli tical action.
Yasmin Kenny, a Florida resident, said she intended to vote f or the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. Ms. Kenny said she had studied democra cy in college, before she had to leave for financial reasons. She described hers elf as ''homeless-ish,'' because all her possessions are in boxes and she sleeps wherever relatives will give her space.
Still, Ms. Kenny, 28, who earns $ 4.65 an hour as a server at a catering company in Tampa, suggested that she coul d be open to persuasion from the major campaigns.
''Who's talking about po or people? About working people?'' she said. ''I hear people say we have a probl em with youth apathy. It's not a matter of apathy, to me. It's a matter of youth recognition that the options are not sufficient.''
Matthew Pastrana, who l ost his stockroom job, his Toyota and the apartment he shared in Orlando last ye ar, recounted the many exhausting hours spent walking along highways because he could not always afford the luxury of catching a bus.
He is not sure whom he will vote for, if he votes at all.
''I got my own worries to think abou t,'' said Mr. Pastrana, who is 21.
The director of the charity where Mr. Pa strana turned for help, the Community Food and Outreach Center, said he saw many young people in crisis. ''The economics they face dominate their political view s, but they're conflicted,'' said Andrae Bailey, the director. ''They don't know if it's Obama's politics that failed them, or if it's the Republican conservati ve platform that they're told led to the recession. When the 20-somethings figur e out who to blame, that's going to shift the electorate for years to come.'' <P A> Shaun Clancy, an unemployed 29-year-old in DuBois, Pa., had a theater schola rship, but even with tuition help he could not afford books and housing and left college. His unemployment benefits were extended this year, which makes him thi nk about possibly voting for Mr. Obama.
''Some of us are working our rear s off trying to make something of ourselves,'' he said, ''and in this economy, i t's really hard.''
At a recent jobs fair in Atlanta, Latasha Kelly, 22, sai d she was distressed by the hundreds of people who also came out. Ms. Kelly drop ped out of college four years ago because she could not afford it. She has compl eted a city-sponsored job training program in customer service. If she is lucky, she says, she will find work at a store like Walmart.
Ms. Kelly thinks Mr . Obama shows compassion toward the poor. ''It's not like one man can find jobs for all these people,'' she said, surveying the crowd around her. ''But there's a lot the president can do.''
On the other hand, Anthony Gonzales, a 20-yea r-old from Denver who just found a job as a custodian after a long search, doubt s Mr. Obama ''has a lever to make things better or really bad.''
Still, Mr. Gonzales finds Mr. Obama more appealing on social issues like same-sex marriage . ''I like him,'' Mr. Gonzales said.
But, at the moment, he cannot help el ect Mr. Obama, no matter how much he likes him.
Mr. Gonzales has never reg istered to vote.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Turn Topic To Evils of Redistribution

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.

 BODY:
Amid t he fallout over Mitt Romney's comments that 47 percent of Americans believed the y were "victims" and are dependent upon government, the Republican Party is ste pping up attacks that President Obama favors redistributing wealth, citing a 199 8 audio clip of him saying, "I actually believe in redistribution."
The Repub lican National Committee released a video Wednesday that plays a carefully clipp ed audio segment containing the remark. The Romney campaign also seized on the q uote, with its campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, saying Mr. Romney "has a differen t idea" - "to foster growth and create wealth, not redistribute wealth, if our economy is to grow the way it has in the past." 
Part of the re cording, though, might surprise critics who believe Mr. Obama has an unalloyed l ove of government largess: He also suggested in his comments that he agreed, at least to some degree, with attacks on "the possibility of government action and its efficacy."
"I think some of it has been deserved," Mr. Obama said, citi ng poor policymaking at the Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago public schools .
Moments later, Mr. Obama, then a state senator speaking at Loyola Univers ity in Chicago, uttered the words Republicans are using against him: "I think th e trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resourc es and hence facilitate some redistribution, because I actually believe in redis tribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot. "
But what still is unclear is precisely how the two candidates' views on r edistribution differ. Does Mr. Romney, for example, believe the current federal tax system is too redistributive? If yes, does that conflict with his assertion that his own tax proposal will retain the progressivity of the tax code?
An aide to Mr. Romney did not respond to those questions on Wednesday. Instead, th e aide repeated attacks on Mr. Obama's economic record and his "vision of a gov ernment-centered society" that includes redistributing wealth.
What is para doxical about the sudden focus on redistribution worries is it seems to ignore d ata that demonstrates that the nation has seen a significant redistribution of i ncomes over the past generation - from the poor and middle class to the rich, an d especially to the very rich - all while government policies have also become l ess redistributive over the same period.
According to the nonpartisan Congr essional Budget Office, in 1979, for example, 7.4 percent of after-tax income fl owed to the wealthiest one percent of the population, but by 2009 that figure ha d grown to 11.5 percent. (This rise came despite a stock market crash that decim ated portfolios of the wealthy at the tail end of the period surveyed: In 2007, the richest one percent had received 16.7 percent of income.)
Over the thre e decades the share of income received both by the poor and middle class fell. O nly the wealthiest one-fifth of Americans saw their share of after-tax income ri se, with gains concentrated among the richest five percent. In a report last yea r, the C.B.O. found most of the shift was due to trends in salaries, business in come, capital gains, pensions and other "market income."
But the C.B.O. als o noted that "government transfers and federal taxes became less redistributive. " Of course, the government continues to redistribute wealth, such as through pr ogressive income taxes: The more you make, the higher your bracket. But on Wedne sday, the Romney aide did not say whether Mr. Romney believes the current federa l tax system - or specific policies Mr. Obama has enacted - are too redistributi ve.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Do You Really Expect Your Business to Get You Through Retirement?

BYLINE: JOSH PATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: If so, you might want to consider these three strategies. 

 BODY:
I've been speaking with and working with private business owners for more than 15 years. Most owners have a dream of running their business for their working career, finding a buyer and then riding off into the sunset with no other planning.
Lately, I have been sensing that business is getting better, and I have been told that buyers are starting to make offers much richer than they were even last year. But before you decide to think about selling your business, you need to think through whether you can afford to sell your business. I encourage you to do the math carefully before you make the move to sell.
First, let's consider some bracing statistics about private businesses that come from the Census Bureau.

        
There are approximately 6 million private businesses that employ people in the United States.
        
Only about 300,000 of these businesses do more than $ 5 million in sales.
        
Only about 150,000 of these businesses do more than $10 million in sales.
        
Private businesses on average sell for between three and six times their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.
        
The average private business has an Ebitda that falls between 7 and 13 percent of annual revenue.
So, let's run the numbers on a simplified example. Suppose we take a business that has $10 million in revenue and an Ebitda of $1 million, or 10 percent. If this company is put up for sale, the transaction might look something like this:

        
Revenue: $10 million.
        
Ebitda: $1 million.
        
Sale price of 4.5 times Ebitda: $4.5 million.
        
Taxes and expenses on sale (35 percent): $1.575 million.
        
Net proceeds from sale: $2.925 million.
        
Pretax annual income available at 4 percent of invested proceeds: $117,000.
And there you see the conundrum that many business owners face when contemplating the sale of their businesses. Keep in mind that in this example, the owner - before the sale - had been enjoying $1 million of annual cash flow before interest, loan principal payments, capital investments and taxes. And this is one of the lucky few businesses in America that have annual revenue of $10 million, one of the top 2.5 percent. Does your business create more than $1 million in Ebitda? Are you in the top 2.5 percent?
If not, and if you are hoping that you might one day be able to leave your business, you might want to consider the following strategies:
 Start and fund a qualified retirement plan. I call this prefunding your buyout. While your business is creating significant cash flow, take $40,000 to $60,000 and put it in a qualified retirement plan. If you are able to get a 6 percent return and invest $50,000 a year for 20 years, you will generate a nest egg of approximately $1.8 million.
Qualified plans are complicated beasts. There is a great deal of customized design that can go into your plan. The people in the qualified plan world who are experts at plan designs are called third party administrators. You will want to find one who understands the various options. Your accountant or investment adviser should be able to point you in the right direction.
In many cases you can tell your adviser how much money you want to save, and he or she can put together a plan that fits those parameters. I've seen business owners who got a late start save as much as $200,000 a year in their plan.
 Think about owning the real estate. If it's possible for you to purchase the real estate where your business operates, you should strongly consider this. Many business owners who own their own real estate end up selling the business but keeping the real estate and collecting rent.
Like a qualified retirement plan, starting early with real estate is important. Many owners will buy their business's real estate and pay rent to themselves for 15 years to pay off the mortgage. After the mortgage is paid off, the rent flows to the business owner. Sometimes, the income from the rent is more than the income from the principal on the sale of the business.
 Do a financial plan first. I have seen business owners sell their businesses, think they are going to retire and then find out four or five years later that they have to go to work for someone else. These owners often wind up with seller's remorse. They wish they didn't sell their business after all.
Doing the financial plan can help you figure out your financial needs before you start to plan the sale of your business. And advanced planning while you have strong cash flow can help you avoid the mistake of assuming that selling your business, even for millions of dollars, will cover all of your retirement needs. Once you sell your business, you don't want that assumption to come back and bite you.
Have you thought about what it's going to take for you to leave your business?

HEADLINE: Poetry Pairing | 'I Hear America Singing'

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: This week's Poetry Pairing matches Walt Whitman's poem "I Hear America Singing" with "Occupy Wall Street: A Frenzy That Fizzled," a DealBook column that assessed the impact of the Occupy movement one year after it started. 

 BODY:
This week's Poetry Pairing matches Walt Whitman's timeless poem "I Hear America Singing" with "Occupy Wall Street: A Frenzy That Fizzled," a DealBook column that assessed the impact of the Occupy Wall Street movement on its first anniversary.
After reading the poem and column, tell us what you think - or suggest other Times content that could be matched with the poem instead.
 Poem 
 As June Jordan put it, "As Shakespeare is to England, Dante to Italy, Tolstoy to Russia, Goethe to Germany, Aghostino Neto to Angola, Pablo Neruda to Chile, Mao-Tse-Tung to China, and Ho Chi Minh to Vietnam, who is the great American writer, the distinctively American poet, the giant American 'literatus?' Undoubtedly, the answer will be Walt Whitman." His poem, "I Hear America Singing," appeared in Leaves of Grass: 
 I Hear America Singing 
By Walt Whitman
I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,
The wood-cutter's song, the ploughboy's on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,
The day what belongs to the day - at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.
 Times Selection Excerpt 
In the column "Occupy Wall Street: A Frenzy That Fizzled," Andrew Ross Sorkin writes: 
It will be an asterisk in the history books, if it gets a mention at all.
A year ago this week, the Occupy Wall Street movement got under way in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. The loose group of protesters, frustrated by the economic downturn, sought to blame Wall Street and corporate America for many of the nation's ills.
While the movement's first days did not receive much news coverage, it soon turned into a media frenzy, with some columnists comparing its importance to that of the Arab Spring, which led to the overthrow of leaders in several Middle Eastern and African countries, spurred by social media. Images of the Wall Street protesters getting arrested were looped on news channels and featured on the covers of newspapers. Big banks - and the famous Charging Bull statue that is an icon of Wall Street - were fortified with barricades. By the end of the year, Time magazine had named the protester its Person of the Year, perhaps rightly given the revolutions taking place around the world, but the magazine also lumped Occupy Wall Street in among the many meaningful movements taking place.
But now, 12 months later, it can and should be said that Occupy Wall Street was - perhaps this is going to sound indelicate - a fad.
That is not to say that Occupy Wall Street had no impact. It created an important national conversation about economic inequality and upward mobility. The chant, "We are the 99 percent," has become part of the lexicon. Its message has subtly been woven throughout the Obama administration's re-election campaign, in the Democrats' position on everything from taxes on the highest earners to the soaring levels of student debt.

HEADLINE: Some New Math for Romney

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: The new language, which Mr. Romney has never before used on the campaign trail, is an attempt to take the sting out of secretly recorded remarks that he made a fund-raiser in May, about how 47 percent of Americans see themselves as "victims" dependent on government help. 

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. - Forget the 47 percent: Mitt Romney is now tossing in the remaining 53.
On Wednesday night, during a candidate forum in Miami, Mr. Romney repeatedly said that his campaign "is about the 100 percent in America."
The new language, which Mr. Romney has never before used on the campaign trail, is an attempt to take the sting out of secretly recorded remarks that he made a fund-raiser in May, about how 47 percent of Americans see themselves as "victims" dependent on government help. "My campaign is about the 100 percent in America," Mr. Romney said.
It represents a change in tone from earlier in the week, when Mr. Romney unapologetically stood by what he had said during the fund-raiser, arguing that is was not much different from what he has said in public about the need to create an economy reliant on the free markets, not the government. Now, Mr. Romney is talking about the need to lift Americans out of poverty. 
During the candidate forum in Miami, Mr. Romney said, "This is a campaign about helping people who need help. And right now the people who are poor in this country need help getting out of poverty."
The 100 percent word (or, more accurately, number) choice is striking because it evokes the numerical identity politics that took root during the Occupy Wall Street movement this year. Protesters adopted the phrase The 99 percent, suggesting that they wanted to take back the country from the wealthiest 1 percent, of which Mr. Romney is a member.
Even as Mr. Romney aims to be a president for 100 percent of the country, he conceded that he is not likely to win all their hearts.
"I know that I am not going to get 100 percent of the vote," he said on Wednesday night.

HEADLINE: Revisiting a Lunch at Perilous Heights

BYLINE: JESSE NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's been 80 years since someone took that iconic photo of men having a vertiginous lunch high above Manhattan, and it's still not certain who that someone was. 

 BODY:
It is a defining image of New York City's history, one that captured the essence of an era, even if it was, in part, a staged scene. On a warm autumn day in 1932, 11 workmen sat perched on a steel girder at Rockefeller Center, smoking, eating sandwiches and reading the newspaper some 800 feet up in the air. Nearby, a camera's shutter clicked: think men in overalls and flat caps, and boots dangling above the rooftops of Midtown Manhattan. The moment captured in black and white was both heroic and mundane. It was a triumph for the city in the throes of economic crisis and has become one of the most famous images in the world.
Today is the 80th anniversary of that photograph, and judging by the bumper crop of framed prints that hang in restaurant washrooms in New York alone, the image remains as popular as ever. Since it was published in The New York Herald Tribune, the photograph has been enlarged to fit a poster, shrunk to note card-size and colored in shades of red and blue. (The black-and-white print is available in The New York Times online store.) Stranger mutations exist too: there is a pickup that drives through the city with a sculptural recreation of the photo rising from its bed, and a picture of someone's Lego reconstruction circulates on the Internet.
"The image has averaged about 100 sales a month over the last 10 years," said Ken Johnston, director of historical photography for Corbis Images, the stock agency that owns the photograph. "This is extremely high."
Oddly enough, for such a legendary photograph from such a celebrated city, we don't know very much about it. We know that it was taken on the 69th floor of the RCA Building (later renamed the GE Building), as construction of the towering Art Deco skyscraper was nearing completion. Beyond that, little is certain. Although the photograph was originally dated Sept. 29, recent discoveries suggest that it was actually taken nine days earlier.
The identities of the men seated on the steel crossbeam are also a mystery. Over the years, countless people have staked claims, Johnston said, but few have had any merit. "So many people say, 'That was my uncle,' " he said. "But no one has ever said anything definitive about who these guys are."
There has been considerable debate about the author of the photograph too. Eight decades ago, "Lunch Atop a Skyscraper," as the image is commonly referred to, was published anonymously. Many thought it was the work of the renowned photographer Lewis Hines, but that wasn't true. In recent years, it has been attributed to a photographer named Charles C. Ebbets. But according to Johnston, Ebbets was one of several photographers atop the RCA Building that day, and he can't be sure who shot which pictures.
There were other images taken in the sky at Rockefeller Center, few of which bear a photographer's name. One picture, of workmen napping precariously on the crossbeam (Slide 5), was shot the same day. Another, of two men lighting their cigarettes in front of the Empire State Building's pinnacle, (Slide 2) was taken several months later.
"It's very common in old news archives that images are not credited," Johnston said. "Photographers were thought of as the guys who ran the machine. The camera was considered a documentary tool, not a paintbrush."
The photograph's original glass-plate negative - the kind used in cameras before plastic film - is part of the Bettmann Archive, a collection of 11 million historical images owned by Corbis. It is stored in a refrigerated cave in western Pennsylvania, encased in cool limestone bedrock to prevent it from rotting and decaying. Despite efforts to preserve the delicate artifact, the negative has seen better days. Years ago, a bite-size chunk went missing from its upper left-hand corner. Then it was dropped, and the glass splintered into five pieces.
As with many iconic photographs, attempts are under way to piece together the origins of "Lunch Atop a Skyscraper," the latest of which is a documentary film called "Men at Lunch," which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival.
But today, on the photograph's anniversary, it is easy enough to put aside questions about what we don't know and appreciate the image for what it is: a fixed part of the story that New York City tells about itself, about industrialization and immigration, resilience and ambition, hard work and high hopes. Eighty years ago today, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover were competing for the United States presidency. The Great Depression was in full swing, Europe was struggling to recover from World War I and Adolf Hitler was leading the Nazis to power in Germany. With all that going on, what's better than a sandwich and a smoke, high above the throng?

HEADLINE: New York State Leads in Income Inequality

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Wyoming has the most evenly distributed income, according to a new report from the Census Bureau. 

 BODY:
Of all American states, New York again has the most unequal income distribution, according to a new report from the Census Bureau. Wyoming has the most equitably distributed income.
Income inequality is measured by the Gini index, which runs from zero to one. A zero represents a society where income is distributed exactly proportionally among every household. A one indicates maximum inequality, where one household has all the income and all the others have none.
The Gini index value for the United States in 2011 was 0.475, higher than it was in 2010 at 0.469. The index rose in 20 states last year (including New York); there was no statistically significant change in the rest of the states and the District of Columbia (which, at 0.534, has a higher index value than any state).
The Gini index value for New York State was 0.503, which means the state's household incomes are about as equally distributed as those in Costa Rica, at least according to the most recent international data available.
The report also looked at median household incomes across the states, which showed great inequality among states as well as within them. The median household income ranged from a low of $36,919 in Mississippi to a high of $70,004 in Maryland.
As previously reported, the national median income fell from 2010 to 2011. There was only one state in which it rose a statistically significant amount, after adjusting for inflation: Vermont, where the median household income was $52,776 in 2011 after having been $50,707 in 2010.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Agency Expands Eastward

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Sequence's new offices are at 337 Broome Street at the Bowery, and it will start with about a dozen employees. 

 BODY:
An innovative agency that works on brand strategy and design assignments, from advertising to app-building, for a blue-chip list of clients like Apple, Chipotle, Walt Disney, Food Network and Google is expanding for the first time outside its home base of San Francisco by opening an office in New York.
The agency, Sequence, is opening in New York with about a dozen employees at 337 Broome Street at the Bowery. Sequence has 50 employees at its headquarters in San Francisco.
The agency hopes to double the size of its New York payroll by the end of next year, Jashojit Roy, chief executive of Sequence, who is known as Jojo, said in an interview before a party Thursday evening to celebrate the opening of the office.
For Chipotle, Sequence has handled tasks that include brand positioning, logo design, digital work and even writing the funny sayings on the bags and cups the food and beverages go inside.
"We're not a traditional ad agency or a digital shop," said Seth Bain, president of Sequence, who joined Mr. Roy for the interview.
"The business has taken a pivot since the introduction of the iPhone and the iPad," Mr. Bain said, and agencies need to concentrate less on traditional tasks and more on "building brand experiences that are useful, usable and delightful" for consumers.
The largest clients in the Sequence New York office will be Chipotle and the Food Network cable channel, Mr. Bain said, and the office will also be working for WebMD. He and Mr. Roy are in discussions with potential clients as well, he added.
Other clients of Sequence handled from the San Francisco headquarters include Best Buy, Chevron, OpenTable and Peet's Coffee and Tea.

HEADLINE: City's Jobless Rate Dips for First Time in Months

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The drop to 9.9 percent in August from 10 percent in June and July was accompanied by positive news about employment losses that are normal at the end of the summer. 

 BODY:
 New York City's unemployment rate dropped to 9.9 percent in August, the first decline in four months, as employers shed fewer jobs than they usually do at the end of the summer, the State Labor Department reported late Thursday.
 The jobless rate had continued to rise through the year despite steady gains in employment, confounding economists and frustrating city officials. In August, those trends appeared to be ending: The unemployment rate declined from 10 percent in June and July, though the number of jobs - before adjustments for the usual seasonal fluctuations - actually fell.
 James Brown, principal economist with the Labor Department, said the return of several thousand utility workers from a lockout by Consolidated Edison in July contributed to the "better-than-average showing." 
 Over the past 12 months, employment in the city's private sector has grown by 2.9 percent, much faster than the 1.8 percent rate for the entire state and the nation, the department said. Indeed, the city has accounted for more than 93,000 of the 132,600 private-sector jobs added in the state in the last year.
 State officials said New York had regained all of the jobs it lost during the recession, which officially ended in June 2009. The city has long since added back all of the jobs it lost during the recession, a fact that made the rising unemployment rate so curious.
 The city's 9.9 percent rate still is higher than recorded for more than two years before this summer, the state's figures show. The national unemployment rate is 8.1 percent, even though the country has gained back fewer than half of the jobs it lost since the recession began in late 2007. 
 New Jersey's Labor Department reported earlier on Thursday that its statewide unemployment rate rose to a three-decade high of 9.9 percent in August, from 9.8 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes, Some Lawmakers Lobby to Change the Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In public letters and closed-door meetings, more than 100 lawmakers have appealed to the Federal Reserve and other authorities over the Volcker Rule, records show. 

 BODY:
As regulators put the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street, they remain entangled in a partisan fight over the overhaul.
In public letters and closed-door meetings, more than 100 lawmakers have lobbied the Federal Reserve and other authorities over the Volcker Rule, records show. The rule, intended to restrict banks from placing risky trades and investing with hedge funds, has drawn an outcry from Republicans who want to mute its effect and some Democrats who want to strengthen it.
The wrangling has been on display at public hearings and in letters posted on regulatory Web sites. Still, some lawmakers have applied pressure behind the scenes.
 Internal government documents provide a glimpse of one such lobbying effort last year, when an aide to Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, appealed to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.
The documents show a back-and-forth between the Fed's top lawyer and Mr. Brown's staff. "I have a very urgent request," Nathaniel Hoopes, Mr. Brown's aide, wrote in an April 2011 e-mail. Seeking to fine-tune an exemption, he argued that a broad range of bank customers should be allowed to invest with hedge funds under the Volcker Rule. "My boss has been hearing it from constituents," he added, referring to the rule's impact on Massachusetts-based financial firms.
In a first draft of the rule released last fall, regulators agreed with that broad definition.
In response to Mr. Hoopes's e-mail, the Fed's general counsel, Scott G. Alvarez, acknowledged that "there are many difficult issues raised by the Volcker Rule." In another e-mail, Mr. Alvarez encouraged Mr. Brown's office to publicly voice its concerns, according to interviews with government officials and the documents. The Fed initially released the documents to a Democratic aide who obtained them through a public records inquiry.
In a statement, the Fed said that it routinely "seeks comment from the public and all interested parties on our rule-makings and carefully evaluates and weighs each comment."
The Fed, like all regulators, provides feedback to lawmakers and has held several meetings with advocacy groups that support the Volcker Rule, including Americans for Financial Reform.
Still, the e-mails - while not improper or unusual - show that such discussions are not always public. The exchange with Mr. Hoopes came months before regulators opened a public comment period or even publicly released a draft version of the Volcker Rule.
The e-mails also indicate how, even after passing the Dodd-Frank Act, some lawmakers are still tinkering with its machinery.
Mr. Hoopes, who previously worked for an arm of Lehman Brothers, also pressed his case with the Treasury Department. In an e-mail to a Treasury official, he said, "This should be very simple and straightforward and I think the Fed is over-complicating it."(The Boston Globefirst reported about the e-mail this summer.)
Mr. Brown, one of three Republicans to vote for Dodd-Frank, is in a tight re-election fight with Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat. She made her name in Washington as a fierce critic of Wall Street and supporter of changes like the Volcker Rule.
The partisan haggling over the rule affects a number of regulators. But much of the pressure has centered on the Fed, where some lawyers have questioned whether the rule is too burdensome for Wall Street, according to government officials briefed on the matter. Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the rule-writing process is private.
"The Volcker Rule regulations have unfortunately been long delayed, obviously in my mind because the agencies are having difficulties reaching agreement," said Michael Bradfield, the former general counsel at the Fed. "The well-known skepticism of some in the Fed about the workability of the Volcker Rule has undoubtedly contributed to this situation."
Few rules present a greater challenge - or have provoked more political squabbling - than this one. Named for Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman who campaigned for the rule, it aims to curb the sort of risk-taking that led to government bailouts in the financial crisis. The rule would largely prevent banks from making bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading. It would also limit how banks invest in hedge funds.
But a draft proposal, released last fall, granted several broad exemptions to the proprietary trading ban. Regulators recently entered a final stage of rule-writing after a group of lawyers from the Fed and other agencies ironed out concerns over several exemptions, according to people briefed on the matter. While regulators initially hoped to complete the rule by September, the people said, they now expect a final version around the November election.
Several Democrats, echoing the antibank animus of the election season, have pushed the Fed to narrow the Volcker Rule exemptions.
Some regulators have stepped up their focus on the rule, too.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is helping to write the overhaul, said in a letter to the Fed last week that certain exemptions would "significantly undercut the fundamental purposes of the rule."
Republican lawmakers counter that Dodd-Frank could jeopardize an already anemic economic recovery.
Mr. Brown, whose donors include major mutual funds like Fidelity, has been particularly vocal.
He supported the Volcker Rule after chipping away at one of its core tenets. During the debate on Capitol Hill, Mr. Brown championed an exemption that allowed banks to invest up to a 3 percent stake in hedge funds. Banks can also offer hedge fund investments to outside investors like pension funds.
Now, Mr. Brown is fighting over the details of the exemption. While Democrats want to restrict access to customers who already have an account with the bank, Mr. Brown wants to expand the definition of "qualified investors."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Brown said he was "proud to cast the deciding vote" for Dodd-Frank and that he worked "to protect Massachusetts jobs."
In his lobbying, Mr. Hoopes first appealed to the Treasury Department, but then took his concerns to the Fed. A "narrow definition," Mr. Hoopes warned in an April 2011 e-mail to the Fed, "was not intended for this purpose" and would shift money to unregulated pockets of the market.
In reply, Mr. Alvarez of the Fed suggested that Mr. Brown file a public comment letter. "Others have been commenting on various ways we should interpret the statute, and we would consider very carefully any comment from you as well," Mr. Alvarez wrote.
What happened next is unclear. While Mr. Hoopes had a brief phone call with the Fed, people briefed on the matter said, no one can recall specifics or whether Volcker was even discussed.
Mr. Hoopes soon filed a comment letter and thanked Mr. Alvarez "for all the quick responses to my questions, etc." It is unclear to what questions Mr. Hoopes was referring.

HEADLINE: Who Makes It Into the Middle Class

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A Brookings study sets benchmarks at stages of life that largely determine whether an individual will make it to the middle class by middle age. 

 BODY:
 9/24/12 | Updated to correct reference to Brookings definition of middle class. 
A new study by researchers at the Brookings Institution shows that about two in three Americans achieves a middle-class lifestyle by middle age - and delves deeply into who makes it there and how. 
Isabel V. Sawhill, Scott Winship and Kerry Searle Grannis tackled the question of why some children make it to the middle class and others do not, studying criteria that tend to be indicative of later economic success and examining how race, gender and family income come into play.
The study breaks life down into stages (for instance, adolescence) and gives benchmarks for each of those stages (in that case, graduation from high school with a grade-point average above 2.5, no criminal convictions and no involvement in a teenage pregnancy). 
They then studied children over time, analyzing whether they met those benchmarks and projecting whether they would make it to the middle class - with incomes at or above 300 percent of the poverty level - by age 40. (In 2011, a family of four would need annual income of $68,000 to qualify as middle class, Isabel Sawhill, one of the study's researchers, wrote in an e-mail. According to Census data, in 2009, about half of Americans had incomes above 300 percent of the poverty line.)
Unsurprisingly, the researchers found that success seems to beget success - meeting each benchmark makes one more likely to meet the next. Moreover, the effect accumulates. A child who meets all the criteria from birth to adulthood has an 81 percent chance of being middle class. A child who meets none has only a 24 percent chance. 
(Notably, at each stage of life, a person who failed to meet the given criteria had as high as a 59 percent chance of meeting them in the next round.)
The researchers also found that a number of other factors significantly influenced a person's likelihood of making it to the middle class. 
Family wealth, for instance, matters a lot. The researchers show that children born to rich families have a 75 percent chance of being middle income or better by the time they reach their 40s. For children born to poor families, the chance is just 40 percent. 
Children from disadvantaged families are less likely to be ready for school at age 5, less likely to be competent elementary-school students, less likely to graduate from high school without a criminal record or a child, and so on. 
Race matters as well. About two in five black adolescents met the benchmark of graduating from high school with a decent grade point average, no children and no criminal record by the age of 19. About two in three white adolescents did. 
The researchers also compared boys' and girls' outcomes. They found that girls are more likely to meet the given benchmarks through childhood, but they lose ground later in life. Boys become as likely to meet the benchmarks as girls do by the time they are in their late 20s, and pull ahead by their 40s.

HEADLINE: Senate Forecast: What Has Gone Wrong for G.O.P. Candidates?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The Democrats' chances of controlling the Senate have increased to 79 percent in the forecast, up from 70 percent on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
The trend in the presidential race has been difficult to discern lately. President Obama has very probably gained ground since the conventions, but it's hard to say exactly how much, and how quickly his bounce is eroding.
There are no such ambiguities in the race for control of the Senate, however. Polls show key races shifting decisively toward the Democrats, with the Republican position deteriorating almost by the day.
Since we published our initial Senate forecast on Tuesday, Republicans have seen an additional decline in their standing in two major races. 
Two polls of Virginia published on Wednesday gave the Democrat, the former Gov. Tim Kaine, leads of 4 and 7 percentage points over the Republican, the former Senator George Allen. The FiveThirtyEight forecast model now gives Mr. Kaine roughly a 75 percent chance of winning the seat on the strength of the new polls, up from about 60 percent in Tuesday's forecast.

The other problematic state for Republicans is Wisconsin, where their candidate, the former Gov. Tommy Thompson, had once appeared to hold the advantage. 
Mr. Thompson's Democratic opponent, Representative Tammy Baldwin, had published an internal poll earlier this week showing her pulling into the lead. The FiveThirtyEight Senate and presidential forecasts do not use internal polls released directly by the campaigns, as they typically exaggerate their candidate's standing.
However, in this case, public polls have now confirmed that the race seems to have shifted. A poll by The New York Times, CBS News and Quinnipiac University showed Mrs. Baldwin having drawn into a tie with Mr. Thompson, after trailing him by 6 percentage points last month. 
A Marquette University poll, also published on Wednesday, showed a much sharper reversal, with Mrs. Baldwin going from a 9-point deficit to a 9-point lead. The Marquette poll appears to be a bit of an outlier -- it also had Mr. Obama leading in the presidential race in Wisconsin by a 14-point margin, a somewhat implausible figure. Nonetheless, the model now has Mrs. Baldwin as the slight favorite, with about a 60 percent chance of winning.
It would be only a modest exaggeration to say that it's been hard to find any strong Senate polls for Republicans in the past two or three weeks. Wednesday also brought bad news for Republicans in Massachusetts, where a fourth consecutive poll showed the Democrat Elizabeth Warren ahead of Senator Scott Brown; in Connecticut, where a poll gave the Democrat Chris Murphy a slight advantage over their candidate, Linda McMahon; and in Florida, where a Fox News poll gave the Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson a 14-point lead.
One exception has been in Maine, where two new polls on Wednesday showed a deterioration in the standing of the independent Angus King, who would probably caucus with the Democrats, at the expense of both the Republican, Secretary of State Charles Summers, and the Democrat, State Senator Cynthia Dill. The model now gives Mr. King an 84 percent chance of winning, Mr. Summers 11 percent, and Mrs. Dill 5 percent.
But this is small compensation for the decline over the past two weeks of the Republicans' position in Virginia, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio, all of which have broken sharply to the Democrats.
The Democrats' chances of controlling the Senate have increased to 79 percent in the forecast, up from 70 percent on Tuesday. 
Had we run the model a month ago, based on polls through Aug. 19, the Democrats' chances of maintaining Senate control would have been listed at just 39 percent.
The velocity of the change is unusual. Although Senate races in different parts of the country can sometimes move in the same direction, there was never quite this rapid a shift in our Senate forecasts in 2008 or 2010. 
The forecast model is not doing anything particularly fancy; it's just that an overwhelming number of Senate polls recently have shown the Democratic candidates' standing improving.
Republicans could also have some reason to be concerned about Nevada, which has not been polled recently but where their candidate, the appointed Senator Dean Heller, maintains a slight advantage over the Democratic Representative Shelley Berkeley. Mr. Heller is a fairly strong candidate, but if there is some sort of national tide against Republicans, he could become the underdog in that race as well.
There's one comforting thought for Republicans, however. It's plausible that at least some of the Democrats' gains reflect a boost from their convention, which could wear off. I have not studied whether conventions produce bounces in Congressional races and the model makes no assumptions about it, but it is a reasonable hypothesis.
However, at least some of the shift appeared to predate the conventions. The model would have had Democrats' chances of retaining the Senate improving to 50 percent from 39 percent over the course of the week beginning Aug. 19, before the Republican convention started.
I can think of two major theories to explain why the shift is occurring, one focused on Mitt Romney, and another on the overall positioning of the Republican brand.
 Theory No. 1: Is Romney a Downballot Drag? 
Polls show that Mr. Romney has middling personal favorability ratings but that many voters will choose him anyway because of the deteriorating economy. 
Senate races, however, are less dictated by national economic conditions. Instead, they often turn more on the strengths and weaknesses of the individual candidates, and then by their stances on fiscal and social policy.
Mr. Romney has not dictated much in the way of detailed programs in these areas, and some of the policy stances that he has articulated are unpopular.
Mr. Romney has also been less able to campaign effectively against an unpopular Democratic initiative, the Democrats' health care bill, because he passed a similar bill as governor of Massachusetts.
Finally, some voters who disapprove of Mr. Obama, but who also have lukewarm feelings toward Mr. Romney, might lean toward voting Democrat for Senate in effort to ensure divided government, especially since Republicans also have control of the House.
 Theory No. 2: G.O.P. Conservatism Is Hurting 
An alternative hypothesis is that the shift has to do with overall perceptions of the Republican platform. 
Our research has shown that statistical measures of candidate ideology are a reasonably powerful predictor of the outcome of Senate races, with candidates who are rated as holding "extreme" views performing poorly. 
But in practice, ideology is in large part perceptual for voters, and may depend on which issues seem most salient at any given time. 
August, at which point the shift toward Democrats in Senate races appeared to begin, was dominated by two major news items: Mr. Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate, who has very conservative views on fiscal policy, and by the comments about rape made by the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, Todd Akin, which may have reinforced the idea that Republicans hold very conservative positions on social issues.
These factors may have made it harder for Republicans to position themselves toward the ideological center. And in several states, including Missouri, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, Republicans nominated sub-optimally conservative candidates.
More moderate Republican candidates, like Mr. Brown of Massachusetts and Mrs. McMahon of Connecticut, have increasingly sought to distance themselves from the national Republican brand, and sometimes also from the Republican presidential ticket.
Some of these theories are speculative, to be sure. A large number of Senate races remain in play: of the several states in which there has been a shift against Republicans in the polls in recent weeks, perhaps only Florida seems completely lost.
But if the trend continues, the question may no longer be whether Republicans can win the Senate -- but how vulnerable they are to losing the House.

HEADLINE: Restoring the Legitimacy of the Fed

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve could quiet critics on both the left and the right with forceful action to raise capital standards for large banks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The Federal Reserve has a legitimacy problem. Fortunately, a potential policy shift is available that offers both the right thing for the Fed to do and a way to please sensible people on both sides of the political spectrum.
 As the election season progresses, Republican politicians are increasingly criticizing the monetary policy of Ben Bernanke and his colleagues on the grounds that they are exceeding their authority, particularly by buying assets and trying to lower interest rates in what is known as "quantitative easing." 
There is growing concern in Republican circles that the Fed is tipping the election toward President Obama, and Mitt Romney repeated unambiguously in August that he would not reappoint Mr. Bernanke (a Republican originally appointed by President George W. Bush).
At the same time, a significant number of people on the left of American politics are concerned about how the Fed acted in the period leading up to the crisis of 2008 - blaming it for a significant failure of regulation and supervision - and about how much support it currently provides to big banks. 
If the right and the left were ever to come together on this issue, they might enact legal changes that would reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve, making it more subject to Congressional pressures. At the very least, the implicit buffers that protect the Fed from political interference could easily weaken, depending on the outcome of the November election.

The Fed has no special constitutional protection, from either the original Constitution or any subsequent amendment. The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 by an act of Congress and its mandate, functions and authority have been amended by Congress over the years. Most recently, some small but potentially significant changes were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial legislation in 2010. 
The Fed has been unpopular before, most notably when under Paul A. Volcker, its chairman, it tightened monetary policy to bring down inflation in the early 1980s. And some tension is built into the very objectives of the organization. Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, now reads:
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates.
(This so-called dual mandate came from the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, sometimes known as the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation. This language was not in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 or the 1946 Employment Act). 
Most of the previous political concerns were from the left of the political spectrum and concerned whether the Fed placed too much weight on low inflation and not enough weight on achieving a high level of employment. Strong voices from the left currently assert that Mr. Bernanke's team should have done more, earlier and faster, to speed the economic recovery.
But now the brunt of the attack comes from the right, where trouble for the Fed has been brewing for some time.
Open season on the Fed was declared last year by Rick Perry, governor of Texas and then a Republican presidential candidate. On the campaign trail in summer 2011, he remarked memorably: 
If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I don't know what you all would do to him in Iowa, but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas. Printing more money to play politics at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous - treasonous, in my opinion.
Mr. Perry was picking up on longstanding themes from that part of the Republican right that feels the very existence of the Federal Reserve undermines the Republic. Ron Paul's book on the subject is titled "End the Fed." Mr. Paul is sometimes regarded as a fringe figure, but anti-Fed sentiment is no longer a marginal view within the Republican Party - see, for example, the range of voices quoted by Politico last week.
(Mr. Paul's and, to some extent, Governor Perry's intellectual predecessor was Wright Patman, a populist Democrat from Texas who served in the House for almost 50 years and was a regular bête noire of Fed chairmen. In one hearing on the Fed's monetary policy, for example, Mr. Patman opened the session by caustically asking the chairman, Arthur Burns, "Can you give me any reason why you should not be in the penitentiary?" Mr. Patman, it should be noted, was described by the historian Robert Caro as to the left of Lyndon B. Johnson.)
Fortunately there is a way for the Fed to reaffirm its legitimacy: the Board of Governors should strengthen capital requirements for the largest United States banks and other systemically important financial institutions. Ideally it should move policy in a direction that is responsible and that would be welcomed on both sides of the political spectrum.
The best way to do this would be to increase capital requirements for very large banks and other financial institutions that the Fed deems to be systemically important. Both sides of the aisle increasingly show some understanding that higher capital requirements for megabanks would make them generally safer and more resilient in the face of really big unusual shocks - and therefore reduce the degree of public subsidy they receive, implicitly, because they are too big to fail (and therefore able to get support, when needed, from the Fed). 
(The Dodd-Frank Act constrained the ability of the Fed to help individual financial institutions, but in my assessment left the door open to various kinds of broader assistance to classes of assets or groups of companies - either through the Fed discount window for lending to banks or through some mechanism to be specified later.)
The recent letter to Mr. Bernanke by Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana - which I wrote about recently - is a perfect example of the emerging cross-partisan consensus. In private, I hear strong voices from right and left echoing the sentiments of this letter.
The megabanks, naturally, are opposed. They contend that higher capital requirements would be bad for the economy. That is a myth, fully exploded by the Stanford professor Anat Admati and her colleagues (if you have not already seen their Web site, you should look at it now.)
The Fed has the ability and the opportunity to make a move on capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions - we are currently in a comment period that runs until Oct. 22 on exactly this issue. Higher requirements would make the financial system safer. They would also represent an important step toward rebuilding the political legitimacy of the Federal Reserve System.

HEADLINE: Banks' Risky Ways

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A prominent regulator had a dire prediction for the nation's big banks on Wednesday. | The chief executive of Goldman Sachs turns 58. | Libor has faced the most scrutiny, but other rates may be similarly vulnerable to rigging. | A excerpt of the new book by Sheila Bair. 

 BODY:
Banks' Risky Ways | A prominent regulator, Thomas M. Hoenig, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member who formerly ran the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, had a dire prediction for the nation's big banks on Wednesday. He said at the Exchequer Club in Washington, according to Bloomberg News:
"The behavior and practices leading to this crisis will soon reemerge and these highly complex, more vulnerable firms will have an even more devastating effect on the economy."
Mr. Hoenig has made the argument - one that recently was echoed by the former Citigroup boss Sanford I. Weill - that the government should reinstate a version of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial banks from investment banks.
A quirk of the tax code isn't helping matters, writes Jesse Eisinger in his column, The Trade. A "tax code distortion" encourages banks to gorge on debt, rather than equity. Mr. Eisinger writes:
"More debt not only makes companies more vulnerable to bankruptcy but also makes investors more susceptible to panics, when they withdraw their capital en masse."
Happy Birthday to Lloyd Blankfein! | The Goldman Sachs chief executive turns 58 today.
As Goldman welcomes a new chief financial officer, some analysts are wondering how the company will bolster its stock price. One possible strategy could be to cut back compensation, writes Lauren Tara LaCapra in a blog post on Reuters. Ms. LaCapra cites an unidentified "prominent investor" who says Goldman faces the "Lazard problem," in which employees expect to be paid a lot and will leave if they are not.
Dealing with regulators shouldn't be a problem for Goldman's new chief financial officer, Harvey M. Schwartz, according to Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman and current adviser to Goldman Sachs. Mr. Levitt told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. Schwartz's demeanor and sense of humor will "play well in Washington."
And in case anyone was wondering, Mr. Blankfein is not a socialist, but believes in the fair distribution of wealth, as he noted during a conversation on Wednesday with the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada.
Robert Rubin, Tortoise | Mr. Rubin, whose career at Goldman Sachs, the Treasury Department and Citigroup has taken him through the upper echelons of finance and government, resembles "an ancient Galapagos tortoise," as William D. Cohan writes in the Bloomberg Businessweek cover story. "Whatever nastiness politics or the global economy may throw at him, he abides." But the 74-year-old's record deserves some scrutiny, Mr. Cohan writes. When the economy collapsed, "due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything."
Betting on Housing | The real estate search site Trulia raised $102 million on Wednesday, surpassing expectations. As housing goes, so should Trulia. By that measure, the outlook looks decent. On Wednesday, data showed housing starts rising 2.3 percent in August and existing home sales jumping 7.8 percent.
Gaming the Rates | Amid a worldwide investigation into rate-rigging, Libor has faced the most scrutiny. But other rates may be similarly vulnerable. Bloomberg News reports on a confidential paper by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, which concludes that the "same lack of oversight that enabled traders to manipulate the London interbank offered rate plagues other benchmarks around the globe."
According to Bloomberg News, the paper says that fewer than half of benchmark rates surveyed in the United States, Europe and Asia "were based on actual transactions."

In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference kicks off at the Waldorf Astoria, featuring speakers like William E. Conway Jr. of the Carlyle Group, Richard A. Friedman of Goldman Sachs and Ted Schlein at Kleiner Perkins.
In Washington, the Senate Banking committee holds a hearing on high-frequency trading at 10 a.m. Dave Lauer, who quit his job last year at a high-speed trading firm in Chicago, is set to testify against the industry. The House Financial Services committee has a hearing on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at 10 a.m., with the agency's head, Richard Cordray, set to testify. The Senate Finance committee and the House Ways and Means committee have a hearing on the tax treatment of capital gains at 10 a.m.
Sheila Bair's New Book | Fortune has an excerpt of "Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street From Wall Street and Wall Street From Itself," the new book by Sheila Bair, who led the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis. In the passage, Ms. Bair describes a meeting where the Treasury secretary at the time, Henry M. Paulson Jr., persuaded bank chiefs to accept the bailout:
"Nine men stood milling around in the room, peremptorily summoned there by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Collectively, they headed financial institutions representing about $9 trillion in assets, or 70% of the U.S. financial system. I would be damned if I would let them see me shaking."
The Rich Get Richer | The past year has been kind to the wealthiest Americans, according to Forbes, which updated its ranking of billionaires on Wednesday. Warren E. Buffett, the country's second-richest man, is worth $46 billion as of September 2012, compared with $39 billion last year. Bill Gates, the richest of the rich, is now worth $66 billion, up from $59 billion last year.
At least one financier didn't fare so well. John A. Paulson, the hedge fund manager who has had a string of money-losing quarters, is now worth $11 billion, down from $15.5 billion last year.
Mitt Romney might have ranked among this elite crew, according to Bloomberg News. The Republican presidential candidate, who is worth a mere $250 million, left the private equity industry before the boom of the early 2000s. Bloomberg News says of Mr. Romney: "Had he stayed at Bain Capital LLC, he'd be worth more than $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index."
Pension Crisis in Chicago | It wasn't a prominent issue in the strike, but Chicago teachers face a looming financial problem, reports The New York Times's Mary Williams Walsh:
"The Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund has about $10 billion in assets, but is paying out more than $1 billion in benefits a year - much more than it has been taking in. That has forced it to sell investments, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to pay retired teachers. Experts say the fund could collapse within a few years unless something is done."

HEADLINE: Focusing Solely on Results, and Finding a $635 Million Budget Hole

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Because of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's impatience with process for a taxi program, the city's budget suddenly has a $635 million hole punched into it. 

 BODY:
 One of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's strengths is his impatience with process - pragmatism from a man who cares more about results than about the means used to achieve them.
 One of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's weaknesses is his impatience with process - pragmatism from a man who cares more about results than about the means used to achieve them.
 Mr. Bloomberg's weakness now overshadows his strength. Unfortunately, the ones who may suffer for that are New Yorkers. Because of this weakness, the city's budget suddenly has a $635 million hole punched into it, a gap that may widen over the next two years by another $825 million.
 This is one-time-only money that City Hall counted on from the anticipated sale of 2,000 new medallions for yellow taxis, part of a broader strategy to permit livery cabs to pick up street hails in the boroughs beyond Manhattan. A month ago, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan stopped the plan cold, with a rebuke of City Hall for not going about it the right way.
 In short, he ruled that process matters. A lot. 
 You may recall that Mr. Bloomberg - who perhaps should have been a football player, given his fondness for end runs - bypassed the City Council to put his taxi program in place. He figured, no doubt correctly, that he didn't stand a chance in the Council, many of whose members are showered with campaign cash from the yellow-cab industry.
 Instead, he ran to Albany, where he could count on many lawmakersto do his bidding, especially Republicans who had benefited mightily from his own showers of campaign money. To a man less interested in process than in results, the maneuver made eminent sense.
 Of course, you have to ask yourself why a lawmaker from, say, Cattaraugus County should get to decide if someone may hail a cab on Southern Boulevard in the Bronx. Good question. The judge, Arthur F. Engoron, wondered the same thing.
 He didn't buy the argument from city lawyers that Albany had a compelling interest in taxi operations on Southern Boulevard or anywhere else in the five boroughs. There was that pesky thing called process. Before state lawmakers could act, the judge said, the City Council should have asked them to intervene, by way of what is known as a "home-rule message." Absent that, he said, the entire law was "null and void."
 The price for ignoring process in this situation is high. All that municipal revenue anticipated from medallion sales, starting with the $635 million built into the current budget? Gone.
 The grim consequences for New Yorkers in potentially lost municipal services became clear the other day when the mayor's budget office directed city agenciesto figure out how to reduce spending by at least 5 percent this year and by even more next year. Asked if layoffs of city workers were possible, Mr. Bloomberg implied that they were. "Attrition doesn't work in a slow economy," he said.
 Process is often given the back of the mayor's hand when he finds that it's inconvenient.
 Do we really need to bring up term limits once again: the self-interested manner in which he and the City Council helped themselves to an extended stay in power by doing an end run around the twice-expressed will of the people? Polls showed that pretty much everyone in the city wanted Mr. Bloomberg to go back to the people on this issue by way of a new referendum. He waved them off as ideologues. The Council's extension of term limits, he said , was a case of "choosing substance over process and pragmatism over ideology." Never mind that the process at issue was what's called the democratic process.
 A graphic example of his disdain for process was on display in 2004 when his plan to end "social promotion" for failing third graders in public schools ran into trouble. The mayor didn't have the required approval of an advisory board, including some of his handpicked appointees, who had their doubts. So he simplyfired the balking members and replaced them with more compliant people.
 But now process has struck back, and unless an appeals court overrules Justice Engoron, the budget is in immediate peril.
 In all likelihood, something will be figured out. There is a process to do that, too.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Is Leaving Romney Campaign for Lobbying Post

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty is leaving the Romney campaign to take a job in Washington as a top lobbyist for a group representing banks and financial companies. 

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is resigning as a national co-chairman of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign to take a job in Washington as a top lobbyist for a group representing banks and financial companies.
Mr. Palwenty's new role as President and chief executive of theFinancial Services Roundtable was announced by the organization Thursday morning. In a statement, the group said that Mr. Pawlenty would step down from his role at Mr. Romney's campaign because the organization is bipartisan.
"My time in public service was rewarding and focused on achieving results," Mr. Pawlenty said in the statement. "I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, but I am now moving on and committed to focusing fully on this new opportunity."
In a statement issued by Mr. Romney's campaign, Mr. Pawlenty added: "My work with Mitt has been a privilege. Mitt Romney is a truly good man and great leader. As the campaign moves into the home stretch, he has my full support and continued faith in his vision and his policies."
Mr. Palwenty was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination last year but dropped out of the race early after a disappointing performance at the Iowa straw poll. He endorsed Mr. Romney early in the fall of 2011 and campaigned for him during the height of the primaries.
He was also on the short list to be Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate. But despite an aggressive campaigning effort by Mr. Pawlenty earlier this year, Mr. Romney passed him over in favor of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
In a brief interview at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., last month, Mr. Pawlenty played down his role on Mr. Romney's behalf.
"I'm just a volunteer,'' he told The Caucus, "so I've got other stuff I've got to do. So as my schedule allows, I'll go out and do surrogate speaking."
That "other stuff" apparently involved seeking the top job at the roundtable, an organization that seeks to shape federal regulations on behalf of about 100 major financial services companies. The group's Web site says that its mission is to "protect and promote the economic vitality and integrity of its members and the United States financial system." It has spent $4.7 million on lobbying in the first two quarters of this year.
The group says it seeks to achieve those goals through "legislative and regulatory advocacy; strong industry reputation of trust and confidence; and premier executive leadership forums."
In a statement, Mr. Romney praised Mr. Pawlenty as "a dear friend" who brought "energy, intelligence and tireless dedication to every enterprise in which he's ever been engaged."
Mr. Romney said that he regretted Mr. Pawlenty's need to step down from his campaign, but said that "his new position advancing the integrity of our financial system is vital to the future of our country. I congratulate him on his new position and wish him every success in carrying out his new mission."
Mr. Pawlenty will begin his new role on Nov. 1.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty to Become Wall Street Lobbyist

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota, was named chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable on Thursday, replacing Steve Bartlett. 

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty was hoping to spend plenty of time in the White House next year. Now, rather than living there, the onetime presidential contender will visit regularly as a top Wall Street lobbyist. 
Mr. Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota, was named chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable on Thursday. He will replace Steve Bartlett, also a former Republican lawmaker, who will retire from the Wall Street lobbying group later this year. 
"I'm excited about this new challenge," Mr. Pawlenty said in a statement. "Few industries have more impact on the entire economy - and on the lives of average Americans - than financial services."
 His appointment comes at a crucial moment for Wall Street, which is battling a regulatory overhaul in the wake of the financial crisis. Under the Dodd-Frank act, regulators are writing more than 300 new rules for banks and other financial firms. 
The deep-pocketed roundtable, which represents 100 of the nation's largest financial institutions, is looked to as a source of influence on the law. The group also helped spearhead several past deregulation efforts, including the repeal of some Glass-Steagall restrictions on banks owning insurance companies. 
Since the 2008 crisis prompted government bailouts of Wall Street, the roundtable has focused on fixing the industry's image problem. Mr. Bartlett, a former congressman and onetime mayor of Dallas known for his affable style and trademark ostrich leather cowboy boots, also became one of Wall Street's go-to lobbyists in the Dodd-Frank fight. 
"Our members have weathered the financial crisis and, now, Tim can help take us to the next level," Mr. Bartlett said in a statement. "His efforts to bridge political and policy divides will serve to enhance the reputation of the financial services industry with customers and policy makers."
Mr. Pawlenty will step down as national co-chair of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Mr. Pawlenty, whose name was mentioned on the short list of potential running mates for Mr. Romney, was likely to secure a post in a Republican administration. 
But he has sworn off politics, at least for now. "I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve," he said, "but I am now moving on and committed to focusing fully on this new opportunity."

HEADLINE: Would John Kerry Have Picked Samuel Alito?

BYLINE: LINCOLN CAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: If Mitt Romney's elected president, he could turn the Supreme Court decidedly conservative for another generation. 

 BODY:
The average retirement age of Supreme Court justices over the past generation is 80. While they have announced no plans to retire, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 79 and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy are 76. It is likely the next president will fill one or more seats. If Mitt Romney has the chance to replace Justice Ginsburg, that could turn the court decidedly conservative for another generation. If President Obama is re-elected and has the chance to replace Justice Scalia or Justice Kennedy, that could turn the court more moderate.
The Nation magazine has dedicated much of its new issue to what it calls "The 1 Percent Court" and why this election matters for what's arguably "the most powerful branch of government" in an era of political gridlock. "Does anyone think Barry Goldwater would have chosen Thurgood Marshall?," the introduction asks: "Or John Kerry, Samuel Alito?"

Conservative court-packing began a generation ago when Lewis Powell, then a corporate lawyer, later a justice, urged the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to focus on the Supreme Court in a campaign to re-take "the American economic system" for large corporations. The chamber's recent success along these lines has been stunning, helping persuade the justices to diminish access to the courts for the poor and middle class, and thwart class actions against corporate discrimination.
The Nation says the Roberts court "bulldozed the foundational understanding of the corporation that had governed American law for two centuries" with Citizens United, allowing CEOs "to reach into their corporate treasuries to bankroll campaigns promoting or opposing the election of candidates for Congress or president." In response to Justice Scalia's defense of this ruling as Jeffersonian, the magazine says, "One must charitably assume Scalia's utter ignorance of Jefferson's political philosophy and how much the Sage of Monticello feared the rise of a 'single and splendid government of an aristocracy, founded on banking institutions, and moneyed incorporations.'"
Voters may be chiefly concerned with the state of the economy, but the election is about more than that.

HEADLINE: Taylor Swift's Record Label Continues Its Online-Offline Royalties Experiment

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: The label, Big Machine, will be paid by Entercom Communications when its songs are played on the air in exchange for a getting lower rate for online streaming. It already has a similar deal with Clear Channel. 

 BODY:
Three months after the record company behind Taylor Swift signed a historic deal with Clear Channel Communications, establishing for the first time a royalty for labels and recording artists when their songs are played on the radio, the company has signed a similar deal with another broadcaster.
The label, Big Machine, announced at a radio industry conference in Dallas on Thursday that it had made an agreement with Entercom Communications, which operates more than 100 stations in 23 markets in the United States.
The label gave few details about the agreement, but as with the Clear Channel deal it will involve Entercom's paying the label a royalty derived from its advertising revenues when it plays Big Machine acts on the air; in exchange, Big Machine will be paid a lower royalty for online streams than the fees that govern most Internet and satellite radio, which are set by federal statute.
"This agreement represents a bold step forward to align our interests with those of Big Machine and their artists," David Field, Entercom's chief executive, said in a statement. "While the deal comes with some significant costs and risks, we believe that by working with the labels and the artist community to establish a new business model, we will ultimately enhance the opportunities for all parties concerned."
In an arrangement that has irked record companies for decades, terrestrial radio stations in the United States pay royalties only to songwriters and music publishers, not to the record companies that provide the music they play. Broadcasters have long argued that labels don't need to be paid a royalty because they benefit from the promotion of airplay, and despite many tries over the years, labels have been able to persuade Congress to change the law.
In June, Clear Channel broke with radio's longtime stance through its deal with Big Machine, an independent label whose other acts include country stars like Tim McGraw, Rascal Flatts and Reba McEntire. The reason was the economic challenges of online radio, which still represents a small fraction of radio listening but is growing fast.
Because of federal laws passed in the 1990s, online broadcasters have to pay performance royalties to labels and artists in addition to what they pay publishers. Those fees increase with every listener, and the sum can be very large. Pandora Media, for example -- which pays lower rates that traditional radio companies for online streams -- paid about half its revenue last year in performance royalties to labels and artists.
Since Big Machine is a small company, its deals with Clear Channel and Entercom will have little effect on the overall economics of radio. But if similar deals are adopted widely, they have the potential to reshape the industry.
"As great and leading visionaries in the broadcast world continue to look into the future they are seeing where listeners are going in regards to how radio is being used now and where and how it will be used in the very near future," Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine, said in the statement.
Whether other labels will follow suit is unclear. For them, the value of such deals depends on how much future digital revenue they would be giving up -- potentially a great deal -- in exchange for a new but most likely small revenue stream from radio.
Clear Channel has said it wants to make more such deals, but has not announced any others so far. At the conference in Dallas, Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, whose radio division owns 127 stations, indicated that his company was not interested in making any change to its royalty system.
"The idea that we have to pay them to put their music on our radio stations is absurd," Mr. Mooves said, according to an industry newsletter, RadioInfo.

HEADLINE: Waters Ethics Investigation Will Not Result in Formal Charges

BYLINE: ERIC LIPTON


HIGHLIGHT: A long-running ethics investigation of Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, will be resolved on Friday at a public hearing without formal charges of wrongdoing, two parties with direct knowledge of the matter said. 

 BODY:
A long-running ethics investigation of Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, will be resolved on Friday at a rare House Ethics Committee public hearing and two parties with direct knowledge of the matter said they expect it to conclude without formal charges of wrongdoing.
Ms. Waters, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, was accused of using her office in late 2008 to set up a meeting with top Treasury Department officials on behalf of a bank her husband owned stock in, at a time when the bank faced possible collapse because of the financial crisis.
 The investigation itself has been mired in controversy, after the House ethics committee's own chief counsel accused staff members in 2010 of sharing confidential details about the matter with Republicans, a violation of House rules.
The result was an extraordinary outside investigation by a former Justice Department prosecutor who was appointed first to see if the ethics committee itself had acted improperly before restarting a new inquiry into the allegations against Ms. Waters. 
This second investigation is complete and has been submitted to a new panel of House members appointed to review the evidence, two parties with direct knowledge of the case said.
 Typically, when the ethics committee holds a public hearing on an investigation, it means that the committee has turned up such evidence of wrongdoing, but the lawmaker has refused to accept a settlement, resulting in a hearing that serves, in effect, as a trial.
 That is a very rare step, which took place most recently in November 2010 to address charges against Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, and concluded with a finding that Mr. Rangel had violated House rules by accepting rent-stabilized apartments from a Manhattan developer and failing to pay income taxes on rent from a villa in the Dominican Republic, among other charges.
 But two parties with direct knowledge of the investigation said Friday's hearing on the new inquiry into Ms. Waters - led by the former federal prosecutor Billy Martin -- has concluded without a recommendation that Ms. Waters be sanctioned by the House for wrongdoing. The report could still include findings that she acted inappropriately or unwisely, without recommending that she be sanctioned. The hearing Friday would give Ms. Waters a chance to respond to such allegations in a public way.
 Ms. Waters has long defended her actions in late 2008, when she said she merely called then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and requested a meeting on behalf of an organization of minority-owned banks. During the first inquiry, House investigators suggested there was evidence of wrong-doing, as her meeting ended up focusing largely on a single bank - OneUnited, a minority-owned institution that her husband had served on the board of and at the time still owned stock in. OneUnited ultimately received bailout funds from Treasury.
The hearing Friday could mean an end to the ethics cloud Ms. Waters has been under since 2009, when the allegations about the meeting she requested with the Treasury Department were first reported in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
 An ethics committee spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on the matter. A spokesman for Ms. Waters said he could not discuss the details of Friday's hearing.

HEADLINE: Publicis Groupe Buys LBi, and Another Digital Ad Agency Is Swallowed Up

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: In the all-cash deal, Publicis spent about $540 million to buy the shares of LBi, an Amsterdam-based agency with about 2,200 employees. 

 BODY:
The mad dash by the world's largest advertising holding groups to beef up their digital assets continued on Thursday as the Publicis Groupe, based in Paris, announced it had acquired LBi, a big digital agency based in Amsterdam. In the all-cash deal, Publicis spent 416 million euros, or about $540 million, to buy the shares of LBi.
This purchase is latest in a series of acquisitions of digital agencies by Publicis; others include Digitas, Razorfish and Rosetta. Holding groups like Publicis, the Omnicom Group, WPP and the Interpublic Group of Companies are eager to increase their presence in the digital space as consumers and marketers increasingly clamor for all things digital.
There had been speculation in recent months that the Publicis Groupe and Omnicom had been closing in on LBi because LBi was among the few remaining big, independent digital agencies.
LBi has about 2,200 employees who work at 32 offices in 16 countries, including the United States. Marketer clients of LBi include Coca-Cola, Ikea, Johnson & Johnson and Volvo.
"The acquisition of LBi is another step forward in further strengthening our digital operations," Maurice Lévy, chairman and chief executive of the Publicis Groupe, said in a statement.
Luke Taylor, chief executive of LBi, said in a statement that being acquired would enable LBi to "accelerate our strategic plans aimed at providing clients with a globally integrated offering."
Among the other big digital agencies that have been acquired recently are AKQA, Big Fuel, Firstborn and Rosetta.

HEADLINE: China Becomes an Issue in the U.S. Campaign

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: The most consequential foreign policy initiative of Barack Obama's presidency could end being the shift of American focus from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to the Pacific Rim. 

 BODY:
President Obama's complex relationship with China began with hope and accommodation but fell into disillusionment after Beijing started flexing its muscles on trade and military questions and proved to be a truculent partner on a variety of global issues.
As Mr. Obama runs for re-election, his tougher line toward Beijing is showing itself on several fronts. The White House has filed two major cases in the past three months against China at the World Trade Organization, both of which Mr. Obama promoted to autoworkers in the Rust Belt. On the same day as the latest trade action, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced plans in Tokyo to help Japan deploy a new missile-defense system, which has aroused suspicion in Beijing.
With Mitt Romney charging that Mr. Obama has not stood up enough to Chinese leaders, China has suddenly become a focal point in the presidential campaign, one that encompasses both security and economic concerns and puts to the test the president's management of this complex relationship. 
The most consequential foreign policy initiative of Mr. Obama's presidency could end being the shift of American focus from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to the Pacific Rim, where the United States has shored up alliances with Japan and South Korea, opened the door to Myanmar, and sent Marines to Australia. While the new focus has rattled allies in Europe, the emergence of a counterweight to a rising China has been greeted with enthusiasm in Asia. 
As my colleagues Thom Shanker and Ian Johnson reported, Mr. Panetta said during his trip that the U.S. change in posture was not aimed at containing China.

HEADLINE: Why Presidents Love Foreign Affairs

BYLINE: DANIEL W. DREZNER


HIGHLIGHT: Because presidents are weak at home and exert their power abroad, voters should take foreign policy more seriously as a campaign issue. 

 BODY:
I'd like to apologize to American voters. I'm one of the 5 percent. The 5 percent, that is, who vote in presidential elections based on the foreign policy views of the candidates. It might seem to the other 95 percent of you that we pull the strings. At his taped fund-raiser, for example,Mitt Romney complained that the common folk weren't asking him enough foreign policy questions. It certainly must appear as if we control presidents once they're elected - after their first year in office, all we read about is that they're attending some fancy-pants summit meeting or using force somewhere exotic.
While I wish that this were true, the reality is a lot more complex. Really, those of us paying attention to foreign policy are trying to do the rest of you a favor. Maybe if some of you paid attention to the rest of the world as well, American presidents would be more cautious about expending blood and treasure abroad. That sounds crazy, but it's true.
I was being generous with the "5 percent" appellation. Poll after poll shows that when Americans are asked what they consider the most important issue in presidential campaigns, an overwhelming majority choose the economy. Answers related to foreign policy or national security typically yield between 3 and 5 percent.
Many pollsters don't even bother asking about international issues because it seems manifestly obvious that they're not terribly important. When pollsters prod Americans about their foreign policy views, the results are clear: they want the government to focus less on the rest of the world.
Politicians are not blind to these numbers. Short of a war or other violent attacks on American installations, foreign policy rarely takes center stage during presidential elections. Presidential candidates almost always campaign on how they intend to jump-start the economy.
It must be maddening to voters, then, that about a year or two after they are elected, presidents seem to devote an ever increasing amount of time to the rest of the world. The Balkans appeared to consume the Clinton administration.George W. Bush launched two wars during his tenure.Barack Obama has devoted a considerable amount of his time to revamping counterterrorism policies, rebalancing attention to the Pacific Rim, prosecuting a war in Libya - and killingOsama bin Laden.
Why do presidents campaign as economic wizards but govern as foreign policy leaders? The first thing to realize is that presidents are not doing this on purpose. Their focus on foreign policy actually reveals the constraints on the modern American presidency.
On most big economic matters, presidents cannot act alone. Congress has to approve things like budgets and taxes, and in case you haven't noticed, Congress has become increasingly sclerotic. During the 1950s, for example, Congress passed an average of 800 laws per session; in the post-cold-war era, that figure has declined to fewer than 400. Based on the 112th Congress, that figure will continue to decline in the future.
The party not in the White House has been increasingly obstructionist - and if you doubt this, look up the filibuster statistics. Any president trying to accomplish something with Congressional approval either needs a majority of the House and 60 votes in the Senate, or needs to compromise with an opposition party ever further away on the ideological spectrum. Short of a landslide, presidents have a brief honeymoon period in which to push major domestic policy initiatives through Congress.
If presidents seem to be ever more constrained in their domestic policy making, in foreign affairs the executive branch has far more leeway. Sure, Congress has to approve treaties and budgets, but they are reluctant to challenge the executive branch on most national security matters. The Bush administration was able to implement the Iraq surge despite skeptical majorities in both houses of Congress. The Obama administration authorized the use of force in Libya without even notifying Congress. Neither policy was terribly popular with the American people, yet both presidents were able to do what they wanted.
Indeed, invoking national security seems to eliminate a disturbing number of institutional impediments for the executive branch. The National Security Agency can admit that it violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of illegal search and seizure without much in the way of political or legal blowback.
Of course, all of this presumes that presidents can control the international environment. This is an utter fantasy. As the 9/11 attacks made clear, small groups of actors can be responsible for large conflagrations. The pretext for the recent attacks on American embassies and consulates across the Middle East was a cartoonish YouTube video. If that is the bar for inciting action against American interests, then any intelligence agency would drown in possible provocations. Most of the time presidents don't pick the foreign policy issues they want to tackle - the issues choose them.
America remains the world's pre-eminent power. This means that whenever something happens somewhere in the world, the expectation is that the United States will be part of the policy solution. When presidents are reluctant to intervene, they are attacked by domestic and foreign adversaries as being weak, passive or "leading from behind."
It's precisely because presidents have so much more leeway to do what they want in the global realm that I now vote based on foreign policy. Mistakes in international affairs can lead to incalculable losses in blood and treasure. Paradoxically, if Americans suddenly started to vote based on national security issues, presidents would have to start to care about the domestic political consequences of their overseas actions.
Who knows, they might just start redirecting their efforts to problems at home.

HEADLINE: Canadian Auto Workers Union And G.M. Agree on Contract

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- General Motors of Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers Union announced a tentative contract on Thursday night, about 72 hours after the union settled with the Ford Motor Company of Canada. But the union and Chrysler Canada appeared far apart in their negotiations.
General Motors agreed to the central terms of the tentative agreement with Ford, a deal that involves concessions on both sides. 
Ken Lewenza, the union's president, said that the agreement, which provides for annual lump sum payments but no wage increases, met the union's main objectives.
''We wanted to share in the modest success of General Motors,'' he said adding that he believes the contract terms would allow G.M. to continue to invest in Canada, a production center whose longtime cost advantage has evaporated with the rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with its United States counterpart.
David Wenner, the general director of labor relations at G.M. Canada, said in a statement that the talks ''have been candid and constructive, reflecting the challenges facing Canadian manufacturers.'' The company declined to comment further.
As has been the case throughout the negotiations, which began in mid-August, the sticking point with Chrysler appears to be its insistence that the Canadian Auto Workers adopt a wage system that the automaker uses in its plants in the United States, which allows the company to permanently pay new employees substantially lower wages.
Like Ford, G.M. agreed on Thursday to a variation of that plan. Under it, new hires in Canada will be paid 60 percent less than established workers for 10 years and then move to the higher wage scale. That represents an extension of four years compared to the previous contract in Canada, which provided new employees with 70 percent of the full wage scale for six years.
Chrysler is best positioned to take advantage of lower wages for new employees in Canada, even under the modified Canadian system. Currently, it has only 70 union members on layoff, according to the union, suggesting it may be hiring soon. Ford Canada, by contrast, has about 900 laid-off employees and General Motors an even greater number, perhaps making hiring new workers theoretical at those companies. Under the terms of the four-year contract, new employees cannot be hired until all laid-off workers are recalled.
Mr. Lewenza, the union's president, said that Chrysler had still not indicated that it would accept the same contract terms as Ford and General Motors, a demand of the union, nor has it presented the union's negotiators with its main economic proposals.
In a statement following the announcement of the G.M. pact, Chrysler Canada said only that it looked ''forward to continuing our discussions with the C.A.W.''
The union extended its strike deadline on Monday night to continue talks with G.M. and Chrysler, after reaching its agreement with Ford. On Thursday, Mr. Lewenza declined to say when the union's patience with Chrysler would wear thin.
''We're not fearing of providing a strike notice,'' Mr. Lewenza said. ''But, as we've said many times, that's the last tool in the toolbox.
While General Motors matched the broad terms adopted by Ford, which include substantial changes to pension plans, it did not follow its competitor's lead and promise new products for its plants. It did, however, agree to extend the operation of an assembly line in Oshawa, Ontario, which was slated to close next year, until June 2014 with at least one shift employing about 750 union workers.
The company also agreed to add 900 jobs by adding a third shift to another assembly line in Oshawa and agreed to increase employment at an engine and transmission plant in St. Catharines, Ontario, by about 100 jobs.
G.M. currently has about 5,500 unionized employees in Canada. Mr. Lewenza noted that when the Canadian Auto Workers union broke away from the United Automobile Workers in 1985, G.M. Canada employed more people on its own than the 21,000 Canadians now working at the three Detroit automakers combined.

HEADLINE: Temerity At the Top

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
I guess we're all supposed to be talking about how to build the middle class these days and look askance at the top 1 percent. But would you mind if I interrupted this cultural moment to point out that capitalism is an inherently elitist enterprise?
Prosperity is often driven by small enclaves of extraordinary individuals that build new industries and amass large fortunes. These driven, manic individuals are frequently unpleasant to be around. But, if your country is not attracting and nurturing them, you're cooked. 
Let's take a contemporary example, Elon Musk, who was just beautifully profiled by Ashlee Vance in Bloomberg Businessweek.
For those who don't read the financial press or the gossip blogs, Musk is a 41-year-old entrepreneur who grew up in South Africa. At 15, he migrated to Canada, worked on farms and at a lumber mill and then got into Queen's University in Ontario.
After two years, he transferred to Penn, earning degrees in economics and physics. While there, as he recently told Jon Stewart, he concluded that the three areas that would most transform humanity were the Internet, sustainable energy and space exploration.
He dropped out of a graduate physics program at Stanford to help start an Internet map and directory company called Zip2, which was sold to Compaq for more than $300 million.
He took his share of that money and helped create PayPal, serving for a time as its chief executive. When that was sold, he poured his share of his money into SpaceX, a space exploration company; Tesla, an electric car company; SolarCity, a solar power company; and Everdream, a data-center software firm.
SpaceX is the first private company to send a rocket into space. Already profitable, it has a long line of orders to take things into space. Tesla is selling its second model for about $55,000 each. Musk decided to revolutionize three industries all at once and is sort of doing it. His net worth is estimated to be about $2 billion.
Musk also told Businessweek about two other project designs he is working on. The first is something called the Hyperloop, a tube capable of taking people from downtown Los Angeles to downtown San Francisco in 30 minutes. The second is a vertical lift-off supersonic passenger jet that would surpass Boeing. He also hopes to open up a space colony on Mars within 10 or 15 years.
''Boldness of enterprise is the foremost cause of [America's] rapid progress, its strength and its greatness,'' Alexis de Tocqueville wrote nearly a couple of centuries ago. Musk is a fountain of bold enterprises, though, of course, he also has the vices of his virtues.
Many employees love him, but there has been at least one blog set up to catalog his mistreatment of those he deems mediocre. He's run through two marriages already, and his first ex-wife wrote a brutal but not necessarily persuasive takedown of him in Marie Claire. He's taken a grand total of one vacation in four years, and his romantic life has faltered. As he told Vance, ''I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need a girlfriend. How much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours?''
Musk is grandiose: a grand lifestyle, grand riches, grand vision and grand verbiage. Playing a computer game with a writer from ForbesLife, he let loose a characteristic burst of vast if vaporous ideas: ''You can look at modern history where its not so much genetics going into battle as a battle of meme structures.''
Today, grandiosity is out of style. We've just been through a financial crisis fueled by people who got too big for their britches. We've got an online and media culture that specializes in ridiculing grand people.
Caution rules. The number of jobs created by business start-ups under President Obama is much lower than under the three previous presidents. The World Economic Forum ranks the competitiveness of nations, and the U.S. has lost ground in each of the last four years.
But, if growth is ever going to rebound, the U.S. will need a grandiosity rebound and the policies that encourage rich people with brass: immigration policies that attract people like Musk, tax rates that encourage risk and government policies that boost them along (SpaceX has benefited greatly from NASA, and Tesla received a big government loan).
Most of all, there has to be a culture that gives two cheers to grandiosity. Government can influence growth, but it's people like Musk who create it. Stories like his are worth repeating because maybe some reader will think: What grand transformational process do I want to be a part of? If Musk pinioned his life to the Internet, electric cars and interplanetary travel, what are my projects?
A few ridiculously ambitious people can change an economy more than any president.

HEADLINE: California Debt Higher Than Earlier Estimates, a Task Force Reports

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Gov. Jerry Brown of California announced when he came into office last year that he had found an alarming $28 billion ''wall of debt'' looming over the state, which had to be dismantled.
Since then, he has slowed the issuance of municipal bonds, called for spending cuts and tried to persuade the state's famously antitax voters to approve a tax increase this fall.
On Thursday, an independent group of fiscal experts said Mr. Brown's efforts were all well and good, but in fact, the ''wall of debt'' was several times as big as the governor thought. 
Directors of the State Budget Crisis Task Force said their researchers had found a lot of other debts that did not turn up in California's official tally. Much of it involved irrevocable promises to provide pensions to public workers, health care for retirees, the cost of delayed highway maintenance and an estimated $40 billion bill to bring drinking water up to federal standards.
They also pointed out many of the same unpaid bills from previous years that the governor had brought to light, like $8 billion in delayed payments to schools and community colleges, and $250 million that was raided from a fund dedicated to transportation and treated as revenue.
The task force estimated that the burden of debt totaled at least $167 billion and as much as $335 billion. Its members warned that the off-the-books debts tended to grow over time, so that even if Mr. Brown should succeed in pushing through his tax increase, gaining an additional $50 billion over the next seven years, the wall of debt would still be there, casting its shadow over the state.
''With inadequate information, our legislators and citizens are flying blind,'' said David Crane, a board member who issued the task force's special report on California's fiscal condition at a news conference in San Francisco on Thursday.
Mr. Crane, a former adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, was joined by the economist George P. Shultz, who served various administrations as secretary of treasury, labor and state.
A spokesman for Governor Brown did not dispute the report but said the governor was making progress in his effort to restore fiscal balance.
The task force was founded last year by Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, and Richard Ravitch, a former New York lieutenant governor. They said they were acting out of a deep concern for the fiscal affairs of the states, which they thought received insufficient attention in Washington.
The task force is conducting detailed analyses of a sample of six states. The others are Illinois, New York, Texas, Virginia and New Jersey.
California was of particular interest, not only because it constitutes the world's ninth-largest economy, but because of its intractable fiscal problems. It has also experienced an unusual string of municipal bankruptcies in recent years. In one of them, the City of Stockton is proposing to walk away from virtually all the principal and interest on one of its bonds.
Analysts are watching the case closely, concerned that if Stockton succeeds, other troubled cities may follow. Some contend that the State of California should be doing more to keep its cities out of bankruptcy, and to shield municipal bond investors.
Task force members said their focus on California was not meant to suggest that the state's general-obligation bonds were at risk. Mr. Crane said he believed California's bonds were very safe, acknowledging that he owned some himself.
Governor Brown's efforts to chip away at the debt have led Standard & Poor's to say it is considering an upgrade of California's bond rating, long one of the lowest among the states. But the report pointed out that S.& P.'s review of California's creditworthiness took into account a ranking in the state Constitution that shows which debts and government programs must be paid ahead of everything else.
While a rating increase would mean that California's bondholders were more secure, it would not necessarily mean more money for the programs that didn't make it onto the seniority list. Nor would it reflect any particular improvement in the fiscal health of the cities, school districts and other local bodies of government, which fall lower in the pecking order than the state's general-obligation bondholders.

HEADLINE: A Manufacturing About-Face: Made in America but Sold in China

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
Standing over a small tank of water in a Brooklyn factory, Zbigniew Solecki plunged a gleaming faucet into a tank of water, then shot air at 60 pounds per square inch into it. He watched to see if bubbles rose from the water, a sign that an unseen fissure had, unacceptably, let the air stream out. It is a rite of passage that Mr. Solecki performs dozens of times a day.
''Every last piece is pressure-tested before it goes out the door to China,'' said Jack Abel, the engineer who built the factory. ''Or anywhere else.'' 
Yes, he did say China.
Mr. Abel's company, Watermark Designs in Brooklyn, is standing history on its head: it is making plumbing parts and shipping them to China.
After generations of manufacturers in New York and across the United States folded because they were unable to compete with imports, Watermark, with its only factory in the East New York section of Brooklyn, has managed to crack the code. Instead of trying to make Watermark's products cheaper, Mr. Abel has prospered by first making them more expensive -- offering custom-made fixtures unique to each building -- and then figuring out how to do that at lower cost. The company has supplied thousands of fixtures to six new luxury hotels and condominiums being built in Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.
''The days of mass producing in New York City are gone,'' Mr. Abel said. ''If you were producing nuts and bolts by the tens of thousands 50 years ago, you're not going to do it today. But creativity, or uniqueness or design is definitely something that can flourish in New York.''
Just as they have in many parts of the country, exports have taken up the slack for the business that Watermark lost during the economic downturn that began in 2008. The New York metropolitan area led the nation last year in exports, rising to $105 billion, its highest ever, from $85 billion in 2010, according to a report released last week by the International Trade Administration, a branch of the United States Department of Commerce that supports companies doing business overseas.
Fencing and flooring for dance clubs, stadiums, and big tents are being made in the Bronx by Signature Fencing and Flooring and shipped to South Africa, Japan, Britain and India. From Medford, on Long Island, Enecon, which makes corrosion-resistant coatings for industrial equipment, ships to 65 countries.
Manufacturing jobs in New York have declined by about 80 percent from a high of 1.1 million jobs in 1947, all but shutting down what had been a heavily trod avenue into the middle class for immigrants and people without advanced educations.
Mr. Abel, who was born in Israel, grew up in the Bronx and studied engineering at the City College of New York and Columbia University, started his business in 1976 in a small metal plating company that his father ran from a 2,000-square-foot storefront in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. For a number of years, it did well and grew by refinishing inexpensive parts and selling them through neighborhood bath stores and the early home improvement centers. Mr. Abel moved into supplying high-end fixtures just as the city was entering a period of luxury construction.
It was a strong strategy, made possible, Mr. Abel said, by his son Avi, who joined the business after graduating from the State University of New York at Binghamton (now Binghamton University) and among other things, overhauled its design capabilities. Around 2006, Watermark bought a three-dimensional printer for $60,000. It works like an ink jet printer, except that it squirts molten plastic to build a form, instead of ink onto paper.
Robert Brenner, 26, a design engineer for the company, showed a plastic prototype of a handle made to an architect's specifications. ''This took three to four hours,'' he said.
After the prototype is approved, Watermark tunes its lathes and milling machines to make the actual parts. In such a world, cheap labor is a dwindling advantage. ''I can get the best equipment,'' Mr. Abel said. ''I can't get someone to operate it -- machinists, machine programmers, people with knowledge how to operate sophisticated equipment, they're not there.''
Nearly 40 years after starting in the storefront, the company employs 45 people in 55,000 square feet. Most of the workers have been with the company for 10 years or more. Besides high-tech equipment, the company now has something else that wasn't available years ago -- Brooklyn chic.
''My son says we should stand on a box and shout it loud: 'This is made not only in the U.S.A., but in Brooklyn,' '' Mr. Abel said, ''It's what Paris had been. We have become a design mecca.''

HEADLINE: Reports Indicate Little Pickup in Hiring

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three economic reports released Thursday indicated that the nation's economy was still struggling to grow and add jobs.
The number of people seeking unemployment benefits last week stayed near a level that signaled only weak hiring in September. Manufacturing shrank for a fifth consecutive month in the Philadelphia region, a sign that weaker global growth had hurt demand for American-made goods. And a measure of future economy activity declined for the second time in three months. 
''There certainly doesn't appear to be much improvement in the performance of the economy,'' Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said. ''Manufacturing continues to soften and decelerate. We shouldn't expect to see substantial gains in hiring or output from manufacturers any time soon.''
Among the reports, the Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell by 3,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 382,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose for the fifth consecutive week to 377,750. Applications, which are a proxy for layoffs, typically need to fall below 375,000 consistently to signal the job market is strong enough to lower unemployment.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its September index of regional manufacturing activity stayed below zero, which signals contraction in the market. While the index rose to minus 1.9, it has been negative since May. Nearly 23 percent of firms in the region reported declines in activity this month, an improvement from 30 percent of firms in August. The region includes firms in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.
The Conference Board said its index of leading indicators fell 0.1 percent in August. The report noted that manufacturing orders, consumer confidence and average weekly manufacturing hours all declined. The index is intended to anticipate economic conditions three to six months in the future.
Hiring has languished since winter, and the unemployment rate remains at 8.1 percent.
Manufacturing, which had helped pull the economy out of recession three years ago, has weakened since the spring. Factories have been hurt by a decline in consumer spending and slower global growth that has cut demand for exports.
Many companies are also worried that the economy could worsen if Congress fails to reach a budget deal before the end of the year to prevent taxes from rising and government spending from being cut.
''Businesses clearly remain reluctant to aggressively boost their work forces,'' said Jim Baird, chief investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, in a note to clients.
The housing market has been one of the few bright spots this year. Sales of previously occupied homes rose in August to the highest level in two years, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The market has been helped by steady price increases and rock-bottom mortgage rates, which fell again this week.

HEADLINE: Intangible Dividend of Antipoverty Effort: Happiness

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
When thousands of poor families were given federal housing subsidies in the early 1990s to move out of impoverished neighborhoods, social scientists expected the experience of living in more prosperous communities would pay off in better jobs, higher incomes and more education.
That did not happen. But more than 10 years later, the families' lives had improved in another way: They reported being much happier than a comparison group of poor families who were not offered subsidies to move, a finding that was published on Thursday in the journal Science. 
And using the gold standard of social surveys -- the General Social Survey, in which researchers have questioned thousands of Americans of all income levels going back to the 1970s -- researchers even quantified how much happier the families were. The improvement was equal to the level of life satisfaction of someone whose annual income was $13,000 more a year, said Jens Ludwig, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and the lead author of the study.
This vast social experiment, involving 4,600 families in Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, Chicago and Boston, tested a long-held theory that neighborhood is an important determinant of an individual's success.
But there was little evidence that the new neighborhoods made much of a difference in either income or education, a disappointment for social scientists, who had hoped that the experiment would lead to new ways of combating poverty.
What researchers did find were substantial improvements in the physical and mental health of the people who moved. Researchers reported last year in The New England Journal of Medicine that the participants who moved to new neighborhoods had lower rates of obesity and diabetes than those not offered the chance to move. Beyond the increase in happiness, the new study found lower levels of depression among those who moved.
''Mental health and subjective well-being are very important,'' said William Julius Wilson, a sociology professor at Harvard whose 1987 book ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' pioneered theory about concentrated poverty. ''If you are not feeling well, it's going to affect everything -- your employment, relations with your family.''
The researchers measured quality of life using participants' reports of their own well-being. Researchers asked: ''Taken all together, how would you say things are these days? Would you say you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy?''
A year after they entered the program, the families who had made the move were living in neighborhoods where about a third of the residents lived in poverty. In contrast, those who were not offered the chance to move lived in neighborhoods where half of the residents lived in poverty.
Professor Wilson said it was not surprising that education levels did not change significantly because many of the children who moved remained in the same school districts. And Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard and one of the study authors, said that the preference for educated workers was so strong that changing neighborhoods did not do much to improve job options for the participants, who were mostly African-American women without college educations.
Researchers said that though they did not know why people felt happier after moving, it probably had to do with feeling safer and less stressed. Nearly three-quarters of the families who signed up for the program said they had done so to get away from violence in dangerous neighborhoods.
Moving to a neighborhood that was less poor caused families that were making $20,000 a year to feel as happy as families making $33,000 a year, Professor Ludwig said.
Even more startling, researchers said, was the finding that families who moved into new neighborhoods that were just as racially segregated as the ones they came from, but were much less poor, reported much larger gains in feelings of well-being than those who moved to much more racially integrated neighborhoods that were nearly as impoverished.
That finding, Professor Katz said, is troubling for the future because economic segregation has grown steadily in the United States, since the 1970s, while racial segregation has been declining.
''The increased geographic isolation of the poor appears to have a pure adverse effect on health and well-being,'' he said.
Improvements in health and well-being caused by moving to areas with less concentrated poverty ''is not a magic bullet to eliminate poverty itself,'' Professor Katz said. That would require major changes in the American economy. But he said it would improve lives for the families that experience it, and reduce the costs to taxpayers of medical care for them.

HEADLINE: As the European Crisis Continues, Retailers Say Price Matters

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
As the European crisis hurtled on last year, Lacoste looked at its more than 500 European stores and decided it had to make some changes.
There still was demand for luxury products, so the French heritage label added expensive items like outerwear and leather goods. But it also added cheap styles like T-shirts, which, at &#x20ac;45, or $59, were almost half the price of one of its famed polo shirts.
And, with the exception of some key products, it now is setting prices on a country by country basis, considering local demand and competition. 
While visits to Lacoste stores in Europe have declined, the company says it is selling more items per visit. And sales from January through August at stores that had been open at least a year, the category retailers use to measure a business's health, have risen in every country except Greece and Italy compared with the same period last year.
''It's always a balance,'' said José Luis Duran, the president of Devanlay, which holds the Lacoste license.
Lacoste has hit on a theme that is increasingly important to European retailers: Price matters.
Retailers are recalibrating for a newly price-conscious audience throughout Europe, either keeping their prices low or aiming for the luxury market, which Asian tourists continue to support. Midrange retailers that have not tried to keep prices low, like Abercrombie & Fitch, are running into trouble.
''It's like the two ends of the spectrum,'' said Omar Saad, a New York-based analyst with ISI Group. ''The Chinese are not traveling all the way to Paris to go to the Abercrombie store, it would seem.''
Mango, the Spanish fast-fashion retailer, cut all of its prices by 20 percent this year in response to the crisis. It also added prices to its ads for the first time. So far, at least, the results are good: The company says sales in the first half of the year rose by 30 percent compared with the same period a year ago.
Inditex Group, the Spanish company that owns Zara, Massimo Dutti and several other brands, has also chosen to absorb higher costs rather than pass them on to consumers. In July, when Spain announced it would increase its value-added tax to 21 percent from 18 percent, Inditex kept its prices flat.
''There's still a case to be made that retailers who have the right fashion and the right product in the store can deliver strong sales growth regardless of the economic environment -- Inditex, for example, has seen fantastic sales growth over the last few years, even though Spain is 25 percent of their sales,'' said Jamie Merriman, a London-based analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. ''Inditex has priced competitively in Spain and has protected Spanish customers where possible,'' like absorbing tax increases.
H&M, too, has kept prices steady, even as it continues nosing into a higher range of prices with new divisions. Cos, which offers slightly more expensive clothing, is now in 13 European countries, and new Cos stores are to open this autumn in Amsterdam; Madrid; Bologna; and Poznan, Poland. And H&M has announced plans for another new unit, called & Other Stories, to be introduced in European cities in 2013. H&M has not offered specifics on the new chain, but analysts expect it to be a luxury offering.
Nevertheless, H&M has been firm on pricing. Though cotton prices and labor costs have risen in recent years, ''the H&M group has been very clear about our chosen strategy, which has been to not pass on the increased costs to our customers,'' said Hacan Andersson, a spokesman. For the six months that ended in May, H&M's sales at stores open at least a year worldwide rose 3 percent, and it says its overall expansion plans remain intact.
Yet not all stores are finding success in the current climate. Gap said its international same-store sales fell by 5 percent in the most recent quarter. And splashy Abercrombie & Fitch, which heralded its new Paris store last year by sending shirtless male models strutting down the Champs-Élysées, admitted that it might have misjudged price tags during the crisis.
Abercrombie said its same-store sales internationally had plummeted 26 percent in the quarter that ended in July.
''We felt we might have stretched the flagship prices too high'' internationally, Michael S. Jeffries, Abercrombie's chairman and chief executive, said in a call with investors last month. ''The situation in Europe has continued to become more difficult since we first spoke of our concerns a year ago.''
Abercrombie already has reduced some prices internationally, and while it did not give details, the company says it plans to do more in the last half of the year.
Ralph Lauren executives said that while outlet stores were doing fine worldwide, the more expensive products were not as popular in Europe. ''Lower tourist travel and restraint among local customers continued to weigh on Ralph Lauren stores in Europe,'' Robert Madore, Ralph Lauren's chief financial officer, said recently. It has gotten so bad that the brand is declining to ship some items that European merchants have ordered, in part because of ''our concerns about their ability to sell through,'' said Roger Farah, the company's chief executive.
Other companies, though, say the European crisis has provided an opportunity for growth.
The athletic-shoe retailer Foot Locker will add about 35 stores in Europe this year, and it says items are selling at slightly higher prices thanks to high-end styles like Nike Free, which sells for &#x20ac;110 to &#x20ac;120, and Tuned Air, &#x20ac;150 to &#x20ac;160.
''We're investing for the long run in Europe, which we believe will stabilize over time,'' the chief executive, Kenneth C. Hicks, said recently.

HEADLINE: Technology, Both Miracle and Burden

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
YALTA, UKRAINE -- One of the paradoxes of our age is that we are simultaneously living through a time of positive economic innovation and also a time of the painful erosion of the way of life of many middle-class families.
Listening to Yuri Milner, the Russian Internet investor, at a conference in Ukraine a few days ago brought home this contrast. Mr. Milner is a billionaire thanks to his Internet investments: He has done well both in his homeland, supporting some of Russia's most successful start-ups, and, even more spectacularly by venturing abroad, taking pioneering stakes in Facebook, Zynga and Groupon. 
When Mr. Milner talks about the technology revolution, he paints a dazzling picture of literally unprecedented innovation, bringing tremendous savings and benefits to consumers.
But when you talk to economists about the impact of those same forces on middle-class jobs, you come joltingly down to earth. The revolution Mr. Milner describes is part of a sea change in how the economies of Western industrialized nations work -- and one that is hollowing out the middle class.
The technology revolution has become so familiar -- grandmothers are on Facebook and toddlers navigate YouTube on their parents' iPads -- that it is easy to forget how revolutionary it still is. But Mr. Milner, speaking at an annual conference held by the Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, argued that it had just begun to radically reshape our lives. (Disclosure: I moderated many of the sessions.)
Mr. Milner's focus is on what he calls the three big ''stories'' in business innovation: ''platform,'' ''free'' and ''e-commerce.'' By ''platform,'' Mr. Milner is referring to the ability of the breakthrough Internet companies to build their businesses using the work and ideas of others. One example is Amazon.com. Mr. Milner said that ''about two million independent merchants are selling on the platform every day. And that adds up to $25 billion of annual sales.'' If those merchants were housed in a brick-and-mortar mall, they would occupy a ''space equal to the island of Manhattan.''
The second big strand of the Internet revolution that Mr. Milner homed in on is ''free.'' Here, again, Mr. Milner argues that something unprecedented is going on: Thanks to the revolutionary impact of ''free,'' massive global brands can be created almost overnight.
Mr. Milner's final major trend is less abstract: e-commerce. Again, this is hardly a novel phenomenon. But what Mr. Milner thinks is new is the impact of e-commerce as it moves from being the sideshow to becoming the main event.
Today, Mr. Milner estimates that 6 percent of retail sales is done online. He believes that number will be 20 percent within a decade, and he thinks it will be 50 percent within two decades. That shift, Mr. Milner argues, will have a profound and positive impact on the world economy -- an 8 percent increase in efficiency. Another predicted consequence is less benign: ''a pretty significant job loss in the retail sector to the tune of forty million jobs in the next twenty years.''
Mr. Milner is a winner in all three of his generation's big revolutions -- the collapse of communism, globalization and the technology revolution. So he is inclined to believe the disappearance of retail jobs will have a happy outcome: The vanishing, low-paying retail jobs will be replaced by better-paying technology work.
But economists who have been studying the impact of globalization and the technology revolution on the labor market in Western industrialized economies are less sanguine, at least in the short term.
John van Reenan, professor of economics and director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics and Political Science, is one of the foremost students of this transition. He thinks the biggest impact of the e-commerce revolution, and its counterparts in sectors like the law or accounting, won't be on the number of jobs in the economy; it will be on how well they pay.
''The worry isn't the quantity of jobs; it is the quality of jobs,'' he said by telephone from his base in London. ''Other jobs will appear, but they may not be very attractive jobs.''
Dr. van Reenan believes this trend has already begun, with deep social and political consequences. ''It is a continuation of the hollowing out of the middle class, which we have seen,'' he said. ''People will find it harder to support a middle-class family.''
We've been in this paradoxical place before. The American economist and politician Henry George described the tumultuous change that his country was undergoing in the 19th century in an 1879 best-seller, whose title says it all: ''Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry in the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want With Increase of Wealth ... The Remedy.''
What makes today's political economy so hard to come to terms with is that the thrilling innovation and the hollowing out of the middle class -- the progress and the poverty -- aren't two inimical trends. They are, instead, opposite faces of the same coin. But that's something we don't like to talk about, either in the hot spots where innovation is happening, or in the depressed regions where its malign side effects are being felt most acutely.

HEADLINE: In Toronto, a Spacious Glass House in the Sky

BYLINE: By KATHERINE TARBOX

 BODY:
TORONTO -- When an 840-square-meter penthouse in the new Toronto Four Seasons hotel complex sold last year for 28 million Canadian dollars, it made headlines as the most expensive condominium sale in Canada's history.
And while the Toronto real estate market is thriving, thanks to its history of stable prices and a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent, it is not known for luxury penthouses with prices exceeding 30,000 dollars per square meter, or about $2,900 per square foot. 
Now, however, Toronto's first condo of this type -- a 1960s unit designed by Philip Johnson -- is on the market with an asking price of 28 million dollars.
This 953-square-meter apartment was the brainchild of the Toronto businessman Noah Torno and his wife, Rose, who came up with the idea of putting a penthouse unit on top of an office building after they visited friends who lived above Bergdorf Goodman in New York.
The Tornos hired Mr. Johnson, the celebrated American architect, to create a condo that looked like a larger version of the Glass House that he designed in 1949 as a weekend retreat in New Canaan, Connecticut. But this version is 13 floors above Bloor Street, considered to be the Canadian version of Fifth Avenue in New York.
The entryway to the penthouse, which has two stories and four bedrooms and features ceilings that are 9 meters high, or 30 feet, is a large square space with seamless travertine walls. (Mr. Johnson and Mr. Torno personally selected the stone to ensure that it would look like a single piece.)
The only other feature is a replica of the grand staircase of the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York, which Mr. Johnson also designed. It showcases the architect's signature style of mixing metals, in this case bronze with stainless steel frames.
The Tornos also brought in the British furniture designer T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings to oversee the decorating in an early Modern design mode.
Surrounding the living space is a 465-square-meter terrace that wraps all the way around the condo and comes with setback views of Lake Ontario.
In 2005, a Canadian developer, Jon Love, bought the building and brought in a local builder, Jon Brennan, to restore much of the inlaid wood and bring the unit up to modern specifications.
''We took down all of the walls to remove the asbestos,'' said Mr. Brennan, who worked on the unit for almost two years. ''We pulled up the floors and then laid them again to repair the cracks. We totally took the apartment apart and put it back together.''
The penthouse now features an open kitchen with Bianco Lasa marble counters, local white oak cabinets and Miele appliances.
Mr. Brennan also brought in other contemporary high-end features, like a wine cellar with a 1,000-bottle capacity and large walk-in closets.
Because the unit is registered with the Toronto Historical Association, some of the five bathrooms could undergo only a minor facelift, like polishing the marble and updating the fixtures, to maintain the penthouse's architectural integrity.
Mr. Love's redevelopment of the building in 2005 included the construction of 14 residences on top of the Johnson-designed unit. All of the condos, or the Toronto Four Seasons Private Residences, have separate entrances from the hotel, as well as staff and service entries.
Mr. Love estimates that there are probably fewer than 100 people in the Toronto market that could buy the landmark condo, but the city has been attracting wealthy foreign investors, who see the market as stable and the Canadian economy as robust because of its abundance of natural resources.
And real estate agents say it is those buyers -- predominantly from Russia, the Middle East and South America -- who are mainly responsible for the impressive statistic that sales contracts exist for 88 percent of the 52,695 condos under construction in the city.

HEADLINE: China Assures Europe on Debt Aid

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said on Thursday that China would continue to help the European Union recover from its economic crisis even as he sternly criticized the bloc for maintaining an embargo on weapons sales to his country.
The Union is the biggest buyer of Chinese exports and China is the second most important trading partner for the Union, after the United States, making the relationship crucial to growth and jobs for both. 
Yet there are serious irritants for Beijing, including the E.U. ban on arms exports to China, in place since the 1989 crackdown on protesters around Tiananmen Square, and the reluctance of Europe to classify China as a modern, open economy, which would clear the way for advantages on tariffs.
''I have to be very frank in saying this,'' Mr. Wen told Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, and José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission. On ''the two issues of lifting the arms embargo against China and recognizing China's full market economy status, we have been working hard for 10 years. But the solution has been elusive.''
''I deeply regret this,'' Mr. Wen said, shortly before a live television transmission from the meeting was cut off. ''I hope, and I do believe that the E.U. side will seize the opportunity and take greater initiative at an early stage.''
The Union considered easing the arms ban in 2005, but the United States steadfastly objected and some of Union's member states raised objections because of concerns about violations of human rights in China.
Without market economy status, a nation usually faces higher tariffs in trade disputes with the Union, but China has fulfilled only one of the five requirements required to win such status, the European Commission said.
China still needs to show less government influence over its businesses, including those in the financial sector, and to adopt transparent laws on corporate governance, property and bankruptcy to be eligible for market economy status, the commission said. Europe and China are also embroiled in trade disputes over solar panels and rare earth metals.
Striking a softer tone, Mr. Wen said China would continue to support the E.U. economy.
''In recent months, China has been continuing to invest in the euro zone government bonds and bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility,'' said Mr. Wen, referring to a temporary fund for euro countries that has already been used to assist Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
''Europe is one of the main markets for China to invest its foreign exchange reserves and China will continue to participate in efforts to tackle Europe's debt crisis through appropriate channels,'' Mr. Wen said.
The European Council, the body headed by Mr. Van Rompuy, did not hold a customary news conference after the meeting because the European authorities and their Chinese counterparts were unable to agree on a format after journalists expressed concerns that the Chinese authorities planned to exclude members of the media they dislike.
In a statement, Mr. Van Rompuy and Mr. Barroso sought to underline the growing interdependence of the Chinese and European economies. The European leaders also urged China to use its influence to end ''a terrible humanitarian tragedy'' in Syria.
''We have asked China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to redouble its efforts to ensure the United Nations Security Council can contribute effectively to the solution of the Syrian crisis,'' they said.
China, along with Russia, has vetoed proposed U.N. resolutions intended to put pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to end a crackdown on the Syrian opposition.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Sleepy Islands and a Smoldering Dispute

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and IAN JOHNSON; Martin Fackler reported from Ishigaki, and Ian Johnson from Beijing. Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Mia Li from Beijing.

 BODY:
ISHIGAKI, Japan -- In the fishing harbor here, Japan has increased the number of sleek, white Coast Guard cutters to fend off the Chinese patrol boats that have stepped up their challenge of Japan's control of disputed nearby islands, one sign of a smoldering conflict that has threatened relations between Asia's two giants.
But even here in Ishigaki, at the southern edge of Japan closest to the contested territory, many fear that the heated showdown may scare off other, more welcome Chinese visitors: tourists who sustain the town's resort-based economy.
The conflicted feelings are emblematic of the quandary both nations face as they once again clash over sovereignty of the uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Neither nation can afford to appear to back down over territorial claims that speak volumes about the countries' often tortured history since Japan's brutal invasion of China. But they also cannot ignore their more modern history, in which businesses have brushed past political wariness to build a web of ties in trade and investment that are critical to both economies' well-being. 
''The huge contradiction at the center of Japanese-Chinese relations is the fact that politics and the economics are moving in completely opposite directions,'' said Kazuko Mori, a China specialist at Waseda University in Tokyo.
Those economic ties may help explain why the Japanese government has remained so reticent, even as demonstrators in China vandalized Japanese-owned businesses this week. They may also explain why China -- after at least tolerating, if not encouraging, protests in recent weeks -- has taken steps to end the protests and prosecute rioters.
According to Japan's Finance Ministry, China was Japan's largest trading partner last year, and Japan is China's second-biggest trading partner after the United States. Japan is also China's largest outside investor, with Japanese companies directly or indirectly employing about 10 million Chinese, according to a Japanese lobby group.
Perhaps as important as the volume of the trade and investment, though, is how complementary the two countries' industries are.
Japan's still formidable lead in technology allows it to provide much of the production machinery in Chinese factories and many of the core components in Chinese-made products that have helped make China's rise possible. Japan's struggling electronics companies, in turn, have become dependent on sales to China's lower-cost manufacturers, which use Japanese memory chips, display panels and other parts in many of their high-tech products.
The iPhone is just one example. Although the phones are assembled in China, many of their most sophisticated parts are supplied by Japanese companies like Toshiba and TDK. Japanese content is so high that there were even calls during the recent anti-Japan protests to boycott the iPhone, according to Japanese news reports.
Beyond that, low-priced Chinese goods have become an important part of coping in economically stagnant Japan, embraced by consumers weary of declining wages and living standards.
''We disagree on the islands,'' said Sachie Misawa, who shopped this week at a store in Tokyo that sells affordable Chinese-made clothing. ''But shopping for clothes is another matter entirely. Chinese-made products are cheap and good, so I am a loyal customer.''
In the short term, such sentiments may help cool the dispute. But the problem, according to Victoria Hui, a scholar of Chinese government and protests at the University of Notre Dame, is that China's government does not seem to have an easy exit strategy from the tensions. Unless Japan surrenders control of the islands, a virtual impossibility, the Chinese government will have no successes to show, which could make it seem weak.
''Japan is unlikely to do anything that will make the Chinese happy,'' she said. ''How do you put the genie back in the bottle?''
The islands at the heart of the dispute are a seven-hour voyage from this tropical port town. They are controlled by Japan, but claimed by both China and Taiwan and have been a festering problem for years.
The hard feelings are partly over history: Japan staked its claims in the late 1800s, in what the Chinese see as one of the aspiring imperial power's earliest attempts to impose its will on the region. The territorial contest is also over resources; studies in recent decades have suggested a possible wealth of oil beneath the waters surrounding the islands.
The issue has been compounded in recent years by Japan's increasing feelings not only of threat from its more assertive neighbor, but also of loss as China has surged past it, displacing Japan as the world's second-largest economy.
Politics has also added to the combustible mixture. China is on the brink of a once-in-a-decade shift in leadership that has not been going well, with a top party official vanquished by a scandal over his wife's murder of an English businessman, and his own grab for power.
Japan, for its part, has had a series of weak governments that some analysts, including Professor Mori, say have allowed a small but vocal group of nationalists to drive the agenda on the islands instead of doing more to convince the public that confrontation is against the country's best interests. Japanese leaders have also been constrained by public opinion, which has slowly turned against China.
''The leadership often cannot control these emotions, because they cannot afford politically to look weak,'' Professor Mori said.
The conflict flared this time as Japan announced plans to buy the privately owned islands, a move that the government said was meant to stop a nationalistic governor from doing so and possibly worsening the conflict. But Chinese officials and protesters scoffed at that explanation, saying the nationalization was meant to solidify Japan's claim.
The raging emotions at the protests in dozens of Chinese cities, which caused some business giants like Toyota to close temporarily, were enough of a shock that business leaders in Japan have begun to urge the government to try to quash the conflict.
''We must get the economic relations back on track,'' Hiromasa Yonekura, the chairman of Japan's largest business lobby group, the Keidanren, told reporters on Wednesday after a trip to Beijing was canceled because of the protests.
And just-released data in the Chinese news media show that trade may already be slowing. During the first eight months of the year, trade fell 1.4 percent to $218.7 billion, according to data from the General Administration of Customs, after increasing 14.3 percent last year. Officials said the slowing world economy was partly responsible, but also blamed concerns over political issues. The government said the growth of investment from Japan in China also slowed, growing 16 percent in the first eight months of the year compared with a 50 percent rise in the same period last year as Japanese companies seek out countries with even cheaper work forces and less-touchy diplomatic relations.
While the two countries are mutually dependent economically, some analysts in both places warn that Japan is overly dependent on China. Automakers, electronics companies and even supermarkets and convenience stores have begun investing heavily in China in part to escape shrinking demand at home.
''China and Japan need each other, but honestly speaking, Japan needs China more,'' said Kazuo Yukawa, a professor at Asia University in Tokyo. ''So Japanese feel torn. They want to defend their territory, but few would say to do so at the expense of business.''
Still, even some of those who have been hurt by the tensions understand the geopolitics driving the problem. Lin Shu Ying -- a Chinese travel agent in Tokyo who has been overwhelmed by cancellations by Japanese bound for China -- suspects that the protests will drive Japan to reconsider its reliance on China.
Indeed, the trade ministry has been working to reduce Japan's near-total reliance on China for so-called rare earths, metals used to make modern electronics, since China cut off shipments in a diplomatic showdown two years ago over the same islands.
''China will remain an important source,'' said Satoshi Hashimoto, a deputy director at the trade ministry, ''but we learned that it is dangerous to be overdependent on it.''

HEADLINE: Markets Overcome Early Losses

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow industrials ended slightly higher on Thursday while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq cut most of the day's losses in a sign that investor sentiment remained generally positive despite several weak manufacturing surveys from around the world.
Pockets of strength included housing, with an index of housing stocks up 0.8 percent, following Wednesday's gains on better-than-expected housing-market data. The S.& P. energy index rose 0.4 percent, in line with a rally in Brent crude oil prices after a three-day decline. The S.& P. utilities index gained 0.4 percent. 
''What's happening in the market is 'What's next?' '' said John De Clue, a global investment strategist at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. ''It's a classic tug of war between indicators that things are improving and, on the other hand, some things appear to be a little more troubling.''
Several economic indicators painted a sobering picture of the global economy. Manufacturing closed out its weakest quarter in three years this month, and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits held near two-month highs last week. The data followed disappointing manufacturing reports from Europe and China.
The S.& P. 500 has gained 5.9 percent since the beginning of August, driven higher mostly by expectations of more stimulus from central banks. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced its third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing, helping push stocks up last Friday within reach of five-year highs.
In a sign of bullishness, UBS raised its target level for the S.& P. 500 by the end of 2012 to 1,525 from 1,375 on Thursday, saying equity markets will climb after aggressive monetary easing by central banks.
''Over the short run, we believe that the 'risk on' trade will continue, with a rotation into the most volatile and economically sensitive stocks,'' UBS's chief United States equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, wrote in a research note.
Transportation stocks, vulnerable to the nation's economic fortunes, ranked among the worst performers a day after the railroad company Norfolk Southern said its earnings would fall short of expectations. Norfolk shares slumped 9.1 percent to $66.11.
The Dow Jones transportation average dropped 2.8 percent.
The Boston Fed president, Eric Rosengren, said that the Fed's actions last week ''should result in stronger economic growth, and return us to full employment more quickly than would be the case, absent the policies.'' He was speaking Thursday to bankers and business leaders in the metropolitan Boston area.
In a bright spot for the market, Trulia surged 41.2 percent to close at $24 in its market opening, as investors bet an improvement in the housing market would benefit the online real estate listing service.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.97 points, or 0.14 percent, to 13,596.93. The S.& P. 500 dipped 0.79 of a point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,460.26. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.66 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 3,175.96.
Manufacturing in China contracted for an 11th straight month in September, according to a private sector survey of factory managers; in the euro zone, a downturn in the service sector steepened this month at the fastest pace since July 2009.
Retailers' shares also fell. Bed Bath & Beyond tumbled 9.8 percent to $62.08 a day after the company posted quarterly results that narrowly missed Wall Street's estimates as a result of higher costs.
J. C. Penney slumped 11.2 percent to $25.83 after its chief executive, Ron Johnson, said new shops within stores are doing much better than other parts of its department stores, but it was ''way too early to draw conclusions'' as the retailer is still rolling out the strategy.
The Morgan Stanley retail index slid 1.2 percent.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32 to 98 24/32, and the yield was unchanged from late Wednesday at 1.77 percent.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis) 
&#x2605; 'Bachelorette' (R. 1:31) Drugs, booze and sex lead the list of things voraciously and carelessly consumed by three bridesmaids-to-be (Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher) on the eve of a high school friend's wedding. Leslye Headland's viciously funny satire of overgrown mean girls is a more truthful female answer to the ''Hangover'' movies. (Stephen Holden)
'Barfi!' (No rating, 2:05, in Hindi) This engagingly odd Hindi romantic comedy stars Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra: He's deaf and mute; she's autistic; they fall in love. Featuring long sequences with minimal or no dialogue, the movie, written and directed by Anurag Basu, sometimes seems mawkish and the comedy tends toward pathos. But ''Barfi!'' is also a particularly pure expression of one Bollywood's most cherished themes: love conquers all. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Dargis)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Compliance' (R, 1:30) Raising troubling questions about the influence of class and education on our response to authority, Craig Zobel's squirmy psychological horror movie, based on a series of hoaxes at fast-food restaurants nationwide, is a slow-motion punch to the groin. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Catsoulis)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Neil Genzlinger)
'The Eye of the Storm' (No rating, 1:59) Charlotte Rampling plays a domineering Australian matriarch, fighting the world, her seemingly ungrateful children (a fine Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis) and maybe herself as she clings to life in Fred Schepisi's dramatically unsteady, blustery if likable film. It was adapted by Judy Morris from the Patrick White novel. (Dargis)
'For a Good Time, Call ...' (R, 1:26) This potty-mouthed comedy about two Manhattan women who establish a successful phone-sex business to pay the rent doesn't aspire to be more than a broad, sloppy, old-fashioned sitcom with a sexy gimmick, but the bogus dirty talk is often very funny. (Holden)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to persuade boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Keep the Lights On' (No rating, 1:41) Ira Sachs's new film chronicles more than a decade in the life of a New York couple, two men (Thure Lindhardt and Zachary Booth) who meet through a casual hookup and pursue a relationship that is by turns blissful, banal, painful and tender. Mr. Sachs captures the ebb and flow of their intimacy and the crises that disrupt it with skill and sensitivity, and the performances have the oddness and particularity of real life. (Scott)
'Lawless' (R, 1:55) A blizzard of gunfire and a riot of Southern accents animate this meandering tale of violent bootleggers in Depression-era Virginia. Tom Hardy croaks like a bullfrog, Shia LaBeouf chatters like a chipmunk and Jessica Chastain pours coffee. (Scott)
'Liberal Arts' (No rating, 1:37) This slick, feel-good film about a college admissions counselor who returns to his alma mater has enough dark notes to make the smug, obsequious performance of its star, screenwriter and director, Josh Radnor, tolerable and at times even likable. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'ParaNorman' (PG, 1:33) This beautiful-looking, charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation -- from the studio that produced ''Coraline'' -- centers on an 11-year-old boy who can see ghosts and, with frights and laughter, battles a spirit. Directed by Sam Fell and the movie's screenwriter, Chris Butler. (Dargis)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'Premium Rush' (PG-13, 1:31) The director David Koepp provides about all the late summer air-conditioned relief you could hope for in this buoyant dumb-fun, ticking-clock thriller about a bicycle messenger (the dependably appealing Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has to get from here to there without being taken out by cars or a bad cop (a terrific Michael Shannon). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Resident Evil: Retribution' (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter -- shamelessly cribbing from ''Aliens'' -- and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis)
'The Right to Love: An American Family' (No rating, 1:28) Cassie Jaye's squishy documentary about two gay fathers and their adopted children diffuses its energy in the banalities of daily life, arguing for same-sex marriage with a lot of heart but not nearly enough spine. (Catsoulis)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Stephen Holden)
&#x2605; 'Step Up to the Plate' (No rating, 1:30, in French) The French chefs Michel Bras and his son Sébastien manage transitions of the generations and their three-star Michelin restaurant, contextualized by their familial heritage, their rural community and their artistic perfectionism. Foodies will be fascinated, but for anyone the film is quiet and witty, personal and detailed, smart and absorbing. (David DeWitt)
'Step Up Revolution' (PG-13, 1:39) How to stop a greedy developer from gutting a Miami neighborhood? The power of dance, of course. The fourth film in the ''Step Up'' franchise has some dandy flash-mob-style dance numbers, though like its predecessors it is burdened by a predictable plot and unintentionally laughable dialogue. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voiceover skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'10 Years' (PG-13, 1:40) It takes a while to sort out who's who in this gabby high school reunion comedy. But once you do, the movie that comes together is an unpretentious well-acted ensemble piece that doesn't aspire to be a portentous generational time capsule like ''The Big Chill,'' ''American Graffiti'' or ''Diner.'' (Holden)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Total Recall' (PG-13, 1:58) Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in this chaotic and thoroughly unmemorable science-fiction action movie, loosely remade from a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle and even more loosely based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Scott)
'The Words' (PG-13, 1:37) Despite a compelling performance from Jeremy Irons, this story within a story about literary plagiarism doesn't bear close scrutiny and has little moral weight. (Holden)
Film Series
Giallo Fever! (Friday through Thursday) Italy's ''yellow'' thrillers of the 1960s and '70s (named after the distinctively colored covers of the paperback novels they were frequently based on) have inspired a passionate following among young critics, perhaps because their air of transgression and decadence provides a liberating contrast to the blandly therapeutic themes of so much contemporary Hollywood. This overview touches on most of the genre's major figures: the operatic sadism of Dario Argento is represented by ''Deep Red'' (Saturday) and ''The Bird With the Crystal Plumage'' (Monday); Mario Bava's bold use of color is featured in ''Blood and Black Lace'' (Tuesday); and Lucio Fulci's themes of curdled sexuality surface in ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (Friday and Thursday) and ''Perversion Story'' (Sunday). A couple of art-house regulars also take a dip in the genre: Pupi Avati, with ''The House of the Laughing Windows'' (Friday and Monday), and Elio Petri, with ''A Quiet Place in the Country'' (Sunday and Thursday).

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: GIALLO FEVER! (Friday through Thursday) Italy's ''yellow'' thrillers of the 1960s and '70s (named after the distinctively colored covers of the paperback novels they were frequently based on) have inspired a passionate following among young critics, perhaps because their air of transgression and decadence provides a liberating contrast to the blandly therapeutic themes of so much contemporary Hollywood fare. This overview touches on most of the genre's major figures: the operatic sadism of Dario Argento is represented by ''Deep Red'' (Saturday) and ''The Bird With the Crystal Plumage'' (Monday)
Mario Bava's bold use of color is featured in ''Blood and Black Lace'' (Tuesday)
and Lucio Fulci's themes of curdled sexuality surface in ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (Friday and Thursday) and ''Perversion Story'' (with Marisa Mell, above), which will be shown on Sunday. A couple of art-house regulars also take a dip in the genre: Pupi Avati, with ''The House of the Laughing Windows'' (Friday and Monday), and Elio Petri, with ''A Quiet Place in the Country'' (Sunday and Thursday).

HEADLINE: Oracle's Profit Meets Forecasts, but Revenue Declines; Software Gains as Hardware Falls

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The business software maker Oracle reported quarterly earnings on Thursday that matched Wall Street's estimates, but a revenue decline signaled that the company was having a tougher time closing deals. 
The fiscal first-quarter results from Oracle were the latest indication that companies and government agencies were cutting back on technology spending amid mounting uncertainty about the economy.
Oracle reported net income of $2.03 billion, or 41 cents a share, for the three months ending in August. That is an 11 percent increase from net income of $1.84 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain accounting items, the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., said it earned 53 cents a share, mirroring analysts' projections.
Revenue dipped 2 percent from last year to $8.18 billion. That was more than $200 million below analysts' forecasts.
Like many American companies that depend on overseas customers for much of their sales, Oracle was hurt by weakening currencies in Europe and other parts of the world. The currency fluctuations translated into fewer dollars during the latest quarter compared with a year earlier.
If exchange rates had remained unchanged, Oracle said, its earnings would have been higher by 3 cents a share and its revenue would have edged up 3 percent instead of dropping.
Concerns surrounding weakening economies in Europe and the unwieldy debts being shouldered by some European countries have put pressure on the euro, which is used by 17 European countries.
Those worries are also weighing on decision makers in corporate and government technology departments, making them more reluctant to invest in new products and features until they get a better handle on the economy's direction.
The manufacturers of personal computers, processors and other hardware have been hurt the most by this trend, but Oracle's performance may raise questions about whether business software makers are starting to feel the pinch, too.
Oracle continued to struggle in its recent foray into hardware, a move punctuated by the company's $7.3 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010. Oracle's total hardware revenue plunged 19 percent from a year ago.
Database and applications software remains Oracle's financial backbone.
In a crucial indicator of the company's health, Oracle's sales of new software licenses and subscriptions rose 5 percent from a year earlier. This category is watched closely by investors because new licenses provide the foundation for future upgrades and maintenance, creating a steady stream of recurring revenue.
The pace of Oracle's software sales decelerated from the previous quarter. During the three months ending in May, Oracle's new software licenses increased 7 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Focusing on Education, With an Eye on the Voters

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune.
The boilerplate for conservatives talking about education usually includes getting more school money into classrooms and out of administration. It usually does not edge into the dangerous ground of teachers' salaries.
But this year, in the wake of deep cuts in the state's public education budget, some Republican candidates are talking about getting more money into classrooms by raising pay for teachers. 
Take State Representative Jason Isaac, a freshman Republican from Dripping Springs, who says the teacher pay he is now emphasizing has always been in his political portfolio. It is getting attention this year for a couple of reasons. He is running against John Adams, a Democrat and a former school trustee. And voters have added education to the list of electoral concerns, like jobs and the economy, that dominated recent election cycles. It is also a defensive strategy: Republicans who voted for the current budget, with its $5.4 billion in education cuts, have to fend off questions about teacher layoffs and pay.
According to the Texas State Teachers Association (which has endorsed Mr. Isaac's challenger), average teacher pay dropped slightly in the 2011-12 school year for the first time in more than a decade. And the 25,000 layoffs the association counted in Texas public schools that year include 11,000 teachers. Meanwhile, those same schools are adding about 80,000 students per year.
Mr. Isaac's pitch goes like this: The state has too many mandates for local school districts that force those districts to spend money outside the classrooms. As he put it in a recent campaign piece: ''Administrative costs have skyrocketed, in part due to increasing unfunded mandates from the state and federal government, while teachers' salaries have only seen minimal increases. Teachers are one of the most important factors in a child's education, and this should be one of the highest-paying occupations. I will continue to advocate for more spending in the classroom, including teacher pay.''
Sounds like something a Democrat might say. Or -- this is important -- a voter.
Teachers' groups are almost reflexively Democratic. Mr. Isaac's district has voted for Republicans in most statewide elections lately, but it is one of those zones that could be competitive this year.
Candidates like Mr. Isaac are more interested in where the voters sit. He is taking a pro-education line against an education candidate, but it might work in this rural-turned-bedroom community anyway. People are there, in part, for the schools. Even the conservatives.
His angle on teacher raises is distinctly different from what you might hear from a Democrat. He wants to get rid of state minimums and maximums for teacher salaries, to leave those decisions to local districts and to let competition between districts and between teachers within districts balance the pay scales. He is vague on the details of how he would keep the rich districts from outrunning the poor ones, but he says there ought to be a way to make teachers the highest-paid school workers.
This is a bad piece of road for Texas officeholders. They have promised their price-sensitive constituents they will not raise taxes, and they have promised not to undermine things like public education when they are holding the line on spending. If those voters turn their attention from one thing to the other -- from taxes, say, to education -- Mr. Isaac and his colleagues have to pivot with them.
Look at State Representative Stefani Carter, a Dallas Republican who, like Mr. Isaac, was elected in 2010's conservative wave. She, too, insists that more of the education money should be spent in classrooms. She, too, voted for the budget and its cuts, though she and Mr. Isaac took opposite sides on legislation allowing local districts to lower teacher pay (he was for it, she was against it). She also has a Democratic opponent who is endorsed by the teachers' association, and she also finds herself talking about education this year.
The political interest in public education is coming into bloom as the state enters its latest round of budget-driving lawsuits over how schools are financed. Student accountability testing is a hot topic too.
The price of government programs and services is still critically important in political contests, but it is not the only thing driving the debate.

HEADLINE: Behind Scenes, Some Lawmakers Push to Change the Volcker Rule

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
As regulators put the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street, they remain entangled in a partisan fight over the overhaul.
In public letters and closed-door meetings, more than 100 lawmakers have lobbied the Federal Reserve and other authorities over the Volcker Rule, records show. The rule, intended to restrict banks from placing risky trades and investing with hedge funds, has drawn an outcry from Republicans who want to mute its effect and some Democrats who want to strengthen it.
The wrangling has been on display at public hearings and in letters posted on regulatory Web sites. Still, some lawmakers have applied pressure behind the scenes.
Internal government documents provide a glimpse of one such lobbying effort last year, when an aide to Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, appealed to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. 
The documents show a back-and-forth between the Fed's top lawyer and Mr. Brown's staff. "I have a very urgent request," Nathaniel Hoopes, Mr. Brown's aide, wrote in an April 2011 e-mail. Seeking to fine-tune an exemption, he argued that a broad range of bank customers should be allowed to invest with hedge funds under the Volcker Rule. "My boss has been hearing it from constituents," he added, referring to the rule's impact on Massachusetts-based financial firms.
In a first draft of the rule released last fall, regulators agreed with that broad definition.
In response to Mr. Hoopes's e-mail, the Fed's general counsel, Scott G. Alvarez, acknowledged that "there are many difficult issues raised by the Volcker Rule." In another e-mail, Mr. Alvarez encouraged Mr. Brown's office to publicly voice its concerns, according to interviews with government officials and the documents. The Fed initially released the documents to a Democratic aide who obtained them through a public records inquiry.
In a statement, the Fed said that it routinely "seeks comment from the public and all interested parties on our rule-makings and carefully evaluates and weighs each comment."
The Fed, like all regulators, provides feedback to lawmakers and has held several meetings with advocacy groups that support the Volcker Rule, including Americans for Financial Reform.
Still, the e-mails - while not improper or unusual - show that such discussions are not always public. The exchange with Mr. Hoopes came months before regulators opened a public comment period or even publicly released a draft version of the Volcker Rule.
The e-mails also indicate how, even after passing the Dodd-Frank Act, some lawmakers are still tinkering with its machinery.
Mr. Hoopes, who previously worked for an arm of Lehman Brothers, also pressed his case with the Treasury Department. In an e-mail to a Treasury official, he said, "This should be very simple and straightforward and I think the Fed is over-complicating it."(The Boston Globe first reported about the e-mail this summer.)
Mr. Brown, one of three Republicans to vote for Dodd-Frank, is in a tight re-election fight with Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat. She made her name in Washington as a fierce critic of Wall Street and supporter of changes like the Volcker Rule.
The partisan haggling over the rule affects a number of regulators. But much of the pressure has centered on the Fed, where some lawyers have questioned whether the rule is too burdensome for Wall Street, according to government officials briefed on the matter. Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the rule-writing process is private.
"The Volcker Rule regulations have unfortunately been long delayed, obviously in my mind because the agencies are having difficulties reaching agreement," said Michael Bradfield, the former general counsel at the Fed. "The well-known skepticism of some in the Fed about the workability of the Volcker Rule has undoubtedly contributed to this situation."
Few rules present a greater challenge - or have provoked more political squabbling - than this one. Named for Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman who campaigned for the rule, it aims to curb the sort of risk-taking that led to government bailouts in the financial crisis. The rule would largely prevent banks from making bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading. It would also limit how banks invest in hedge funds.
But a draft proposal, released last fall, granted several broad exemptions to the proprietary trading ban. Regulators recently entered a final stage of rule-writing after a group of lawyers from the Fed and other agencies ironed out concerns over several exemptions, according to people briefed on the matter. While regulators initially hoped to complete the rule by September, the people said, they now expect a final version around the November election.
Several Democrats, echoing the antibank animus of the election season, have pushed the Fed to narrow the Volcker Rule exemptions.
Some regulators have stepped up their focus on the rule, too.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is helping to write the overhaul, said in a letter to the Fed last week that certain exemptions would "significantly undercut the fundamental purposes of the rule."
Republican lawmakers counter that Dodd-Frank could jeopardize an already anemic economic recovery.
Mr. Brown, whose donors include major mutual funds like Fidelity, has been particularly vocal.
He supported the Volcker Rule after chipping away at one of its core tenets. During the debate on Capitol Hill, Mr. Brown championed an exemption that allowed banks to invest up to a 3 percent stake in hedge funds. Banks can also offer hedge fund investments to outside investors like pension funds.
Now, Mr. Brown is fighting over the details of the exemption. While Democrats want to restrict access to customers who already have an account with the bank, Mr. Brown wants to expand the definition of "qualified investors."
A spokeswoman for Mr. Brown said he was "proud to cast the deciding vote" for Dodd-Frank and that he worked "to protect Massachusetts jobs."
In his lobbying, Mr. Hoopes first appealed to the Treasury Department, but then took his concerns to the Fed. A "narrow definition," Mr. Hoopes warned in an April 2011 e-mail to the Fed, "was not intended for this purpose" and would shift money to unregulated pockets of the market.
In reply, Mr. Alvarez of the Fed suggested that Mr. Brown file a public comment letter. "Others have been commenting on various ways we should interpret the statute, and we would consider very carefully any comment from you as well," Mr. Alvarez wrote.
What happened next is unclear. While Mr. Hoopes had a brief phone call with the Fed, people briefed on the matter said, no one can recall specifics or whether Volcker was even discussed.
Mr. Hoopes soon filed a comment letter and thanked Mr. Alvarez "for all the quick responses to my questions, etc." It is unclear to what questions Mr. Hoopes was referring.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Reversing Trend, Life Span Shrinks for Some Whites

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
For generations of Americans, it was a given that children would live longer than their parents. But there is now mounting evidence that this enduring trend has reversed itself for the country's least-educated whites, an increasingly troubled group whose life expectancy has fallen by four years since 1990.
Researchers have long documented that the most educated Americans were making the biggest gains in life expectancy, but now they say mortality data show that life spans for some of the least educated Americans are actually contracting. Four studies in recent years identified modest declines, but a new one that looks separately at Americans lacking a high school diploma found disturbingly sharp drops in life expectancy for whites in this group. Experts not involved in the new research said its findings were persuasive.
The reasons for the decline remain unclear, but researchers offered possible explanations, including a spike in prescription drug overdoses among young whites, higher rates of smoking among less educated white women, rising obesity, and a steady increase in the number of the least educated Americans who lack health insurance. 
The steepest declines were for white women without a high school diploma, who lost five years of life between 1990 and 2008, said S. Jay Olshansky, a public health professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the lead investigator on the study, published last month in Health Affairs. By 2008, life expectancy for black women without a high school diploma had surpassed that of white women of the same education level, the study found.
White men lacking a high school diploma lost three years of life. Life expectancy for both blacks and Hispanics of the same education level rose, the data showed. But blacks over all do not live as long as whites, while Hispanics live longer than both whites and blacks.
''We're used to looking at groups and complaining that their mortality rates haven't improved fast enough, but to actually go backward is deeply troubling,'' said John G. Haaga, head of the Population and Social Processes Branch of the National Institute on Aging, who was not involved in the new study.
The five-year decline for white women rivals the catastrophic seven-year drop for Russian men in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, said Michael Marmot, director of the Institute of Health Equity in London.
The decline among the least educated non-Hispanic whites, who make up a shrinking share of the population, widened an already troubling gap. The latest estimate shows life expectancy for white women without a high school diploma was 73.5 years, compared with 83.9 years for white women with a college degree or more. For white men, the gap was even bigger: 67.5 years for the least educated white men compared with 80.4 for those with a college degree or better.
The dropping life expectancies have helped weigh down the United States in international life expectancy rankings, particularly for women. In 2010, American women fell to 41st place, down from 14th place in 1985, in the United Nations rankings. Among developed countries, American women sank from the middle of the pack in 1970 to last place in 2010, according to the Human Mortality Database.
The slump is so vexing that it became the subject of an inquiry by the National Academy of Sciences, which published a report on it last year.
''There's this enormous issue of why,'' said David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard who was an author of a 2008 paper that found modest declines in life expectancy for less educated white women from 1981 to 2000. ''It's very puzzling and we don't have a great explanation.''
And it is yet another sign of distress in one of the country's most vulnerable groups during a period when major social changes are transforming life for less educated whites. Childbirth outside marriage has soared, increasing pressures on women who are more likely to be single parents. Those who do marry tend to choose mates with similar education levels, concentrating the disadvantage.
Inklings of this decline have been accumulating since 2008. Professor Cutler's paper, published in Health Affairs, found a decline in life expectancy of about a year for less educated white women from 1990 to 2000. Three other studies, by Ahmedin Jemal, a researcher at the American Cancer Society; Jennifer Karas Montez, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholar at Harvard; and Richard Miech, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver, found increases in mortality rates (the ratio of deaths to a population) for the least educated Americans.
Professor Olshansky's study, financed by the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on an Aging Society, found by far the biggest decline in life expectancy for the least educated non-Hispanic whites, in large part because he isolated those without a high school diploma, a group usually combined with high school graduates. Non-Hispanic whites currently make up 63 percent of the population of the United States.
Researchers said they were baffled by the magnitude of the drop. Some cautioned that the results could be overstated because Americans without a high school diploma -- about 12 percent of the population, down from about 22 percent in 1990, according to the Census Bureau -- were a shrinking group that was now more likely to be disadvantaged in ways besides education, compared with past generations.
Professor Olshansky agreed that the group was now smaller, but said the magnitude of the drop in life expectancy was still a measure of deterioration. ''The good news is that there are fewer people in this group,'' he said. ''The bad news is that those who are in it are dying more quickly.''
Researchers, including some involved in the earlier studies that found more modest declines in life expectancy, said that Professor Olshansky's methodology was sound and that the findings reinforced evidence of a troubling pattern that has emerged for those at the bottom of the education ladder, particularly white women.
''Something is going on in the lives of disadvantaged white women that is leading to some really alarming trends in life expectancy,'' said Ms. Montez of Harvard.
Researchers offered theories for the drop in life expectancy, but cautioned that none could fully explain it.
James Jackson, director of the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan and an author of the new study, said white women with low levels of education may exhibit more risky behavior than that of previous generations.
Overdoses from prescription drugs have spiked since 1990, disproportionately affecting whites, particularly women. Professor Miech, of the University of Colorado, noted the rise in a 2011 paper in the American Sociological Review, arguing that it was among the biggest changes for whites in recent decades and that it appeared to have offset gains for less educated people in the rate of heart attacks.
Ms. Montez, who studies women's health, said that smoking was a big part of declines in life expectancy for less educated women. Smoking rates have increased among women without a high school diploma, both white and black, she said. But for men of the same education level, they have declined.
This group also has less access to health care than before. The share of working-age adults with less than a high school diploma who did not have health insurance rose to 43 percent in 2006, up from 35 percent in 1993, according to Mr. Jemal at the American Cancer Society. Just 10 percent of those with a college degree were uninsured last year, the Census Bureau reported.
The shift should be seen against the backdrop of sweeping changes in the American economy and in women's lives, said Lisa Berkman, director of the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. The overwhelming majority of women now work, while fertility has remained higher than in European countries. For women in low-wage jobs, which are often less flexible, this could take a toll on health, a topic that Professor Berkman has a grant from the National Institute on Aging to study.

HEADLINE: Why Presidents Love Foreign Affairs

BYLINE: By DANIEL W. DREZNER. 
Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at Tufts.

 BODY:
I'D like to apologize to American voters. I'm one of the 5 percent. The 5 percent, that is, who vote in presidential elections based on the foreign policy views of the candidates. It might seem to the other 95 percent of you that we pull the strings. At his taped fund-raiser, for example, Mitt Romney complained that the common folk weren't asking him enough foreign policy questions. It certainly must appear as if we control presidents once they're elected -- after their first year in office, all we read about is that they're attending some fancy-pants summit meeting or using force somewhere exotic.
While I wish that this were true, the reality is a lot more complex. Really, those of us paying attention to foreign policy are trying to do the rest of you a favor. Maybe if some of you paid attention to the rest of the world as well, American presidents would be more cautious about expending blood and treasure abroad. That sounds crazy, but it's true. 
I was being generous with the ''5 percent'' appellation. Poll after poll shows that when Americans are asked what they consider the most important issue in presidential campaigns, an overwhelming majority choose the economy. Answers related to foreign policy or national security typically yield between 3 and 5 percent.
Many pollsters don't even bother asking about international issues because it seems manifestly obvious that they're not terribly important. When pollsters prod Americans about their foreign policy views, the results are clear: they want the government to focus less on the rest of the world.
Politicians are not blind to these numbers. Short of a war or other violent attacks on American installations, foreign policy rarely takes center stage during presidential elections. Presidential candidates almost always campaign on how they intend to jump-start the economy.
It must be maddening to voters, then, that about a year or two after they are elected, presidents seem to devote an ever increasing amount of time to the rest of the world. The Balkans appeared to consume the Clinton administration. George W. Bush launched two wars during his tenure. Barack Obama has devoted a considerable amount of his time to revamping counterterrorism policies, rebalancing attention to the Pacific Rim, prosecuting a war in Libya -- and killing Osama bin Laden.
Why do presidents campaign as economic wizards but govern as foreign policy leaders? The first thing to realize is that presidents are not doing this on purpose. Their focus on foreign policy actually reveals the constraints on the modern American presidency.
On most big economic matters, presidents cannot act alone. Congress has to approve things like budgets and taxes, and in case you haven't noticed, Congress has become increasingly sclerotic. During the 1950s, for example, Congress passed an average of 800 laws per session; in the post-cold-war era, that figure has declined to fewer than 400. Based on the 112th Congress, that figure will continue to decline in the future.
The party not in the White House has been increasingly obstructionist -- and if you doubt this, look up the filibuster statistics. Any president trying to accomplish something with Congressional approval either needs a majority of the House and 60 votes in the Senate, or needs to compromise with an opposition party ever further away on the ideological spectrum. Short of a landslide, presidents have a brief honeymoon period in which to push major domestic policy initiatives through Congress.
If presidents seem to be ever more constrained in their domestic policy making, in foreign affairs the executive branch has far more leeway. Sure, Congress has to approve treaties and budgets, but they are reluctant to challenge the executive branch on most national security matters. The Bush administration was able to implement the Iraq surge despite skeptical majorities in both houses of Congress. The Obama administration authorized the use of force in Libya without even notifying Congress. Neither policy was terribly popular with the American people, yet both presidents were able to do what they wanted.
Indeed, invoking national security seems to eliminate a disturbing number of institutional impediments for the executive branch. The National Security Agency can admit that it violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of illegal search and seizure without much in the way of political or legal blowback.
Of course, all of this presumes that presidents can control the international environment. This is an utter fantasy. As the 9/11 attacks made clear, small groups of actors can be responsible for large conflagrations. The pretext for the recent attacks on American embassies and consulates across the Middle East was a cartoonish YouTube video. If that is the bar for inciting action against American interests, then any intelligence agency would drown in possible provocations. Most of the time presidents don't pick the foreign policy issues they want to tackle -- the issues choose them.
America remains the world's pre-eminent power. This means that whenever something happens somewhere in the world, the expectation is that the United States will be part of the policy solution. When presidents are reluctant to intervene, they are attacked by domestic and foreign adversaries as being weak, passive or ''leading from behind.''
It's precisely because presidents have so much more leeway to do what they want in the global realm that I now vote based on foreign policy. Mistakes in international affairs can lead to incalculable losses in blood and treasure. Paradoxically, if Americans suddenly started to vote based on national security issues, presidents would have to start to care about the domestic political consequences of their overseas actions.
Who knows, they might just start redirecting their efforts to problems at home.

HEADLINE: Daunting Path Greets Romney Before Debates

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There are seven days until early voting begins in Iowa, less than two weeks until the first debate and 46 days left in the race for Mitt Romney to change the dynamic of a campaign that by many indicators is tilting against him.
That, advisers to President Obama acknowledge, is plenty of time.
But the burden rests to a remarkable degree directly on Mr. Romney and his ability to restore confidence to his campaign, become a more nimble candidate and clearly explain to voters why he would be the better choice to repair the economy and lead the nation in addressing its challenges at home and abroad.
The state-by-state landscape facing Mr. Romney is more daunting than he expected by this stage in the contest. He anticipated, aides said, to be in a position of strength in at least some of the states that turned Democratic in 2008 for the first time in a generation, but few of them show signs of breaking decisively his way, and Mr. Obama still has more and clearer paths to 270 electoral votes. 
And as Mr. Romney works to move beyond one of the most turbulent periods of his candidacy, in a week dominated by the disclosure of remarks in which he said that 47 percent of Americans do not pay taxes and see themselves as victims, he is starting to confront criticism from some in his party who worry that his troubles will affect their own races.
''The presidential thing is bound to have an impact on every election,'' Tommy G. Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor who is the Republican candidate for the Senate there, said in an interview on Wednesday with a Madison television station. ''If your standard-bearer for the presidency is not doing well, it's going to reflect on the down ballot.''
While Mr. Romney remains deadlocked with Mr. Obama in most national polls, anxiety among Republicans about the presidential race, the seeming lurching nature of Mr. Romney's campaign and his own miscues have spread far beyond Washington. Republican strategists across the country said in interviews that their candidates were being asked about Mr. Romney's remarks, creating an unwelcome potential trap for those in tough races.
Mr. Romney has sought to turn the issue against Mr. Obama, calling the president an advocate of redistributing wealth and emphasizing, ''My campaign is about the 100 percent of America.'' But as the two candidates campaigned in Florida on Thursday, Mr. Obama focused on Mr. Romney's ''47 percent'' comments.
''My thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot,'' Mr. Obama said about Mr. Romney in an appearance at a Univision forum in Coral Gables.
There is a growing sense of frustration among Republicans that Mr. Romney has yet to take a commanding lead in any of the major battleground states -- especially North Carolina, which is tied with South Carolina for having the nation's fifth-worst unemployment rate, or Nevada, which has the nation's highest jobless rate, 12 percent.
In Ohio, Florida and Colorado, Republicans who support Mr. Romney's efforts said they were worried that he was not campaigning enough in their states and that resources were not trickling into vital counties.
''Could we use yard signs? Could we use information data?'' said A. J. Matthews, a Republican State Committee member from Hillsborough County, Fla. ''What would we most like from Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan? Visit us more.''
In Ohio, some Republicans have expressed concern that Mr. Romney was not spending more money and appearing more frequently in rural counties where he needs a strong turnout to win the state -- and where his ''47 percent'' comments threaten to undercut support among working-class voters otherwise inclined to vote for him. A bus trip by Mr. Romney next week may address some of these worries.
In Colorado, Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist and a former state party chairman, said he hoped to see Mr. Romney campaign harder for swing voters in suburban Denver, and he said he was pleased the candidate was planning to visit the state on Sunday, the first time in seven weeks.
Speaking of those swing voters, Mr. Wadhams said, ''They want to vote against Obama, but they haven't quite come to the point where they're going to vote for Romney.''
Mr. Wadhams and other party leaders said, however, that they were heartened by Mr. Romney's get-out-the-vote operations. Republicans say Mr. Romney's on-the-ground efforts are far superior to those of Senator John McCain in 2008.
Officials at the Romney campaign said they believed some of the concern in the tossup states was being created by what they described as hyped news media reporting on Mr. Romney's latest missteps. The campaign has been meticulously thought out, they said, and its supporters have yet to see activity that, by design, was not scheduled to begin until near the end of the race.
''We're making some very strategic decisions,'' said Rich Beeson, the political director. ''And when we're coming down to the end, you'll see the governor everywhere he needs to be.''
Mr. Romney has yet to take command of any battleground states, according to polls, many of which show Mr. Obama with an edge. The Romney campaign has been focusing on Iowa as one of its more promising states, but an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College poll released Thursday evening showed Mr. Obama with an 8-point advantage there.
In a stop near Des Moines, Ann Romney said it was time for Republicans to stop second-guessing her husband. ''Stop it. This is hard,'' she told Radio Iowa. ''You want to try it? Get in the ring.''
The president and his aides are aware that everything could change in an instant, particularly with three presidential debates looming, and said Democrats could not be complacent.
But for the first time in many months, Mr. Obama's job approval rating has reached 50 percent in several recent polls. He has taken the edge away from Mr. Romney on questions of who voters believe will be a better steward of the economy, which coincides with the release of modestly positive economic signals.
Construction of new houses and home sales have reached their highest levels in more than two years, new reports show, and the Census Bureau reported that the number of young adults living at home with their parents -- a vivid indicator of the personal effect of the recession on young people -- is dropping.
Yet the president must still contend with his campaign promises made four years ago, including his pledge to change Washington. When asked about that Thursday during the Univision forum, he said change must come from the ''outside.''
Speaking to supporters in Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Romney seized on the remark as an admission of failure, saying: ''The president today threw in the white flag of surrender. He went from the president of change to the president who can't get change.''
For all of the open fretting among Republicans, several party leaders say Mr. Romney still has an opportunity to win over voters who are ready to reject Mr. Obama.
''Romney has not made the sale yet with the 5 or 10 percent that are undecided, and he very well could,'' said Mike DeWine, Ohio's attorney general. ''It's a very doable thing for Romney to win Ohio and very doable for him to win the race.''
As Mr. Romney headed to an evening fund-raiser in West Palm Beach, Fla., a reporter asked if he would be campaigning more extensively.
''Ha, ha. We're in the stretch, aren't we?'' Mr. Romney said before promptly changing the subject and pointing to the sky. ''Look at those clouds. It's beautiful. Look at those things.''

HEADLINE: Bill to Keep Graduates In U.S. Fails In the House

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
A Republican bill to provide permanent resident visas for foreigners who graduate from American universities with advanced degrees in science and technology failed to pass the House on Thursday, a setback for technology companies that had strongly supported it.
Republican leaders called the vote under a fast-track procedure that limits debate but also requires a two-thirds majority to pass. The final tally was 257 to 158, with all but a few Republicans joined by 30 Democrats in voting yes, well short of passage.
The bill, sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, would have eliminated an annual lottery and instead allocated 55,000 visas for legal permanent residency, known as green cards, each year to foreigners who have completed master's and doctoral degrees from American universities in the STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The lottery now distributes the same number of green cards to foreigners from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. 
While Congressional Republicans have taken a hard line on illegal immigration, they said they wanted to show before the November elections that they were ready to pass a measure to fix a widely acknowledged flaw in the legal immigration system.
A fierce fight broke out during the brief floor debate on Thursday, with Democrats strongly opposed to ending the lottery. Democratic leaders accused Republicans of partisan posturing by rushing a vote on an immigration issue when, they said, bipartisan accord was within reach. There is uncommonly broad consensus in Congress on the legislation's underlying goal -- keeping talented and highly educated foreign science graduates in the country so they can work and start businesses.
The bill would ''help us create jobs, increase our competitiveness and spur our innovation,'' Mr. Smith said after the vote. ''Unfortunately, the Democrats voted today to send the best and brightest foreign graduates back home to work for our global competitors.''
Democrats had voted ''against economic growth and job creation,'' Mr. Smith said.
Democrats were led in their challenge by Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, whose district includes many Silicon Valley technology companies and who had offered a competing bill last week. While saying ''it pains me greatly'' to vote no, Ms. Lofgren said the Republican proposal had ''another, in my opinion, more sinister purpose -- to actually reduce legal immigration levels.''
Ms. Lofgren's proposal would have created 50,000 new green cards for foreign science graduates, without eliminating or reducing the lottery.
Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said, ''We strongly oppose a zero-sum game that trades one legal immigration program for another.''
Democrats want to preserve the lottery because many immigrants who come through it are from Africa and small Asian nations. Leaders of the black, Hispanic and Asian-American caucuses in the House released a letter this week opposing the bill.
Mr. Smith said the lottery was vulnerable to fraud and created security risks, since he said terrorists could use it to gain residence in the United States.
Technology and business groups had mobilized an all-out show of support for the bill. Several dozen major employers, including Adobe, Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, sent their own letter on Wednesday appealing for a bipartisan effort to pass some legislation to provide new visas.
Currently, many foreign science and technology graduates who finish their advanced studies either have to leave the country or remain on restrictive temporary visas and wait, sometimes for years, for permanent green cards.
After the vote, Democrats appealed to Republicans to return to negotiations to find a compromise. ''There is too broad a consensus in favor of this policy to settle for gridlock,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who presented his own proposal this week to add new green cards for highly skilled foreigners.
But disappointed Republicans predicted there would be little time to take up a visa measure again in a year-end session that is already overloaded with major business.

HEADLINE: Disdain For Workers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
By now everyone knows how Mitt Romney, speaking to donors in Boca Raton, washed his hands of almost half the country -- the 47 percent who don't pay income taxes -- declaring, ''My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.'' By now, also, many people are aware that the great bulk of the 47 percent are hardly moochers; most are working families who pay payroll taxes, and elderly or disabled Americans make up a majority of the rest.
But here's the question: Should we imagine that Mr. Romney and his party would think better of the 47 percent on learning that the great majority of them actually are or were hard workers, who very much have taken personal responsibility for their lives? And the answer is no. 
For the fact is that the modern Republican Party just doesn't have much respect for people who work for other people, no matter how faithfully and well they do their jobs. All the party's affection is reserved for ''job creators,'' a k a employers and investors. Leading figures in the party find it hard even to pretend to have any regard for ordinary working families -- who, it goes without saying, make up the vast majority of Americans.
Am I exaggerating? Consider the Twitter message sent out by Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, on Labor Day -- a holiday that specifically celebrates America's workers. Here's what it said, in its entirety: ''Today, we celebrate those who have taken a risk, worked hard, built a business and earned their own success.'' Yes, on a day set aside to honor workers, all Mr. Cantor could bring himself to do was praise their bosses.
Lest you think that this was just a personal slip, consider Mr. Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. What did he have to say about American workers? Actually, nothing: the words ''worker'' or ''workers'' never passed his lips. This was in strong contrast to President Obama's convention speech a week later, which put a lot of emphasis on workers -- especially, of course, but not only, workers who benefited from the auto bailout.
And when Mr. Romney waxed rhapsodic about the opportunities America offered to immigrants, he declared that they came in pursuit of ''freedom to build a business.'' What about those who came here not to found businesses, but simply to make an honest living? Not worth mentioning.
Needless to say, the G.O.P.'s disdain for workers goes deeper than rhetoric. It's deeply embedded in the party's policy priorities. Mr. Romney's remarks spoke to a widespread belief on the right that taxes on working Americans are, if anything, too low. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal famously described low-income workers whose wages fall below the income-tax threshold as ''lucky duckies.''
What really needs cutting, the right believes, are taxes on corporate profits, capital gains, dividends, and very high salaries -- that is, taxes that fall on investors and executives, not ordinary workers. This despite the fact that people who derive their income from investments, not wages -- people like, say, Willard Mitt Romney -- already pay remarkably little in taxes.
Where does this disdain for workers come from? Some of it, obviously, reflects the influence of money in politics: big-money donors, like the ones Mr. Romney was speaking to when he went off on half the nation, don't live paycheck to paycheck. But it also reflects the extent to which the G.O.P. has been taken over by an Ayn Rand-type vision of society, in which a handful of heroic businessmen are responsible for all economic good, while the rest of us are just along for the ride.
In the eyes of those who share this vision, the wealthy deserve special treatment, and not just in the form of low taxes. They must also receive respect, indeed deference, at all times. That's why even the slightest hint from the president that the rich might not be all that -- that, say, some bankers may have behaved badly, or that even ''job creators'' depend on government-built infrastructure -- elicits frantic cries that Mr. Obama is a socialist.
Now, such sentiments aren't new; ''Atlas Shrugged'' was, after all, published in 1957. In the past, however, even Republican politicians who privately shared the elite's contempt for the masses knew enough to keep it to themselves and managed to fake some appreciation for ordinary workers. At this point, however, the party's contempt for the working class is apparently too complete, too pervasive to hide.
The point is that what people are now calling the Boca Moment wasn't some trivial gaffe. It was a window into the true attitudes of what has become a party of the wealthy, by the wealthy, and for the wealthy, a party that considers the rest of us unworthy of even a pretense of respect.

HEADLINE: Just the Latest to Trip Over a Tongue

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
As critics pummel Mitt Romney over his secretly recorded comments at a fund-raiser, he can at least take comfort in this: He's not the first.
Presidential campaign history overflows with candidates who tripped over their own loose tongues -- some obscuring their actual meaning, others accidentally revealing it. Even a cursory analysis shows that well over 47 percent of races for the White House have seen a candidate suffer self-inflicted wounds.
In Mr. Romney's case, he has stood by his remarks, but nevertheless acknowledged he had spoken inelegantly. 
Consider what follows a list of the Top 10 verbal misfires under the pitiless glare on the national political stage.
¶Senator John McCain, 2008: ''The fundamentals of the economy are strong.''
This off-key attempt at reassurance, delivered in mid-September as Lehman Brothers was collapsing, helped seal the fate of a losing campaign. The beneficiary was Barack Obama, who had endured his own embarrassment over a secretly recorded remark to donors that some working-class voters ''cling to their guns or religion'' as reasons to support Republicans.
¶Senator John Kerry, 2004: ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it.''
The unfortunate comment about money to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, made by Mr. Kerry in March during a college event in Pennsylvania, helped cement his reputation as an equivocating politician after President George W. Bush's campaign exploited it in mocking television ads.
¶Vice President Al Gore, 2000: ''I took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
Critics seized on this clumsy assertion, made during a March 1999 CNN interview, to lampoon Mr. Gore as a brazen embellisher taking credit for the innovation. The attacks later helped George W. Bush's campaign to influence media post-mortems after a fall 2000 debate in which Mr. Gore made minor misstatements. Mr. Gore ultimately received more votes; Mr. Bush moved into the White House the next January.
¶President Bill Clinton, 1996: ''You think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too.''
With that acknowledgment at a 1995 Houston fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton roiled Democrats, Republicans and his own aides. He won re-election easily anyway, in part by linking his Republican opponent, Bob Dole, to Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had bluntly predicted his agenda would cause the existing structure of Medicare to ''wither on the vine.''
¶President George Bush, 1992: ''Message: I care.''
Stung by accusations that he was disconnected from the economic struggles of average Americans, Mr. Bush fueled them by giving New Hampshire voters this piece of political stage direction. Mr. Clinton's ''It's the economy, stupid'' campaign proved resonant enough to withstand publication of a 1970 letter in which he acknowledged having avoided fighting in Vietnam without resisting the draft ''to preserve my political viability.'' He won a three-way race against Mr. Bush and Ross Perot.
¶Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, 1988: ''I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.''
This emotionless response, to a debate question whose hypothetical premise involving the rape and murder of his wife, fixed Mr. Dukakis's image as a governmental technocrat at odds with most Americans on the high-voltage issue of crime and punishment.
That liability trumped the plutocratic mien that George Bush, then the vice president, had taken on in explaining his Iowa straw poll defeat this way: ''A lot of the people who support me, they were at an air show, they were at their daughter's coming-out party, or teeing up at the golf course in that all-important last round.'' Mr. Bush won handily.
¶Walter F. Mondale, 1984: ''Mr. Reagan will raise taxes and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.''
Intending to impress with candor, Mr. Mondale handed President Ronald Reagan a weapon with this stunner in his speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. Reagan's celebration of ''Morning in America'' and warnings against tax-and-spend liberalism produced a landslide -- despite his shaky debate performances, most famous for one rambling response that began: ''I remember driving down the California coast one day.''
¶Ronald Reagan, 1980: ''Approximately 80 percent of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation.''
Democrats used this so-called killer trees statement to cast Reagan as a know-nothing, extremist, retired actor. But economic conditions and the plight of American hostages in Iran created such an appetite for change that Reagan swept to victory after dismissing a debate attack from President Jimmy Carter with the killer rejoinder, ''There you go again.''
¶President Gerald Ford, 1976: ''There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.''
The misstatement, intended to signal solidarity with those under the Soviet Union's thumb, allowed Mr. Carter to question the incumbent's foreign policy acumen. Mr. Carter won a close race despite his own awkward confession to Playboy magazine that he had ''committed adultery in my heart many times.''
¶George W. Romney, 1968: ''When I came back from Vietnam I just had the greatest brainwashing anybody can get.''
This summer 1967 remark, about Mr. Romney's conversations with American diplomats and military leaders on the war in Southeast Asia, led to the collapse of his challenge to Richard M. Nixon for the Republican nomination. It also prompted this lacerating response from the Democratic candidate Eugene McCarthy: ''A light rinse would have been sufficient.''
That catastrophic gaffe produced a striking bit of recent political analysis -- from Mr. Romney's son Mitt. During his failed bid for the 2008 Republican nomination, the younger Mr. Romney said his father's experience was ''probably not that applicable to today'' because candidates possess heightened awareness of their vulnerability.
''Running for president in the YouTube era, you realize you have to be very judicious in what you say,'' Mr. Romney told The New York Times in 2007. ''You have to be careful with your humor. You have to recognize that anytime you're running for the presidency of the United States, you're on.''

HEADLINE: Circuit Court Needs to Let The S.E.C. Do Its Job

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The second-most important court in the United States has three vacancies, one of which was created in 2005. It may yet be the institution that dooms many or even most of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms that Congress passed in 2010 and that regulatory agencies have been struggling to put in place since then.
In the area of regulatory law, that court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, reigns supreme, and it is now controlled by judicial activists who seem quite willing to negate, on technical grounds, any regulations they do not like. The Securities and Exchange Commission has suffered a series of defeats there, defeats that it has chosen to accept rather than risk an appeal to the Supreme Court.
The judges have done that through the use of cost-benefit analysis -- or more specifically by a willingness to find that the S.E.C. failed to do enough to quantify even minor costs. 
In an article to be published in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Bruce R. Kraus, a partner in the New York law firm of Kelley Drye & Warren who was a senior member of the S.E.C. staff from 2008 to 2011, and Connor Raso, a lawyer for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, trace the history of that series of decisions, beginning with a 1993 ruling.
They argue that the commission should insist on its right ''to discern and define the boundary between economic analysis and policy choice.'' In an interview, Mr. Kraus said he thought the circuit court wrongly thought the S.E.C. had not tried to follow its previous rulings, because the judges were not fully aware of the work the staff had done in trying to comply, work that in some cases never became public because the commission did not choose to propose a revised rule. He said he was hopeful that the court would be favorably impressed when it considers future challenges to S.E.C. rules now being considered.
Perhaps he is right, but it might also help if there were some new blood on the court, something that Republican senators seem to have been able to prevent throughout the Obama presidency.
There are supposed to be 11 active judges on the court, but there now are three vacancies. One of them is recent, caused by the decision of Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, the author of some of the decisions that have put the court in the position to decide which regulations it does not like, to assume senior status on the court. But the other two seats have been empty throughout the Obama administration.
The president has proposed nominees for two of those seats, but they are unlikely to go anywhere before the election. Even if the president wins re-election, Republicans seem likely to block any nominee who strikes them as even a little liberal.
Democrats were obstructionist when George W. Bush was in office, but he eventually prevailed in winning confirmation of three of his nominees. They included Brett M. Kavanaugh, a White House aide who had played a major role in finding conservatives to nominate for judicial openings. He also helped to write the Starr report that led to the attempt to remove Bill Clinton from office.
Mr. Kraus points to one way the vacancies influence appellants: When a three-judge panel of the court issues a ruling against the S.E.C., the commission could seek an ''en banc'' hearing of the entire court. But with only five other judges, and the need for a majority to gain a new hearing, that would require convincing all of the others that their three colleagues were wrong.
The government could appeal the court's decisions to the Supreme Court. Perhaps it should have done so in response to the latest ruling by Judge Ginsburg, in 2011, which threw out rules -- specifically authorized by Congress in the Dodd-Frank law -- allowing minority shareholders in very limited cases to get access to corporate proxies to propose candidates for director. But it did not.
The supremacy of the District of Columbia circuit court in this area of law is a result of laws that mandate that appeals related to regulations go directly to it. There is no district judge to hear cases and establish facts. Nor are there likely to be any differing opinions from other circuit courts, as there can be in other areas of the law. It is such differences that often lead to a Supreme Court decision to hear a case.
Cost-benefit analysis is one of those concepts that enjoys wide Congressional support, and there are bills pending to widen it. After all, who would support a rule whose costs exceed its benefits? But that raises the issue of who bears the costs and how to quantify them. Nor are benefits easily calculated.
''Concern about cost was a key factor in decisions not to adopt tougher regulations of subprime mortgage lending, credit rating agencies, asset-backed securities, and over-the-counter derivatives markets,'' wrote Barbara Roper, in a blog post on the Huffington Post Web site this week, adding that those decisions helped cause the financial crisis and worldwide recession.
Earlier this year, the S.E.C. quietly circulated guidance to its staff regarding how to assure that its cost-benefit analysis was adequate to pass the circuit court's muster. Mr. Kraus, who was formerly the co-chief counsel of the commission's division of risk, strategy and financial innovation, thinks that guidance can help ward off further adverse court decisions, but Ms. Roper is among those who see it as a surrender.
''A regulatory system driven by cost-benefit requirements will inevitably be skewed against the public interest and against effective regulation,'' she wrote, under the headline, ''Will Cost-Benefit Analysis Seal the S.E.C.'s Fate as an Industry Lap Dog?''
The circuit court's decisions have not turned on such weighty issues as how to quantify the benefits of avoiding a new financial crisis. Instead, they have sometimes been amazingly nit-picking. When the court stopped the S.E.C. from requiring mutual funds to have a majority of independent directors, the court said the commission should have done more to calculate the costs a fund would face in finding and choosing independent directors.
Eventually, the S.E.C. did ask for comment on that issue, and the comments showed the costs were, as the commission had earlier assumed, trivial. But by then the commission was under new leadership, and it never returned to the issue.
Last year, when the circuit court rejected the commission's effort to allow proxy access to large institutional shareholders, the court, wrote Mr. Kraus and Mr. Connor, ''summarily dismissed the S.E.C.'s extensive review of the empirical evidence'' regarding the potential benefits of the rule. The court was, however, impressed by ''one commentator,'' who ''submitted an empirical analysis showing that when dissident directors win board seats, those firms underperform peers by 19 percent to 40 percent.''
The opinion by Judge Ginsburg, the authors point out, did not note that the ''one commentator'' was the Business Roundtable, the plaintiff in the suit, or that the statistic was based on a study whose authors specifically rejected the conclusion the court found so persuasive.
''The court accepted petitioner's factoid uncritically,'' they wrote, ''all the while accusing the S.E.C. of paying inadequate attention to the empirical work before it, and of slipshod economic analysis in general.''
The circuit court has not been as hostile to other regulators, showing more willingness to accept scientific conclusions by the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, than it is to accord any credence to market or economic analyses by the S.E.C. But its willingness to decide it knows best has made regulators nervous about saying anything that might offend the judges.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which employs Mr. Raso, evidently does not want to be associated with a criticism of the court if it can help it.
Articles published in journals almost always list the affiliation of the authors, but this one simply gave Mr. Raso's name, and Mr. Kraus declined to say who he was. After a Google search showed that someone named Connor Raso worked for the consumer bureau, a bureau spokeswoman confirmed he was the co-author, but asked that I note his views were not necessarily those of the agency.
Maybe better economic analysis will help the S.E.C. prevail in some future case, but for now there is considerable reason to assume that any financial regulation that big business does not like will be rejected by the circuit court. Rules approved this year by the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may fall, leaving the Dodd-Frank law in tatters.
If that happens, it will be important for the Obama administration to build a case for the Supreme Court. And if the president wins the election, he will need to win confirmation of judges for the court who will be willing to allow the S.E.C. to do its job.

HEADLINE: In Midtown, Taking Aim at Occupy Wall St. and Obama

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
Three days after the Occupy Wall Street movement marked its first anniversary, a couple of dozen opponents responded on Thursday, staging a brief but rowdy morning rally on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan.
Organized by Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-inspired advocacy group founded by the billionaire Koch brothers, the half-hour event took place on Avenue of the Americas at Rockefeller Center.
Several speakers ran down a list of complaints about the country -- including unemployment, Middle East troubles and high national debt -- and laid the blame squarely at the feet of President Obama. Their audience of about 40 people included curious passers-by and counterprotesters. 
A photo of Mr. Obama's face beamed from the side of a large caramel-colored bus parked at the curb, with the words ''You Didn't Build That'' near his mouth in a speech balloon. The bus, which arrived from Long Island, is one of three owned by Americans for Prosperity now crisscrossing the country and being used to help stage similar events. The group cannot directly promote political candidates because of its tax-exempt status.
But the group delivered its most aggressive blows to the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has called attention to the country's economic inequalities.
One speaker, Steve Lonegan, said that since wealthy people built most of Manhattan's skyscrapers, they should be celebrated. Mr. Lonegan ran against Chris Christie for the Republican nomination for New Jersey governor in 2009 and now heads Americans for Prosperity's chapter in that state.
Those builders were like the ''so-called 1 percent that are being demonized by the Occupy Wall Street freaks that hate everybody who makes money!'' Mr. Lonegan yelled to a group that applauded frequently and wore pins with slogans like ''Obama Spoke/Now I'm Broke.''
''In fact,'' he shouted, ''I think they hate each other!''
In New York City, which reliably votes Democratic in national elections, Mr. Lonegan's case against Mr. Obama might seem to be a hard one to make.
Many of the morning commuters leaving a subway stop at West 50th Street appeared more interested in their cellphones than in the long list of the group's grievances -- including ''Billions Wasted on Solyndra and Green Energy Scams'' -- that were detailed on the side of the bus.
Complicating the challenge of organizing a large rally was that none of Americans for Prosperity's 34 chapters are in New York. Most of the members who attended the event came from New Jersey.
In defending the turnout, Mr. Lonegan said, ''Unlike the Occupy Wall Street people who are all unemployed, our people all work.''
Several counterprotesters made themselves known.
Louis Flores, 39, of Jackson Heights, Queens, walked through the crowd carrying a sign reading, ''Take your billions out of our politics and put them on the tax rolls.''
For Mr. Flores, who said he was affiliated with the Occupy movement, the light attendance was a signal that Americans for Prosperity was a front for corporate interests. ''They should have 3,000 people here today, like Occupy did,'' he said. ''Where is the grass-roots support?''
Americans for Prosperity organizers said there were other opponents present who pretended to support their group.
Indeed, two clean-cut men wearing suits and shiny leather shoes held signs reading ''1%'' and ''Thank You Koch Brothers'' and tried to fire up the crowd with a chant of ''U-S-A,'' which prompted a heated exchange with a woman nearby. She accused them of being impostors.
''I'm sick of being told I don't have a voice,'' said one of the men, who identified himself as Rob Stetson, a resident of ''near Wall Street.'' If it was an act, he did not break character once.
''Smells like a leftist liberal to me,'' another demonstrator snarled in Mr. Stetson's direction.
Afterward, some rally participants headed to the South Street Seaport for lunch, a route that took them close to Zuccotti Park, the heart of the Occupy movement. But the anti-Obama bus did not accompany them; it headed to New Jersey, where another rally was scheduled in Montclair.
But while the rally might have excited supporters, it did not make it any easier for some to decide whether to vote for Mr. Obama or his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, in November.
''We should have more choices,'' Mussen Laverty, a welder who was working nearby, said after taking a photo. ''I think they're all the same.''

HEADLINE: Year After Effort at U.N., New Aim for Palestinians

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERICHO, West Bank -- One year after the Palestinians' high-profile failure to win United Nations membership through the Security Council, they are returning to the General Assembly next week seeking largely symbolic ''nonmember state'' status, with a subdued campaign that many analysts see as a long-shot effort to win back the waning attention of the world.
The delegation heading to New York this weekend is half the size of last year's. And there are no concerts or street parties planned this time around President Mahmoud Abbas's Sept. 27 speech to the General Assembly; instead, it comes after days of unrest across the West Bank focused more on the Palestinian Authority than its Israeli occupier.
It has been a year without peace talks. And it has been a year in which economic conditions for Palestinians have deteriorated, Israeli settlements in the West Bank have expanded, and promised reconciliation between Mr. Abbas's Fatah faction and the more militant Hamas that rules the Gaza Strip has failed to materialize. 
At the same time, Mr. Abbas's approval ratings have plummeted, to 46 percent this month from 67 percent in September 2011, according to the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, while the revolutions across the Arab world and the Iranian nuclear program have distracted the international community from the Palestinian struggle.
''A lost year'' is how Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian commissioner of international relations, put it in an interview this week. ''We have wasted a whole year, and that waste cost us a lot in the circumstances of our people, in the support of our people. The frustration is unequaled. This stalemate, this closed door, this impasse cannot stay.''
While there is broad support for the United Nations bid among Palestinian leaders and on the street, there are also growing calls for a far more drastic move: abandoning the Oslo agreements that have governed Palestinian-Israeli relations for nearly two decades, or dissolving the Palestinian Authority. After two evenings of sometimes-heated meetings this week, according to participants, Mr. Abbas told the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization that within 10 days of his return from New York he wanted a decision either to walk away from Oslo or to hold national elections and replace him.
''Twenty years of Oslo and 20 years of a Palestinian Authority and 20 years of all the promises ended in fiasco,'' said Zakaria al-Qaq, a professor of national security at Al Quds University. ''They are trying to scare the Israelis, because the Israelis consider Oslo as a genius political achievement. They want to scare the Americans and the Europeans.''
But experts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict see this more as posturing than serious policy making, and they warn that a vacuum could provide opportunity for extremists. ''Supposing now you scrap Oslo -- then what?'' Tony Blair, the representative of the so-called quartet -- the Middle East peacemaking group made up of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- asked in an interview on Wednesday. ''If you burn the house down on the basis that somebody's going to have to build you something new, you might just be left with a burned house.''
The Oslo Accords, signed in 1993 and 1995, were intended as a five-year interim arrangement establishing the Palestinian Authority to begin state-building while negotiations continued toward a final-status solution. They outline protocols for security and economic cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and divide the West Bank into distinct areas with varying levels of Israeli control and Palestinian responsibility.
There have been occasional calls for abandoning Oslo for a decade, said Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiations unit. Lately, the chorus has grown, with Palestinian officials complaining that Israel routinely violates provisions of the agreements. In April, Yossi Beilin, one of the Israeli architects of the accords, wrote an open letter to Mr. Abbas in the magazine Foreign Policy headlined, ''End This Farce.''
''It's like keeping someone in kindergarten for 19 years and then blaming the kindergarten for them not being successful,'' Mr. Beilin said this week. ''They need something dramatic. If they say by the 1st of December, if nothing good happens to us, if there are no serious negotiations, you don't freeze settlements, whatever, we are going to give up on it -- this will put the world in a different situation, everyone will rush to prevent it.''
But he and others said they doubted the Palestinian leadership would actually take such a step. ''The threat of canceling Oslo is always a reactionary threat, just the same way that Abbas is always threatening to quit,'' Ms. Buttu said.
For now, there is the General Assembly. While some in Jerusalem and Washington have condemned the effort as thwarting the peace process, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians' chief negotiator, described it Thursday as a last-ditch effort to ''preserve the two-state solution.''
''We have never said that our rights of self-determination are subject to negotiation,'' Mr. Erekat told journalists at his headquarters here in Jericho before leaving for Turkey en route to New York. ''We are declaring a state on the 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital, to live side by side with Israel in peace and security. I don't see why people who stand for the two-state solution would not join us.''
Appeasing the Americans, the Palestinians do not plan to press for a vote before the Nov. 6 presidential election. Instead, they will only begin drafting the resolution. Mr. Erekat said they expected to win the votes of between 150 and 170 of the General Assembly's 193 members.
Nonmember state status would give the Palestinians access to United Nations' institutions like the International Criminal Court, and, Mr. Erekat said, make clear that they are living under occupation, not in what Israelis sometimes call ''disputed territory.''
''The day after, life will not be the same,'' he said. ''Yes, occupation will continue, settlements will continue, the crimes of settlers may continue. But there will be consequences.''
Mark Regev, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, denounced the General Assembly strategy as ''a violation of their fundamental commitment,'' and placed blame for the stagnated peace process on Mr. Abbas's refusal to return to the table while the settlement enterprise marches on.
''We are willing for Palestinian statehood in the framework of peace and reconciliation,'' Mr. Regev said. ''If Palestinians want a state merely as a superior vehicle to continue a political, military, economic and psychological struggle with Israel, that's not what we have in mind.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Journey To Tougher Tack On a Rising China

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's patience with China had been fraying for months, and by November 2010 he was fed up. Meeting with President Hu Jintao in Seoul, South Korea, Mr. Obama warned that if China did not do more to curb North Korea's bellicose behavior, he would have to take steps to shield the United States from the threat of a nuclear missile attack from the North.
For the first time in a half dozen stilted encounters, Mr. Obama seemed to get through to the bland, tightly scripted Chinese leader. Mr. Hu dropped his talking points and asked Mr. Obama to clarify what he meant, according to two people who were in the room. The president's answer included a clear hint that the United States would move warships to the seas off China, a step sure to antagonize the increasingly nationalistic Chinese.
''Obama pulled back the veil,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, the president's chief adviser on China at the time, who was one of those in the room. He added that Mr. Obama's warning prodded the Chinese president to send a senior diplomat to lean on North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il. 
The tense exchange, Mr. Bader and other officials said, was a turning point in the president's complex relationship with China, a journey that began with hope and accommodation but fell into disillusionment after Beijing started flexing its muscles on trade and military questions and proved to be a truculent partner on a variety of global issues.
As Mr. Obama runs for re-election, his tougher line toward Beijing is showing itself on several fronts. The White House has filed two major cases in the past three months against China at the World Trade Organization, both of which Mr. Obama promoted to autoworkers in the Rust Belt. On the same day as the latest trade action, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced plans in Tokyo to help Japan deploy a new missile-defense system, which has aroused suspicion in Beijing.
With Mitt Romney charging that Mr. Obama has not stood up enough to Chinese leaders, China has suddenly become a focal point in the presidential campaign, one that encompasses both security and economic concerns and puts to the test the president's management of a crucial, and occasionally combustible, relationship.
Mr. Obama's blunt warning in Seoul presaged what may end up as the most consequential foreign policy initiative of his presidency: the shift of American focus from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to the Pacific Rim, where the United States has shored up alliances with Japan and South Korea, opened the door to Myanmar, and sent Marines to Australia. While the new focus has rattled allies in Europe, the emergence of a counterweight to a rising China has been greeted with enthusiasm in Asia.
''Time and time again, I had leaders -- I mean, I'm talking about the highest leaders -- essentially say: 'Thank goodness. Thank you. I'm so pleased you're here. We were worried about America,' '' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who played a significant role in shaping the president's approach to China, said in an interview.
Mr. Obama's turn to Asia was not precisely what he had in mind when he entered office. The shift emerged in fits and starts, after a first year in which critics, including the president's aides, concluded that the United States had been too soft on China. In interviews, a dozen current and former administration officials described a White House that struggled to find the right tone with Beijing.
From his decision not to meet with the Dalai Lama in 2009 to his tightly constrained first trip to China, the president accommodated Chinese leaders in the hopes that the moves would translate into good will on issues like climate change or Iran's nuclear program.
They did not. China spurned the United States on climate change standards, dragged its feet on efforts to pressure Iran and began bullying its neighbors over territorial claims in the South China Sea. That last development, in particular, persuaded the administration that the time for accommodation had come to an end.
''I certainly think we tested the limit of how far you can get with China through positive engagement,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. ''We needed to toughen our line in Year 2, and we did that.''
At the center of the internal debate on China was a president, who despite being born in Hawaii and spending childhood years in Indonesia, is less beguiled by China's history and culture than many of his predecessors were, aides said. Once in office, they said, Mr. Obama came to view China primarily through an economic prism. He is angry at what he sees as Beijing's refusal to play by the rules in trade, and frustrated by the United States' lack of leverage to do anything about it.
In meetings, Mr. Obama liked to tease two of his advisers, Mr. Bader and Lawrence H. Summers, who had helped negotiate China's entry into the World Trade Organization during the administration of Bill Clinton. ''Did you guys give away too much?'' he asked them, according to a senior aide, who described it as ''a running joke.''
To some extent, Mr. Obama's learning curve on China parallels his early outreach to Iran: an initial hope that old adversaries could put aside their differences, followed by a jolting recognition of reality and the ultimate adoption of a realpolitik approach. The difference, officials argue, is that in this case the tougher line has led not to stalemate but to a constructive give-and-take with a country bound to rub up against the United States.
''Despite it all, China has been an increasingly responsible actor on Iran,'' said James B. Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of state who made a number of trips to Beijing to air American concerns. ''Despite some wobbles, they've played a positive role in constraining North Korea at times of crisis.''
The president's Asia agenda, however, raises many questions. With deep cuts in the military budget looming, critics question whether the United States has the money to back up its words. A Pentagon preoccupied by Afghanistan and Iraq has done little planning to shift troops or ships -- so little, in fact, that a Navy commander was called to the White House for his first meeting after Mr. Obama had already laid out the broader strategy.
America's eastward shift has left the Chinese deeply suspicious of American motives, with some analysts in China arguing that the United States is trying to encircle the country. For all the talk of give-and-take, the Chinese rebuffed Mrs. Clinton during her recent visit to Beijing when she raised the disputes over the South China Sea.
''The Chinese feel a bit whiplashed,'' said Michael J. Green, an Asia policy maker in the administration of George W. Bush who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''The hope and change of the first year, followed by the sharp-edged push-back of the second year, all of this, to the Chinese, looks like gross inconsistency and unpredictability.''
The President's Asia
It is little surprise that Mr. Obama would look east. The president's Asia, however, lies not on the wind-swept ramparts of the Great Wall of China but in the tropical swelter of Singapore and Indonesia. He identifies more with the languid rhythms of Jakarta, aides say, than with the crackling energy of Shanghai.
An adviser recalled a breakfast at a summit meeting in Toronto in 2010 that Mr. Obama shared with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, which was so relaxed and serene that afterward the president's hyperactive chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, told him, ''Now I see what your Asianness is about.''
Despite his preferences, Mr. Obama was determined not to antagonize China when he ran for president in 2008. Unlike Mr. Clinton, who referred to China's leaders as the ''butchers of Beijing'' in 1992, Mr. Obama said little about China, and his thin record on foreign policy left few clues for the Chinese to size him up.
''We tried to introduce him as the first Asia-Pacific president,'' said Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who was ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011, before resigning to run for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Huntsman said that in exchanges with Chinese officials, Mr. Obama was highly effective. ''But the Chinese were perplexed by President Obama,'' he said. ''Where does he come from? What does he think? He remained a bit of a cipher.''
With the president focused on priorities like Afghanistan and Iran in the early days of his administration, other officials rushed to stake their claim to China. Thomas E. Donilon, who later became national security adviser, spoke of a ''rebalancing'' to Asia from the Middle East. Mrs. Clinton, eager to reassert the State Department's role on China, made her first trip there.
Before landing in Beijing, however, Mrs. Clinton appeared to sideline the issue of human rights, saying she did not see the value of lodging pro forma protests with the Chinese in return for predictable responses. (She quickly changed course.)
Then, a few months later, Mr. Obama declined to meet with the Dalai Lama when he visited the United States. The sticking point was not the meeting but the timing -- in October 2009, a month before Mr. Obama was to make his first trip as president to Beijing. Officials involved in the decision now express regret for not going ahead with the meeting.
''We hadn't reckoned with the way people in Washington set up litmus tests,'' Mr. Bader said. ''Maybe we should have.''
The optics did not improve on Mr. Obama's trip, which the Chinese stage-managed, allowing no questions after a joint news conference with Mr. Hu. White House officials said the trip was more successful than the news coverage suggested, but they do not dispute that the lasting impression was of a fast-rising power -- the holder of $1 trillion in American debt -- pushing back on a beleaguered United States.
Not all of Mr. Obama's first year was conciliatory. In September 2009, he imposed a tariff on China for dumping tires into the American market. The administration also kept pressure on Beijing to revalue its currency, though it did not label China a currency manipulator. This showed what former aides described as the ''Chicago pol'' side of Mr. Obama, who views China as a threat to American jobs.
An aide recalled briefing the president in early 2011 before a state visit by Mr. Hu on an array of diplomatic and human rights issues. Impatiently, Mr. Obama said, ''The only thing people care about is the economic issues.''
Drawing a Line
For a president with Southeast Asian sympathies, however, the tensions over the South China Sea were hard to ignore. At a meeting in May 2010, China's top foreign affairs official, Dai Bingguo, told a stunned Mrs. Clinton that Beijing regarded vast swaths of the sea, which it shares with Vietnam, the Philippines and other neighbors, as its territory. The economic stakes are great, given the resources beneath the sea's surface.
''China had been on a charm offensive and had really been making inroads with their neighbors in kind of soothing fears and showing restraint,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And then I think that the Chinese began to flex their muscles.''
The White House decided to draw a line. Two months later, Mrs. Clinton, working with Mr. Bader and Kurt M. Campbell, the hard-charging assistant secretary for East Asia in the State Department, sprang a surprise. At a summit meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, she declared that the United States would take an interest in resolving disputes over the sea. China was livid, while Vietnam and the Philippines felt that they had a potent new backer.
China also underlies Mr. Obama's opening to Myanmar. During the long estrangement between the United States and its military dictators, China set out to turn the isolated country, also known as Burma, into a colonial outpost. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama welcomed Myanmar's opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to the White House.
Mr. Campbell rejected the suggestion that the United States was pursuing a cold-war-style containment of China, saying that the notion was ''simplistic and wrong.'' At the same time, he said, ''the Chinese respect strength, determination and strategy.''
Exhibit A in that approach, he and others said, is the tortuous but ultimately successful negotiation over the dissident Chen Guangcheng, who sought refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing and was allowed to fly to New York.
With China embroiled in a leadership transition, Beijing now sometimes sounds like the beleaguered party. Over lunch with Mr. Donilon in Beijing recently, China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, complained about being pressured over the South China Sea. ''Big countries can get bullied by little countries,'' Mr. Yang said, according to a senior aide who was in the room.
But China shows few signs of backing down. It filed its own case at the World Trade Organization against the United States on the same day as Mr. Obama's latest action. And when Mr. Panetta met in Beijing with China's presumed next leader, Xi Jinping, he got an earful on a territorial dispute involving tiny islands claimed by Japan and China.
Looking back, some former officials argue that it was not Mr. Obama who changed, but the Chinese. ''People say we got mugged by reality,'' Mr. Bader said. ''No, the Chinese behaved differently in 2010, and what we did reflected their behavior.''
A Measure of Change: This is the sixth article in a series assessing President Obama's record.

HEADLINE: Waters Ethics Investigation Will Get a Public Hearing

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
A long-running ethics investigation of Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, will be resolved on Friday at a rare House ethics committee public hearing and two parties with direct knowledge of the matter said they expect it to conclude without formal charges of wrongdoing. 
Ms. Waters, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, was accused of using her office in late 2008 to set up a meeting with top Treasury Department officials on behalf of a bank her husband owned stock in, at a time when the bank faced possible collapse because of the financial crisis.
The investigation itself has been mired in controversy, after the House ethics committee's own chief counsel accused staff members in 2010 of sharing confidential details about the matter with Republicans, a violation of House rules.
The result was an extraordinary outside investigation by a former Justice Department prosecutor who was appointed first to see if the ethics committee itself had acted improperly before restarting a new inquiry into the allegations against Ms. Waters.
This second investigation is complete and has been submitted to a new panel of House members appointed to review the evidence, two parties with direct knowledge of the case said.
Typically, when the ethics committee holds a public hearing on an investigation, it means that the committee has turned up such evidence of wrongdoing, but the lawmaker has refused to accept a settlement, resulting in a hearing that serves, in effect, as a trial.
That is a very rare step, which took place most recently in November 2010 to address charges against Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, and concluded with a finding that Mr. Rangel had violated House rules by accepting rent-stabilized apartments from a Manhattan developer and failing to pay income taxes on rent from a villa in the Dominican Republic, among other charges.
But two parties with direct knowledge of the investigation said Friday's hearing on the new inquiry into Ms. Waters - led by the former federal prosecutor Billy Martin -- has concluded without a recommendation that Ms. Waters be sanctioned by the House for wrongdoing. The report could still include findings that she acted inappropriately or unwisely, without recommending that she be sanctioned. The hearing Friday would give Ms. Waters a chance to respond to such allegations in a public way.
Ms. Waters has long defended her actions in late 2008, when she said she merely called then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and requested a meeting on behalf of an organization of minority-owned banks. During the first inquiry, House investigators suggested there was evidence of wrong-doing, as her meeting ended up focusing largely on a single bank - OneUnited, a minority-owned institution that her husband had served on the board of and at the time still owned stock in. OneUnited ultimately received bailout funds from Treasury.
The hearing Friday could mean an end to the ethics cloud Ms. Waters has been under since 2009, when the allegations about the meeting she requested with the Treasury Department were first reported in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
An ethics committee spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on the matter. A spokesman for Ms. Waters said he could not discuss the details of Friday's hearing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: An Industry Becalmed

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
FAIRLESS HILLS, Pa. -- Last month, Gamesa, a major maker of wind turbines, completed the first significant order of its latest innovation: a camper-size box that can capture the energy of slow winds, potentially opening new parts of the country to wind power.
But by the time the last of the devices, worth more than $1.25 million, was hitched to a rail car, Gamesa had furloughed 92 of the 115 workers who made them.
''We are all really sad,'' said Miguel Orobiyi, 34, who worked as a mechanical assembler at the Gamesa plant for nearly five years. ''I hope they call us back because they are really, really good jobs.''
Similar cuts are happening throughout the American wind sector, which includes hundreds of manufacturers, from multinationals that make giant windmills to smaller local manufacturers that supply specialty steel or bolts. In recent months, companies have announced almost 1,700 layoffs. 
At its peak in 2008 and 2009, the industry employed about 85,000 people, according to the American Wind Energy Association, the industry's principal trade group.
About 10,000 of those jobs have disappeared since, according to the association, as wind companies have been buffeted by weak demand for electricity, stiff competition from cheap natural gas and cheaper options from Asian competitors. Chinese manufacturers, who can often underprice goods because of generous state subsidies, have moved into the American market and have become an issue in the larger trade tensions between the countries. In July, the United States Commerce Department imposed tariffs on steel turbine towers from China after finding that manufacturers had been selling them for less than the cost of production.
And now, on top of the business challenges, the industry is facing a big political problem in Washington: the Dec. 31 expiration of a federal tax credit that makes wind power more competitive with other sources of electricity.
The tax break, which costs about $1 billion a year, has been periodically renewed by Congress with support from both parties. This year, however, it has become a wedge issue in the presidential contest. President Obama has traveled to wind-heavy swing states like Iowa to tout his support for the subsidy. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has said he opposes the wind credit, and that has galvanized Republicans in Congress against it, perhaps dooming any extension or at least delaying it until after the election despite a last-ditch lobbying effort from proponents this week.
Opponents argue that the industry has had long enough to wean itself from the subsidy and, with wind representing a small percentage of total electricity generation, the taxpayers' investment has yielded an insufficient return.
''Big Wind has had extension after extension after extension,'' said Benjamin Cole, a spokesman for the American Energy Alliance, a group partly financed by oil interests that has been lobbying against the credit in Washington. ''The government shouldn't be continuing to prop up industries that never seem to be able to get off their training wheels.''
But without the tax credit in place, the wind business ''falls off a cliff,'' said Ryan Wiser, a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who studies the market potential of renewable electricity sources.
The industry's precariousness was apparent a few weeks ago at the Gamesa factory, as a crew loaded the guts of the company's newest model of the component, a device known as a nacelle, into its fiberglass shell. Only 50 completed nacelles awaited pickup in a yard once filled with three times as many, most of the production line stood idle, and shelves rated to hold 7,270 pounds of parts and equipment lay bare.
''We've done a lot to get really efficient here,'' said Tom Bell, the manager of the plant, which was built on the grounds of a shuttered U.S. Steel factory that was once a bedrock of the local economy. ''Now we just need a few more orders.''
Industry executives and analysts say that the looming end of the production tax credit, which subsidizes wind power by 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour, has made project developers skittish about investing or going forward. That reluctance has rippled through the supply chain.
On Tuesday, Siemens, the German-based turbine-maker, announced it would lay off 945 workers in Kansas, Iowa and Florida, including part-timers. Last week Katana Summit, a tower manufacturer, said it would shut down operations in Nebraska and Washington if it could not find a buyer. Vestas, the world's largest turbine manufacturer, with operations in Colorado and Texas, recently laid off 1,400 workers globally on top of 2,300 layoffs announced earlier this year. Clipper Windpower, with manufacturing in Iowa, is reducing its staff by a third, to 376 from 550. DMI Industries, another tower producer, is planning to lay off 167 workers in Tulsa by November.
Wind industry jobs range in pay from about $30,000 a year for assemblers to almost $100,000 a year for engineers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The industry's contraction follows several years of sustained growth -- with a few hiccups during the downturn -- that has helped wind power edge closer to the cost of electricity from conventional fuels. The number of turbine manufacturers grew to nine in 2010 from just one in 2005, according to the United States International Trade Commission, while the number of component makers increased tenfold in roughly the same period to almost 400, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Aside from Clipper Windpower and General Electric, most of the turbine manufacturers operating in the United States have headquarters overseas, especially in Europe, where wind power took off first, spurred by clean energy policies and generous subsidies.
As the United States put in place mandates and subsidies of its own, several large outfits, including the Spanish company Gamesa, set up shop stateside. Because the turbines, made of roughly 8,000 parts, are so large and heavy -- blades half the length of a football field, towers rising hundreds of feet in the air, motors weighing in the tons -- they are difficult and expensive to transport.
As a result, manufacturers invested billions to develop a supply chain in the United States. More than 100 companies contribute parts to Gamesa's 75-ton devices, which are the most expensive and complex major components of high-tech windmills.
Some longtime Gamesa partners like Hine Hydraulics followed the company from Spain, investing millions in building plants in the United States and sending workers to Spain for expensive training.
Rich Miller, who works for Hine in Quakertown, Pa., said that when he went to Spain to learn how to build and test power units for its hydraulic systems, it was his first trip out of the country.
''That was quite an experience in itself,'' said Mr. Miller, who is 58, adding that he probably learned more in four years at Hine than at previous jobs.
Now he worries about having to move on. ''Hopefully it will go back to the way things were.'' Losing his job at his age, he said, ''would be devastating for me.''

HEADLINE: Moving On: Pawlenty Accepts Lobbying Job

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is resigning as a national co-chairman of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign to take a job in Washington as a top lobbyist for a group representing banks and financial companies. 
Mr. Palwenty's new role as President and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable was announced by the organization Thursday morning. In a statement, the group said that Mr. Pawlenty would step down from his role at Mr. Romney's campaign because the organization is bipartisan.
"My time in public service was rewarding and focused on achieving results," Mr. Pawlenty said in the statement. "I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, but I am now moving on and committed to focusing fully on this new opportunity."
In a statement issued by Mr. Romney's campaign, Mr. Pawlenty added: "My work with Mitt has been a privilege. Mitt Romney is a truly good man and great leader. As the campaign moves into the home stretch, he has my full support and continued faith in his vision and his policies."
Mr. Palwenty was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination last year but dropped out of the race early after a disappointing performance at the Iowa straw poll. He endorsed Mr. Romney early in the fall of 2011 and campaigned for him during the height of the primaries.
He was also on the short list to be Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate. But despite an aggressive campaigning effort by Mr. Pawlenty earlier this year, Mr. Romney passed him over in favor of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
In a brief interview at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., last month, Mr. Pawlenty played down his role on Mr. Romney's behalf.
"I'm just a volunteer,'' he told The Caucus, "so I've got other stuff I've got to do. So as my schedule allows, I'll go out and do surrogate speaking."
That "other stuff" apparently involved seeking the top job at the roundtable, an organization that seeks to shape federal regulations on behalf of about 100 major financial services companies. The group's Web site says that its mission is to "protect and promote the economic vitality and integrity of its members and the United States financial system." It has spent $4.7 million on lobbying in the first two quarters of this year.
The group says it seeks to achieve those goals through "legislative and regulatory advocacy; strong industry reputation of trust and confidence; and premier executive leadership forums."
In a statement, Mr. Romney praised Mr. Pawlenty as "a dear friend" who brought "energy, intelligence and tireless dedication to every enterprise in which he's ever been engaged."
Mr. Romney said that he regretted Mr. Pawlenty's need to step down from his campaign, but said that "his new position advancing the integrity of our financial system is vital to the future of our country. I congratulate him on his new position and wish him every success in carrying out his new mission."
Mr. Pawlenty will begin his new role on Nov. 1.

HEADLINE: In Britain, Austerity Collides With Pension System

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- It may be the age of austerity for many in Britain. For a former doctor, Geoffrey Lipman, it is anything but.
Dr. Lipman's annual government pension of £48,000, or nearly $78,000, nicely supplements the £144,000 tax-free payment he received when he retired from Britain's National Health Service in 2007 after 35 years of service.
He also makes use of the wide menu of universal benefits available to older Britons -- including free bus travel and annual payments of £200, or $324, to defray winter heating costs. Next month, when he turns 65, he will qualify as well for a second government pension payout of £104 a week, plus a £10 bonus at Christmas.
Dr. Lipman's payments are emblematic of what Britain's Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, is up against, having hitched his political fortunes to the coalition government's ability to cut the national budget. Despite Mr. Cameron's efforts to curb public outlays and reduce one of Europe's biggest budget deficits, government spending is higher than when he took office two years ago. This continues a climb that began with the creation of the British welfare state after World War II. 
The cuts Mr. Cameron has made -- a public sector pay freeze, a reduction in outlays for local governments and cutbacks in personnel at government ministries, to name a few -- have drawn howls of protest. The outcry has come from unions; the Labor Party, which now has a strong lead in the polls; and even a growing faction of Tory-supporting business leaders.
But overall government spending, as a portion of the economy, continues to rise. It is projected to approach £700 billion this year, or about 45 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 38 percent a decade ago. That is partly a result of social benefits, mainly for the elderly, that are deemed politically off-limits and are being propelled up by a demographic curve that will add millions of Britons to the retiree ranks in coming years.
''Austerity is just not a word that I recognize,'' said Dr. Lipman, who since retiring from full-time work as a family doctor in the northern city of Leeds has upgraded the car he drives to a Mercedes. ''I would not say that I am worried financially.''
The issue in some ways parallels the challenge facing the United States, where growing numbers of retiring baby boomers threaten to bankrupt the Social Security and Medicare systems within decades unless those systems are revamped. And as in the United States, because people still working are paying for retirees' benefits that are more generous than younger people can expect to receive, the budget struggle has elements of a generational dispute.
Younger doctors in Britain do not expect to receive the same benefits as Dr. Lipman. This year they held a one-day strike to protest the government's decision to raise their retirement age and their pension contributions.
In Britain, ''the welfare state can no longer carry this burden,'' said Angus Hanton, an economist and a member of the advisory board of the Intergenerational Foundation, which advocates on behalf of younger Britons.
With British tax revenue remaining weak because of an economy that is forecast to shrink 0.5 percent this year, it is becoming ever more likely that Mr. Cameron's government will miss its goal of cutting the deficit this fiscal year to £120 billion, from £126 billion last year.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that Britain will have a deficit this year of 8.1 percent of G.D.P., surpassing Spain and even Greece and trailing only Ireland among the distressed euro zone economies.
Opposing politicians -- and some economists -- have accused Mr. Cameron of destroying any chance for economic recovery by sticking to his austerity platform. He faces growing pressure to reverse course.
''We have not gone far enough -- you can keep the welfare state as long as you have economic growth, and this is not happening,'' said Tim Morgan, an economist at the brokerage firm Tullett Prebon in London who tracks government spending patterns.
For now, many bond investors are disregarding Britain's deficit. Continuing to see the pound as a haven from woes in the euro zone, they are lending money to Britain for 10 years at an interest rate only slightly higher than Germany's 1.6 percent.
But at least one hedge fund manager, Ben Davies of Hinde Capital, is betting against British bonds. ''The government has this austerity program, but spending and debt continue to increase,'' Mr. Davies said. ''It's very disingenuous, and I think by the end of the year the market will question whether the government can truly implement these cuts.''
Driving this increase has been spending on entitlements, which Mr. Morgan calculated to be 50 percent of spending last year, if interest payments on government debt were not counted. Benefits for Britons older than 60 are substantial. Retirees receive the winter heating payments regardless of income or where they live, even in the not-so-chilly south of France or coastal Spain. When they turn 75, retirees no longer have to pay the annual £145 fee that other British households pay for using a television.
Many economies in Europe, of course, say they are under pressure from benefit payments and are making cutbacks. But the strain on the British Exchequer is particularly intense because the benefits include some of the most generous pension plans in Europe. That is especially so for retired government employees.
According to research by the Intergenerational Foundation, about 100,000 public sector retirees receive pensions that exceed the country's average annual wage of £25,900. Those ranks are expected to increase sharply in coming years as more senior government workers retire.
Not all of the 670,000 people collecting pensions from the National Health Service live at Dr. Lipman's level. Many were lower-paid health service professionals -- including support staff and nurses -- who receive close to the national public sector pension average of £7,000 a year.
But the foundation's research found that the richest payouts went to retirees from the health profession, with some doctors receiving pensions of as much as £100,000 annually.
''The total liability for these government pensions is £1.3 trillion,'' or more than $2.1 trillion, said Mr. Hanton, the economist who helps advise the Intergenerational Foundation.
The Cameron government has put in place changes that will require younger working doctors to increase their pension contributions to 14 percent of their salary by 2014. Dr. Lipman had to contribute 4 percent from the £100,000 a year he earned on average as a doctor.
It has also put in place the second increase in doctors' retirement age since 2008, raising it to 68 from 65. It was 60 when Dr. Lipman left the work force.
Because this year's changes affect only doctors younger than 47, any near-term savings will not be substantial. The effect is most profound on the doctors themselves. That is why the British Medical Association called for a strike in late June, the first time doctors here had taken such action in 40 years.
''We are really angry,'' said Dr. David Wrigley, 43, who works in the Lancashire region of northwest England.
Under National Health Service guidelines, for his 15 years of experience, Dr. Wrigley qualifies for a yearly salary of around £85,000, about $138,000 at today's exchange rates. He acknowledges that even with the new rules, doctors will remain well compensated compared with other public sector professions.
But he says the latest changes seem to single out doctors.
''When you first joined the N.H.S. you signed a moral contract to work until you are 60 and then get your pension,'' Dr. Wrigley said. ''Now that is being taken away.''
But not from retirees like Dr. Lipman, whose pensions will not be affected.
''We have a lifestyle that is very good,'' said Dr. Lipman, who is married and has two grown daughters. ''We just got back from Tuscany, we are going to Portugal in three weeks, the Canary Islands for New Year's and are planning a trip to South Africa after that.''
That, he concedes with a chuckle, is the beauty of a legacy-style N.H.S. pension. ''You get paid £48,000 a year to do nothing.''

HEADLINE: A University's Mission: Preparing Mongolia for the Future

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Isolated for decades, Mongolia is now seeing breakneck economic growth. To manage the coming change, what's needed is critical thinking, says the chairman of the new American University of Mongolia, which intends to offer liberal arts education in the capital. 

 BODY:
When talking about Mongolia, the words "mining," "strategic" and "change" seem to crop up almost immediately.
It's easy to see why - the democratic nation of just 2.8 million people has begun exploiting its fabulous mineral wealth (gold, copper and coal, to name a few); it's wedged between two giants, China and Russia; and it's scrambling to manage superspeed economic growth, which surpassed 17 percent last year.
To manage all that change, what Mongolia needs is thinking, says J.
Peter Morrow, chairman of the new American University of Mongolia, which intends to offer a liberal, U.S.-style education in the capital, Ulan Bator. The university was formally established this week.
"Think" was a word Mr. Morrow used often during a telephone interview Friday; he sees it as central to the university's mission to teach critical thinking skills. But he also added another, perhaps surprising, word to the ongoing conversation about Mongolia: "sexy." 
Closed off from most of the world for much of the last century, until the fall of the Soviet Union led to an open democracy that's a rarity in the region, Mongolia is "quite simply a very sexy place," Mr. Morrow said.
"Prior to 1990, no one came here. This place was unspoiled," said Mr. Morrow, a 12-year resident who ran the Khan Bank for a decade.
That means the wealth to be explored is not just in minerals, but in culture and history - core components of the university's liberal education philosophy, he said.
Classes for the university's first freshmen will begin in the fall of 2014. The university, which currently occupies one floor of an office building on Seoul Street, already offers an executive M.B.A. and English language classes.
The university's focus, at least to begin with, will be on environmental and business issues, to produce graduates with the hard skills the emerging economy needs, Mr. Morrow said. "We will train them. But they have to be able to think. So logically any curriculum would start with that," he said.
Mongolia faces tremendous challenges in managing its boom, as my colleague Dan Levin wrote here.
"Mongolia is obviously a strategic place to a lot of people. It needs more education, not just to dig stuff out of the ground and sell it, but also in terms of managing the change," said Mr. Morrow.
"For us, we believe in democracy and free markets and in that, Mongolia is a very important place," he said. "We're sitting in an unfriendly neighborhood that does not have democracy and free markets, we're wedged between Russia and China. It could go very right or it could go wrong." 
Key problems include environmental degradation and accompanying health risks, said Mr. Morrow. Then there's "the pace of cultural change," he continued.
"No one knows what happens when you move large numbers of nomads and herders into apartments and put them on work in mines," he said, singling out family abuse and alcoholism as major social challenges.
Governance is another. "How do you manage important government functions in the face of all that change, how do you manage taxes, royalties, how do you manage it wisely? And not just waste it, spend it and steal it?" he said.
"It's an enormous challenge and I'm not aware of another country that is trying to do this as a significant democracy," said Mr. Morrow.
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan became democratic only after liberalizing their economies, but "Mongolia is doing it the other way round. It's not as easy to manage a fast-moving situation where everyone has a vote," he said.
Some of those tensions were explored in an article in Bloomberg Businessweek magazine, which pointed out that nearly a third of Mongolians live in poverty, despite the economic boom.
The new university, whose funders include Newcom, Rio Tinto and the GE Foundation, is part of an informal chain of worldwide American Universities that includes those in Beirut and Cairo. It joins tertiary institutions already operating in Mongolia, such as the National University of Mongolia and the University of the Humanities.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $16 Million

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A six-story, six-bedroom Modernist brick house is on a prime historic block steps from Central Park. 

 BODY:
A six-story Modernist brick town house that has weathered the burden of an ugly duckling reputation in its relatively short history at 7 East 69th Street sold for $16 million, in the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.
Marketed as a one-family home ripe for renovation, the property - developed as a spec mansion in 1984 on the site of a two-family dwelling built in 1899 - was listed in June for $20 million. According to its listing broker, Guthrie Garvin of Massey Knakal Realty Services, it sold in an all-cash transaction.
On a prime historic block between Fifth and Madison Avenues, the house has a limestone-and-rose-brick facade and a pillared entrance designed by the Sag Harbor architect Hobart D. Betts. It has six bedrooms, six baths, three half-baths and an elevator.
The outdoor space includes front and rear decks with Central Park views and a sizable back garden. Despite its New Age aesthetic, construction was approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The 7,600-square-foot house originally went on the market for $5.5 million and, ostensibly because of its charm-deprived interiors and absence of Old World detail, was stranded there for three years until Edward Baron Cohen, sensing potential and a relative bargain for its nonpareil location, bought it for $4.5 million in 1988.
But Mr. Cohen, then the head of Cohen Brothers Realty, acknowledged that the interiors needed embellishing: "When you went into it, it was a horror," he told The New York Times in 1990. "There was no taste whatsoever." He rectified that by installing mahogany paneling in the library, adding crown molding and plastering the walls. Mr. Cohen used the house and one in Southampton as his residences until his death in 2009. The trustee of the property was his son Andrew B. Cohen, who lives nearby on East 67th Street in a more traditional 1905 limestone town house that he found through Massey Knakal. 
The anonymous buyer was listed as SBP 69th Street, a limited-liability company with a Lake Placid, N.Y., address. Mr. Garvin said that unlike some potential buyers, the new owners of the town house had no quibble with the layout or décor; it is his impression that they intend to move into it as is. The biggest drawing card: "It is on an unbelievable block, and it has all that outdoor space, which buyers seem to want these days," he said. "And it's just a few steps from Central Park."
Although Massey Knakal is known to specialize in investment and commercial properties, Mr. Garvin said the firm had expanded its footprint throughout the city in what he termed a very healthy town-house market, particularly on the Upper East Side.
"Just this year I've listed seven town houses in the $12-to-$25-million range, sold three, and have two others in contract," he said. "There is no shortage of buyer activity around these specialty town-house properties that are coming available on the prime blocks at these price points. The interest level from both international and domestic buyers is very high; the town-house marketplace is definitely ratcheting up."
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Reviewing the Mazda CX-5

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The CX-5 is an important vehicle for Mazda, as it continues to roll out the Skyactiv technology that should help it meet federal fuel economy standards. The crossover is certainly efficient, but it sacrifices power. 

 BODY:
In Sunday's Automobiles section, Cheryl Jensen reviews the 2013 Mazda CX-5, the new compact crossover positioned to challenge longtime segment leaders like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Ford Escape.
Ms. Jensen writes that the CX-5 "has been the main beneficiary of the company's research and development efforts over the last three years, making it something of a showcase for Mazda's strategy and intentions." A critical component of that strategy is Skyactiv, the suite of efficiency-bolstering technologies on which Mazda is leaning as other automakers opt for mild hybrid systems to meet more stringent federal fuel-economy targets.
Indeed, Ms. Jensen praises the CX-5 for its stingy consumption of fuel; she averaged 33 miles per gallon on one road trip. But that efficiency comes at the cost of power. The CX-5 musters 155 horsepower, 30 horsepower less than the base model of the CR-V. What is retained, however, is the spirited ride for which Mazda is known, she writes:
The Mazda's steering has a fairly tight on-center feel and is predictable. On a really rumpled surface, the CX-5's ride was a bit choppy, verging on harsh. But that's a small price for such driving fun.
Read the entire review, check out the slide show and share your thoughts on the CX-5 in the comments.

HEADLINE: Freedom and Restraint

BYLINE: JOHN FABIAN WITT


HIGHLIGHT: In the crucible of emancipation, Lincoln created the rules that now govern soldiers around the world. 

 BODY:
New Haven
On Sept. 22, 1862 - 150 years ago today - Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, promising to free the slaves in any state still in rebellion on Jan. 1, 1863. Americans have celebrated Lincoln's proclamation, and argued about its meaning, ever since. But there's a surprising legacy that few Americans know anything about, one that historians have overlooked, even though it shows just how thoroughly American ideas of freedom reshaped the globe. Emancipation touched off a crisis for the principle of humanitarian limits in wartime and transformed the international laws of war. In the crucible of emancipation, Lincoln created the rules that now govern soldiers around the world.
Ever since 1775, when the royal governor of Virginia offered freedom to slaves who would turn against their revolutionary masters, American soldiers and statesmen held that freeing an enemy's slaves was anathema to civilized warfare. George Washington and the Continental Congress complained bitterly when British forces carried away slaves when they left New York in 1783.
In the War of 1812, British raids along the Chesapeake Bay encouraged thousands of slaves to escape to freedom. For more than a decade after the war ended, the American government pursued compensation from the British, contending that the laws of war protected slave owners from enemy depredations.
The irony of a humanitarian law that protected slave owners rather than slaves was not lost on European critics. But Americans argued that to seize an enemy's slaves was to make war on civilian economic resources.
White Southerners further argued that arming an enemy's slaves invited terrible atrocities by freed people against their former masters. Nineteenth-century Americans knew that the servile rebellions of antiquity had involved horrific violence: the Haitian revolution in the 1790s led to the slaughter of white slaveholders, while several abortive slave revolts in the American South showed that the pent-up violence of slavery could explode in bursts of nightmarish terror.
It was no surprise, then, that Southern whites reacted to Lincoln's proclamation with fury. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, condemned it as barbaric and inhumane, and he swore never to recognize black Union soldiers as entitled to the treatment afforded to prisoners of war. Instead he promised to punish them and their white officers as criminals, subject to enslavement or execution. The Union pledged to retaliate in turn. It soon seemed that efforts to limit the war might collapse altogether.
The South's threats forced the Union to restate its position on the laws of war. In December 1862, three weeks before the final emancipation order was to go into effect, and just as criticism of emancipation was reaching its height, Lincoln's general in chief, Henry W. Halleck, commissioned a pamphlet-length statement of the Union's view of the laws of war.
Drafted by the Columbia professor Francis Lieber and approved by Lincoln himself, the code set out a host of humane rules: it prohibited torture, protected prisoners of war and outlawed assassinations. It distinguished between soldiers and civilians and it disclaimed cruelty, revenge attacks and senseless suffering.
Most of all, the code defended the freeing of enemy slaves and the arming of black soldiers as a humanitarian imperative, not as an invitation to atrocity. The code announced that free armies were like roving institutions of freedom, abolishing slavery wherever they went. And it defended black soldiers by insisting that the laws of war made "no distinction of color" - indeed, mistreatment of black soldiers would warrant righteous retaliation by the Union.
The pocket-size pamphlet quickly became the blueprint for a new generation of treaties, up to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Strong nations like Prussia and France had long suspected that law-of-war initiatives were little more than maneuvering by weaker countries and closet pacifists hoping to make war more difficult. Lincoln's code broke that diplomatic logjam: It contained no hidden European agenda, and no one could accuse the Lincoln administration of trying to hold back strong armies.
To the contrary, the code had been devised just as Lincoln abandoned what he called the "rose-water" tactics of the war's first year in favor of the much more aggressive strategy signaled by emancipation.
And it set in motion the great paradox of the modern laws of war. These laws arose out of the greatest moral triumph of modern political history - emancipation - and they aimed to place outer limits on war's destruction. In a sense, they succeeded: the feared terrors of a mass slave insurrection never came to pass.
But by authorizing freedom, the new code also licensed a powerful and dangerous war strategy. It was a tool of the Union war effort, like the Springfield rifle and the Minié ball. That is why the Lincoln administration issued it, and that is why the most powerful states in the European world signed on to versions of it in the decades that followed.
The rules of armed conflict today arise directly out of Lincoln's example. They restrain brutality. But by placing a stamp of approval on "acceptable" ways to make war, they legitimate terrible violence. The law does not relieve war of all its terrors; it does not even purport to. But it stands as a living reminder, a century and a half later, of how thoroughly the United States' most significant moment still shapes our moral universe.
John Fabian Witt is a professor at Yale Law School and the author of "Lincoln's Code: The Laws of War in American History."

HEADLINE: Income Inequality and Educational Opportunity

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Investing in education is not just morally right, but also provides a strong return on investment, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
A core American value is that each individual should have the opportunity to realize his or her potential. Birth needn't dictate destiny. Education has been the traditional American pathway to opportunity and upward mobility, but this pathway is closing for a growing number of Americans in low- and middle-income families. 
And the failure to provide all Americans with the educational opportunities to realize their potential not only harms them; it harms the nation. 
Educational attainment levels rose rapidly throughout much of the 20th century, with the college completion rate quadrupling for those born between 1915 and 1975. But it has been largely stagnant since. 
The slowdown in college attainment levels has been most pronounced for individuals from low-income families. At the same time, the economic benefits of higher education have risen. In 1979, the average college graduate made 38 percent more than the average high school graduate. The comparable figure today is more than 75 percent. 
During the last three decades the gap between the educational attainments of children raised in rich and poor families has widened dramatically, and it reveals itself remarkably early in children's lives.

According to the most recent census report, about one-quarter of children under the age of 6 live in poverty. Recent research shows that early childhood poverty has negative effects on brain development. At the age of 3, children in poverty have smaller vocabularies than their peers and a harder time sorting and organizing information and planning ahead. 
Children in poor families are also less likely to have access to early-childhood education programs. Such programs have a proven record of raising future educational attainment levels, especially for poor children. Sadly, many states are slashing such programs, despite the fact that the funds dedicated to them earn an annual real rate of return of 10 percent or higher. 
Disparities in educational achievement among children from different income groups increase with age. Such gaps are larger in fifth grade than they are in kindergarten, and they continue to grow as children move through primary and secondary school. 
As a result of residential segregation, children from low-income families are more likely to have classmates with low achievement levels and behavioral problems than children from affluent families. Poor children are also disproportionately situated in schools that often find it difficult to attract and retain skilled teachers. And as the Chicago teachers' strike reminds us, poor children are often hungry, depending on their schools rather than their homes for breakfast and lunch. 
The United States is caught in a vicious cycle largely of its own making. Rising income inequality is breeding more inequality in educational opportunity, which results in greater inequality in educational attainment. That, in turn, undermines the intergenerational mobility upon which Americans have always prided themselves and perpetuates income inequality from generation to generation. 
This dynamic all but guarantees a permanent underclass. Indeed, the process is already under way: An American child's future income is already more dependent on his or her parents' income than a child born in most other developed countries. 
Demographic trends are aggravating this vicious cycle. More than half of all births in the United States now occur out of marriage, and incomes for single-parent families are lower than for married families. That's one reason that family incomes have been declining for more than 50 percent of all children during the last 40 years. 
Poverty rates are much higher in single-parent households than in married households. According to the most recent census numbers, 11.8 percent of all families, 6.2 percent of married families, 31.7 percent of single-parent families headed by a female and 15.8 percent of single-parent families headed by a male were living in poverty in 2011. About 48 percent of children in single-parent households headed by women were living in poverty, compared with about 11 percent of children in married households. And poverty claimed a staggering 57 percent of all children under the age of 6 in female-headed households. 
Researchers at the Hamilton Project have found a strong correlation between earnings and marriage rates. While marriage rates have declined across the board, the drop has been larger for middle- and low-income groups, especially for men with a high school degree or less. This group has experienced a large secular decline in real earnings during the last 30 years. A provocative new book posits that women are increasingly dominant in work and education and celebrates the growth of female-headed households as a sign that patriarchy is giving way to matriarchy. 
But there is another, less sanguine way to regard these trends. The rise of single-parent households headed by women may reflect the fact that women do not want to get married or stay married to such men or that men with weak earning prospects would rather drop out of the labor force altogether and avoid marital responsibilities. In either case, the news is not good for children and their educational opportunities and attainments.
Meanwhile, college-educated men and women are more likely to marry - most often to people with similar education levels - less likely to divorce and less likely to have children outside of marriage. Marriage and stable two-parent households are becoming marks of prosperity. These trends spell even greater income inequality and even greater inequality of opportunity for children in the future.
What can the federal government do to mitigate these trends? First, the progressivity of the federal tax and transfer system should be strengthened. The United States has one of the most unequal income distributions in the developed world, but its tax and transfer system is among the least progressive. 
Tax expenditures that disproportionately benefit high-income families should be limited, while the earned-income tax credit that benefits working families should be expanded. The tax rates on capital gains, dividends and carried interest, most of which go to top income earners, should be increased as part of a multiyear deficit reduction plan. 
Such a plan should also include more means-testing of entitlement programs and adequate funds for programs like food stamps, Head Start and Medicaid that address the needs of low-income families.
Second, the investments championed by President Obama to enhance educational opportunities - the $4 billion Race to the Top program to reward states for school reforms; the increase in the number and size of Pell grants; the tuition tax credit; the reformed student loan program; federal support for partnerships with community colleges - must be sustained. Deficit reduction must not be at the expense of these investments. Because they are investments, not handouts, they will end up paying for themselves.
Providing all Americans with the opportunity to realize their potential, regardless of their origins, is a core value. It is also a wise down payment on the nation's future prosperity. "A mind is a terrible thing to waste" is more than a clever slogan.

Welcome to our new Common Core Practice feature, which we'll post each Friday in collaboration with two teachers in New Jersey, Jonathan Olsen and Sarah Gross. 
The nutshell: We're experimenting with the new standards by publishing three actual tasks these teachers and their 9th grade humanities students tried each week. Each entry uses Times content, targets one or more of the Common Core E.L.A. Anchor Standards and provides ideas for "scaffolding" the task and taking it further.
Tell us what you think. We hope to improve this feature in conversation with our readers as we go.
 Common Core Practice Tasks | Week of Sept. 17 - 21, 2012 
 Argumentative Writing: 
Science: "Manga as Medical Tool"
Common Core Anchor Standards: RI4, RI10, W1, W9, W10, RH4, RH5
 Dr. Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently published a study showing that a new drug that promotes blood clotting in patients can reduce the chance of death in trauma patients. 
Because no pharmaceutical companies will devote money to an advertising campaign, Dr. Roberts has turned to nontraditional means to share the information with doctors around the world, including cartoons and manga comics.
 Your Task: Do you think it is a good idea to share research findings through visual media, like manga comics and cartoons? Write a paragraph in which you use information from this article to support your views. Provide at least one example where visual media could be helpful - or harmful - in sharing this kind of information.
 Before you do the task, you might... 

        
 View the manga comic created by Dr. Roberts.
        
Watch the cartoon, posted above, that was created by Dr. Roberts's nephew.
        
 Brainstorm a list of times in your life when you have been given information in a visual, rather than written, format. How well did you learn it?
 Extension Activities: 

        
Design a comic strip explaining an important rule in your school. The comic should be entertaining and informative, like Dr. Roberts's manga, and use elements like dialogue, pacing and sensory details to engage.
        
Watch this TED talk by the poet Billy Collins, in which several of his poems are turned into animated pieces. Do the animations help or hinder your interpretation of the poems?
 Informative Writing: 
National: "As Grocery Dies Off, Down-and-Out Town Lives On, if Barely"
Common Core Anchor Standards: RI1, RI2, W2, W9, RH2, RH5, WHST2
 The family-run Westside Grocery has been a fixture in the California town of Mendota since 1940, but its owner, Joseph Riofrio, was recently forced to shut its doors. If Mr. Riofrio, 50, cannot make it in this town, called "the Detroit of California," can anyone?

 Your Task: Explain in a paragraph what the conditions were in Mendota that forced Mr. Riofrio to close his family business.
 Before you do the task, you might... 

        
View a slide show of Mendota to see what the town looks like today.
        
 Read the article and find three to five reasons that help explain why Mr. Riofrio was forced to shut his business down.
        
Discuss how the recession has impacted small businesses in your community. 
 Extension Activity: 
Choose a small business that has been in your community for a long time and interview those who run it. What has it meant to the community? How has it changed over the years as the area has changed? How has the recession affected it?
 Argumentative Writing: 
Dining: "It's Been a While, Hasn't It?"
Common Core Anchor Standards: RI2, RI4, RI6, W1, W9, RH1, RH5, RH8, WHST4, WHST9
 The food critic for The New York Times, Pete Wells, has strong feelings about the popular New York City restaurant Le Cirque. Over a series of meals this year, Mr. Wells experienced the breadth of Le Cirque's menu under its new chef, Olivier Reginensi. 
 Your Task: In a paragraph, first state whether Mr. Wells gave Le Cirque a positive or negative review, then explain how the reviewer's word choice makes this clear. Cite two examples of figurative language that make an excellent argument for or against having dinner at Le Cirque. 
 Before you do the task, you might... 

        
 View a slide show of photos from Le Cirque.
        
Visit Le Cirque's Web site and look at its menu.
        
Read the article and underline positive word choices and circle negative word choices. When in the review did you realize that it would be largely positive or negative? Why?
 Extension Activity: 
Using Mr. Wells's review as a mentor text, write a one-paragraph review of your dinner tonight for homework, using at least two examples of figurative language.
 Want to do something more open-ended with "informational text?" 
Invite your students to post their answers weekly to our Student Opinion question, What Interested You Most in The Times This Week?

HEADLINE: Romney and His Palestinian Problem

BYLINE: SHMUEL ROSNER


HIGHLIGHT: Should Mitt Romney be elected president an unlikely peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would become even more unlikely. 

 BODY:
TEL AVIV - Palestinians have had their share of disappointment with President Barack Obama, but don't expect them to be crossing their fingers for a Mitt Romney victory.
On a visit to Israel at the end of July, Romney said that "culture" explains the "difference in economic vitality" between Israel and the Palestinian territories. Palestinian leaders called the comment racist.
Then last week, at the same Florida fundraiser at which he said that 47 percent of Americans are "dependent upon government," Romney said that the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish."
Predictably, these no-peace predictions earned him some criticism and suspicion. One columnistventured, "His comments seemed to reflect the views of his billionaire benefactor, Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $100 million to elect Romney."
Maybe so. On the other hand, when it comes to estimating the chances for peace, Romney's view just reflects what most Israelis and Palestinians think.
A poll conducted in June by the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found that "majorities among Israelis (71 percent) and Palestinians (68 percent) view the chances for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state next to Israel in the next five years as low or non-existent."
That's also what the vast majority of Jewish Americans believe. In the American Jewish Committee's 2011 annual survey of Jewish opinion, a whopping 76 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, "The goal of the Arabs is not the return of occupied territories but rather the destruction of Israel." 
But that is treading into slightly different territory than just gauging the prospects for peace; it's about guessing, much as Romney has done, at the Palestinians' intentions. And those, like the intentions of any vast group, can be difficult to assess. According to one poll last year, Palestinians support negotiations with Israel, but by a "2-to-1 margin they also oppose the two-state solution that's been the stated goal of negotiations," with most preferring "ending up with a single state" instead. Given many Israelis' objection to that outcome, to some people, the Palestinians' preference hardly seems compatible with peace.
Romney's take on the Palestinian problem is far from extraordinary. But by stating his views so bluntly - and before a bunch of Jewish voters in Florida - he has seriously harmed his ability to talk to the Palestinians. Should he be elected an unlikely peace would become even more unlikely.

HEADLINE: Sept. 20: Obama's Convention Bounce May Not Be Receding

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's position inched forward in the FiveThirtyEight forecast on Thursday, as he continues to do well in swing states and in surveys that use industry-standard polling methodology. 

 BODY:
President Obama's position inched forward in the FiveThirtyEight forecast on Thursday. His chances of winning the Electoral College are 76.1 percent, according to the forecast, up from 75.2 percent on Wednesday. Mr. Obama's projected margin of victory in the national popular vote also increased slightly, to 3.4 percentage points.
By and large, the story that Thursday's polls told was the same one as on Wednesday. Mr. Obama continues to get very strong results in state polls that use industry-standard methodology, meaning that they use live interviews and place calls to mobile phones along with landlines. 
In the 10 states that have generally been ranked the highest on our tipping-point list - Ohio, Virginia, Florida, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan - there have been 21 such polls since the Democratic convention ended. Mr. Obama has led in all 21 of these surveys - and usually by clear margins. On average, he has held a six-point lead in these surveys, and he has had close to 50 percent of the vote in them.
Mr. Obama's results have been more varied among polling firms that use different methodologies. A series of polls in eleven swing states, released on Thursday by the online firm YouGov, were fairly strong for Mr. Obama, putting him ahead among likely voters in all of the states except North Carolina.
But automated polls, like those from the Rasmussen Reports, have had lukewarm results for Mr. Obama. A Rasmussen Reports poll released on Thursday, for instance, put Mr. Obama three points behind in Iowa.
I don't mean to keep repeating this point about polling methodologies, but it really does seem to be the easiest way to unpack the state-level data right now. 
In contrast to the six-point lead Mr. Obama has held on average among the swing-state polls that included cellphones, and the five-point lead he had on average among the YouGov Internet surveys, Mr. Obama has been ahead by just two points on average in polls that called landlines only, most of which were "robopolls" conducted by automated script.
If Mr. Obama's lead is five or six points in the typical swing state right now, then Mitt Romney will probably need some sort of external contingency to give him much of a chance at winning. 
If Mr. Obama's lead is more like two points instead, then routine factors like the debates or economic reports could more easily put Mr. Romney ahead, although obviously there would be no guarantees.
Although the forecast model weighs polls from the stronger polling firms more heavily, it continues to project something of an in-between result - in part because the national polls seem to have gravitated more toward the range of a three- or four-point lead for Mr. Obama, and in part because it continues to assume that Mr. Obama could still be experiencing a modest afterglow from his convention that will subsequently fade. 
However, Mr. Romney will need to see Mr. Obama's numbers decline fairly soon if he wants to bank on the convention bounce hypothesis. The penalty that the forecast is applying to Mr. Obama's polls will phase out over the next week or so. The model would make Mr. Obama a 83.9 percent favorite right now were it not for the convention bounce adjustment. 
But isn't Mr. Obama's convention bounce declining already? It sure seemed to be the case a couple of days ago - but now the evidence has become more ambiguous.
The most powerful argument that Mr. Obama's convention bounce is fading - or perhaps has already faded - is the Gallup national tracking poll, which showed the race reverting to a tie on Thursday after once having given Mr. Obama a seven-point lead.
Gallup is one of four national tracking polls, however, and the others tell a variety of stories, none of which are exactly consistent.
In the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, Mr. Obama's numbers faded sharply late last week, but they have since rebounded. In Thursday's version of that poll, he held a three-point lead over Mr. Romney when voters who leaned toward a candidate were included.
In the Ipsos online tracking poll, Mr. Obama's numbers have fluctuated some, but he remains five points ahead among likely voters - only slightly off his peak. (The survey also put Mr. Obama 10 points ahead among the broader universe of registered voters.)
In the RAND Corporation's tracking poll, Mr. Obama lead has expanded slowly but steadily. In fact, he reached his highest level of the year on Thursday, with the survey giving him a 5.4 percentage point advantage among likely voters.
A simple average of the four tracking polls put Mr. Obama 3.4 percentage points ahead on Thursday. That is essentially no different than a week ago, when the same technique gave him a 3.5-point lead.
It's at least possible that Mr. Obama's bounce was fading - but that the attention to Mr. Romney's "47 percent" comments has since given Mr. Obama renewed momentum. It will take a few more days before we can come to any sort of conclusion about this, however, especially since some of the tracking polls use long field periods and have only conducted a fraction of their interviews since Mr. Romney's remarks were uncovered.
It's also possible that we've been jumping the gun. The four national tracking polls all shot up very quickly after the Democratic National Convention, to the point that it seemed possible that Mr. Obama might eventually (if temporarily) gain as much as a six- to eight-point advantage in the race.
But the Gallup tracking poll, which showed an especially sharp shift, could have been exaggerating it because of statistical variance - and now may be underselling it for the same reason.
Last week, Mr. Obama's state polls seemed to be underwhelming relative to his national ones. This week, just the opposite has been true. That might lend credibility to the hypothesis that the some of the national trackers initially exaggerated the extent of Mr. Obama's bounce - but also, that the Gallup poll now exaggerates his decline.
Of course, if you're a purist, then the Gallup survey is the only one of the four tracking polls that you'll find acceptable, since it's the only one to use a traditional methodology. But then you have to reconcile that with the fact that the polls using the strongest methodological standards at the state level are now giving Mr. Obama a six-point lead in the battleground states.
Mr. Romney would much prefer the robopolls, warts and all. And if his numbers don't improve soon, he had better hope that they are right.

HEADLINE: Fallout From "47 Percent" Comment Hits Senate Campaigns

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: If there was any doubt that Mitt Romney's secretly recorded comments about the "47 percent" had jumped beyond the presidential campaign, it was erased with the first question of the Virginia Senate debate on Thursday. 

 BODY:
If there was any doubt that Mitt Romney's secretly recorded comments about the "47 percent" had jumped beyond the presidential campaign, it was erased with the first question of the Virginia Senate debate on Thursday.
Noting that the Senate contest between George Allen and Tim Kaine was occurring "in the shadow of the presidential contest," David Gregory, the moderator of the debate and the host of NBC's "Meet the Press" program, asked the candidates to reflect on Mr. Romney's characterization of nearly half of the country as dependents who pay no federal income tax.
The answer by Mr. Kaine provided the newsiest moment in an otherwise predictable debate -- and a prime example of how difficult it can be for candidates at all levels to navigate touchy issues that emerge on the presidential campaign trail.
In several of the most bitterly contested Senate contests across the county, candidates spent the week nervously trying to avoid getting caught up in the political fallout from Mr. Romney's comments. The remarks were first reported by Mother Jones magazine, which posted video clips on its Web site Monday.
Republican candidates, in particular, sought to distance themselves from Mr. Romney's assertion that nearly half of the country believed that they were "victims" and were entitled to a range of services that made them dependents of the federal government.
But as Mr. Kaine proved on Thursday, the issue can be tricky for some Democrats, too.
Mr. Kaine, the state's former Democratic governor, called Mr. Romney's comments "condescending and divisive," but then went on to say he might support the idea of a minimum income tax that would ensure everyone pays at least some tax.
"I would be open to a proposal that would have some minimum tax level for everyone," Mr. Kaine said.
It was clearly an attempt by Mr. Kaine, who served as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to appear moderate on taxes and appeal to independent and Republican voters in Virginia who might be bothered by residents who pay no taxes at all.
But it provided an opening for Mr. Allen, the former Republican governor and Senator, to attack Mr. Kaine for "proposing" a new tax on all Virginia residents. 
During the debate, Mr. Allen repeatedly dodged questions about whether he agreed with Mr. Romney's comments, saying that "I have my own point of view, and my point of view is that people of America still believe in the American dream."
But after the debate, Mr. Allen seized on Mr. Kaine's response, saying, "I don't think everyone ought to be paying income taxes."
In the presidential campaign, President Obama sought to keep the issue of Mr. Romney's comments alive by jabbing at his rival during a forum for Latino voters hosted by Univision in Florida on Thursday.
"When you express the attitude that half the country considers themselves victims and wants to be dependent on government, my thinking is that you haven't gotten around a lot," Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Romney, meanwhile, sought to move past the controversy by insisting that he was concerned about "100 percent" of the people in the country. He also seized on a comment by Mr. Obama, who said Thursday that "you can't change Washington from inside, only from the outside."
Meanwhile, Senate candidates were still trying to figure out how to handle the weeklong controversy.
In Wisconsin, Senator Tommy Thompson, the Republican candidate for Senate, blamed Mr. Romney's recent messaging troubles for his own drop in the polls in his state. A new survey showed Mr. Thompson trailing Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat in the Senate race, by 9 points.
"The presidential thing is bound to have an impact on every election," Mr. Thompson told WKOW, the television station in Madison on Wednesday. "You know, whether you're a Democrat or Republican. If you're a standard-bearer for the presidency is not doing well, it's going to reflect on the down ballot."
In Massachusetts, the first debate between Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic challenger, and Scott Brown, the Republican incumbent, avoided any mention of Mr. Romney's comments.
That may be because Mr. Brown had moved quickly to denounce Mr. Romney's assertion that so many people saw themselves as victims. On Tuesday, Mr. Brown said, "That's not the way I view the world. As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, I know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in."
Ms. Warren has made a point throughout the campaign of trying to tie Mr. Brown to Mr. Romney's views. During the debate on Thursday, Ms. Warren said repeatedly that she agreed with Mr. Obama's policies. Mr. Brown never mentioned Mr. Romney once.
In Nevada, a similar dynamic has emerged in the race between Dean Heller, the Republican candidate, and Representative Shelley Berkley, the Democratic candidate.
"Keep in mind, I have five brothers and sisters. My father was an auto mechanic. My mother was a school cook. I have a very different view of the world," Mr. Heller told The Washington Post on Wednesday. "And as United States Senator, I think I represent everyone, and every vote's important. Every vote's important in this race. I don't write off anybody."
In Connecticut, Linda McMahon, the Republican candidate for Senate, was quick to say that she disagreed with what she called "Governor Romney's insinuation" that nearly half of all Americans consider themselves to be victims.
"I know that the vast majority of those who rely on government are not in that situation because they want to be," she said in a statement on her Web site this week. "People today are struggling because the government has failed to keep America competitive, failed to support job creators, and failed to get our economy back on track."
What do all of those Senate contests have in common? They are all close races. The outcome of any of them could determine which party in Washington controls the Senate next year.
The question for all of the candidates is whether the debate over the "47 percent" ends up being a brief diversion or a lasting issue. If it lasts, it could help shape a two-month, state-by-state conversation about the role of government and the fairness of the tax system. 
Or it could fade into the background, another intense -- but fleeting -- controversy that is largely forgotten by Election Day.

HEADLINE: Influencing Dodd-Frank

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Two years after passing Dodd-Frank, lawmakers are still tinkering behind the scenes. | Xstrata has until Monday to decide whether to accept Glencore's sweetened merger offer. | New York's attorney general, who runs a new task force on mortgage abuses, said the group would act soon. | A report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago raises concerns about high-frequency trading. 

 BODY:
Influencing Dodd-Frank | Two years after passing a spate of financial rules, lawmakers are still tinkering behind the scenes with Dodd-Frank. In a show of partisan haggling, more than 100 lawmakers have lobbied the Federal Reserve and other authorities over the Volcker Rule, writes Ben Protess of DealBook. A top aide to Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, has been reaching out to the Treasury Department and the Fed in an effort to limit the impact on local financial firms. While the Fed encouraged the aide to air his views publicly, internal government documents indicate some of the discussions took place in private. In a draft of the Volcker Rule, regulators adopted Mr. Brown's approach.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Brown faced off in a debate with his challenger for the Senate, the Harvard professor and consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren. Ms. Warren, a Democrat, has been a fierce supporter of regulations like the Volcker Rule. But the debate on Thursday focused on other issues, like Ms. Warren's ethnic heritage.
It's not just lawmakers trying to temper Wall Street regulation. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is "now controlled by judicial activists who seem quite willing to negate, on technical grounds, any regulations they do not like," writes Floyd Norris of The New York Times. Mr. Norris says the court "may yet be the institution that dooms many or even most of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms."
Three states, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Michigan, announced on Thursday that they had joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the regulatory overhaul, bringing more visibility to a legal effort that began in June.
Crunch Time for Glencore and Xstrata | The mining giant has until Monday to decide whether to accept Glencore's sweetened merger offer. According to The Financial Times, the two companies were in last-minute meetings on Thursday to review the details of the deal.
Once Xstrata weighs in, Qatar Holding is likely to give its view. The sovereign wealth fund has been a vocal opponent of the deal, pushing for a higher price.
Mortgage Fraud Busters Get Ready | New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who runs a new task force on mortgage abuses, told Reuters: "We'll see actions being taken sooner rather than later."
The group, which includes representatives of the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Internal Revenue Service, is looking at mortgage deals that contributed to the financial crisis.
On the Agenda | A Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Bart Chilton, is on CNBC at 11:20 a.m. Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is speaking at 12:40 p.m. to the Atlanta Institute of Internal Auditors. Rajiv Goel, the witness whose testimony helped convict Raj Rajaratnam of insider trading, is scheduled to be sentenced at 3:30 p.m. The latest iPhone hits stores on Friday, with Apple stock trading just below $700 a share.
Friday is also a quadruple witching day, the quarterly expiration of options and futures contracts, which can cause an unusually high trading volume. Judging by history, the expiration could be positive for stocks, CNBC notes.
The Barclays Center, the new home of the Nets in Brooklyn, has its ribbon-cutting on Friday. The British bank, for which the center is named, already seems to have fallen victim to the stadium-naming curse.
 Speed Before Safety? | Computers are ruling the market - and as we've been told, that may not be a good thing. A new report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, commissioned after market misses like the Facebook I.P.O. and the Knight Capital trading debacle, found that "out-of-control algorithms were more common than anticipated prior to the study and that there were no clear patterns as to their cause."
Such market disruptions have come into focus this week. At a Senate hearing on Thursday, David Lauer, a former high-speed trader who now works for the advocacy group Better Markets, said the process these firms used to see prices a split second faster than other participants "reeks of non-public information," The Wall Street Journal reports. Two experts at the hearing, Andy Brooks of T. Rowe Price and Larry Tabb of the research firm TabbGroup, disagreed over specific policy prescriptions but both said that something should be done to change the market, reports Nathaniel Popper in DealBook.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is hosting a roundtable on Oct. 2 to address these issues.

HEADLINE: Notes on the Political Economy of Redistribution

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The median is the message. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is getting beaten up, and rightly so, for claiming that redistribution is un-American. Of course we redistribute, and we've been doing it on a substantial scale for generations. Medicare, for example, is in effect a strongly redistributive program: it's supported by a payroll tax (and other revenue) in which the amount you pay in depends on your income, but it supplies a benefit that depends only on your medical costs. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!
So no, Obama isn't a radical for suggesting that we should continue to do what we're already doing; the real radicals are the people on the right who want to declare much of what our government has been doing these past three generations illegitimate.
The real question - arguably the central question of political economy - is how much to redistribute. And it's both interesting and important to try to understand how that decision gets made.
There's a substantial literature (see, for example, the references here (pdf)) that makes use of something like the following model: 
1. The government levies taxes on everyone - say, as a constant proportion of income
2. It uses that revenue to pay for a benefit that everyone receives
3. Voters choose parties based on which offers a tax/benefit program closest to the one that maximizes their own utility
4. The end result reflects the preferences of the median voter
This kind of model suggests that the median voter will in fact want redistribution as long as his or her income - median income - is less than average income, because in that case he'll have more to gain than to lose from a bit of redistribution. And this condition is always met, because income distribution is skewed to the right (there are people with incomes $1 million above the median, but none with incomes $1 million below the median).
But in that case, won't the median voter favor complete redistribution, with all income taxed away and then handed out as benefits? No, because of incentives: too high a tax rate will discourage effort and reduce overall incomes. So there's a tradeoff that leads to some equilibrium level of redistribution.
OK, it should be obvious that while this model is pretty, it falls down badly in the realism department. For one thing, median-voter models of politics suggest that the parties should converge on similar policies; in fact, they're deeply polarized. 
Beyond that, the model suggests that higher income inequality should lead to more redistribution. What we see in practice, however, is that European countries with relatively low inequality of market income do much more redistribution than the United States, with its high inequality - and that as America has gotten more unequal, its tax and transfer system has grown less, not more redistributive. 
I don't think we have a full explanation of these awkward facts. But the model is still useful for thinking about the political world we live in.
In particular, imagine yourself as a hired gun for the right tail of the income distribution. What would you do in an effort to stop the median voter from realizing that she would benefit from a more European-style system? Well, you'd do everything you can to exaggerate the disincentive effects of higher taxes, while trying to convince middle-income voters that the benefits of government programs go to other people. And at the same time, you'd do everything you can to disenfranchise lower-income citizens, so that the median voter has a higher income than the median citizen.
So far, efforts along these lines have been remarkably successful. But operatives on the right are clearly worried that their three-decade run of success may be coming to an end. Indeed, the whole panic about the lucky duckies and all that can be seen as reflecting a great fear on the part of the right that any day now the median voter will realize where his true interests lie, and start supporting much more redistributionist policies. 
So now you know what was bugging Romney at Boca, and why there's such a desperate attempt to paint Obama as a radical.

HEADLINE: Joaquín Almunia on Europe's Tough Terms for Approving Universal-EMI Deal

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview, Mr. Almunia, the driving figure in the negotiations in Brussels over the future of EMI, explains why Europe insisted that Universal sell its assets globally, not just in Europe. 

 BODY:
 The most important man in music at the moment is not a hit-spotting executive in New York or London, but, rather, a diminutive Spanish bureaucrat whose decisions about the breakup of EMI will largely determine the shape of the industry for years to come. 
 Joaquín Almunia, the European Commission's vice president for competition, has been the driving figure in the negotiations in Brussels over the future of EMI. In June, the commission approved a $2.2 billion sale of EMI's music publishing business to a group led by Sony, with a relatively small number of concessions. 
 On Friday, the commission signed off on the Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion bid for EMI's record labels, but only after months of talks and an extensive divestment package that requires selling off the rights to some of EMI's most prominent labels and artists. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the deal. 
 On Thursday, while in New York for a conference at Fordham Law School, Mr. Almunia spoke with The Times about his efforts to preserve competition and cultural diversity in the music business. 
 Q. 
 Even with these disposals, Universal will be by far largest record company in the world. How can you preserve competition with one party so large as a result? 
 A. 
It's true that the position of Universal before the merger was quite strong, and that this merger, without remedies, would have created an unacceptable market position. Having considered the situation, we are ready to clear the decision with remedies. Those remedies will in our view avoid the materialization of the serious risks we observed in our statement of objections.
Broadly speaking, our remedies represent two-thirds of EMI's revenue in European Economic Area. In our analysis, this will not change substantially the competition environment in each national market. And at the European level, this huge package of remedies includes something like 90 percent of the Anglo repertoire of EMI.
The way we have asked Universal to draft the remedies package, we have obtained additional guarantees of noncompetitive risks. One is that rights that will be sold are worldwide, because in the negotiations with the big platforms in the digital music market the conditions are established worldwide, not only for E.E.A. [European Economic Area] users. The second thing - without being precise, because this question is subject to confidentiality protection - is that we will try to establish good conditions for the independents, and, if possible, to have no barriers for the creation of another operator in the market.
 Q. 
 Early on, you rejected most of Universal's arguments in justification of the merger, like the idea that their market power is limited by piracy or by digital music services. What arguments did that leave in support of it? 
 A. 
The initial arguments that I received from Universal were not very convincing. All these arguments about piracy, and "We need to build a European champion ... ." We are talking about the digital music market, which is mainly global. Don't create barriers where barriers cannot exist anymore.
On other hand, in the analysis of the E.E.A. market and of the markets in each country, will the competitive conditions change substantially because of the merger, after taking into account remedies, yes or no? This is what we looked at. The situation is not the same in the different markets throughout the world. Here in the U.S., the market power of Universal is not as big as it is in Europe.
 Q. 
 It's very big, though. 
 A. 
Yes, but not as big as in Europe. And here there is no question of cultural diversity. This is important in Europe, because we deal not only with Anglo repertoire, but Spanish, French, German, Swedish - every country has its own culture, even if the Anglo repertoire is extremely important.
 Q. 
 A number of people, including independent groups like Impala, were asking for this to be blocked outright. Was that a possibility? 
 A. 
We met with Impala several times. Yes, they would have liked a negative decision. But other independents understand that they can take advantage of the new conditions of the market, provided that size of the remedies package is substantial - as will be the case - and that some other additional conditions will keep barriers to entry as low as possible.
The situation of this market has changed very quickly in the last years. In some aspects the changes have created better conditions for the indies to survive, but in other ways they have not. So let's see if we cannot create additional difficulties with our decision, but try to improve as much as possible the conditions under which the digital music market can become an opportunity for new composers and new singers to flourish, and for the new big successes of indies promoting and selling new music.

HEADLINE: An Alternate Interpretation of Romney's '47 Percent'

BYLINE: ANAND GIRIDHARADAS


HIGHLIGHT: Many assume the Republican presidential nominee was channeling the arrogance of the One Percent. But he may have been voicing the pain of people a lot poorer. 

 BODY:
ASSISI, Italy - When Mitt Romney's closed-door remarks calling 47 percent of Americans "victims" emerged this week, it caused a protracted firestorm. What was he thinking? Was this a pivotal moment in the campaign? Was it even possibly the end?
In much of the ensuing analysis, it was taken for granted that Mr. Romney's comments flowed from his own extraordinary wealth. But in this week's Currents column, I challenge that idea.
The resentments that Mr. Romney was voicing are not the customary resentments of the one percent who live in Aspen, Colorado, and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. They are, instead, the resentments you hear from a class of Americans less elite than Mr. Romney but more elite than the 47 percent, privileged but only just, feeling squeezed by a lousy economy and by a sense of falling behind in a fast-changing country.
However ham-fistedly it came out, Mr. Romney may have been trying to channel a very real sense among many Americans that the tables of privilege are turning and that today's fortunate may be tomorrow's left-behind.
 Tell us: What do you think Mr. Romney was doing? Was he channeling the rage of the one percent? Or was it the bitterness of that other 47 percent above the bottom 47?

 BODY:
 Internal government documents showed lawmakers lobbying behind the scenes to mute the Volcker Rule. | Goldman Sachs introduced someone who may be the first of the next generation of leaders. | Andrew Ross Sorkin declared Occupy Wall Street a fad.
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions »
 BP Offers to Acquire Larger Stake in Rosneft | The British oil company has offered to acquire a bigger stake in the Russian state oil company if it can sell its interests in a private joint venture, Mr. Kramer reported. BP's chief made the offer in a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. DealBook »
The deal also holds the promise of reviving an ill-fated offshore exploration deal in the Russian Arctic that fell apart last year amid lawsuits, and more broadly tie BP's fate to Russia for years to come. 
 French Carmaker May Sell Logistics Arm | Struggling to stay afloat in the faltering European car market, PSA Peugeot Citroën has entered exclusive negotiations with J.S.C. Russian Railways to sell 75 percent of Gefco for 800 million euros, or about $1 billion, David Jolly and Andrew E. Kramer reported. DealBook »
The French automaker is reeling from its heavy exposure to the European market and its dependence on relatively low-margin models. New passenger car registrations were down 7.1 percent this year in Europe. With the euro zone in recession and the future of the currency itself uncertain, analysts were not predicting a quick turnaround.
 Anschutz Is Said to Consider Sale of Its Entertainment Division | The parent company, owned by the billionaire Philip Anschutz, expects to reap billions of dollars from any sale of the sports and entertainment juggernaut that owns stakes in teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Kings, Michael J. de la Merced reported. DealBook »
The company is in the midst of pushing for approval to build a $1.2 billion stadium in downtown Los Angeles in an effort to draw in a professional football team to the city for the first time since the Rams decamped for St. Louis in 1995.
 Lowe's Ends Effort to Acquire Rona, Its Canadian Rival | The home improvement retailer abandoned its $1.8 billion hostile bid, a move that avoids a political showdown with the government in Quebec, Ian Austen reported. DealBook »
In a rare point of agreement, both the Liberal Party, which lost an election this month in Quebec, and the separatist Parti Québécois, which will form the province's next government, spoke out strongly against the deal despite commitments from Lowe's to maintain a Canadian head office in Quebec and to cultivate Canadian suppliers.
 Russia to Raise $5 Billion in Sberbank Stake Sale | The Russian government announced that it would sell a 7.6 percent stake in the country's largest lender, in a rights offering that could raise around $5.1 billion, Mark Scott reported. DealBook »
The move would be one of Russia's largest share sales in recent years as the government aims to reduce its stakes in a number of the country's largest companies.
Investors have long awaited the announcement of Sberbank's rights offering, which had been hampered by volatility in global financial markets and the recent depressed performance of Russian stocks.
Investment Banking »
 Executive at Goldman Is Retiring | Goldman Sachs introduced what may be the first of the next generation of leaders to run the storied Wall Street firm, Peter Lattman reported. The bank's longtime chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, will retire at the end of January and be replaced by Harvey M. Schwartz, a 48-year-old executive. DealBook »
Analysts said the departure of Mr. Viniar, who was viewed by analysts and investors as a source of stability for Goldman, indicated that the bank's leadership believed it had put one of the most challenging times in its history behind it. And it will likely spur further speculation about who will replace Mr. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive since 2006. Mr. Blankfein, who will turn 58 on Thursday, has said he has no plans to retire.
 Deal Professor: Behind Goldman Sachs's Success, a Focus on Survival | Steven M. Davidoff says that "Goldman is becoming the last pure-play, big investment bank. In a world where business consultants preach that a focus on your best business lines is necessary to success, Goldman is likely to have an advantage over the banking conglomerates." DealBook »
It wasn't long ago that Goldman Sachs was painted as an outsize villain of the financial crisis, and its future seemed hazy. Today, however, Goldman Sachs has retained its clients and its dominance. And recent missteps by its competitors are putting the investment bank in pole position to profit when a recovery comes.

 Big Stock Offering by Japan Airlines Is Overshadowed by China's Anti-Japanese Protests | JAL's share price was weighed down by investor jitters over the airline's prospects in a cutthroat industry, Hiroko Tabuchi reported. DealBook »
JAL has also become a far smaller airline with a more limited global reach and capacity that may be ill positioned to tap into growth, especially in Asia, where the aviation industry is most likely to have its fastest gains.
Legal/Regulatory »
 Standard Chartered Signs Pact With New York Regulator | The British bank agreed last month to pay $340 million to settle claims of illegally funneling money for Iranian banks and corporations. Until Friday, though, the final details were not hashed out, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported. DealBook »
Federal authorities, including the Manhattan district attorney and the Justice Department, have their own investigations into Standard Chartered's activities. The bank is expected to resolve any criminal allegations with the Manhattan district attorney's office by next week, according to law enforcement officials. 
 Behind Scenes, Some Lawmakers Push to Change the Volcker Rule | More than 100 lawmakers have lobbied the Federal Reserve and other authorities, Ben Protess reported. E-mails between the Federal Reserve's top lawyer and an aide to Senator Scott Brown provide a glimpse of the partisan fight. DealBook »
"I have a very urgent request," Nathaniel Hoopes, Mr. Brown's aide, wrote in an April 2011 e-mail. Seeking to fine-tune an exemption, he argued that a broad range of bank customers should be allowed to invest with hedge funds under the Volcker Rule. "My boss has been hearing it from constituents," he added, referring to the rule's impact on Massachusetts-based financial firms.
In a first draft of the rule released last fall, regulators agreed with that broad definition.
 The Trade: Distortion in Tax Code Makes Debt More Attractive to Banks | Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica says that banks pay a lot less taxes thanks to the tax code's favoring of debt over equity, a distortion that makes the financial system and the economy more fragile, prone to bankruptcies and runs. DealBook »
The system we have subsidizes the middleman to create dubious products. Those products help the middlemen - the banks - but they make the financial system more fragile. So the tax code distortion doesn't just lead to more debt in corporate America and more leveraged banks. It also helps create a finance-heavy economy where the banking sector accounts for a bigger proportion of gross domestic product and corporate profits than it otherwise would. Granted, the tax code is far from the only force in American society that creates a larger financial sector or overleveraged corporations. But it's one of the least recognized.

HIGHLIGHT: Internal government documents showed lawmakers pushing behind the scenes to mute the Volcker Rule. | Goldman Sachs introduced someone who may be the first of the next generation of leaders. | Andrew Ross Sorkin declared Occupy Wall Street a fad. 

 BODY:
 Internal government documents showed lawmakers lobbying behind the scenes to mute the Volcker Rule. | Goldman Sachs introduced someone who may be the first of the next generation of leaders. | Andrew Ross Sorkin declared Occupy Wall Street a fad.
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions »
 BP Offers to Acquire Larger Stake in Rosneft | The British oil company has offered to acquire a bigger stake in the Russian state oil company if it can sell its interests in a private joint venture, Mr. Kramer reported. BP's chief made the offer in a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. DealBook »
The deal also holds the promise of reviving an ill-fated offshore exploration deal in the Russian Arctic that fell apart last year amid lawsuits, and more broadly tie BP's fate to Russia for years to come. 
 French Carmaker May Sell Logistics Arm | Struggling to stay afloat in the faltering European car market, PSA Peugeot Citroën has entered exclusive negotiations with J.S.C. Russian Railways to sell 75 percent of Gefco for 800 million euros, or about $1 billion, David Jolly and Andrew E. Kramer reported. DealBook »
The French automaker is reeling from its heavy exposure to the European market and its dependence on relatively low-margin models. New passenger car registrations were down 7.1 percent this year in Europe. With the euro zone in recession and the future of the currency itself uncertain, analysts were not predicting a quick turnaround.
 Anschutz Is Said to Consider Sale of Its Entertainment Division | The parent company, owned by the billionaire Philip Anschutz, expects to reap billions of dollars from any sale of the sports and entertainment juggernaut that owns stakes in teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Kings, Michael J. de la Merced reported. DealBook »
The company is in the midst of pushing for approval to build a $1.2 billion stadium in downtown Los Angeles in an effort to draw in a professional football team to the city for the first time since the Rams decamped for St. Louis in 1995.
 Lowe's Ends Effort to Acquire Rona, Its Canadian Rival | The home improvement retailer abandoned its $1.8 billion hostile bid, a move that avoids a political showdown with the government in Quebec, Ian Austen reported. DealBook »
In a rare point of agreement, both the Liberal Party, which lost an election this month in Quebec, and the separatist Parti Québécois, which will form the province's next government, spoke out strongly against the deal despite commitments from Lowe's to maintain a Canadian head office in Quebec and to cultivate Canadian suppliers.
 Russia to Raise $5 Billion in Sberbank Stake Sale | The Russian government announced that it would sell a 7.6 percent stake in the country's largest lender, in a rights offering that could raise around $5.1 billion, Mark Scott reported. DealBook »
The move would be one of Russia's largest share sales in recent years as the government aims to reduce its stakes in a number of the country's largest companies.
Investors have long awaited the announcement of Sberbank's rights offering, which had been hampered by volatility in global financial markets and the recent depressed performance of Russian stocks.
Investment Banking »
 Executive at Goldman Is Retiring | Goldman Sachs introduced what may be the first of the next generation of leaders to run the storied Wall Street firm, Peter Lattman reported. The bank's longtime chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, will retire at the end of January and be replaced by Harvey M. Schwartz, a 48-year-old executive. DealBook »
Analysts said the departure of Mr. Viniar, who was viewed by analysts and investors as a source of stability for Goldman, indicated that the bank's leadership believed it had put one of the most challenging times in its history behind it. And it will likely spur further speculation about who will replace Mr. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive since 2006. Mr. Blankfein, who will turn 58 on Thursday, has said he has no plans to retire.
 Deal Professor: Behind Goldman Sachs's Success, a Focus on Survival | Steven M. Davidoff says that "Goldman is becoming the last pure-play, big investment bank. In a world where business consultants preach that a focus on your best business lines is necessary to success, Goldman is likely to have an advantage over the banking conglomerates." DealBook »
It wasn't long ago that Goldman Sachs was painted as an outsize villain of the financial crisis, and its future seemed hazy. Today, however, Goldman Sachs has retained its clients and its dominance. And recent missteps by its competitors are putting the investment bank in pole position to profit when a recovery comes.

 In Buyback Deal, Alibaba Gets Half of Yahoo's Stake | Yahoo got $3 billion to return to its shareholders, Mr. de la Merced reported.

 Big Stock Offering by Japan Airlines Is Overshadowed by China's Anti-Japanese Protests | JAL's share price was weighed down by investor jitters over the airline's prospects in a cutthroat industry, Hiroko Tabuchi reported. DealBook »
JAL has also become a far smaller airline with a more limited global reach and capacity that may be ill positioned to tap into growth, especially in Asia, where the aviation industry is most likely to have its fastest gains.
Legal/Regulatory »
 Standard Chartered Signs Pact With New York Regulator | The British bank agreed last month to pay $340 million to settle claims of illegally funneling money for Iranian banks and corporations. Until Friday, though, the final details were not hashed out, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported. DealBook »
Federal authorities, including the Manhattan district attorney and the Justice Department, have their own investigations into Standard Chartered's activities. The bank is expected to resolve any criminal allegations with the Manhattan district attorney's office by next week, according to law enforcement officials. 
 Behind Scenes, Some Lawmakers Push to Change the Volcker Rule | More than 100 lawmakers have lobbied the Federal Reserve and other authorities, Ben Protess reported. E-mails between the Federal Reserve's top lawyer and an aide to Senator Scott Brown provide a glimpse of the partisan fight. DealBook »
"I have a very urgent request," Nathaniel Hoopes, Mr. Brown's aide, wrote in an April 2011 e-mail. Seeking to fine-tune an exemption, he argued that a broad range of bank customers should be allowed to invest with hedge funds under the Volcker Rule. "My boss has been hearing it from constituents," he added, referring to the rule's impact on Massachusetts-based financial firms.
In a first draft of the rule released last fall, regulators agreed with that broad definition.
 The Trade: Distortion in Tax Code Makes Debt More Attractive to Banks | Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica says that banks pay a lot less taxes thanks to the tax code's favoring of debt over equity, a distortion that makes the financial system and the economy more fragile, prone to bankruptcies and runs. DealBook »
The system we have subsidizes the middleman to create dubious products. Those products help the middlemen - the banks - but they make the financial system more fragile. So the tax code distortion doesn't just lead to more debt in corporate America and more leveraged banks. It also helps create a finance-heavy economy where the banking sector accounts for a bigger proportion of gross domestic product and corporate profits than it otherwise would. Granted, the tax code is far from the only force in American society that creates a larger financial sector or overleveraged corporations. But it's one of the least recognized.

HEADLINE: At Racetrack, Economic Pressures Overpower Veterinarians' Oath

BYLINE: By WALT BOGDANICH, JOE DRAPE and REBECCA R. RUIZ; Dara Miles, Laura Dodd and Rebecca Teitel contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Only after Bourbon Bandit broke a leg racing last November did his owner, Susan Kayne, learn the full extent of prescription drugs that veterinarians had given him at Belmont Park on Long Island.
Until then, Ms. Kayne had believed that Bourbon Bandit was ''sound and healthy,'' because that is what her trainer told her, she said. But new veterinary bills arrived, showing that the horse had been treated regularly with clenbuterol, a widely abused medication for breathing problems that can build muscle by mimicking anabolic steroids.
''If a horse is sound, why does it need all these drugs?'' she asked. ''I never gave consent.''
Gene and Eileen Hartis said they, too, were shocked by their bill, from a California veterinarian, showing that in just over three months in 2010, their graded stakes winner, Princess Haya, had been given drugs for pain, soreness and swelling 34 times, as well as seven doses of clenbuterol. 
''It's so contrary to our philosophy that we explained in length to our vet and trainer,'' Mr. Hartis said.
More than anyone in the sport, racetrack veterinarians are supposed to put the horse first, having taken an oath to protect ''animal health and welfare.''Yet in the shed rows of America's racetracks and at private training centers, racehorse veterinarians often live by a different code -- unique in the veterinary community -- one that emphasizes drugs to keep horses racing and winning rather than treating soreness or injury through rest or other less aggressive means, according to dozens of interviews and a review of medical and regulatory records.
Only veterinarians can legally prescribe medicine, yet they often let trainers, who are paid to win races, make medical decisions, including which drugs to use. These veterinarians also have a powerful financial incentive to prescribe drugs: they are both doctor and drugstore, and so the more drugs they prescribe, the more money they make. Selling and administering drugs, in fact, accounts for most of their income.
In contrast, veterinarians who treat small animals or pets earn most of their money from examinations and other professional services.
''Is it any wonder that our industry is being criticized for being overmedicated?'' said Stuart S. Janney III, chairman of the Thoroughbred Safety Committee of the Jockey Club, an influential industry group.
Still, despite the concern that a drug culture pervades America's racetracks -- especially with the arrival of casinos offering fattened purses -- little attention has been paid to the veterinarians who prescribe these medications.
The American Association of Equine Practitioners, the industry's most influential veterinary group, acknowledges that ''to a very large extent'' medical treatments are geared toward when a horse is racing, rather than toward what might be in the horse's best interest. And while the group has worked hard to make racing safer, it has made scant progress in changing how racehorse veterinarians earn their money.
''That's a tough nut to crack,'' said Dr. Jeff Blea, the association's vice president. ''You are talking about decades and generations of the way things are done.''One of New York State's most prominent racetrack veterinarians, Dr. James C. Hunt Jr., made his loyalties clear in a letter to regulators, arguing that trainers should not regularly have to reveal medication regimens.
''The veterinarians will honor this because the trainers are their real clients, not the owners,'' wrote Dr. Hunt, who treated I'll Have Another when the horse was training for the Belmont Stakes after winning this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. (He was scratched on the eve of the race.)
Dr. Hunt added, ''The board must also understand that trainers make nearly 100 percent of all veterinarian decisions regarding the medication of their horses.''
Dr. Blea strongly disagrees with this approach. ''You've got to remember, you are the vet,'' he said.
While doping racehorses with banned chemicals -- for example, the potent secretion of a type of South American frog -- is almost universally condemned, debate continues over the safety of using legal drugs that keep horses competing by reducing pain and inflammation, as well as therapeutic drugs like clenbuterol that can make horses run faster.
Racing regulators say overmedicating injured horses can contribute to fatal breakdowns. On average, 24 horses die each week at the nation's state-regulated racetracks, according to a New York Times analysis of racing records, reported in March.
Even so, the belief that prescription drugs are good for horses and for business is reflected in the ubiquity of veterinarians at the racetrack.
In the 1970s, only seven or eight veterinarians used to cover two Southern California racetracks. Today, California officials say veterinarians' vehicles are so numerous on the backside that trainers complain they have trouble getting their horses onto the track.
Few would dispute that the great majority of veterinarians and trainers care deeply about their horses and are emotionally devastated when they break down and are euthanized. But the pressure to perform -- and win -- is intense. ''I've had owners send their horses to people they know are not playing by the rules,'' said Eric Reed, a Kentucky-based trainer with more than $13 million in career earnings. ''If you can't beat them, join them.''
The Times reported that since 2009, 3,800 horses had tested positive for drugs, the vast majority for illegal levels of prescription drugs. (State rules specify allowable drug levels or how close to race time a drug can be administered.) Many veterinarians and trainers say these test results are mistakes, not attempts to cheat. Yet veterinarians who may have played a role, inadvertent or not, in the positive tests usually escape serious scrutiny because of the trainer responsibility rule, where trainers are automatically held responsible, regardless of circumstance.
In the rare instances that veterinarians are banned from racetracks for breaking the rules, they can continue practicing at private, unregulated training centers if state veterinary boards do not suspend their licenses.
This regulatory gap has allowed one New York veterinarian to treat horses at private centers despite a felony conviction for selling anabolic steroids to weight-lifters and a history of violating state rules on drugs in racing.
While veterinarians provide invaluable services, ''They push the envelope to the limit,'' Mr. Reed says, adding, ''If you got a good vet with ethics, you are not going to do very well.''A Drug Takes Hold
Long after every other major sport had banned anabolic steroids for their muscle-building effect, racetrack veterinarians continued to prescribe the drugs, saying they would speed a horse's recovery from racing, stoke its appetite and get it back into competition.
Not everyone bought that explanation.
''When you look at the pattern of behavior and the quantities that they were using, it's hard to argue that the steroids were for recovery,'' said Matt F. Iuliano, executive director of the Jockey Club. ''They were trying to do a whole lot more than keep horses' noses in the feed bucket.''
Racing banned steroids in 2010, but another prescription drug -- clenbuterol, brand name ventipulmin -- could also build muscle and act as a stimulant. Darrell Haire, a regional manager for the Jockeys' Guild, told California racing officials that in morning workouts, clenbuterol ''moves a horse up at least a second.''
Clenbuterol is approved only to treat respiratory disease, often caused by poor air quality in barns, and many veterinarians and trainers consider it highly effective. But evidence of its widespread abuse surfaced last year when California authorities reported finding the drug in all 72 quarter horses they tested and in 54 percent of thoroughbreds. Even yearlings were getting the drug to improve appearance and increase sale price.
Clenbuterol became so popular that in California sales totaled at least $7 million annually. Illegal supplies of super-potent clenbuterol, some smuggled in from Mexico, began showing up at racetracks, according to California regulators.
Jack Van Berg, a Hall of Fame trainer, said young horses ''are all torn up'' when fed muscle-building drugs. ''Clenbuterol is one of the worst things that happened to racing,'' he told a forum on drug use this year.
When not used as directed -- in high doses or from an illegal supplier -- clenbuterol has killed horses and caused a host of health problems.
The drug's manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim, says clenbuterol ''should be withdrawn'' after 30 days. ''Long term, you start pushing a horse into the beginning stages of heart failure,'' explained Kenneth H. McKeever, associate director of research at the Rutgers Equine Science Center. But many veterinarians do not follow this guideline, treatment records show.
Scott Lake, a trainer who for many years led the nation in wins, is an unabashed fan of clenbuterol. ''I use a lot of clenbuterol in horses,'' he said in a televised interview early this year, calling it a good bronchodilator. He also criticized regulators for giving trainers ''a black eye'' for positive tests on clenbuterol, since it is not an ''exotic'' drug. Mr. Lake has been cited seven times in four states for illegal levels of clenbuterol.
Because of clenbuterol abuse, several states, including California, have restricted its use.
That will not stop horses from being trained on it, and possibly benefiting from it when racing. Dr. McKeever said that while he has not seen any studies showing how long the drug's steroidal effects last, anecdotally he believes horses stay ''muscled up for weeks afterward.''The Treatment
Clenbuterol was one of the drugs that concerned Ms. Kayne when it showed up in $3,200 of veterinary bills that arrived unexpectedly after her horse Bourbon Bandit broke down and was retired from racing.
''I have spent literally every day of my life in the company of thoroughbreds,'' Ms. Kayne said in an interview. ''I have no problem with racing big, sound, healthy horses. I spent a lot of time in Europe at racetracks and saw the fruits of drug-free racing.''
The bills, she said, showed that a veterinarian whom she had never met had purchased clenbuterol without her approval. Wanting to know why, Ms. Kayne wrote to the veterinarian. He turned out to be Dr. Hunt, who has one of New York's biggest racetrack practices.
Dr. Hunt responded that all veterinary procedures ''were done so under the instructions of your authorized agent and trainer.''
Ms. Kayne said she had never given her trainer, Bruce Levine, permission to use clenbuterol.
So she contacted Dr. Hunt again, asking how the ailment had been diagnosed. He said another veterinarian, Dr. Gregory J. Bennett, had performed an endoscopic exam that found mild throat inflammation and ''mucous in the trachea, signs consistent with inflammatory airway disease.''
Dr. Bennett, however, said his exams were normal, according to a letter he sent to Ms. Kayne.
The association of equine veterinarians says treatments ''should be based upon a specific diagnosis and administered in the context of a valid and transparent owner-trainer-veterinarian relationship.''
Dr. Bennett, who prescribed the pain and anti-inflammatory drugs, said he administers treatments generally at the trainer's request. ''You may wish to consult Bruce Levine about the injections as these are part of his racing program and are routinely done with all of his horses,'' he said.
Drs. Hunt and Bennett declined to be interviewed, as did Mr. Levine. Dr. Hunt is seeking payment of his bills through arbitration, while Ms. Kayne has asked the state's racing commission and veterinary board to investigate Bourbon Bandit's treatment.
Gene and Eileen Hartis, horse owners in Texas, also describe themselves as ''minimalist when it comes to medication.'' ''We were opposed to anything that would mask an injury just so a horse would run,'' Mr. Hartis said.
Their first bill from a California veterinarian was for $8,500 for just over three months. Every horse they had sent to their trainer was healthy, Mr. Hartis said. Even so, the horses began receiving drugs without the owners' permission ''from the minute they got off the trailer,'' he said. Two horses received clenbuterol on the same seven days, invoices show.
The veterinarian, Dr. Keith Latson, declined to comment.Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board, said veterinarians often find themselves in an untenable position: ''The vet's fiduciary responsibility is to the owners, but it's the trainers that hire and fire them. Who are you going to be beholden to?'' What's more, trainers often know their horses better than veterinarians do, because they spend more time with them.
Hong Kong, widely regarded as the world's safest, most tightly regulated horse racing venue, operates differently. Veterinarians are employed directly by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which oversees racing and holds disciplinary power.
Under this system, clenbuterol may not be given unless a horse has been endoscopically examined within two days of the prescription, according to the club's executive director, William A. Nader. ''Clinicians must report all findings of clinical relevance in detail -- accurately and promptly,'' he added.
A 'Blind Spot'
It did not take long for word to circulate that a cheap, easily obtainable drug might make horses run faster if administered close to race time. Better yet, regulators might not suspect it.
So on April Fools' Day in 2011, trainers at harness tracks tried it on nine racehorses. All finished in the money -- eight in first place, one in second.
Over 12 days, with nearly $600,000 at stake at harness tracks in New York and Pennsylvania, 36 of 38 horses using the drug finished first or second, with 31 winning their races.
Another surprise was the drug itself, oxymetazoline, an ingredient in Afrin, an over-the counter cold medicine. Oxymetazoline, which is not approved for racing, stimulates a horse's cardiovascular system when administered in large doses through an inhalation mask.
Some of the doped horses shared more than prize money. They also shared certain veterinarians, including Dr. Louis A. Grasso, according to New York racing commission records.
In addition to his felony conviction for selling steroids to weight-lifters, Dr. Grasso lost his New York State racing license for giving drugs too close to race time and signing blank scratch forms.
In 2000, Delaware authorities suspected him of treating horses without a license in the state, but when they tried to arrest him, Dr. Grasso led the police on a chase through the back roads of New Castle County. When they finally caught him, officers found needles, syringes and two banned drugs in his vehicle. He eventually pleaded guilty to resisting arrest.
Though New York's Racing and Wagering Board has stripped Dr. Grasso of his license to practice at racetracks, it has no authority over his activities elsewhere.
The racing board also referred his conduct to the state's veterinary board, which could bar him from practicing anywhere in the state. But it has not done so, leaving Dr. Grasso free to work at off-site training centers.
What's more, New York is not among the few states that let regulators test for illegal drugs at private training centers. When the racing board tried to put in place out-of-competition testing, a horsemen's group went to court in 2011 and stopped it.
As a result, said Dr. George A. Maylin, who directs the state's testing program, there is no effective way to detect certain performance-enhancing drugs. Horses can be doped at the training centers, then shipped to racetracks. ''The drugs are used days to weeks in advance, and positives will only be from mistakes and dummies,'' Dr. Maylin said.
Indiana, which has one of the most comprehensive out-of-competition programs, discovered last year that four racehorses had been illegally given zilpaterol, a bulking supplement for cattle. Joe Gorajec, executive director of the Indiana Horse Racing Commission, said the racing industry's failure to push harder for out-of-competition testing had created a major ''blind spot.''
Joseph S. Anderson, a trainer who had five horses test positive for oxymetazoline last year after the state began testing for it after races, kept his horses at one of the off-site training centers where Dr. Grasso works, north of New York City. Mr. Anderson told investigators that he bought his nebulizer mix from his two veterinarians, one of them Dr. Grasso, records show. The nebulizer regimen ''is a fairly regular one at the barn,'' Mr. Anderson said.
The trainer was suspended and fined. Dr. Grasso remained beyond the regulators' reach.
Dr. Grasso, in an interview, accused regulators of having a vendetta against him and his family. ''Anything that goes wrong with harness racing they point to me,'' he said. Afrin, he said, had long been used for therapy in harness and thoroughbred horses and had never before resulted in positive tests.
While acknowledging past mistakes, Dr. Grasso said he treats horses well. ''Veterinarians out in the field are out there to help horses, not hurt them,'' he said. ''We are probably the only ones who have the horses' well-being in mind.''
After repeated questions from The Times about its handling of Dr. Grasso's case, the state Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline, which oversees the Veterinary Board, issued a statement that said, in part, ''We have recently taken affirmative steps to have the Racing and Wagering Board share data following their review of racetrack veterinary medicine practices.''
State veterinary boards rarely discipline veterinarians who run afoul of racing rules. In New York, only 2 of the board's 125 disciplinary actions over the last 10 years involved racehorse veterinarians, a review by The Times found.
''Losing a racing license is not a big enough deterrent,'' said Edward J. Martin, president of the Association of Racing Commissioners International, a trade group. ''We believe losing a veterinarian's license is. This is a hole in the regulatory scheme and needs to be plugged.''
In Kentucky, Dr. Rodney J. Stewart's racing license was suspended in 2007 after he brought cobra venom, a banned nerve-deadening agent, onto the grounds of the Keeneland racetrack. Dr. Stewart has retained his veterinary license.
In 2010, Dr. Phillip R. Kapraun kept his Illinois veterinary license after he, too, was fined for possessing snake venom at Balmoral Park south of Chicago.
In an interview, Dr. Kapraun said he had administered 20,000 doses of the substance to horses over the years and continued to do so at off-track facilities, arguing that it heals tendon injuries quickly and safely. He acknowledged that a horse might benefit more from months away from competing. ''The economics of horse racing does not allow for that. Horse racing is on the decline. If a horse needed a year to heal up, they would go to the killers up in Canada or Mexico,'' he said, referring to slaughterhouse.
Veterinary boards may be reluctant to punish, said Dr. Larry R. Bramlage, a prominent equine surgeon. ''The state regulatory board,'' he said, ''consists of mostly inactive elements of the profession, and they don't like to sit over one of their own.''
And even if boards are inclined to discipline wayward practitioners, they may not be informed of violations. Veterinarians have raised objections to having state boards review racetrack practices, saying that their peers should be able to review racetrack practices first.A Change of Heart
Twenty years ago, a prosperous California veterinarian, Dr. Gregory L. Ferraro, surprised his colleagues when he publicly condemned a prescription drug culture that he had helped create.
Six years later, he left a racetrack practice with more than $2 million in annual billings -- mostly for drugs and other treatments.
''The last five years of my practice I let two young associates take over that aspect of my practice and I only wanted to see the lame and the sick,'' Dr. Ferraro said. ''I couldn't stand it anymore.''
Dr. Ferraro, who now directs the equine health program at the University of California, Davis, remembers being the first veterinarian at his track to use a fiber-optic endoscope, a flexible tube that could peek into a horse's respiratory tract and easily spot small amounts of blood. He conducted a study to see how often endoscopes found blood. And while the numbers were not large, he said, a drug, furosemide, appeared to help.
Most regulators say furosemide, a diuretic sold under the trade name Salix, enhances performance by flushing 20 to 30 pounds of water out of a horse. Now, virtually all horses in the United States, whether they need it or not, get a needle filled with furosemide plunged into their neck several hours before racing.
Dr. Ferraro found himself in the vanguard of veterinarians advocating for the wide use of furosemide and other new therapeutic drugs, like phenylbutazone, or ''bute'' used for inflammation and pain. These drugs, he believed, could make racing safer, more humane.
But over time, he said, he came to realize that veterinarians were using drugs simply to keep horses racing, not to treat their underlying conditions.
''There comes a time in every horse's career that you've got to stand up and say, 'That's enough. We are endangering this horse,' '' Dr. Ferraro said. ''There are not a lot of veterinarians willing to do that.''
Racing authorities in Europe and Hong Kong will not allow horses to compete with any prescription drugs in their bodies. In the United States, a large group of veterinarians, trainers and owners disagree strongly with that stance. Furosemide has proved itself safe, they say, and not using it might endanger a horse's health.
In July, Kent H. Stirling, chairman of the medication committee of the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, told a Congressional panel that horses in training benefit from therapeutic medicine much as people use aspirin to ''ease sore muscles.''
''We're not like Europe, where horses spend half the year in the pasture eating grass,'' Mr. Stirling said in an interview in March. ''The owners want a return on the investment and the trainer needs to keep the horse as fit as he can.'' Mr. Stirling said that if a horse has a nagging injury, it is ''not fair to the horse'' if the trainer does not treat it.
Dr. Mary Scollay, chief veterinarian for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, said bute and banamine, another anti-inflammatory, are not the same as aspirin and other over-the-counter pain medicines.
''These are drugs that you need to have a prescription for and are more powerful and given in larger doses than what's sold over the counter,'' Dr. Scollay said.
Tracy Farmer, a longtime breeder and owner who is also vice chairman of the Kentucky's racing commission, said the liberal use of prescription drugs has harmed racing. ''Look no further than the number of contenders in this year's Kentucky Derby now sidelined by injury or already retired to stud,'' Mr. Farmer said.
This happens almost every year, he added. ''By the time the Breeders' Cup rolls around, most Triple Crown stars are out of action, depriving the sport of heroes like Seabiscuit and John Henry.''
Dr. Ferraro says he and other veterinarians share the blame for turning racehorses into commodities.
''We took a beautiful, noble thing and screwed it up,'' he said. ''Horses are too good to put a price tag on. Some things ought to be sacred.''

HEADLINE: Freedom and Restraint

BYLINE: By JOHN FABIAN WITT. 
John Fabian Witt is a professor at Yale Law School and the author of ''Lincoln's Code: The Laws of War in American History.''

 BODY:
New Haven
ON Sept. 22, 1862 -- 150 years ago today -- Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, promising to free the slaves in any state still in rebellion on Jan. 1, 1863. Americans have celebrated Lincoln's proclamation, and argued about its meaning, ever since. But there's a surprising legacy that few Americans know anything about, one that historians have overlooked, even though it shows just how thoroughly American ideas of freedom reshaped the globe. Emancipation touched off a crisis for the principle of humanitarian limits in wartime and transformed the international laws of war. In the crucible of emancipation, Lincoln created the rules that now govern soldiers around the world.
Ever since 1775, when the royal governor of Virginia offered freedom to slaves who would turn against their revolutionary masters, American soldiers and statesmen held that freeing an enemy's slaves was anathema to civilized warfare. George Washington and the Continental Congress complained bitterly when British forces carried away slaves when they left New York in 1783. 
In the War of 1812, British raids along the Chesapeake Bay encouraged thousands of slaves to escape to freedom. For more than a decade after the war ended, the American government pursued compensation from the British, contending that the laws of war protected slave owners from enemy depredations.
The irony of a humanitarian law that protected slave owners rather than slaves was not lost on European critics. But Americans argued that to seize an enemy's slaves was to make war on civilian economic resources.
White Southerners further argued that arming an enemy's slaves invited terrible atrocities by freed people against their former masters. Nineteenth-century Americans knew that the servile rebellions of antiquity had involved horrific violence: the Haitian revolution in the 1790s led to the slaughter of white slaveholders, while several abortive slave revolts in the American South showed that the pent-up violence of slavery could explode in bursts of nightmarish terror.
It was no surprise, then, that Southern whites reacted to Lincoln's proclamation with fury. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, condemned it as barbaric and inhumane, and he swore never to recognize black Union soldiers as entitled to the treatment afforded to prisoners of war. Instead he promised to punish them and their white officers as criminals, subject to enslavement or execution. The Union pledged to retaliate in turn. It soon seemed that efforts to limit the war might collapse altogether.
The South's threats forced the Union to restate its position on the laws of war. In December 1862, three weeks before the final emancipation order was to go into effect, and just as criticism of emancipation was reaching its height, Lincoln's general in chief, Henry W. Halleck, commissioned a pamphlet-length statement of the Union's view of the laws of war.
Drafted by the Columbia professor Francis Lieber and approved by Lincoln himself, the code set out a host of humane rules: it prohibited torture, protected prisoners of war and outlawed assassinations. It distinguished between soldiers and civilians and it disclaimed cruelty, revenge attacks and senseless suffering.
Most of all, the code defended the freeing of enemy slaves and the arming of black soldiers as a humanitarian imperative, not as an invitation to atrocity. The code announced that free armies were like roving institutions of freedom, abolishing slavery wherever they went. And it defended black soldiers by insisting that the laws of war made ''no distinction of color'' -- indeed, mistreatment of black soldiers would warrant righteous retaliation by the Union.
The pocket-size pamphlet quickly became the blueprint for a new generation of treaties, up to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Strong nations like Prussia and France had long suspected that law-of-war initiatives were little more than maneuvering by weaker countries and closet pacifists hoping to make war more difficult. Lincoln's code broke that diplomatic logjam: It contained no hidden European agenda, and no one could accuse the Lincoln administration of trying to hold back strong armies.
To the contrary, the code had been devised just as Lincoln abandoned what he called the ''rose-water'' tactics of the war's first year in favor of the much more aggressive strategy signaled by emancipation.
And it set in motion the great paradox of the modern laws of war. These laws arose out of the greatest moral triumph of modern political history -- emancipation -- and they aimed to place outer limits on war's destruction. In a sense, they succeeded: the feared terrors of a mass slave insurrection never came to pass.
But by authorizing freedom, the new code also licensed a powerful and dangerous war strategy. It was a tool of the Union war effort, like the Springfield rifle and the Minié ball. That is why the Lincoln administration issued it, and that is why the most powerful states in the European world signed on to versions of it in the decades that followed.
The rules of armed conflict today arise directly out of Lincoln's example. They restrain brutality. But by placing a stamp of approval on ''acceptable'' ways to make war, they legitimate terrible violence. The law does not relieve war of all its terrors; it does not even purport to. But it stands as a living reminder, a century and a half later, of how thoroughly the United States' most significant moment still shapes our moral universe.

HEADLINE: As the U.S. Borrows, Who Lends?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, when the United States government was borrowing huge amounts of money and paying very low interest rates to do it, critics scoffed that a lot of Treasury bonds were being purchased by China, and even more of them were ending up in the hands of the Federal Reserve, the American central bank. 
What would happen if China decided to start selling Treasury bonds? And what would happen if the Fed's appetite for government bonds were to be quenched?
Not much, it appears.
Estimates by the Treasury Department released this week indicated that over the 12 months through July, China reduced its position in Treasury securities by $165 billion, cutting them to $1.15 trillion despite making a small amount of purchases in July. And the Federal Reserve reported that, as of Wednesday, it owned $1.65 trillion in Treasury securities, $17 billion less than it had owned a year earlier.
The rates the Treasury is paying to borrow remain extraordinarily low.
That is partly because of the Fed, of course, but they would be much higher if investors were unwilling to lend money at rates as low as one-tenth of 1 percent, the current rate on three-month Treasury bills.
Standard & Poor's may have taken away the country's AAA rating, but there is still confidence that the United States will pay its bills. In Europe, by contrast, fears of government defaults -- or currency devaluations if a country leaves the euro zone -- have caused capital to flee across the Atlantic.
While the Fed has basically held its total Treasury holdings steady since the summer of 2011, their makeup has changed as the central bank bought more longer-term securities. A year ago, 10 percent of the holdings were in securities that would mature within a year. Now, that figure is close to zero. The proportion of securities with maturities over 10 years has almost doubled, to 23 percent.
The Fed hoped that would help to hold down longer-term interest rates, and perhaps provide economic stimulus.
China's selling of Treasuries over the 12-month period was offset by the actions of Japan, another country whose trade surplus with the United States remains large. The Japanese are estimated to have increased their holdings by $232 billion over the 12 months, to $1.12 trillion. Those figures include both government and private holders of Treasuries.
Japan was the largest overseas holder of Treasuries until 2008, when it was passed by China. When China's estimated holdings peaked last July, it held 48 percent more Treasuries than Japan. Now, that margin is down to 3 percent, and it could easily vanish in coming months.
July was the first month that the total Treasury debt issued to the public topped $10 trillion. Of that, 53 percent was held by overseas investors, 30 percent by American companies and investors, and the rest by the Fed.
That $10 trillion total is well below the number sometimes reported for the federal debt, which was almost $16 trillion at the end of July.
The larger figure includes money lent to the Treasury by other government agencies, principally the Social Security Administration.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Who Is Owed by the United States: Despite running budget deficits of more than $1 trillion a year, the United States has been able to borrow at very low interest rates. Over the last year, the Federal Reserve, the American central bank, did not buy any Treasury securities, but the government had no trouble raising cash from domestic and foreign investors. That was true even though China, the largest lender to the United States, was selling Treasury securities. (Sources: U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Federal Reserve, Bloomberg, Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Helps Free 2 From Gambia Prison

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- Two Gambian-Americans serving long prison sentences are now in the United States after the Rev. Jesse Jackson made a personal plea to Gambia's erratic president, Yahya Jammeh, to release them this week. 
Mr. Jackson traveled to the tiny West African country, considered one of the most repressive on the continent, after an international outcry over Mr. Jammeh's announced plans to conduct a mass execution of dozens of prisoners on his country's death row.
Nine prisoners have already been killed. However, several days before Mr. Jackson arrived Sunday, Mr. Jammeh announced a moratorium on the executions, after expressions of disapproval from the European Union, the United Nations and other international groups.
The two men Mr. Jackson helped release, Amadou Scattred Janneh and Tamsir Jasseh, had been high-ranking officials in Mr. Jammeh's government who were convicted on the routine charge of treason leveled against those who fall out of favor with it. They were held in the country's notorious Mile 2 Central Prison.
In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Jasseh, who had been head of Gambia's immigration agency, described his six and a half years in prison as a ''very horrible experience, inhumane,'' saying he had been ''tortured horribly.'' Mr. Janneh, a former information minister, said Mile 2 was ''one of the worst prisons in the world.'' Neither man had been on death row.
Mr. Janneh once taught at the University of Tennessee, and Mr. Jasseh is a veteran of the United States military.
Mr. Jackson said his personal connection to the Gambian president provided an opening in persuading the leader, a former army colonel and wrestler who seized power in 1994, to release the two men. ''I've known him and met him on several occasions,'' Mr. Jackson said.
Human rights groups routinely denounce Mr. Jammeh's government for its systematic use of torture, jailing of journalists, repression of free speech and rigging of elections.
Freedom House, in its latest report on Gambia, cited ''voter intimidation and government control of the media,'' saying ''journalists are subject to arrests, harassment and violence.'' It noted the ''torture of prisoners, including political prisoners,'' as well as ''severe suppression of the opposition, media and civil society.''
Shortly before Mr. Jackson's arrival, two leading independent newspapers were shut down by Mr. Jammeh's government. Two journalists were arrested over having sought a permit to protest the executions. Earlier in the month, the government expelled a visiting BBC West Africa correspondent who had come to report on the executions.
''These executions were a distraction from growth,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview, noting what he said was the country's high economic growth rate.
''They've got some good things happening there,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''There are some arrows pointing upwards.''

HEADLINE: A 21st-Century Islam

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Muslim world cannot have it both ways. It cannot place Islam at the center of political life -- and in extreme cases political violence -- while at the same time declaring that the religion is off-limits to contestation and ridicule.
Islam is one of the world's three great monotheistic religions. Of them it is the youngest by several centuries and, perhaps for that reason, the most fervid and turbulent. It is also, in diverse forms, a political movement, reference and inspiration. 
Politics is a rough-and-tumble game. If the emergent Islamic parties of nations in transition -- like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Ennahda in Tunisia -- are to honor the terms of democratic governance they will have to concede that they have no monopoly on truth, that the prescriptions of Islam are malleable and debatable, and that significant currents in their societies have different convictions and even faiths.
The past couple of weeks have been discouraging. Nobody expects a U.S. standard of freedom of speech to be adopted -- or even fully understood -- in these societies; they will set their own political and cultural frameworks inspired by a still fervent desire to escape from despotism, whether secular or theocratic, and by the central place of faith.
But the failure in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt to control violent mobs of Salafis enraged by mockery in America and Europe of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad suggests an unacceptable ambivalence: The rule of law here on earth must override divine indignation.
The world has tried Islamic republics. It found them oxymoronic. As Iran illustrates, they don't work: Republican institutions, shaped by the wishes of men and women, fall victim to the Islamic superstructure, supposedly shaped by God.
The great challenge of the Arab Spring is to prove that, as in Turkey, parties of Islamic inspiration can embrace a modern pluralism and so usher their societies from a culture of grievance and victimhood to one of creativity and agency.
Just how deep the grievances remain in the Arab world -- over loss of power, economic stagnation, colonial intrusion, Western wars and Israel -- has been clear in the latest eruption. Change will be slow.
But it is coming: These societies will not return to tyranny. The West has an overwhelming strategic interest in supporting transitions that offer the youth of the Arab world opportunity: Egypt now dwarfs Afghanistan in its importance to fighting Islamic extremism.
But the West will not do so by compromising its own values. The porn-grade American movie that started the unrest was pitiful. The murderous violence that followed from Cairo to Benghazi was criminal. Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical newspaper, then had a strong editorial case for mocking the religious fundamentalism that produced the killing; it chose to do so through caricatures of Muhammad.
Gérard Biard, the editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, put the case well: ''We're a newspaper that respects French law. Now, if there's a law that is different in Kabul or Riyadh, we're not going to bother ourselves with respecting it.'' Alluding to all the violence, Biard asked: ''Are we supposed to not do that news?''
He is right. There are too many hypocrisies in Islam -- deploring attacks on it while often casting scorn on Judaism and Christianity, claiming the mantle of peace while inspiring violence -- for it to expect to be spared the cartoonist's arrows.
The video insulting Muhammad reflected the visceral Islamophobia of its authors. Charlie Hebdo was driven by a different agenda: the refusal to be cowed by a spate of atavistic Islamist religious violence.
Still, I defend the right of the video's authors even if I loathe what they produced. The U.S. Supreme Court, in its 1969 Brandenburg v. Ohio decision, overturned the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader who had menaced political officials with violence, saying that ''the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force.'' As Glenn Greenwald wrote in The Guardian, ''Obviously, if the state cannot suppress speech even where it explicitly advocates violence, then it cannot suppress a video on the ground that it implicitly incites violence.''
The rich maelstrom of ideas in the United States is inextricably tied to this fundamental freedom. It cannot be compromised.
As for the new leaders of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, and the great mass of moderate Muslims, they might recall the words of the late Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri protesting the stolen Iranian election of 2009 -- an example of God's supposed will imposed over the will of the people:
''A characteristic of a strong and legitimate government -- Islamic or not -- is that it is capable of respecting all opinions, whether they support it or oppose it. This is necessary for any political system, in order to embrace all social classes and encourage them to participate in the affairs of their nation, and not dismiss and repulse them.''
Montazeri fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini because his Iranian theocracy was incapable of ''respecting all opinions.'' Decades on, in this Arab awakening, that challenge remains for political Islam.

HEADLINE: Shares Close Flat After Rally on iPhone Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks closed flat on Friday even though investors welcomed Spain's efforts to seek a bailout and cheered the first day of sales of the newest iPhone introduced by Apple, driving its shares to a record high.
Apple, the world's most valuable public company in terms of market capitalization, rose to a record high of $705.07 as customers lined up to buy the iPhone 5. Apple's stock ended up 0.2 percent at $700.09.
News from Spain helped lift stocks after the debt-laden country said it was considering freezing pensions and speeding up a planned rise in the retirement age as it raced to cut spending and meet conditions of an expected international sovereign aid package. 
The moves, taken with the European Central Bank's efforts to spur growth in the euro zone and the Fed's recent announcement of a third round of quantitative easing, continued to underpin gains.
''The market is predominantly looking forward to the Federal Reserve and the QE infinity that the Fed promised, and the globally coordinated easing cycle,'' Steve Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments in New York, said.
But this week, the market's action has been muted, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index barely moving 0.6 percent in either direction daily.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 17.46 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 13,579.47 on Friday. The S.& P. 500 dipped 0.11 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to finish at 1,460.15. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 3,179.96.
A quick and sharp sell-off in spot gold shortly after midday, driven by a rumor that the CME Group might raise margin requirements on commodities, weighed on financial services stocks, according to Joseph Greco, managing director of Meridian Equity Partners in New York.
Many banks and other companies in the financial sector have high exposure to gold and other commodities, so any increase in margin requirements would affect them, Mr. Greco said.
Spot gold later recovered to close with a gain of $7.80.
But financial shares were still lower by late afternoon on Friday. The S.& P. financial index ended down 0.3 percent.
The transportation sector limited the market's advance on Friday, when the Dow Jones transportation average fell 1 percent. The benchmark S.& P. 500 index has gained 5.9 percent since the start of August, mostly on expectations for new economic stimulus measures from the world's central banks. On Sept. 13, the Federal Reserve announced a third round of stimulus or quantitative easing, known as QE3, intended to bolster the economy and reduce unemployment.
The market was more active than usual because of ''quadruple witching,'' the quarterly settlement and expiration of four different types of September equity futures and options contracts. Expiration can lead to greater volume and volatility as players adjust or exercise their derivative positions.
''There was a little bit of a sell-off towards the close, but nothing crazy,'' JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, said. ''There is not much volatility because the market has been trading in a pretty tight range most of the day, and it looks like most of the players have already rolled their positions over the last two weeks.''
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 98 27/32, and the yield fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Medicare Bills Rise as Records Turn Electronic

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON, JULIE CRESWELL and GRIFFIN J. PALMER

 BODY:
When the federal government began providing billions of dollars in incentives to push hospitals and physicians to use electronic medical and billing records, the goal was not only to improve efficiency and patient safety, but also to reduce health care costs.
But, in reality, the move to electronic health records may be contributing to billions of dollars in higher costs for Medicare, private insurers and patients by making it easier for hospitals and physicians to bill more for their services, whether or not they provide additional care.
Hospitals received $1 billion more in Medicare reimbursements in 2010 than they did five years earlier, at least in part by changing the billing codes they assign to patients in emergency rooms, according to a New York Times analysis of Medicare data from the American Hospital Directory. Regulators say physicians have changed the way they bill for office visits similarly, increasing their payments by billions of dollars as well.
The most aggressive billing -- by just 1,700 of the more than 440,000 doctors in the country -- cost Medicare as much as $100 million in 2010 alone, federal regulators said in a recent report, noting that the largest share of those doctors specialized in family practice, internal medicine and emergency care. 
For instance, the portion of patients that the emergency department at Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare in Utica, N.Y., claimed required the highest levels of treatment -- and thus higher reimbursements -- rose 43 percent in 2009. That was the same year the hospital began using electronic health records.
The share of highest-paying claims at Baptist Hospital in Nashville climbed 82 percent in 2010, the year after it began using a software system for its emergency room records.
In e-mailed statements, representatives for both hospitals said the increases reflected more accurate billing for services. Faxton also said its patients required more care than in past years.
Over all, hospitals that received government incentives to adopt electronic records showed a 47 percent rise in Medicare payments at higher levels from 2006 to 2010, the latest year for which data are available, compared with a 32 percent rise in hospitals that have not received any government incentives, according to the analysis by The Times.
The higher coding has captured the attention of federal and state regulators and private insurers like Aetna and Cigna. This spring, the Office of Inspector General for the federal Health and Human Services Department warned that the coding of evaluation services had been ''vulnerable to fraud and abuse.''
Some experts blame a substantial share of the higher payments on the increasingly widespread use of electronic health record systems. Some of these programs can automatically generate detailed patient histories, or allow doctors to cut and paste the same examination findings for multiple patients -- a practice called cloning -- with the click of a button or the swipe of a finger on an iPad, making it appear that the physicians conducted more thorough exams than, perhaps, they did.
Critics say the abuses are widespread. ''It's like doping and bicycling,'' said Dr. Donald W. Simborg, who was the chairman of federal panels examining the potential for fraud with electronic systems. ''Everybody knows it's going on.''
When Methodist Medical Center of Illinois in Peoria rolled out an electronic records system in 2006, Dr. Alan Gravett, a former emergency room physician, quickly expressed alarm.
He said the new system prompted doctors to click a box that indicated a thorough review of patients' symptoms had taken place, even though the exams were rarely performed, while another function let doctors pull exam findings ''from thin air'' and include them in patients' records.
In a whistle-blower lawsuit filed in 2007, Dr. Gravett contended that these techniques drove up Medicare reimbursement levels substantially. According to the lawsuit, Dr. Gravett was eventually fired for ordering too many tests. He says he was retaliated against for complaining about the new system. The Justice Department is weighing whether to join an amended suit in Federal District Court in Central Illinois.
An independent analysis by The Times showed that Methodist's Medicare billings for the highest level of emergency care jumped from 50 percent of its emergency room Medicare claims in 2006 to more than 80 percent in 2010, making the 353-bed hospital one of the country's most frequent users of high-paying evaluation codes.
Methodist declined to comment on Dr. Gravett's allegations. But in an e-mailed statement, a spokesman said that not all of the hospital's billing was done electronically, that it followed professional coding guidelines and that its patients required more care than patients at other hospitals.
Many hospitals and doctors say that the new systems allow them to better document the care they provide, justifying the higher payments they are receiving. Many doctors and hospitals were actually underbilling before they began keeping electronic records, said Dr. David J. Brailer, an early federal proponent of digitizing records and an official in the George W. Bush administration. But Dr. Brailer, who invests in health care companies, acknowledged that the use of electronic records ''makes it faster and easier to be fraudulent.''
Both the Bush and Obama administrations have encouraged electronic records, arguing that they help doctors track patient care. When used properly, the records can help avoid duplicate tests and remind doctors about a possible diagnosis or treatment they had not considered. As part of the economic stimulus program in 2009, the Obama administration put into effect a Bush-era incentive program that provides tens of billions of dollars for physicians and hospitals that make the switch.
But some critics say an unintended consequence is the ease with which doctors and hospitals can upcode -- industry parlance for seeking a higher rate of reimbursement than is justified. They say there is too little federal oversight of electronic records.
A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department, however, said electronic health records ''can improve the quality of care, save lives and save money.'' Medicare, he added in an e-mailed statement, ''has strong protections in place to prevent fraud and abuse of this technology that we're improving all the time.''
He also said Medicare had reduced improper payments in the last two years.
In emergency rooms, which use special billing codes to indicate how much care a patient needs, hospitals have increased their claims for the two highest-paying categories to 54 percent of Medicare claims in 2010, from 40 percent in 2006, according to The Times's analysis of Medicare data. The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative journalism group, recently released a similar analysis.
Some contractors handling Medicare claims have already alerted doctors to their concerns about billing practices. One contractor, National Government Services, recently warned doctors that it would refuse to pay them if they submitted ''cloned documentation,'' while another, TrailBlazer Health Enterprises, found that 45 out of 100 claims from Texas and Oklahoma emergency-department doctors were paid in error. ''Patterns of overcoding E.D. services were found with template-generated records,'' it said.
The Office of Inspector General is studying the link between electronic records and billing.
One sophisticated patient witnessed the overbilling firsthand. In early 2010, Robert Burleigh, a health care consultant, came to the emergency room of a Virginia hospital with a kidney stone. When he received the bill from the emergency room doctor, his medical record, produced electronically, reflected a complete physical exam that never happened, allowing the visit to be billed at the highest level, Mr. Burleigh said.
The doctor indicated that he had examined Mr. Burleigh's lower extremities, but Mr. Burleigh said that he was wrapped in a blanket and that the doctor never even saw his legs.
''No one would admit it,'' Mr. Burleigh said, ''but the most logical explanation was he went to a menu and clicked standard exam,'' and the software filled in an examination of all of his systems. After he complained, the doctor's group reduced his bill.
As software vendors race to sell their systems to physician groups and hospitals, many are straightforward in extolling the benefits of those systems in helping doctors increase their revenue. In an online demonstration, one vendor, Praxis EMR, promises that it ''plays the level-of-service game on your behalf and beats them at their own game using their own rules.''
The system helps doctors remember what they did when they successfully billed for similar patients, and ensures that they do not forget to ask important questions or to perform necessary tests, said Dr. Richard Low, chief executive of Infor-Med Corporation, which developed Praxis. ''The doctor can use a chart the way the pilot uses a checklist,'' he said.
But others place much of the blame on the federal government for not providing more guidance. Dr. Simborg, for one, said he helped draft regulations in 2007 that would have prevented much of the abuse that now appears to be occurring. But because the government was eager to encourage doctors and hospitals to enter the electronic era, he said, those proposals have largely been ignored.
''What's happening is just the problem we feared,'' he said.

HEADLINE: At Unveiling of Barclays Center, Owner Talks of a Nets Championship

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
On a stage packed with dignitaries, one man stood tallest, so tall that the microphone had to be raised by a foot to meet his chin. When he spoke, the message was no less striking.
Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the towering owner of the re-branded Brooklyn Nets, celebrated the unveiling of his team's new arena Friday morning by predicting a playoff berth this season and a championship within three years.
The $1 billion Barclays Center will open with a Jay-Z concert Friday. It will be six weeks before the Nets make a meaningful basket. But this was a day for dreamy rhetoric and bold visions. 
''For me, there is only one place: No. 1,'' said Prokhorov, the 6-foot 8-inch Russian billionaire who purchased the team two years ago. ''And I do my best in order to reach championship.''
The Nets made huge strides this summer, re-signing Deron Williams, acquiring Joe Johnson and restocking their roster with enough talent to crack the top tier of the Eastern Conference. They might not be ready to dethrone the Miami Heat, but they will be worthy rivals to the Knicks and, Prokhorov said, ''worthy of this great arena and the borough of Brooklyn.''
The 675,000-square-foot Barclays Center is expected to host 220 events a year, including concerts, family events and college basketball games. But it is the Nets, Brooklyn's first major professional team since the Dodgers departed in 1957, who will call it home for most of the calendar year.
The team will make its Brooklyn debut with a preseason game on Oct. 15. The first regular-season game is on Nov. 1, against the Knicks, a night that Prokhorov said, ''I am really thirsting for.''
The ribbon-cutting doubled as a victory party for the local officials who pushed Barclays Center into being, despite the protests of neighborhood groups, through dozens of legal challenges in a down economy.
It took eight years for the developer Bruce Ratner, who bought the Nets in 2004 with the intent of moving them to Brooklyn, to see his vision come to life at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush avenues.
Ratner sold his majority stake in the team in 2009 but he remains the primary owner of the arena and, along with the borough president Marty Markowitz, its most energetic cheerleader. He enjoyed his moment Friday, presiding from a stage on the main concourse, overlooking the arena's lower bowl.
The lights were flipped on at 9:38 a.m., on Ratner's cue, as he cooed into the microphone, ''Ohhh, we got there! We got it.''
The Nets' new home is distinctive, with an exterior of weathered steel and glass and a grand oculus that juts out over the main plaza, framing the sky. Inside, the Nets will play on a herringbone-patterned court, the only one in the N.B.A., and drive to the hoop across an all-black lane, also an original feature of the arena.
''I think it's the best arena in the world,'' Prokhorov said.
The hardwood floor was off limits to the news media Friday, but Brook Lopez, the Nets' center, took a leisurely stroll to the large black ''B'' stamped at center court.
The arena's high-definition scoreboard is visible from the main doors, not far from a new subway entrance providing access to 11 train lines and the Long Island Rail Road. Both Prokhorov and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took the subway to the arena.
Bloomberg trumpeted the jobs and affordable housing created by the Atlantic Yards project, which includes the arena and 16 towers. The project's opponents contend Ratner failed to deliver on those promises, a point that was raised repeatedly by about 40 protesters in a rally before the ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Ratner announced a Dec. 18 groundbreaking for the project's first residential tower, which is to contain 350 units, half of them classified as middle-income or affordable.
Prokhorov compared the rise of Barclays Center to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge -- ''a symbol being born'' and ''a project that changes the face and the destiny of this city.''
''If you are from Brooklyn or Manhattan, Miami or Moscow, Barclays Center will be the heart of the Brooklyn borough,'' he said.
It may take some time for the Nets to match the hype surrounding their new home. They have nine new players and their three stars -- Williams, Johnson and Lopez -- have not played together. On the plus side, 13 Nets have been working out and scrimmaging.
Prokhorov declined to discuss a possible extension for Coach Avery Johnson, who is entering the final year of his contract, but he said, ''I think we'll be together'' for a couple years. He predicted an executive of the year award for Billy King, the general manager, who presided over the roster overhaul.
''I think for the first time in my years with the Nets, every night going in, I know we can compete with the opponent,'' King said.

HEADLINE: Russia Moves to Redefine Treason

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's lower house of Parliament on Friday unanimously approved amendments substantially broadening the legal definition of high treason, so it applies not only to acts that jeopardize state security but also to those that undermine ''constitutional order, sovereignty, and territorial and state integrity.'' 
Another proposed change would allow the charge to be applied to Russian citizens providing assistance to foreign states or international organizations. Addressing lawmakers, the deputy director of the Federal Security Service said the step was necessary because foreign intelligence services ''actively use'' such organizations ''as a cover and they conduct independent intelligence activities.'' To become law, the bill must pass two additional readings and be signed by President Vladimir V. Putin.
Rights activists immediately condemned the initiative. Russian leaders ''have now chosen an ideological course -- you can even call it a national idea -- to search for external and internal enemies,'' Lev A. Ponomarev, a veteran activist, said in an interview with Dozhd TV. Lyudmila M. Alekseyeva, a human rights advocate, told the news service Interfax that she had ''a feeling that they are again pulling down the Iron Curtain.''
Earlier this week, the United States Agency for International Development announced that it would end its 20-year-old program in Russia at the Kremlin's request. On Friday, the Moscow office of Radio Liberty, which is financed by the American government, announced that it was ending medium-wave broadcasts because of a tough new media law that prohibits such broadcasting when more than 48 percent of an outlet's founders are foreigners. The station will continue its broadcasts online.
A law passed this summer will require nonprofit organizations that receive foreign financing to identify themselves as ''foreign agents,'' a term that evokes cold-war espionage in Russia.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hoopla in the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn

 BODY:
With an official ribbon-cutting on Friday, Brooklyn celebrated the opening of a lavish sports and entertainment center featuring the Brooklyn Nets (formerly of New Jersey). This is generally good news for the borough and the city. It elevates what had been an underdeveloped area into a vibrant hub for basketball fans, shoppers and followers of such superstars as Jay-Z, who owns a club in the complex. For an older generation, the arrival of a major-league sports team may help fill the emptiness left by the departure of the Dodgers for Los Angeles in 1957. 
Amid all the razzle-dazzle, however, it is worth reminding residents as well as the Barclays Center developer of promises made nine years ago. Forest City Ratner Companies, which is building the $4.9 billion project, originally sold the city on the arena plan because it would provide at least 2,250 affordable apartments, 8 acres of open space in the 22-acre project and 10,000 jobs.
Company officials said this week that they would, at some point, make good on those promises. The recession and numerous lawsuits from opponents have slowed down their progress, according to MaryAnne Gilmartin, an executive vice president of the company.
On Friday, Bruce Ratner, chairman of the development company, announced that he would break ground on the first of 14 residential buildings in December. The first building is supposed to offer 181 units of affordable rental apartments, which leaves more than 2,000 affordable units to be finished by 2031.
In some ways, it feels as though the developers got their dessert first -- the splendid arena that will draw crowds and superstars starting on Friday night. Now for the meat and potatoes.

HEADLINE: Doing the Right Thing, Whatever That Is

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
I RECENTLY found myself in a position where I had some moral qualms about a writing assignment. No, it wasn't for this publication, and no, I wasn't being asked to make up quotes or leave out pertinent facts. But I was being asked to phrase things in a way I didn't feel totally comfortable with.
I spoke to the editor without much luck. I debated what to do. Should I withdraw the article, though it would cause considerable problems to the editor at this late date? Should I ask for my byline to be removed?
In the end, I decided to let the story run. But I vowed I would never write for the publication again. 
The incident made me reflect on how things can seem so black and white when you're outside a situation, and yet so difficult when you're entangled in it. How do we find a framework for addressing ethical issues in our everyday lives?
First, it's important to know what ethics are not, said Judy Nadler, a senior fellow in government ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.
''They're not, 'Well everyone else is doing it, so it must be O.K.,' '' she said. The Web site for her center lays out other things ethics are not: they aren't the same as feelings, because many people feel good even though they are doing something wrong. And often our feelings will tell us it's uncomfortable to do the right thing if it is hard.
They're not just following the law. Laws can become ethically corrupt, and there are things strictly allowed by law that we would consider unethical, like some of the activity on Wall Street that led to the financial crisis, Ms. Nadler said. ''I always say the law is the floor, not the ceiling.''
So how do we determine if we're acting ethically?
''If, at the end of the day, can you say, 'I got all the facts, not just the ones I agreed with'?'' Ms. Nadler said. ''Can you say you looked at all the options, not just the convenient ones? If I did all those things and answered them honestly, then I can say I did my very best.''
Most of us know the situation where we're asked by a boss to do something that makes us uneasy. And these situations can rankle us for years.
My father still remembers an incident back in 1979 when he worked, as he did for most of his professional life, as a science writer and communications director at the University of California, Los Angeles.
A small research nuclear reactor on the campus became the focus of a group of student protesters, whom my father said he ''instinctively sympathized with.'' And he had some social connection with the parents of the leader of the group.
''On the other hand,'' he said, ''there were the professors and administration with whom I worked day by day and whom I generally respected, who assured me that the reactor was completely safe, had passed all inspections and was needed to train a generation of future nuclear engineers -- then thought to be the world's solution to the energy problem.''
My father, who didn't have the technical background to know what was right, wrote the news release quoting a nuclear engineering professor stating that the reactor was safe.
He loved his job, was putting two children through college and had one in high school. Yet the episode still bothers him years later, and in retrospect, put in the same position today, he said he might have at least discussed his reservations with his boss and perhaps asked if someone else could be assigned to deal with the media on this issue.
My father's instinct -- that he should have talked about his ethical qualms -- is a good one, said Susan Dwyer, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Maryland.
''I think people have a great deal of difficulty being honest and straightforward,'' Professor Dwyer said. ''I'm an Australian and I find Americans are really coy about saying, 'This is an uncomfortable situation and I don't want to do it.' '' That's true in personal and well as professional relationships, she said.
You also have to be aware that if you work in a place where the culture implicitly or explicitly encourages unethical behavior, you're going to face the same quandary over and over, said Thomas White, professor of business ethics at Loyola Marymount University.
''You have to ask yourself, even if I get through this situation, is it going to come up again? If the message is, 'Make those numbers no matter what,' if you find yourself in a moral dilemma, you want to be ruthlessly realistic with yourself and start developing an exit strategy,'' Professor White said. ''You're just kidding yourself if you think it won't happen again.''
But Professor White also acknowledged a hard truth: It's easier to have higher ethical standards in good economic times than bad.
His department's Web site offered helpful ways to think through an ethical problem. Analyze the consequences: Who will be helped by what you do? Who will be hurt? What kind of benefits and harms are we talking about, and how does this look over the long run as well as the short term?
But don't make the mistake of assuming that people who have strong principles and never compromise are necessarily ''better.''
''We often admire this kind of backbone and we are apt to attribute courage to those who run considerable risks in sticking to their guns,'' said Professor Dwyer, who teaches moral philosophy focusing on issues like abortion, pornography and assisted suicide. ''But some people might stick to their guns -- act on their principles, come what may -- because they are cowardly. They simply don't want to think through the complications of particular cases and reach for a rule or principle. This represents a refusal to honestly engage with the messiness of human life, while at the same time allowing the person to bask in self-righteousness.''
And of course, ethics change. Randy Cohen, who wrote The Ethicist column for The New York Times from 1999 to 2011, said that when he first started, he was asked by a woman going out on a blind date whether it was ethical to Google her date.
''How the world has changed,'' he said. ''Now, no one wouldn't think of not Googling a blind date.''
The most common ethical question he was asked about over the years concerned a ''duty to report.'' That is, you find out a friend's spouse is having an extramarital affair. A college roommate is cheating by downloading papers from the Internet.
Do you tell?
In terms of the friend, he said, it depends on whether you're getting a strong message that the friend wants to know. If not, be silent, he said.
With the roommate question, Mr. Cohen, the author of ''Be Good: How to Navigate the Ethics of Everything'' (Chronicle Books, 2012), said he liked the rule some universities had come up with: You have a duty to act.
''You can talk to your roommate. You can go a professor or department chair and say there's cheating going on without naming names. But you can't do nothing,'' he said.
So how do I feel now about my ethical quandary? The best I can do, I believe, is use what I've learned as a guideline for how I will address the next moral issue I will inevitably face.
As Mr. Cohen said: ''We can't ask people to be perfect. But we can ask them to strive to be good.''

HEADLINE: At Racetrack, Economic Pressures Overpower Veterinarians' Oath

 BODY:
Only after Bourbon Bandit broke a leg racing last November did his owner, Susan Kayne, learn the full extent of prescription drugs that veterinarians had given him at Belmont Park on Long Island.
Until then, Ms. Kayne had believed that Bourbon Bandit was ''sound and healthy,'' because that is what her trainer told her, she said. But new veterinary bills arrived, showing that the horse had been treated regularly with clenbuterol, a widely abused medication for breathing problems that can build muscle by mimicking anabolic steroids.
''If a horse is sound, why does it need all these drugs?'' she asked. ''I never gave consent.''
Gene and Eileen Hartis said they, too, were shocked by their bill, from a California veterinarian, showing that in just over three months in 2010, their graded stakes winner, Princess Haya, had been given drugs for pain, soreness and swelling 34 times, as well as seven doses of clenbuterol. 
''It's so contrary to our philosophy that we explained in length to our vet and trainer,'' Mr. Hartis said.
More than anyone in the sport, racetrack veterinarians are supposed to put the horse first, having taken an oath to protect ''animal health and welfare.''Yet in the shed rows of America's racetracks and at private training centers, racehorse veterinarians often live by a different code -- unique in the veterinary community -- one that emphasizes drugs to keep horses racing and winning rather than treating soreness or injury through rest or other less aggressive means, according to dozens of interviews and a review of medical and regulatory records.
Only veterinarians can legally prescribe medicine, yet they often let trainers, who are paid to win races, make medical decisions, including which drugs to use. These veterinarians also have a powerful financial incentive to prescribe drugs: they are both doctor and drugstore, and so the more drugs they prescribe, the more money they make. Selling and administering drugs, in fact, accounts for most of their income.
In contrast, veterinarians who treat small animals or pets earn most of their money from examinations and other professional services.
''Is it any wonder that our industry is being criticized for being overmedicated?'' said Stuart S. Janney III, chairman of the Thoroughbred Safety Committee of the Jockey Club, an influential industry group.
Still, despite the concern that a drug culture pervades America's racetracks -- especially with the arrival of casinos offering fattened purses -- little attention has been paid to the veterinarians who prescribe these medications.
The American Association of Equine Practitioners, the industry's most influential veterinary group, acknowledges that ''to a very large extent'' medical treatments are geared toward when a horse is racing, rather than toward what might be in the horse's best interest. And while the group has worked hard to make racing safer, it has made scant progress in changing how racehorse veterinarians earn their money.
''That's a tough nut to crack,'' said Dr. Jeff Blea, the association's vice president. ''You are talking about decades and generations of the way things are done.''One of New York State's most prominent racetrack veterinarians, Dr. James C. Hunt Jr., made his loyalties clear in a letter to regulators, arguing that trainers should not regularly have to reveal medication regimens.
''The veterinarians will honor this because the trainers are their real clients, not the owners,'' wrote Dr. Hunt, who treated I'll Have Another when the horse was training for the Belmont Stakes after winning this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. (He was scratched on the eve of the race.)
Dr. Hunt added, ''The board must also understand that trainers make nearly 100 percent of all veterinarian decisions regarding the medication of their horses.''
Dr. Blea strongly disagrees with this approach. ''You've got to remember, you are the vet,'' he said.
While doping racehorses with banned chemicals -- for example, the potent secretion of a type of South American frog -- is almost universally condemned, debate continues over the safety of using legal drugs that keep horses competing by reducing pain and inflammation, as well as therapeutic drugs like clenbuterol that can make horses run faster.
Racing regulators say overmedicating injured horses can contribute to fatal breakdowns. On average, 24 horses die each week at the nation's state-regulated racetracks, according to a New York Times analysis of racing records, reported in March.
Even so, the belief that prescription drugs are good for horses and for business is reflected in the ubiquity of veterinarians at the racetrack.
In the 1970s, only seven or eight veterinarians used to cover two Southern California racetracks. Today, California officials say veterinarians' vehicles are so numerous on the backside that trainers complain they have trouble getting their horses onto the track.
Few would dispute that the great majority of veterinarians and trainers care deeply about their horses and are emotionally devastated when they break down and are euthanized. But the pressure to perform -- and win -- is intense. ''I've had owners send their horses to people they know are not playing by the rules,'' said Eric Reed, a Kentucky-based trainer with more than $13 million in career earnings. ''If you can't beat them, join them.''
The Times reported that since 2009, 3,800 horses had tested positive for drugs, the vast majority for illegal levels of prescription drugs. (State rules specify allowable drug levels or how close to race time a drug can be administered.) Many veterinarians and trainers say these test results are mistakes, not attempts to cheat. Yet veterinarians who may have played a role, inadvertent or not, in the positive tests usually escape serious scrutiny because of the trainer responsibility rule, where trainers are automatically held responsible, regardless of circumstance.
In the rare instances that veterinarians are banned from racetracks for breaking the rules, they can continue practicing at private, unregulated training centers if state veterinary boards do not suspend their licenses.
This regulatory gap has allowed one New York veterinarian to treat horses at private centers despite a felony conviction for selling anabolic steroids to weight-lifters and a history of violating state rules on drugs in racing.
While veterinarians provide invaluable services, ''They push the envelope to the limit,'' Mr. Reed says, adding, ''If you got a good vet with ethics, you are not going to do very well.''A Drug Takes Hold
Long after every other major sport had banned anabolic steroids for their muscle-building effect, racetrack veterinarians continued to prescribe the drugs, saying they would speed a horse's recovery from racing, stoke its appetite and get it back into competition.
Not everyone bought that explanation.
''When you look at the pattern of behavior and the quantities that they were using, it's hard to argue that the steroids were for recovery,'' said Matt F. Iuliano, executive director of the Jockey Club. ''They were trying to do a whole lot more than keep horses' noses in the feed bucket.''
Racing banned steroids in 2010, but another prescription drug -- clenbuterol, brand name ventipulmin -- could also build muscle and act as a stimulant. Darrell Haire, a regional manager for the Jockeys' Guild, told California racing officials that in morning workouts, clenbuterol ''moves a horse up at least a second.''
Clenbuterol is approved only to treat respiratory disease, often caused by poor air quality in barns, and many veterinarians and trainers consider it highly effective. But evidence of its widespread abuse surfaced last year when California authorities reported finding the drug in all 72 quarter horses they tested and in 54 percent of thoroughbreds. Even yearlings were getting the drug to improve appearance and increase sale price.
Clenbuterol became so popular that in California sales totaled at least $7 million annually. Illegal supplies of super-potent clenbuterol, some smuggled in from Mexico, began showing up at racetracks, according to California regulators.
Jack Van Berg, a Hall of Fame trainer, said young horses ''are all torn up'' when fed muscle-building drugs. ''Clenbuterol is one of the worst things that happened to racing,'' he told a forum on drug use this year.
When not used as directed -- in high doses or from an illegal supplier -- clenbuterol has killed horses and caused a host of health problems.
The drug's manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim, says clenbuterol ''should be withdrawn'' after 30 days. ''Long term, you start pushing a horse into the beginning stages of heart failure,'' explained Kenneth H. McKeever, associate director of research at the Rutgers Equine Science Center. But many veterinarians do not follow this guideline, treatment records show.
Scott Lake, a trainer who for many years led the nation in wins, is an unabashed fan of clenbuterol. ''I use a lot of clenbuterol in horses,'' he said in a televised interview early this year, calling it a good bronchodilator. He also criticized regulators for giving trainers ''a black eye'' for positive tests on clenbuterol, since it is not an ''exotic'' drug. Mr. Lake has been cited seven times in four states for illegal levels of clenbuterol.
Because of clenbuterol abuse, several states, including California, have restricted its use.
That will not stop horses from being trained on it, and possibly benefiting from it when racing. Dr. McKeever said that while he has not seen any studies showing how long the drug's steroidal effects last, anecdotally he believes horses stay ''muscled up for weeks afterward.''The Treatment
Clenbuterol was one of the drugs that concerned Ms. Kayne when it showed up in $3,200 of veterinary bills that arrived unexpectedly after her horse Bourbon Bandit broke down and was retired from racing.
''I have spent literally every day of my life in the company of thoroughbreds,'' Ms. Kayne said in an interview. ''I have no problem with racing big, sound, healthy horses. I spent a lot of time in Europe at racetracks and saw the fruits of drug-free racing.''
The bills, she said, showed that a veterinarian whom she had never met had purchased clenbuterol without her approval. Wanting to know why, Ms. Kayne wrote to the veterinarian. He turned out to be Dr. Hunt, who has one of New York's biggest racetrack practices.
Dr. Hunt responded that all veterinary procedures ''were done so under the instructions of your authorized agent and trainer.''
Ms. Kayne said she had never given her trainer, Bruce Levine, permission to use clenbuterol.
So she contacted Dr. Hunt again, asking how the ailment had been diagnosed. He said another veterinarian, Dr. Gregory J. Bennett, had performed an endoscopic exam that found mild throat inflammation and ''mucous in the trachea, signs consistent with inflammatory airway disease.''
Dr. Bennett, however, said his exams were normal, according to a letter he sent to Ms. Kayne.
The association of equine veterinarians says treatments ''should be based upon a specific diagnosis and administered in the context of a valid and transparent owner-trainer-veterinarian relationship.''
Dr. Bennett, who prescribed the pain and anti-inflammatory drugs, said he administers treatments generally at the trainer's request. ''You may wish to consult Bruce Levine about the injections as these are part of his racing program and are routinely done with all of his horses,'' he said.
Drs. Hunt and Bennett declined to be interviewed, as did Mr. Levine. Dr. Hunt is seeking payment of his bills through arbitration, while Ms. Kayne has asked the state's racing commission and veterinary board to investigate Bourbon Bandit's treatment.
Gene and Eileen Hartis, horse owners in Texas, also describe themselves as ''minimalist when it comes to medication.'' ''We were opposed to anything that would mask an injury just so a horse would run,'' Mr. Hartis said.
Their first bill from a California veterinarian was for $8,500 for just over three months. Every horse they had sent to their trainer was healthy, Mr. Hartis said. Even so, the horses began receiving drugs without the owners' permission ''from the minute they got off the trailer,'' he said. Two horses received clenbuterol on the same seven days, invoices show.
The veterinarian, Dr. Keith Latson, declined to comment.Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board, said veterinarians often find themselves in an untenable position: ''The vet's fiduciary responsibility is to the owners, but it's the trainers that hire and fire them. Who are you going to be beholden to?'' What's more, trainers often know their horses better than veterinarians do, because they spend more time with them.
Hong Kong, widely regarded as the world's safest, most tightly regulated horse racing venue, operates differently. Veterinarians are employed directly by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which oversees racing and holds disciplinary power.
Under this system, clenbuterol may not be given unless a horse has been endoscopically examined within two days of the prescription, according to the club's executive director, William A. Nader. ''Clinicians must report all findings of clinical relevance in detail -- accurately and promptly,'' he added.
A 'Blind Spot'
It did not take long for word to circulate that a cheap, easily obtainable drug might make horses run faster if administered close to race time. Better yet, regulators might not suspect it.
So on April Fools' Day in 2011, trainers at harness tracks tried it on nine racehorses. All finished in the money -- eight in first place, one in second.
Over 12 days, with nearly $600,000 at stake at harness tracks in New York and Pennsylvania, 36 of 38 horses using the drug finished first or second, with 31 winning their races.
Another surprise was the drug itself, oxymetazoline, an ingredient in Afrin, an over-the counter cold medicine. Oxymetazoline, which is not approved for racing, stimulates a horse's cardiovascular system when administered in large doses through an inhalation mask.
Some of the doped horses shared more than prize money. They also shared certain veterinarians, including Dr. Louis A. Grasso, according to New York racing commission records.
In addition to his felony conviction for selling steroids to weight-lifters, Dr. Grasso lost his New York State racing license for giving drugs too close to race time and signing blank scratch forms.
In 2000, Delaware authorities suspected him of treating horses without a license in the state, but when they tried to arrest him, Dr. Grasso led the police on a chase through the back roads of New Castle County. When they finally caught him, officers found needles, syringes and two banned drugs in his vehicle. He eventually pleaded guilty to resisting arrest.
Though New York's Racing and Wagering Board has stripped Dr. Grasso of his license to practice at racetracks, it has no authority over his activities elsewhere.
The racing board also referred his conduct to the state's veterinary board, which could bar him from practicing anywhere in the state. But it has not done so, leaving Dr. Grasso free to work at off-site training centers.
What's more, New York is not among the few states that let regulators test for illegal drugs at private training centers. When the racing board tried to put in place out-of-competition testing, a horsemen's group went to court in 2011 and stopped it.
As a result, said Dr. George A. Maylin, who directs the state's testing program, there is no effective way to detect certain performance-enhancing drugs. Horses can be doped at the training centers, then shipped to racetracks. ''The drugs are used days to weeks in advance, and positives will only be from mistakes and dummies,'' Dr. Maylin said.
Indiana, which has one of the most comprehensive out-of-competition programs, discovered last year that four racehorses had been illegally given zilpaterol, a bulking supplement for cattle. Joe Gorajec, executive director of the Indiana Horse Racing Commission, said the racing industry's failure to push harder for out-of-competition testing had created a major ''blind spot.''
Joseph S. Anderson, a trainer who had five horses test positive for oxymetazoline last year after the state began testing for it after races, kept his horses at one of the off-site training centers where Dr. Grasso works, north of New York City. Mr. Anderson told investigators that he bought his nebulizer mix from his two veterinarians, one of them Dr. Grasso, records show. The nebulizer regimen ''is a fairly regular one at the barn,'' Mr. Anderson said.
The trainer was suspended and fined. Dr. Grasso remained beyond the regulators' reach.
Dr. Grasso, in an interview, accused regulators of having a vendetta against him and his family. ''Anything that goes wrong with harness racing they point to me,'' he said. Afrin, he said, had long been used for therapy in harness and thoroughbred horses and had never before resulted in positive tests.
While acknowledging past mistakes, Dr. Grasso said he treats horses well. ''Veterinarians out in the field are out there to help horses, not hurt them,'' he said. ''We are probably the only ones who have the horses' well-being in mind.''
After repeated questions from The Times about its handling of Dr. Grasso's case, the state Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline, which oversees the Veterinary Board, issued a statement that said, in part, ''We have recently taken affirmative steps to have the Racing and Wagering Board share data following their review of racetrack veterinary medicine practices.''
State veterinary boards rarely discipline veterinarians who run afoul of racing rules. In New York, only 2 of the board's 125 disciplinary actions over the last 10 years involved racehorse veterinarians, a review by The Times found.
''Losing a racing license is not a big enough deterrent,'' said Edward J. Martin, president of the Association of Racing Commissioners International, a trade group. ''We believe losing a veterinarian's license is. This is a hole in the regulatory scheme and needs to be plugged.''
In Kentucky, Dr. Rodney J. Stewart's racing license was suspended in 2007 after he brought cobra venom, a banned nerve-deadening agent, onto the grounds of the Keeneland racetrack. Dr. Stewart has retained his veterinary license.
In 2010, Dr. Phillip R. Kapraun kept his Illinois veterinary license after he, too, was fined for possessing snake venom at Balmoral Park south of Chicago.
In an interview, Dr. Kapraun said he had administered 20,000 doses of the substance to horses over the years and continued to do so at off-track facilities, arguing that it heals tendon injuries quickly and safely. He acknowledged that a horse might benefit more from months away from competing. ''The economics of horse racing does not allow for that. Horse racing is on the decline. If a horse needed a year to heal up, they would go to the killers up in Canada or Mexico,'' he said, referring to slaughterhouse.
Veterinary boards may be reluctant to punish, said Dr. Larry R. Bramlage, a prominent equine surgeon. ''The state regulatory board,'' he said, ''consists of mostly inactive elements of the profession, and they don't like to sit over one of their own.''
And even if boards are inclined to discipline wayward practitioners, they may not be informed of violations. Veterinarians have raised objections to having state boards review racetrack practices, saying that their peers should be able to review racetrack practices first.A Change of Heart
Twenty years ago, a prosperous California veterinarian, Dr. Gregory L. Ferraro, surprised his colleagues when he publicly condemned a prescription drug culture that he had helped create.
Six years later, he left a racetrack practice with more than $2 million in annual billings -- mostly for drugs and other treatments.
''The last five years of my practice I let two young associates take over that aspect of my practice and I only wanted to see the lame and the sick,'' Dr. Ferraro said. ''I couldn't stand it anymore.''
Dr. Ferraro, who now directs the equine health program at the University of California, Davis, remembers being the first veterinarian at his track to use a fiber-optic endoscope, a flexible tube that could peek into a horse's respiratory tract and easily spot small amounts of blood. He conducted a study to see how often endoscopes found blood. And while the numbers were not large, he said, a drug, furosemide, appeared to help.
Most regulators say furosemide, a diuretic sold under the trade name Salix, enhances performance by flushing 20 to 30 pounds of water out of a horse. Now, virtually all horses in the United States, whether they need it or not, get a needle filled with furosemide plunged into their neck several hours before racing.
Dr. Ferraro found himself in the vanguard of veterinarians advocating for the wide use of furosemide and other new therapeutic drugs, like phenylbutazone, or ''bute'' used for inflammation and pain. These drugs, he believed, could make racing safer, more humane.
But over time, he said, he came to realize that veterinarians were using drugs simply to keep horses racing, not to treat their underlying conditions.
''There comes a time in every horse's career that you've got to stand up and say, 'That's enough. We are endangering this horse,' '' Dr. Ferraro said. ''There are not a lot of veterinarians willing to do that.''
Racing authorities in Europe and Hong Kong will not allow horses to compete with any prescription drugs in their bodies. In the United States, a large group of veterinarians, trainers and owners disagree strongly with that stance. Furosemide has proved itself safe, they say, and not using it might endanger a horse's health.
In July, Kent H. Stirling, chairman of the medication committee of the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, told a Congressional panel that horses in training benefit from therapeutic medicine much as people use aspirin to ''ease sore muscles.''
''We're not like Europe, where horses spend half the year in the pasture eating grass,'' Mr. Stirling said in an interview in March. ''The owners want a return on the investment and the trainer needs to keep the horse as fit as he can.'' Mr. Stirling said that if a horse has a nagging injury, it is ''not fair to the horse'' if the trainer does not treat it.
Dr. Mary Scollay, chief veterinarian for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, said bute and banamine, another anti-inflammatory, are not the same as aspirin and other over-the-counter pain medicines.
''These are drugs that you need to have a prescription for and are more powerful and given in larger doses than what's sold over the counter,'' Dr. Scollay said.
Tracy Farmer, a longtime breeder and owner who is also vice chairman of the Kentucky's racing commission, said the liberal use of prescription drugs has harmed racing. ''Look no further than the number of contenders in this year's Kentucky Derby now sidelined by injury or already retired to stud,'' Mr. Farmer said.
This happens almost every year, he added. ''By the time the Breeders' Cup rolls around, most Triple Crown stars are out of action, depriving the sport of heroes like Seabiscuit and John Henry.''
Dr. Ferraro says he and other veterinarians share the blame for turning racehorses into commodities.
''We took a beautiful, noble thing and screwed it up,'' he said. ''Horses are too good to put a price tag on. Some things ought to be sacred.''

Clenbuterol is approved only to treat respiratory disease, often caused by poor air quality in barns, and many veterinarians and trainers consider it highly effective. But evidence of its widespread abuse surfaced last year when California authorities reported finding the drug in all 72 quarter horses they tested and in 54 percent of thoroughbreds. Even yearlings were getting the drug to improve appearance and increase sale price.
Clenbuterol became so popular that in California sales totaled at least $7 million annually. Illegal supplies of super-potent clenbuterol, some smuggled in from Mexico, began showing up at racetracks, according to California regulators.
Jack Van Berg, a Hall of Fame trainer, said young horses ''are all torn up'' when fed muscle-building drugs. ''Clenbuterol is one of the worst things that happened to racing,'' he told a forum on drug use this year.
When not used as directed -- in high doses or from an illegal supplier -- clenbuterol has killed horses and caused a host of health problems.
The drug's manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim, says clenbuterol ''should be withdrawn'' after 30 days. ''Long term, you start pushing a horse into the beginning stages of heart failure,'' explained Kenneth H. McKeever, associate director of research at the Rutgers Equine Science Center. But many veterinarians do not follow this guideline, treatment records show.
Scott Lake, a trainer who for many years led the nation in wins, is an unabashed fan of clenbuterol. ''I use a lot of clenbuterol in horses,'' he said in a televised interview early this year, calling it a good bronchodilator. He also criticized regulators for giving trainers ''a black eye'' for positive tests on clenbuterol, since it is not an ''exotic'' drug. Mr. Lake has been cited seven times in four states for illegal levels of clenbuterol.
Because of clenbuterol abuse, several states, including California, have restricted its use.
That will not stop horses from being trained on it, and possibly benefiting from it when racing. Dr. McKeever said that while he has not seen any studies showing how long the drug's steroidal effects last, anecdotally he believes horses stay ''muscled up for weeks afterward.''The Treatment
Clenbuterol was one of the drugs that concerned Ms. Kayne when it showed up in $3,200 of veterinary bills that arrived unexpectedly after her horse Bourbon Bandit broke down and was retired from racing.
''I have spent literally every day of my life in the company of thoroughbreds,'' Ms. Kayne said in an interview. ''I have no problem with racing big, sound, healthy horses. I spent a lot of time in Europe at racetracks and saw the fruits of drug-free racing.''
The bills, she said, showed that a veterinarian whom she had never met had purchased clenbuterol without her approval. Wanting to know why, Ms. Kayne wrote to the veterinarian. He turned out to be Dr. Hunt, who has one of New York's biggest racetrack practices.
Dr. Hunt responded that all veterinary procedures ''were done so under the instructions of your authorized agent and trainer.''
Ms. Kayne said she had never given her trainer, Bruce Levine, permission to use clenbuterol.
So she contacted Dr. Hunt again, asking how the ailment had been diagnosed. He said another veterinarian, Dr. Gregory J. Bennett, had performed an endoscopic exam that found mild throat inflammation and ''mucous in the trachea, signs consistent with inflammatory airway disease.''
Dr. Bennett, however, said his exams were normal, according to a letter he sent to Ms. Kayne.
The association of equine veterinarians says treatments ''should be based upon a specific diagnosis and administered in the context of a valid and transparent owner-trainer-veterinarian relationship.''
Dr. Bennett, who prescribed the pain and anti-inflammatory drugs, said he administers treatments generally at the trainer's request. ''You may wish to consult Bruce Levine about the injections as these are part of his racing program and are routinely done with all of his horses,'' he said.
Drs. Hunt and Bennett declined to be interviewed, as did Mr. Levine. Dr. Hunt is seeking payment of his bills through arbitration, while Ms. Kayne has asked the state's racing commission and veterinary board to investigate Bourbon Bandit's treatment.
Gene and Eileen Hartis, horse owners in Texas, also describe themselves as ''minimalist when it comes to medication.'' ''We were opposed to anything that would mask an injury just so a horse would run,'' Mr. Hartis said.
Their first bill from a California veterinarian was for $8,500 for just over three months. Every horse they had sent to their trainer was healthy, Mr. Hartis said. Even so, the horses began receiving drugs without the owners' permission ''from the minute they got off the trailer,'' he said. Two horses received clenbuterol on the same seven days, invoices show.
The veterinarian, Dr. Keith Latson, declined to comment.Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board, said veterinarians often find themselves in an untenable position: ''The vet's fiduciary responsibility is to the owners, but it's the trainers that hire and fire them. Who are you going to be beholden to?'' What's more, trainers often know their horses better than veterinarians do, because they spend more time with them.
Hong Kong, widely regarded as the world's safest, most tightly regulated horse racing venue, operates differently. Veterinarians are employed directly by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which oversees racing and holds disciplinary power.
Under this system, clenbuterol may not be given unless a horse has been endoscopically examined within two days of the prescription, according to the club's executive director, William A. Nader. ''Clinicians must report all findings of clinical relevance in detail -- accurately and promptly,'' he added.
A 'Blind Spot'
It did not take long for word to circulate that a cheap, easily obtainable drug might make horses run faster if administered close to race time. Better yet, regulators might not suspect it.
So on April Fools' Day in 2011, trainers at harness tracks tried it on nine racehorses. All finished in the money -- eight in first place, one in second.
Over 12 days, with nearly $600,000 at stake at harness tracks in New York and Pennsylvania, 36 of 38 horses using the drug finished first or second, with 31 winning their races.
Another surprise was the drug itself, oxymetazoline, an ingredient in Afrin, an over-the counter cold medicine. Oxymetazoline, which is not approved for racing, stimulates a horse's cardiovascular system when administered in large doses through an inhalation mask.
Some of the doped horses shared more than prize money. They also shared certain veterinarians, including Dr. Louis A. Grasso, according to New York racing commission records.
In addition to his felony conviction for selling steroids to weight-lifters, Dr. Grasso lost his New York State racing license for giving drugs too close to race time and signing blank scratch forms.
In 2000, Delaware authorities suspected him of treating horses without a license in the state, but when they tried to arrest him, Dr. Grasso led the police on a chase through the back roads of New Castle County. When they finally caught him, officers found needles, syringes and two banned drugs in his vehicle. He eventually pleaded guilty to resisting arrest.
Though New York's Racing and Wagering Board has stripped Dr. Grasso of his license to practice at racetracks, it has no authority over his activities elsewhere.
The racing board also referred his conduct to the state's veterinary board, which could bar him from practicing anywhere in the state. But it has not done so, leaving Dr. Grasso free to work at off-site training centers.
What's more, New York is not among the few states that let regulators test for illegal drugs at private training centers. When the racing board tried to put in place out-of-competition testing, a horsemen's group went to court in 2011 and stopped it.
As a result, said Dr. George A. Maylin, who directs the state's testing program, there is no effective way to detect certain performance-enhancing drugs. Horses can be doped at the training centers, then shipped to racetracks. ''The drugs are used days to weeks in advance, and positives will only be from mistakes and dummies,'' Dr. Maylin said.
Indiana, which has one of the most comprehensive out-of-competition programs, discovered last year that four racehorses had been illegally given zilpaterol, a bulking supplement for cattle. Joe Gorajec, executive director of the Indiana Horse Racing Commission, said the racing industry's failure to push harder for out-of-competition testing had created a major ''blind spot.''
Joseph S. Anderson, a trainer who had five horses test positive for oxymetazoline last year after the state began testing for it after races, kept his horses at one of the off-site training centers where Dr. Grasso works, north of New York City. Mr. Anderson told investigators that he bought his nebulizer mix from his two veterinarians, one of them Dr. Grasso, records show. The nebulizer regimen ''is a fairly regular one at the barn,'' Mr. Anderson said.
The trainer was suspended and fined. Dr. Grasso remained beyond the regulators' reach.
Dr. Grasso, in an interview, accused regulators of having a vendetta against him and his family. ''Anything that goes wrong with harness racing they point to me,'' he said. Afrin, he said, had long been used for therapy in harness and thoroughbred horses and had never before resulted in positive tests.
While acknowledging past mistakes, Dr. Grasso said he treats horses well. ''Veterinarians out in the field are out there to help horses, not hurt them,'' he said. ''We are probably the only ones who have the horses' well-being in mind.''
After repeated questions from The Times about its handling of Dr. Grasso's case, the state Education Department's Office of Professional Discipline, which oversees the Veterinary Board, issued a statement that said, in part, ''We have recently taken affirmative steps to have the Racing and Wagering Board share data following their review of racetrack veterinary medicine practices.''
State veterinary boards rarely discipline veterinarians who run afoul of racing rules. In New York, only 2 of the board's 125 disciplinary actions over the last 10 years involved racehorse veterinarians, a review by The Times found.
''Losing a racing license is not a big enough deterrent,'' said Edward J. Martin, president of the Association of Racing Commissioners International, a trade group. ''We believe losing a veterinarian's license is. This is a hole in the regulatory scheme and needs to be plugged.''
In Kentucky, Dr. Rodney J. Stewart's racing license was suspended in 2007 after he brought cobra venom, a banned nerve-deadening agent, onto the grounds of the Keeneland racetrack. Dr. Stewart has retained his veterinary license.
In 2010, Dr. Phillip R. Kapraun kept his Illinois veterinary license after he, too, was fined for possessing snake venom at Balmoral Park south of Chicago.
In an interview, Dr. Kapraun said he had administered 20,000 doses of the substance to horses over the years and continued to do so at off-track facilities, arguing that it heals tendon injuries quickly and safely. He acknowledged that a horse might benefit more from months away from competing. ''The economics of horse racing does not allow for that. Horse racing is on the decline. If a horse needed a year to heal up, they would go to the killers up in Canada or Mexico,'' he said, referring to slaughterhouse.
Veterinary boards may be reluctant to punish, said Dr. Larry R. Bramlage, a prominent equine surgeon. ''The state regulatory board,'' he said, ''consists of mostly inactive elements of the profession, and they don't like to sit over one of their own.''
And even if boards are inclined to discipline wayward practitioners, they may not be informed of violations. Veterinarians have raised objections to having state boards review racetrack practices, saying that their peers should be able to review racetrack practices first.A Change of Heart
Twenty years ago, a prosperous California veterinarian, Dr. Gregory L. Ferraro, surprised his colleagues when he publicly condemned a prescription drug culture that he had helped create.
Six years later, he left a racetrack practice with more than $2 million in annual billings -- mostly for drugs and other treatments.
''The last five years of my practice I let two young associates take over that aspect of my practice and I only wanted to see the lame and the sick,'' Dr. Ferraro said. ''I couldn't stand it anymore.''
Dr. Ferraro, who now directs the equine health program at the University of California, Davis, remembers being the first veterinarian at his track to use a fiber-optic endoscope, a flexible tube that could peek into a horse's respiratory tract and easily spot small amounts of blood. He conducted a study to see how often endoscopes found blood. And while the numbers were not large, he said, a drug, furosemide, appeared to help.
Most regulators say furosemide, a diuretic sold under the trade name Salix, enhances performance by flushing 20 to 30 pounds of water out of a horse. Now, virtually all horses in the United States, whether they need it or not, get a needle filled with furosemide plunged into their neck several hours before racing.
Dr. Ferraro found himself in the vanguard of veterinarians advocating for the wide use of furosemide and other new therapeutic drugs, like phenylbutazone, or ''bute'' used for inflammation and pain. These drugs, he believed, could make racing safer, more humane.
But over time, he said, he came to realize that veterinarians were using drugs simply to keep horses racing, not to treat their underlying conditions.
''There comes a time in every horse's career that you've got to stand up and say, 'That's enough. We are endangering this horse,' '' Dr. Ferraro said. ''There are not a lot of veterinarians willing to do that.''
Racing authorities in Europe and Hong Kong will not allow horses to compete with any prescription drugs in their bodies. In the United States, a large group of veterinarians, trainers and owners disagree strongly with that stance. Furosemide has proved itself safe, they say, and not using it might endanger a horse's health.
In July, Kent H. Stirling, chairman of the medication committee of the National Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association, told a Congressional panel that horses in training benefit from therapeutic medicine much as people use aspirin to ''ease sore muscles.''
''We're not like Europe, where horses spend half the year in the pasture eating grass,'' Mr. Stirling said in an interview in March. ''The owners want a return on the investment and the trainer needs to keep the horse as fit as he can.'' Mr. Stirling said that if a horse has a nagging injury, it is ''not fair to the horse'' if the trainer does not treat it.
Dr. Mary Scollay, chief veterinarian for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, said bute and banamine, another anti-inflammatory, are not the same as aspirin and other over-the-counter pain medicines.
''These are drugs that you need to have a prescription for and are more powerful and given in larger doses than what's sold over the counter,'' Dr. Scollay said.
Tracy Farmer, a longtime breeder and owner who is also vice chairman of the Kentucky's racing commission, said the liberal use of prescription drugs has harmed racing. ''Look no further than the number of contenders in this year's Kentucky Derby now sidelined by injury or already retired to stud,'' Mr. Farmer said.
This happens almost every year, he added. ''By the time the Breeders' Cup rolls around, most Triple Crown stars are out of action, depriving the sport of heroes like Seabiscuit and John Henry.''
Dr. Ferraro says he and other veterinarians share the blame for turning racehorses into commodities.
''We took a beautiful, noble thing and screwed it up,'' he said. ''Horses are too good to put a price tag on. Some things ought to be sacred.''

HEADLINE: Working Nonstop to Stay Relevant

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Over the last decade, Ty Hallock has steered his business from Web site creation to social media to mobile apps. In three more years, he expects to be back at the drawing board again.
To prepare, Mr. Hallock, 29, spends an hour or two a day at his business, TopFloorStudio in Asheville, N.C., tracking venture capitalists and start-up news, trying to divine the next frontier. He created TopFloorUniversity, where experts teach his employees and clients the latest in app development. When he could not find a good curriculum for information architecture, he and a colleague developed one themselves. As a pretext to learn from the luminaries in his field, Mr. Hallock even produces his own podcast.
''You're always reaching for something that's kind of like unknown, because you don't know what is really going to be the future,'' Mr. Hallock said. ''I'm not in my 30s yet, and I'm sure at some point I'm going to be like, 'Enough.' '' 
But exhaustion may be a luxury that Mr. Hallock can never afford. The need to constantly adapt is the new reality for many workers, well beyond the information technology business. Car mechanics, librarians, doctors, Hollywood special effects designers -- virtually everyone whose job is touched by computing -- are being forced to find new, more efficient ways to learn as retooling becomes increasingly important not just to change careers, but simply to stay competitive on their chosen path.
Going back to school for months or years is not realistic for many workers, who are often left to figure out for themselves what new skills will make them more valuable, or just keep them from obsolescence. In their quest to occupy a useful niche, they are turning to bite-size instructional videos, peer-to-peer forums and virtual college courses.
Lynda Gratton, a professor of management practice at the London Business School, has coined a term for this necessity: ''serial mastery.''
''You can't expect that what you've become a master in will keep you valuable throughout the whole of your career, and you want to add to that the fact that most people are now going to be working into their 70s,'' she said, adding that workers must try to choose specialties that cannot be outsourced or automated. ''Being a generalist is, in my view, very unwise. Your major competitor is Wikipedia or Google.''
Businesses have responded by pouring more money into training, even in the current economic doldrums, according to several measures. They have experimented by paying employees to share their expertise in internal social networks, creating video games that teach and, human resources consultants say, enticing employees with tuition help even if they leave the company.
Individuals have also shouldered a lot of responsibility for their own upgrades. Lynda.com, which charges $25 a month for access to training videos on topics like the latest version of Photoshop, says its base of individual customers has been growing 42 percent a year since 2008. Online universities like Udacity and Coursera are on pace to double in size in a year, according to Josh Bersin of Bersin & Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in learning and talent management. The number of doctors participating in continuing education programs has more than doubled in the last decade, with the vast majority of the growth stemming from the increased popularity of Internet-based activities, according to the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education in Chicago.
The struggle is not just to keep up, but to anticipate a future of rapid change. When the Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College in North Carolina wanted to start a program for developing smartphone and tablet apps, the faculty had to consider the name carefully. ''We had this title Mobile Applications, and then we realized that it may not be apps in two years, it may be something else,'' said Pamela Silvers, the chairwoman of the business computer technologies department. ''So we changed it to Mobile Development.''
As the metadata and digital archivist at Emory University, Elizabeth Russey Roke, 35, has had to keep up with evolving standards that help different databases share information, learn how to archive ''born digital'' materials, and use computers to bring literary and social connections among different collections to life. The bulk of her learning has been on the job, supplemented by the occasional course or videos on Lynda.com.
''For me, it's easier to learn something in the classroom than it is on my own,'' she said. ''But I can't exactly afford another three years of library school.''
Rapid change is a challenge for traditional universities; textbooks and even journals often lag too far behind the curve to be of help, said Kunal Mehta, a Ph.D. student in bioengineering at Stanford University. His field is so new, and changing so rapidly, he said, that there is little consensus on established practices or necessary skills. ''It's more difficult to know what we should learn,'' he said. ''We have advisers that we work with, but a lot of times they don't know any better than us what's going to happen in the future.''
Instead, Mr. Mehta, 26, spends a lot of time comparing notes with others in his field, just as many professionals turn to their peers to help them stay current. The International Automotive Technicians Network, where mechanics pay $15 a month to trade tips on repairs, has more than 75,000 active users today, up from 48,000 in 2006, said Scott Brown, the president.
In an economy where new, specialized knowledge is worth so much, it may seem anticompetitive to share expertise. But many professionals say they don't see it that way.
''We're scattered all over the country, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., so it never really bothered us that we were sharing the secrets of what we do,'' said Bill Moss, whose repair shop in Warrenton, Va., specializes in European cars, and who is a frequent user of peer-to-peer forums.
Mr. Moss, 55, said technological advances and proprietary diagnostic tools had forced many garages to specialize. Ten years ago, if his business had hit a slow patch, he said, he would have been quicker to broaden his repertory. ''I might have looked at other brands and said, 'These cars aren't so bad.' That's much harder to do now, based on technology and equipment requirements.'' His training budget is about $4,000 a year for each repair technician.
Learning curves are not always driven by technology. Managers have to deal with different cultures, different time zones and different generations as well as changing attitudes. As medical director of the Reproductive Science Center of New England, Dr. Samuel C. Pang has used patient focus groups and sensitivity training to help the staff adjust to treating lesbian couples, gay male couples, and transgendered couples who want to have children. This has given the clinic a competitive advantage.
''We have had several male couples and lesbian couples come to our program from our competitors' program because they said they didn't feel comfortable there,'' Dr. Pang said.
On top of that, he has to master constantly evolving technology. ''The amount of information that I learned in medical school is minuscule,'' he said, ''compared to what is out there now.''

HEADLINE: Watching a Hit Sitcom, and Seeing Undecided Voters

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It's not so surprising that Michelle Obama said ''Modern Family'' was one of her family's favorite shows. And it's only a little surprising that Ann Romney claimed that she and her husband, Mitt, were also devoted fans.
There is no coincidence or meeting of the minds. ''Modern Family'' is a charming, hugely popular ABC sitcom with a little something for everyone, a funny portrait of the many fragmented, unconventional configuration forms that can make a family, encased in a comfortable, loving frame. It is also a show that has more than one politically sensitive element likely to alienate the bases of the president and his Republican opponent. 
So the best explanation is that neither candidate is worried about the base, and both are wooing the same middle-of-the road voters who are still uncertain which way they will go in November. For the campaigns, at least, watching the white, middle-class suburban characters on ''Modern Family'' is a way to mingle with the undecided.
The show's Phil Dunphy, a real estate agent with a wife and three children to support, represents a key political demographic: he's a businessman likely to fret about soft home sales and a slow economic recovery, but one who wouldn't mind ''Obamacare'' for his children.
It's unlikely that either candidate thinks that part of the electorate will favor him because of a shared taste in entertainment. In the eyes of anyone running for the highest office, however, the Phil Dunphy vote is tantalizingly just within reach. The Obamas and the Romneys are like those window-shoppers who linger outside a car dealership -- they may never get their hands on a vintage convertible, but they can't keep their eyes off the floor model (in one episode, Phil does give in to temptation and buys a snazzy sports car).
Pop culture references are a campaign fixture as mandatory as kissing babies and kissing up to PACs. Mr. Romney says he is down with Snooki of ''Jersey Shore,'' while Mr. Obama says he likes ''Homeland.'' But Americans, or at least American cable news anchors, are notoriously touchy: there is some risk to even the most innocuous choices, including ''Modern Family,'' a show so broad in appeal that it is up for 14 Emmys on Sunday.
The show casts a wide net: in addition to the Dunphys, there are a gay couple and a divorced man married to a much younger Hispanic woman. But it doesn't have an African-American in the core cast, which could be a turnoff for Obama supporters who expect the president and his family to promote diversity.
And the show's gay couple, Cameron and Mitchell, who have adopted one child and are seeking to adopt another, might alienate those conservatives who want the news media to respect traditional family values and take Mr. Romney at his word that he opposes gay marriage and supports ''defense of marriage'' laws.
But when it comes to attracting the undecided, the candidates' wives have a role, and in this case, if no other, Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Romney have similar agendas that defy their differences. Mrs. Obama has to persuade middle-class voters who might be turned off at seeing the first family gallivanting at cool fund-raisers with the likes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z that she has more pedestrian connections. One easy way is to signal that she can identify with a white middle-class suburban housewife -- and control freak -- like Claire Dunphy, Phil's wife. (Mrs. Obama also says she likes ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'')
Mrs. Romney, for her part, needs to shake off her homogeneous Mormon family's aura of country club insularity and exclusiveness, and embracing a gay couple on screen is an easy way to show tolerance.
Racial diversity, on the other hand, is a more sensitive issue. ''Girls,'' on HBO, is a boutique comedy with a limited range in characters -- middle-class 20-something slackers in Brooklyn. Yet the creator, Lena Dunham, was still slammed for not including black characters. She will have one next season.
''Modern Family'' has a Hispanic co-star but not a black one. In Season 3, the writers added a black neighbor, played by the comedian Kevin Hart, who is funny, but whose character is secondary at best.
The reality is that Mr. Obama doesn't need to prove his street cred, and Mr. Romney, as he made clear in the ''47 percent'' fund-raiser footage, seems not to want to.
''Modern Family'' is not just a television show; it's the meeting place of the undecided, those wavering few who may determine who will next control the remote in the West Wing.

HEADLINE: New iPhone Draws Around-The-Block Crowds as Sales Begin in Asia-Pacific

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SYDNEY -- The Apple iPhone 5 went on sale across Asia on Friday, with mobile carriers reporting record demand, leading at least one to question Apple's supply capacity.
KDDI, a Japanese carrier, said that it had already run out of the new phone. In Australia, Telstra reported that online preorders sold out in a record 18 hours and that it was discussing accelerated restocking with Apple.
When the iPhone 5 first went on sale, last Friday in the United States, Apple booked more than 2 million preorders in the first 24 hours, double the first-day sales of the previous model, the iPhone 4S. 
An estimated 600 people lined up around the block from the Apple store in central Sydney, the first in the world to hand over an iPhone 5 to a buyer, at 8 a.m. local time Friday (Apple planned to deliver the first preordered phones to U.S. customers later in the day).
The Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, in Brisbane, Australia, for a business forum, was among a crowd of several hundred lining up for an iPhone 5.
''I just feel this impulse, like I want to be part of this big adventure, this big revolution and this advance in technology,'' Mr. Wozniak, who stopped working for Apple in the late 1980s, told local television.
Masayoshi Son, president of Softbank, the other of the two Japanese carriers selling the phone, said he was concerned that Apple does not have enough production capacity to meet demand. Softbank and Singapore Telecommunications, also known as SingTel, said demand for the iPhone 5 had exceeded previous offerings from Apple, partly because the new phones could work on 4G networks that offer much faster data speeds.
Samsung Electronics of South Korea, both a rival and a component supplier to Apple, moved to crash the party on the eve of the phone's debut, saying it planned to add the new device to existing patent lawsuits against the U.S. technology company.
In Singapore, SingTel had booths open selling accessories and staff on hand to help buyers transfer data from their old phones, while in a rainy Tokyo, the lines stretched several blocks.
In Hong Kong, whose proximity to China supports a thriving gray market, small groups of people carrying rucksacks filled with cash waited outside the Apple store hoping to snap up phones for resale.
The introductions of the iPhone 5 were more tightly controlled by Apple than the release of the iPhone 4S in 2010, resulting in a more subdued atmosphere -- most of the noise in Hong Kong came from staff members, who outnumbered customers and chanted ''iPhone 5, iPhone 5.''
In Sydney, guerrilla marketers grabbed the first dozen or so spots in line, with companies paying staff members to line up for several days in the hope of being photographed and interviewed. But most of those waiting were aficionados already hooked on Apple's earlier iPhones and iPad tablet computers.
''I feel like if I leave it at home, I go a bit crazy,'' James Vohradsky, a 20-year-old student said of his current iPhone. He had been in line for 17 hours with his younger sister ''I have to drive back and get it. I can't do my normal day without it.''
Some analysts expect Apple to sell up to 10 million of the iPhone 5 in the remaining days of September and J.P. Morgan has estimated that the phone release could provide a $3.2 billion boost to the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter.
The new phone has a larger, 4-inch screen and is slimmer and far lighter than the previous model. The iPhone 5 supports faster 4G mobile networks and also comes with a number of software updates, including Apple's new in-house maps feature.
''It's thin and light. I've used Samsung before, but the operation, the feeling of the iPhone is better,'' Wataru Saito said of the iPhone 5. The semiconductor engineer had been waiting line in Tokyo since Thursday afternoon with his suitcase because he had a flight to catch Friday.
Some buyers were not completely happy. The iPhone 5 comes with Apple's own mapping software; previous models used maps from Google. Kim Tudo, a student at the University of New South Wales who had lined up overnight in Sydney, said he was disappointed that the turn-by-turn navigation feature was not immediately available in Australia.
Apple also did not embed near-field communication technology used to turn cellphones into mobile wallets in the iPhone 5. Mr. Vohradsky, also a student in Sydney, said the lack of mobile payment chip was also ''a bit of a letdown.''
The iPhone is Apple's highest-margin product and accounts for half of its annual revenue. Apple has said it will make initial deliveries of the iPhone 5 on Friday in the United States and most of the major European markets, like France, Germany and Britain. The phone goes on sale next Friday in 22 more countries. Apple plans to sell the new phone in 100 countries by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Romney Gaffe Reflects Real Sentiments

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
ASSISI, ITALY -- Kate Middleton and Mitt Romney have learned the lesson that what occurs at a French villa or a party with rich folk should be assumed to be no more private than a tweet.
But while the Duchess of Cambridge commanded sympathy, Mr. Romney found himself on the defensive. This is in part because the leaked tape of the Republican presidential candidate speaking to wealthy donors had a feel of authenticity. There was a fluency that sometimes eludes Mr. Romney when he is speaking in public.
The reaction from much of the United States and the world, including here in Italy, was shock: shock at the claim that 47 percent of voters are ''dependent upon government,'' thinking themselves ''victims'' who are ''entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it''; and shock that a candidate would say this and expect to win. 
''Romney: 'Half the voters are parasites,''' read the headline in Il Mattino, a newspaper published in Naples. Il Messaggero, a leading paper from Rome, accused Mr. Romney of threatening the American ''civic solidarity'' that was ''an example for many democracies in the world.'' The influential political newspaper Il Foglio declared Mr. Romney to be a ''monster, an accuser of his own people, a detractor of the lower social classes.''
What some of the commentary ignored, particularly in a Europe used to welfare states, was that Mr. Romney was articulating a theory that taps into strong, subterranean currents of resentment swirling beneath the United States today. Mr. Romney's remarks reminded me in particular of so many discussions I have had in Texas, where I am researching a book about, among other things, differing visions of the American dream.
Much analysis of Mr. Romney's remarks focused, understandably, on his own wealth. ''The Real Romney Captured on Tape Turns Out to Be a Sneering Plutocrat,'' shouted a headline on the Web site of New York magazine.
But that line of analysis may miss the point. Mr. Romney was not articulating the typical resentments of the stratosphere. If the rich talk about the poor, it is usually not in such terms. What Mr. Romney seemed to be channeling was the resentments of the much larger class far below him -- but just above the 47 percent.
This resentment, of the just-above-averages toward the just-belows, is a real political force in America today. It is the anger of the small-time salesman who works for commission with no days off toward the unionized teacher whom he sees going on strike. It is the bitterness of the plumber who came to the United States the right way toward compatriots who came illegally.
In Mr. Romney's words, given at a private fund-raiser in Boca Raton, Florida, were three interconnected claims about modern American life that one hears very rarely from the rich but all the time from the just-aboves.
The first is that the paramount division in American life is not race, not class, not geography; that it is, instead, the line between the energetic and lazy -- between makers and takers. The second is that these are fixed identities, not fleeting situations: that takers are a certain kind of person, with their own culture and values, and makers another variety. The third is that the United States has been drifting into a perverse new condition in which it will, before long, be better to be born a taker than a maker.
This sense of a reversal of roles is at the core of an angst into which Mr. Romney apparently tried to play. It was explicit in a less-quoted section of the tape, when the candidate was talking about how his father was born in Mexico -- though, alas, as a child of white parents. ''Had he been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.''
The idea that a white millionaire son of a governor and auto executive would be better off, as a presidential candidate, if only he were Latino is more than implausible. It is also notable because, once again, it is not your typical millionaire's grievance.
It seems borrowed from the grievances of folks less fortunate than Mr. Romney, who enjoy some fortune but whose privilege is precarious enough that they feel it slipping away. And they feel so in part (in their own assessment) because of government help to the disadvantaged: the contracts set aside for minorities; the affirmative action that works against their college-bound children; the taxes they pay while others seem to them to enjoy unemployment and its checks.
It is what Tom Boston, a body shop owner in the Dallas area and a middle-aged white man, was getting at when he told me not long ago, ''The tables have turned to where the white community is the minority community.''
In a country whose opportunities feel increasingly scarce and whose demographics are browning, this anxiety about victims in certain quarters of upper-class white America can itself become a kind of victimhood. As David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, wrote on The Daily Beast during the past week, ''The background to so much of the politics of the past four years is the mood of apocalyptic terror that has gripped so much of the American upper class.''
Mr. Romney is offering himself to the fearful as a savior who can spare it the bitter fate of becoming tomorrow's underdogs.

HEADLINE: From Parents, A Living Inheritance

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
For all of the conversation this week about Mitt Romney's views on federal income taxes and personal responsibility, his insistence that ''I have inherited nothing'' may be the most thought-provoking.
His comment, which was among those he made in the video of a fund-raiser that Mother Jones magazine posted Monday, has inspired a few skeptical reactions, given his privileged background. But leaving the breadth of his advantages aside, the comment speaks to an often unspoken distinction among families that can determine who gets ahead, who gets along and who merely scrapes by.
Some parents help their adult children financially, while others cannot or do not.
This living inheritance comes in many forms. It exists along a range from the free room and board for a 23-year-old intern to a stay of years for a 43-year-old single parent who has lost a job or recently divorced. The contribution can be as small as a first month's rent or as large as the 25 years of payments that many parents now make on college loans they took out so their children would not have to. 
The less help you have as an adult starting out, the harder you have to work to make the next geographic, career and economic step up. If you lack that help, any and all mistakes (and there will be plenty) often have much bigger consequences. And the lack of any family help can have a compounding effect on the millions of people who have negative net worths well into adulthood thanks to their student loan debt.
In certain respects, it's bewildering that this is our current state of affairs. How can it be that the more tuition costs rise, the fewer opportunities there seem to be for educated people in their 20s and 30s to move seamlessly into jobs that offer health insurance and pay enough to cover their living expenses?
The parents of adult children don't have good answers to this question; they simply write checks, if they can. Patrick Wightman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, points to data showing that nearly 60 percent of 23- to 25-year-olds report receiving some kind of financial assistance from their parents.
To parents like Kevin O'Brien, a 70-year-old retiree who divides his time between Park City, Utah, and Naples, Fla., this is simply the new order of things, something that needs to be part of every parent's financial planning.
He methodically ticked off the help he has provided his three children during divorce or job loss and transition and the assistance his sisters and close friends have provided. ''We see it again and again,'' he said. ''Most people don't like to talk about it, but the people you spend a lot of time with, the stories come out over lunch or a drink.''
This has required a bit of sacrifice from Mr. O'Brien, a retired physicist, and his wife, a retired pediatrician, but not so much that they don't do it willingly. ''When they get in trouble, I don't want them to go so far downhill that they'll never get out,'' he said. ''As a parent and grandparent, I think it's a fundamental responsibility for me and one I'm gladly willing to fulfill.''
Indeed, parents who provide financial help often speak in the language of necessity. To Karen Kline in Orinda, Calif., the idea of her lawyer son and graphic designer daughter not having health insurance was ''unacceptable.'' So she paid for it until they qualified for the benefit at their jobs. Ms. Kline, now 63 years old, has savings and will retire in two months with a pension, so she was able to afford the help.
Then there are the scores of young adults taking up temporary residence in their childhood bedrooms. The author Sally Koslow refers to a bed and cable access as ''the middle-class trust fund'' in her recently published book ''Slouching Toward Adulthood.''
Her son Jed, a lawyer, availed himself of the room in Manhattan more than a decade ago during a brief period of career and geographic transition and said his arrangement provoked a bit of jealousy. ''So many friends who had moved to New York City for the first time after college said that they would totally live at home if they had that opportunity,'' he said.
When I suggested to Mr. O'Brien that all of this parental assistance might strike people as so much coddling, he responded swiftly with a barnyard epithet. Things are different now, he noted. When he went to work for Bell Labs in 1969, his $16,000 salary was enough to afford a $32,000 family-size home in New Jersey. Today, that home would cost $500,000.
These parents don't deliver the usual platitudes about the next generation doing better than the last. They're merely trying to guard against downward mobility, which is a natural instinct.
But many young adults don't have families that can cushion their entry into adulthood. Jenna Leigh Wilson has just over $100,000 of student loan debt after earning degrees from Villanova and the University of Pennsylvania. Her mother died three years ago of breast cancer, she still has three siblings in college or younger and her father isn't in a position to help her financially.
Ms. Wilson, now a 27-year-old high school history teacher, is able to manage the debt thanks to the federal program that allows her to make student loan payments based on what she can afford. Any remaining balance will be waived in another decade or two depending on whether she sticks with full-time teaching.
She tries not to resent peers who have it easier. ''I think what is most upsetting to me is that the decisions I made at 17 and the perspective I had at 17 now completely color the future I'm going to have at 27,'' she said.
Indeed, without any family assistance in their 20s and 30s, people like her have little margin for error. They're the ones who believed the well-meaning grown-ups who told them as teenagers and 22-year-olds to go to the best college and graduate schools they could. They accepted the gospel that any education debt was good debt.
Alexandra Kimball, a 34-year-old Canadian writer, has seen this predicament from two starkly different sides. Her essay in the online magazine Hazlitt about trying to make it as a young journalist has been ricocheting around the Web for the last month, and reading it forever changed the way I will look at every résumé I see.
For years, she was deeply in debt and lacking the kind of personal safety net that comes from having access to money even if you don't have your own savings account. ''People are not necessarily rich, but they are middle-class and can sometimes borrow from their families,'' she said.
Ms. Kimball was on welfare for a brief period when she couldn't find work in any field. ''You just wind up in this mad scramble,'' she said, having defined it in her essay as a sort of vocational Whac-A-Mole. ''I have to pay $400 by the end of the month. What am I going to do? When you're doing that kind of short-term financial planning, what kind of gets lost is this idea of a career trajectory.''
Unless you get lucky -- as Ms. Kimball did. A surprise inheritance allowed her to retire her debt and pursue her chosen field. In an instant, everything changed. ''The really stunning thing for me was the mental freedom,'' she said. ''The rodentlike quality of my broke life, which was this scrambling feeling inside of me all the time, is gone.''
Ms. Kimball was fortunate. But there could be another option even for people who can't count on an inheritance or a loan from their parents. Forward-thinking families might consider establishing a loan pool, a concept that was new to me until I heard about it this week.
''It started when my grandmother died,'' said George Lewis, an 82-year-old lawyer in Quincy, Ill., one of nine siblings who grew up on a small farm and all graduated from the University of Illinois. ''She had a strong belief in education. Because of her, instead of flowers, we started a fund for college scholarships.''
Today, the nearly 50-year-old fund actually lends money interest-free, and the funds are now available to scores of members of the extended clan. Any family could mimic this pretty easily and hand out loans to young adults in a number of circumstances.
The fund that Mr. Lewis has helped administer now holds $111,000, having grown larger over the years from bequests and the proceeds of auctions at family reunions. ''I don't think any of us in our wildest dreams thought it would get to this point,'' said Matt Lewis, George's grandnephew, a 25-year-old college basketball coach who benefited from the fund. ''We don't realize how lucky we are that our family has something like this.''

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Didn't Break Ethics Rules in Bank Case, Investigator Finds

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, did not violate House ethics rules when she contacted the Treasury Department in 2008 to set up a meeting on behalf of top executives from a bank her husband owns stock in, a special investigator announced on Friday.
But the House ethics committee is still debating whether her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, acted improperly when he continued to work behind the scenes on behalf of the same bank, OneUnited, which is based in Boston. 
The findings, which still must be acted on by the ethics committee, represent some of the final steps in what has been a three-year investigation into Ms. Waters's actions during the financial crisis.
If the recommendation of the special investigator is approved, as is expected, it will represent a major victory for Ms. Waters, clearing the way for her to take over the spot as the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, where she has long served. The committee's ranking Democrat, Barney Frank of Massachusetts, is retiring.
Ms. Waters has long argued she did nothing wrong when she made that September 2008 phone call to Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was the treasury secretary at the time, to set up the meeting attended by executives from OneUnited, then near financial collapse.
Billy Martin, a former federal prosecutor who was named this year as an ethics committee special investigator for this case, said Friday at an unusual public hearing on the case that Ms. Waters believed at the time she made this call that she was acting on behalf of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited.
Only after the 2008 meeting did Ms. Waters find out that OneUnited executives dominated the event, asking for a special bailout by the Treasury Department, Mr. Martin said. If the bank had failed, her husband could have lost an investment then worth about $350,000.
Mr. Martin told an ethics committee panel Friday that once Ms. Waters learned of OneUnited's request for special treatment, she told Mr. Moore to stay out of the matter, the investigators found.
''Representative Waters went above and beyond what was required of her,'' said Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio. ''There is nothing left with Representative Waters.''
But the special panel set up by the ethics committee spent Friday morning examining whether Mr. Moore, who is Ms. Waters's grandson, continued to intervene on behalf of OneUnited, which ultimately received $12 million in bailout funds from the Treasury Department.
E-mails sent by Mr. Moore in late September 2008 that mentioned OneUnited were read at the hearing -- where Mr. Moore testified for more than an hour, while Ms. Waters, and her husband, Sidney Williams, sat silently behind him.
Mr. Martin said he had concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to bring formal charges against Mr. Moore, as he could not prove that Mr. Moore knew that Ms. Waters's husband owned the bank stock at the time he was acting on behalf of the bank.
But committee members said his testimony had been inconsistent and that there still was evidence that he might have acted improperly.
As a result, the ethics committee might issue a ''letter of reproval'' against Mr. Moore, which is not a formal charge, but its least serious type of punishment, which would not require action by the full House.
The letter would accuse Mr. Moore of using his office for personal gain, attempting to dispense special favors and taking actions that brought discredit on the House, Mr. Moore said, in his own testimony at the public hearing.
''I believe you either knew or should have known'' there was a conflict of interest, Representative Donna Edwards, Democrat of Maryland, said to Mr. Moore.
There was no proposal under consideration Friday to take action against Ms. Waters.
Mr. Moore, the only witness at the hearing, tried to defend his actions.
''The work that I did in September 2008 was not on behalf of any one bank,'' Mr. Moore said.
But Mr. Martin said that the ethics committee did not need ''clear and convincing'' evidence against Mr. Moore of wrongdoing to issue the letter of reproval, only ''sufficient evidence to conclude a violation occurred,'' given that it is not a formal sanction by the full House against him.
Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the special ethics committee, said that Mr. Moore could have a conflict of interest even if he did not personally see a financial benefit from a bailout to OneUnited, as Ms. Waters is his boss and grandmother.
Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. LaTourette agreed that the House rules regarding a conflict of interest needed to be examined to make it clearer what type of behavior violates the rules.
''Work needs to be done in this area,'' Mr. Goodlatte said.
The investigation of Ms. Waters, which started in 2009, has been mired in controversy after the House ethics committee's own chief counsel accused staff members in 2010 of sharing confidential details about the matter with Republicans, a violation of House rules.
The result was an extraordinary decision to appoint Mr. Martin to see if the ethics committee had acted improperly before restarting a new inquiry into the accusations against Ms. Waters.
Ms. Waters, 74, who has served in the House since 1991, declined to comment on the case at the end of Friday's hearing, saying she wanted to wait for a final action by the ethics committee.
But she was smiling as she walked out of the hearing room, with her husband at her side.

HEADLINE: IPhone 5 Fever? Don't Count Samsung Out

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
By many measures, Samsung Electronics should be on the ropes. Last month, it lost an important patent battle with its rival Apple after a jury in the United States ruled that Samsung had illegally copied aspects of Apple's groundbreaking iPhone. Apple introduced its newest model, the iPhone 5, to enthusiastic reviews and a worldwide consumer frenzy, with customers lining up to buy the new model days before it arrived in stores on Friday. This week, Apple shares hit a record high and cracked the $700 threshold.
So why is Samsung not only holding its own, but thriving?
Even as the Apple juggernaut has rolled over Research in Motion, which makes BlackBerry handsets, and Nokia, Samsung reported record earnings for its latest quarter, which ended June 30. Its handset profits, fueled by the introduction of its high-end Galaxy S III model in May, leapt 75 percent over the previous year. Samsung's stock has gained over 65 percent in the last year and was trading this week on the Korea Exchange at more than 1.3 million won, also close to a record. 
Samsung can't claim the intense media coverage, the passionate fan base or the cult of personality that grew up around Steve Jobs. But the giant South Korean manufacturer has built an impressive lead in global mobile phone sales. The research firm IDC reported that Samsung had 24.1 percent of the global handset market compared with Apple's 6.4 percent at the end of the last quarter. Samsung also had a commanding lead in the lucrative smartphone market: 32.6 percent compared with Apple's 16.9 percent, although the gap is likely to narrow because of the iPhone 5's introduction.
By contrast, Nokia's share of the smartphone market withered to 6.6 percent and Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry devices once accounted for nearly 20 percent of global smartphone sales, was no longer ranked among the top five producers.
These results didn't come as a complete surprise to me. As I reported a little over a year ago, after testing the latest handsets from Apple, Samsung and RIM, I ended up buying the Samsung Charge, a decision that surprised me, since I thought I wanted the same iPhone 4 all my cool friends had. The BlackBerry was sadly lacking, and the iPhone was a strong contender. What won me over was Samsung's large screen. Despite my large hands, I could type on the virtual keyboard with a fair degree of accuracy. (Try correcting typos when you're frantically searching for information on a Web browser or entering passwords.) Photos also looked better, and Samsung's 4G was faster, although I often found myself stuck in a 3G backwater. And it still fit in my pocket.
I can't say my subsequent experience has been flawless. At one point the Charge stopped functioning, a failure that stumped the technicians at a Verizon service center. But they replaced the phone at no charge to me, and thanks to Google, all my contact information was backed up and easily migrated to the new device. Since then, I've been comfortably embedded in a seamless Android world of e-mail, maps, directions, search and Web browsing even while continuing to use other Apple products.
But the competitive landscape has changed in just a year, with Samsung's introduction of the Galaxy S III and now Apple's release of the iPhone 5. My Charge already seems obsolete. Apple appears to have addressed all the issues that bothered me about the iPhone 4: the screen is bigger (though still not as big as the Charge's or the Galaxy's) and it offers 4G. It's also lighter and, in my view, looks better than my Charge. But Samsung is so confident that its Galaxy S III holds up favorably to the iPhone 5 that it started an aggressive national advertising campaign with a head-to-head comparison between the two handsets, highlighting a list of features the iPhone lacks. And Samsung said it has a more sophisticated Galaxy handset waiting in the wings that will offer an even bigger screen.
Several experts and analysts I spoke to this week said that Samsung was a formidable competitor that had moved ahead of Apple in some aspects. Samsung ''has come out with really attractive phones,'' Toni Sacconaghi, senior technology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said. ''They have large screens, great display, faster processors than Apple. Apple hasn't been at the front edge of hardware design for a couple of years.''
Tero Kuittinen, an analyst at the mobile communications consulting firm Alekstra, agreed. ''The iPhone has remained pretty much static now for three generations,'' he said. ''The first iPhone was a revelation, in a class of its own.'' With Apple holding on to the same interface for five years, ''you can still claim the interface is better, but the difference has been shrinking every year,'' he said. ''On display, you can argue Samsung has taken the lead. Maybe you can slam Samsung for being an imitator, but when they imitate, they do it right.''
Whether Samsung was innovating, imitating or illegally copying was at the heart of the complex patent suit. Samsung has appealed the jury's verdict and has its own claims against Apple. But nearly everyone I spoke to shrugged off the longer-term implications, saying technology is developing so quickly that the lawsuits may soon be irrelevant.
One group that Samsung clearly hasn't won over is design purists. ''Samsung is second to none in manufacturing and technology capabilities, but from a design perspective, it's soulless compared to Apple,'' Gadi Amit, a founder of NewDealDesign in San Francisco, told me. ''You hold the new iPhone, and you see and feel the difference immediately. The iPhone uses aluminum and glass, and both materials are considered noble from a design perspective. Samsung sticks to a lot of plastic, which is lower cost, not to say cheap. Worse, they use a surface finish to make it look like aluminum. It's fake. That's a big no-no in design circles. It's very uncool. The era of faux materials went out a long time ago.''
Robert Cihra, a managing director and technology specialist at the investment bank Evercore Partners, agreed that ''it's a tall order to compete with Apple on the coolness factor, at least for now.'' He added: ''There's no technology product that even comes close from a loyal fan base and cool factor perspective. The Apple stores are more beautiful than Louis Vuitton stores. It all goes hand-in-hand: branding, messaging, stores, advertising, the product, the mythology. It's amazing. But that could change.''
Samsung made two major decisions that enabled it to vault over RIM and Nokia, and then challenge and surpass Apple in market share. It wholeheartedly embraced Google's Android operating system, which leveraged Google's software research and development prowess and let Samsung focus exclusively on hardware, where it has long excelled. RIM and Nokia, by contrast, continued to struggle with their own aging and costly software systems as Android and Apple's iOS all but established a global duopoly.
''To my mind, the competition comes down to the software platforms,'' Mr. Cihra said. ''Pre-iPhone, cellphones competed on size, weight, battery life, camera. Those things are still important, but what Apple really did was change the game away from small hardware tweaks to the software platform. The strength of the iPhone is the operating system.'' He noted that once consumers were happily embedded in an operating ecosystem, seamlessly connected to other services and devices, they were hard to pry loose. ''That cohesiveness is a big part of what they're competing on,'' he said.
At this juncture, Android has emerged as the most popular operating system (68 percent of the smartphone market, compared with Apple's 17 percent, according to IDC), in large part because Apple doesn't compete at the lower end. Samsung took the opposite approach by making handsets that cater to every part of the market. Its huge economies of scale and global reach have given it advantages over other Android competitors like HTC of Taiwan and Motorola Mobility, now owned by Google, Mr. Sacconaghi said.
Mr. Kuittinen noted that ''Samsung's low-end strategy has been incredibly effective.'' He added, ''There are big long-term benefits from building a low-end foundation,'' because customers stay with the brand when they trade up. ''The Galaxy III became a huge success because of Samsung's strong portfolio in Brazil, India, Indonesia and China. What's fascinating about Apple is its refusal to get aggressive in emerging markets. They basically ceded the crown to Samsung. You can understand that they don't want to dilute their margins by competing on price. But at some point, they may have to accept lower growth or go after Samsung.''
By concentrating on the high end, Apple remains far more profitable than Samsung, accounting for more than two-thirds of the profits from smartphones, according to Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank, while Samsung accounted for about a third. The two companies, in fact, accounted for all of the profits from smartphones because other makers, like Nokia and Research in Motion, are losing money, the bank said.
The good news for consumers is that competition has produced better and cheaper mobile phones at an astonishing rate. No one I talked to thought either Apple or Samsung could rest on its laurels or market share. With its purchase of Motorola's operations, Google looms large as a new competitive threat, and there's intense speculation about what it will come up with. If anything, the competition is heating up.
''Samsung has done the best job of leveraging Android to its advantage,'' Mr. Cihra said. ''Over the last year, it's come down to Apple, Samsung and everyone else. But it's deeper than Apple vs. Samsung. Samsung is the flag bearer for the Android system. It's Apple vs. Android. That's where the real competition is going to be.''

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
On Friday, Mitt Romney made public his most recent tax return and some information from previous years, responding to political pressure and asserting that he paid a double-digit federal income tax rate for more than two decades, Nicholas Confessore and David Kocieniewski report.

        
President Obama and Representative Paul D. Ryan made back-to-back appearances at the AARP convention on Friday, each insisting his opponent's policies would threaten the future of Medicare, Mark Landler and Richard A. Oppel Jr. report. The crowd gave a better reception to Mr. Obama than to Mr. Ryan, who was met with boos at his suggestion of repealing the new health care law.

        
The Senate passed a stopgap spending measure, and then lawmakers headed home until ballots are cast in the November elections, Jonathan Weisman reports. And Congress lurched to the exits the way it started - amid partisan acrimony and backbiting even within the parties.

        
A special investigator has ruled that Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, did not violate House ethics rules for her involvement during the financial crisis, clearing the way for her to become the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Eric Lipton reports. Her chief of staff is now the primary focus of an inquiry by the House Ethics Committee.

        
Though pop culture references have become a campaign fixture, President Obama and Mitt Romney's love for the television show "Modern Family" comes with a few politically sensitive elements likely to alienate both the liberal and conservative bases, Alessandra Stanley writes.
 Weekly Addresses 

        
In this week's address, President Obama criticized Congress for recessing when "their work isn't finished." He blamed their absence for the lack of a farm bill, legislation that would have helped homeowners and small businesses, and a bill that sought to set up a job corps for veterans. "All of these ideas would strength our economy and help the middle class right now," he said. "That's why, after going home and listening to their constituents for a few weeks, members of congress should come back in November and do this work."
 Around the Web 

        
Representative Todd Akin, Republican of Missouri, may have found a few friends to support his Senate campaign after much of his party shunned him for making inflammatory comments about rape. The Hill says that Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, is considering financially supporting Mr. Akin's campaign, and Politico reports that Newt Gingrich will host a joint news conference with him on Monday and attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Akin.

        
Three senators made cameos on the NBC sitcom "Parks and Recreation" on Thursday, Politico reports. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, acted alongside Amy Poehler, whom some may remember for her impersonation of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on "Saturday Night Live" during the 2008 elections.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Michelle Obama will deliver remarks at an awards dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus.

        
The Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition will be held in the National Museum of Natural History this weekend. The event will also feature a "Women, Music and Diplomacy" gala honoring Madeleine K. Albright, former secretary of state.

        
The Library of Congress will host the National Book Festival on the National Mall.

HEADLINE: Underdogged

BYLINE: JILL LEPORE


HIGHLIGHT: Why does Mitt Romney try to represent himself as downtrodden? 

 BODY:
"I definitely think Mitt goes in as an underdog," Ann Romney said in a television interview earlier this month. Mr. Romney's campaign happens to be imploding at the moment, but his supporters have been calling him an underdog since the primaries. In February, Mr. Romney said he was the underdog in Michigan, his home state. In June, Gov. Scott Walker said Mr. Romney was the underdog in Wisconsin. Sometimes, being just any old underdog isn't enough. "He's the tremendous underdog," said a Republican committeeman in New Hampshire.
In August, the Republican nominee was somehow the underdog at his own nominating convention. "Romney entered the G.O.P. convention the underdog and left the convention the underdog," as one blogger put it. Mr. Romney said it best: "It's always a good thing to be seen as the underdog."
The word "underdog" is an Americanism. I went into the archives to sniff out these sous-chiens. The expression dates from at least 1859, and a widely printed poem, "The Under Dog in the Fight." The underdog is the cur who's been bitten and trampled and who, at the end of the fight, lies bloodied and beaten. Sympathy for the underdog meant sympathy for the downtrodden. ("For my heart will beat, while it beats at all,/For the under dog in the fight.")
The term became common during Reconstruction. In a Harriet Beecher Stowe novel published in 1871, one character says about another that he always "goes for the under dog: he is always ready to help the poor." In 1879, a New York newspaper reported on a speech written by Frederick Douglass. "Besides occasional outbreaks of violence and bloodshed, the negro has been the 'under dog,' and treated as such," the story reads, summarizing Douglass's remarks. "Only a few years ago the negroes were bought and sold like cattle, and flogged and outraged, and sometimes murdered." To be an underdog was to be treated like an animal.
Not long after that, underdogs entered politics. During the presidential election of 1884, supporters of James G. Blaine, who was defeated by Grover Cleveland, were referred to as "under-dogs." But, more usually, underdogs weren't the losers in political contests; they were the working poor. In 1912, in Congressional hearings on industrial relations, labor representatives referred to themselves as "we, the underdogs." One told Congress that if a longshoreman was injured at work and went to a hospital, he'd be left untreated, "dirty and dusty... the last sort of person they want in the hospital" because he's "the underdog."
In the 1940s, social scientists used the word "underdog" as shorthand for "socially and economically underprivileged Americans." A subject of great fascination, at the time, was that Americans tended to have a lot of sympathy for underdogs. (That sympathy is why we fight for equality.) This got political consultants thinking: what if we sold our candidates as underdogs? By 1954, the political scientist Herbert A. Simon had coined the phrase "the underdog effect," to describe how doing badly in early polls can be a boon because American voters sometimes sympathize with losers.
IN 1963, Howard Schuman at Harvard and John Harding at Cornell published an article called "Sympathetic Identification with the Underdog." They defined an underdog as an "ethnic minority facing discrimination." They conducted an experiment on a sociology class in a northern college, two summer school classes at a college in the South, the white students in a class at Harvard on race relations, and a group of adults from Boston. They asked questions like this:
 A colored man born in New England goes South for the first time and sees in a Mississippi bus station two waiting rooms, one for colored and one for whites. How do you think he would be likely to react to this? 
 (a) He probably thinks it is a good thing at present, since it prevents trouble from arising. 
 (b) He may notice it at first, but after a while he probably gets used to it and it doesn't make much difference to him. 
 (c) He very likely feels hurt by it, and perhaps angry. 
 (d) It is hard to know exactly how he would react to such a situation, though with more information one might be able to tell. 
One of their more interesting findings was that the people who were most sympathetic with underdogs were sympathetic with top dogs, too. Sympathy is sympathy. A white middle-aged Boston housewife who, answering a different question, expressed concern about how the people sitting on the back of a bus must feel, added that she was also worried about the people on the front of the bus, mainly because she found it so hard to put herself in their shoes. She said, "I think it's probably hard for us here to understand how the white people there feel about it."
"Underdog," an animated television show that started in 1964, featured a beagle whose mission was to protect the poor and helpless from "those whose hearts are filled with greed." An early idea for the series called him Downtrodden Man.
Mitt Romney is no Downtrodden Man. In May, at a fund-raiser in Florida, Mr. Romney expressed contempt for the "47 percent" of Americans who, he said, "believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it." This is not a man who loves underdogs.
When Mr. Romney says he's an underdog, that's not humility: that's branding. Last year, a team of scholars that included Harvard's Neeru Paharia and Anat Keinan published a study called "The Underdog Effect: The Marketing of Disadvantage and Determination through Brand Biography." They defined "underdog brand biography" as "an emerging trend in branding in which firms author a historical account of their humble origins, lack of resources, and determined struggle against the odds." Their research, they say, demonstrates that telling a story about yourself in which you are an underdog builds brand loyalty, especially in cultures where "underdog narratives are part of the national identity." Pretending to be an underdog is good business.
Mr. Romney's branding himself an underdog to earn voter sympathy might not be the weirdest feature of his topsy-turvy campaign. It's not even the most ruthless. But it is one of the saddest.

HEADLINE: Here Yesterday, Gone Tomorrow

BYLINE: By NICK KURCZEWSKI

 BODY:
THE school year may have just begun, but the automotive Class of 2013 is already well settled at dealerships around the nation. Each model year brings new models to fill showroom spaces vacated by cars and trucks that have been discontinued. For 2013, more than a dozen nameplates will not be returning, and two automotive brands have also expired.
After a protracted bankruptcy and with legal tussles continuing, the 63-year operations of Saab, the Swedish automaker, are being dismantled. Likewise, Daimler's Maybach line of ultraluxury sedans is fading away after a decade-long revival. 
Some vehicles are not being replaced, like the Mercedes-Benz R-Class wagon and the electric Tesla Roadster. Others, like the Dodge Caliber, will be indirectly replaced by a different vehicle in the same segment.
Here are some of the most notable vehicles that are disappearing after the 2012 model year:
ASTON MARTIN DBS Aston's top model -- save for the ultraexotic, sold-out One-77 -- is replaced by the 565-horsepower Vanquish coupe and convertible. Like James Bond bidding farewell with a sly wink and a raised martini, the DBS exits in style.
CHEVROLET COLORADO/GMC CANYON Pickup sales are big business, but midsize models like these have struggled to find a following. The Colorado and Canyon will sit out the current model year, at least until more fuel-efficient and aerodynamic versions arrive, perhaps as 2014 models.
DODGE CALIBER Only operators of daily rental fleets might bemoan the loss the cut-rate Caliber. Most consumers probably didn't notice that the boxy hatchback was still around, especially because the vastly better Dart sedan replaced it in the Dodge lineup.
HYUNDAI VERACRUZ This midsize crossover has been pushed out of Hyundai's lineup in favor of the new Santa Fe, which now offers an optional long-wheelbase 7-passenger version.
JEEP LIBERTY The Liberty S.U.V. remains ruggedly handsome, so it's too bad its clunky 4-speed automatic and wheezy 3.7-liter V-6 amount to the mechanical equivalent of a pack-a-day smoking habit.
KIA SEDONA Kia's stylish hip-hop hamsters would steer clear of the Sedona, the South Korean automaker's bland entry in the minivan market. A more cutting-edge replacement, based on the KV7 design study, is planned for the 2014 model year.
LEXUS HS 250H The Lexus HS 250h sedan should have provided a steppingstone for Prius owners to move up to Toyota's luxury division. But the appeal of this plush eco-sedan was limited by a price significantly higher than the Prius's, along with lower fuel economy.
MAYBACH In 2003, Daimler dusted off this long-dormant brand to take on Rolls-Royce and Bentley. The interiors of the Maybach 57 and 62 sedans had all the trappings of a private jet. Unfortunately, the exterior styling, which managed to be unremarkable and gaudy, had more in common with a Mercedes S-Class from two generations ago.
MAZDA CX-7 With demand for its nimble and attractive CX-5 crossover exceeding supply, Mazda simply doesn't need the five-passenger CX-7 anymore. The CX-9, which provides seating for up to seven, remains in the lineup, however.
MERCEDES-BENZ R-CLASS With a station wagon body that looked rather hearselike, the R-Class aimed for a market niche that proved not to exist. The performance-oriented R63 AMG model could become a cult classic, however.
MITSUBISHI GALANT AND ECLIPSE Mitsubishi is streamlining its lineup in what could be a make-or-break moment for the automaker in the United States. With the Galant gone, the brand lacks a mainstream midsize sedan. And the Eclipse sporty coupe has reached the end of the line after a tumultuous history in which it veered from a pocket rocket to an overstyled economy car.
SAAB Spyker, a Dutch maker of supercars, bought Saab from General Motors in 2010. Since then, Saab cozied up to Russian tycoons and formed dubious links to relatively unknown Chinese automakers. Recent plans included transforming the company into an electric car manufacturer. Spyker is suing G.M. for $3 billion, charging that it stood in the way of deals that could have saved Saab.
TESLA ROADSTER A two-seater based on the Lotus Elise, with a zero-emission electric powertrain for scintillating performance, the Roadster made electric cars cool. But the travel range was limited and the price topped $100,000. Having made its mark with the Roadster, Tesla has turned its attention to the more affordable Model S sedan.

HEADLINE: A Long Ride Across a Small Country

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER. 
BRUCE WEBER is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IF and when you decide to bicycle across Luxembourg, I cannot promise that you will be rescued from a cloudburst by the unexpected appearance of a tunnel on the bike path, nor that in the tunnel you will be welcomed by an alphorn trio.
But it happened to me.
I'm a cross-country cyclist, though the only country I've ever ridden across is the United States, which I've done twice. That trip was getting a little old. Oh, wait, I once rode across the south island of New Zealand, but the plane flight! No thanks. Besides, this year I was a little pressed for time. A long weekend was about all I could spare, and it happens that I was in Paris. So Luxembourg was it.
Wedged between France, Belgium and Germany, Luxembourg is just about 1,000 square miles, making it smaller than Rhode Island. From Steinfort on the Belgian border in the west across the center of the country to Echternach on the Germanyside is about 30 miles as the crow flies, maybe 35 as the cyclist cycles. You can do it in a long afternoon if you're so inclined. 
I wasn't; you'd hate to cross a place just for the sake of the crossing and not get any sense of it. You might miss discovering the place I did: a bit of a storybook land with a sense of humor about itself; Hans Christian Andersen but droll. In other words, an alphorn trio in a tunnel.
I arrived in Luxembourg city, the capital and, with about 100,000 residents, by far the country's largest population center, on a Thursday evening. Situated at the confluence of two rivers and more than 1,000 years old, the city is a banking center that is one of Europe's most prosperous. It rises up along dark cliffs from a gorge and gives a stratified first impression, with its cozy and compact center nestled in a layered shell of commerce.
My girlfriend and I had taken a two-hour train ride from Paris, getting there in time for a late dinner. Our cabdriver, recently arrived from Morocco, he said, lauded the amiability of the city's people, and as if to prove it, gave us a brisk tour in the Mittel-European twilight, along economically healthy-looking thoroughfares that yielded to a view of the Luxembourg fortress, dating to the 10th century, from which the city emerged.
Our hotel was on Place d'Armes, an ordinarily bustling square in the city center with music and outdoor cafes, but a power outage shortly before we arrived had curtailed the nightly activity as well as shut down the restaurant -- and the computer system -- in our hotel (whose name I won't mention because it seems unfair to complain about mediocre service after that). We found a night spot, Brasserie Guillaume, a garishly lighted bistro with well-dressed patrons and a menu -- on the expensive side (main dishes were mostly between 20 and 30 euros, about $25 to $37 at $1.25 to the euro) -- prominently featuring beef carpaccio and lobster. The waiter recommended veal rognons, a specialty of the chef, which turned out to be kidneys, something I didn't realize until after I'd eaten them, returned to the hotel and looked up the word. I liked them better before I knew.
Early the next morning we made our way to the Grund, a quarter of quaint lanes and shops along the Alzette River sunk so dramatically below the central city that the entire area feels as though it has fallen into a crevasse. (We had walked down a long, uncomfortably steep cobblestoned road to get there, not knowing that there is, in fact, an elevator available to ferry pedestrians down and up.)
In any case, in the Grund we found the Velo en Ville bike rental shop, a very casual place staffed by competent and earnest young men, where we picked up our sturdy, easy-to-ride touring bikes. Made by Trek, the popular American manufacturer, they were built for comfort rather than speed, featuring upright handlebars, simple shifters, reliable brakes and soft, padded seats.
LIKE much of Europe, Luxembourg has an enthusiastic cycling culture. The Schleck brothers, Frank and Andy, perpetual Tour de France contenders, are Luxembourgers, and the government has officially supported cycling as a boon to both tourism and recreation. The country is laced with a national network of cycling paths -- known as PCs, for the French term pistes cyclables -- which perambulate through a pretty, undulating landscape with only the occasional, briefly daunting incline. The project was set in motion in 1999 and is about two-thirds finished. Right now 23 separate paths -- about 600 miles in total -- crisscross the nation.
Conveniently, PC 1, the part of the cycle path network that circles Luxembourg city and intersects with a number of other pistes, goes right by Velo en Ville, so we started our ride from there.
The route we planned was a vaguely egg-shaped path through the center of the country that touched both the Belgian and German borders and was a kind of Luxembourg sampler: a little urban sophistication, a little small town quaintness, some architecture from the Middle Ages, and landscapes of forests, riversides and rolling farmland.
We hadn't thought about suburbs -- who plans to cycle through suburbs? -- but within an hour of leaving the capital city, that is exactly where we found ourselves. Namely, we were in a park in a town called Hesperange, where a children's summer camp was in session.
The children, for some reason all wearing yellow baseball caps, were playing jump-rope and dodge ball (or something like it) on a lovely green lawn that also served as a contemporary sculpture garden; the exhibit included a dozen or so life-size female mannequins in imaginatively intergalactic garb along with half a dozen orange pigs, which the children took pleasure in mounting, cowboylike, and kicking with their heels as if they were saddled horses. One of the camp counselors, meanwhile, borrowed our pump to inflate her unicycle tire.
The scene was charming and, in the driest, most deadpan way, hilarious. But it did slow us down. The park, you see, wasn't really on our preferred route, but the signs marking the bike path we'd been following were, at that point, in conflict with one another. We found our way forward with the help of some park workers (who held quite a substantial debate about our predicament before venturing their counsel). But as we negotiated the rest of a suburbanscape that resembled nothing so much as Englewood, N.J., we grew hungry and grumpy -- the only explanation for our lunch stop at McDonald's, where we scarfed down what should be (but aren't) called Luxemburgers. Still, I have to admit -- they perked us up.
Soon we were beyond the reach of the capital's infrastructure, traffic and population, and the remainder of the day was far more encouraging. As it would for the rest of the journey, the bike path proceeded in seemingly designated segments, each with a distinct character: the forest segment, with dense undergrowth and dappled sunlight; the field segment, with Andrew Wyeth-like waves of rolling wheat; the riverside segment, with leafy trees along a sleepy watercourse. One segment would stop abruptly and the next would begin.
Occasionally, there would be a town -- we passed through Steinfort and Eischen along the Belgian border, then pivoted toward the northeast toward Noerdange, Useldange and Colmar-Berg -- generally small and tidy communities with azure-, peach- and lox-colored houses, well-tended gardens and flower boxes replete with red begonias, pink impatiens and deep-purple petunias. Judging from the number of bustling, crowded riverside campgrounds we passed, outdoor living is a national pastime. Public sculpture, some of it eyebrow-raisingly kitschy, is all over the place.
That was also the day of the rainstorm, the tunnel and the alphorn trio, but I'll get to that later. We rode 40 miles before we stopped for the night in Erpeldange, an unassuming small town just north of the larger town of Ettelbruck. You wouldn't think there would be a hotel at all in Erpeldange, but there was, in fact, a surprising one, the Hôtel Dahm, where the room (small but comfy) was more than adequate, especially for 90 euros, and the restaurant was terrific, even if chateaubriand for two came to a lot more than that.
On Saturday, once we passed through the town of Diekirch (home of a pretty good beer), we had our most rural day of riding, going north out of our way a bit to Vianden, near the German border, where a formidable medieval castle, built between the 11th and 14th centuries, stands sentry high above a charming, if touristy, village, affording dramatic photo ops. (The steeply pitched, cobblestoned road up to the castle was the toughest challenge of our ride -- and worth it.)
The path to Vianden went through cornfields, intensely green hills and rolling farmland stocked with the meatiest, healthiest-looking cows I've ever seen. At the top of one hill whose slopes were dotted with apple trees, we were treated to the sight of two enormous hawks with brown mottled wings, circling above us in a swooping, graceful dance that went on for minutes.
The castle houses a museum (6 euros admission) with some interesting displays of weaponry and a striking view of the river valley below, but it is more impressive from the outside, where the magnificent view is made especially poignant by a plaque dedicated to the American soldiers who completed the liberation of Luxembourg when they took Vianden from the Nazis in February 1945.
We retraced our path for a few miles, back past the apple trees (the hawks were gone), and followed the Sure River along the border, crossing over a short bridge to touch our wheels in Wallendorf, Germany, before continuing south on the Luxembourg side. We spent the night at Hôtel Brimer, a roadside resort in the town of Grundhof, which had just added a ''wellness'' wing to a traditional, century-old inn, and whose motley decorative plan featured some striking taxidermy in the lobby hallway and a Vegas touch (that rug!) in our large, light, well-appointed bedroom (141 euros.) I'm not scoffing: The foie gras was superb (the broiled lobster, too) and the bathroom unexpectedly commodious. I'd recommend it, especially to travelers who can appreciate a good identity crisis.
On Sunday we had weather. We followed the Sure to Echternach, an attractive town on a sleepy stretch of the river, and then turned west for the final 25 miles back to Luxembourg city. It was a beautiful and adventuresome ride, part of it through a glorious forest in a torrential downpour and part through treeless, rolling fields as the rain died down and the wind rose. We were hurrying.
Finally, we entered the city from the north, where a slew of gargantuan public buildings of strikingly modern design were in varying stages of completion. The sky was gray, the urbanscape spooky, and as we pedaled through what felt like the abandoned set of a science fiction movie, suddenly the wind gusted -- once, twice, three times -- so hard it halted our pedaling and nearly threw us off our bikes. We had to wait for it to pause, and we raced to the city center, just as another downpour descended. It was a nice way to finish, actually, with a little drama that made us glad to be back.
Now, I hope you get my point that crossing Luxembourg is worthwhile without an alphorn trio serenade. It still counts as a crossing. But the truth is it's better with one, which is exactly what I was thinking when Paul Krummes, Anne Houlard and Remy Zahlen introduced themselves.
Known collectively as the Aischdall Alphorntrio, they were setting up for a rehearsal in the mouth of a quarter-mile-long tunnel near Eischen, a few dozen pedal strokes from Belgium, unpacking their instruments, the giraffes of the music world.
(For those of you unfamiliar with the Mittel-European musical tradition, the alphorn -- also known as the alpenhorn or alpine horn, usually associated with Switzerland and best known from commercials for Ricola lozenges -- is a hollow, wooden wind instrument shaped like a long, narrow cone that extends as much as 12 feet from its mouthpiece to an upturned bell that rests on the ground.)
It had just begun raining, suddenly and rather hard. The arched stone tunnel, paved and lighted in dim, handsome amber, was formerly for the railroad but now it's part of a trail reserved for hikers and bikers. It was a surprise and a relief; the manifestation of the trio, as if from thin air, seemed straight from a fairy tale.
Their music was delightful, imperfectly performed but richly harmonic, deep-voiced and thrumming like a pride of bullfrogs along the empty stone corridor.
''The acoustics,'' said Mr. Krummes, the leader of the group, when I asked what they were doing there. This was the longest tunnel in Luxembourg, he added.
WE listened for 10 minutes or so, a rapt audience, then bade them regretful farewell and remounted our steeds. (Sorry, something about all of this seems to call for archaic language.) They continued to play as we rode away, and the soundtrack trailed us and faded away, as if a movie were ending. When we emerged at the other end, the rain had stopped and the sun was out.
No rainbow, alas. But maybe that would have been too much.
IF YOU GO
CYCLING
Both the size and civility of Luxembourg make it especially well-suited to a do-it-yourself cycling vacation. We arranged all of it easily -- locating a bike rental, planning the route, reserving hotels, buying train tickets -- in a few hours online and on the phone just a couple of days before we left. (Luxembourg by Cycle is a helpful online guide: biking-tours.lu/cycle-luxembourg.)
We rented our bikes from Velo en Ville, which from what I could tell is the only full-service bike rental place in the city of Luxembourg. In a cavelike space on a cobbled road in the Grund quarter, it is staffed by helpful people and provides sturdy, well-maintained bikes. Children's bikes are available as well. Reservations are not necessary. Bikes can be rented by the hour or the day or the weekend. We paid 75 euros total, not quite $100, for two bicycles, from Friday morning through Sunday afternoon. One bit of advice: Though Ville en Velo provides locks, water bottles and helmets, it does not supply saddlebags, so bring your own -- or at least a few bungee cords to secure your duffel bag or backpack to the rear rack. Velo en Ville: (352) 4796-2383; vdl.lu/Location+de+vélos.html
Once you are in the country, Luxembourg pedestrians are so eager to help lost English-speaking cyclists that you might end up swearing they've been hanging out on street corners waiting for you. Though the French influence seems to dominate the west and German the east, most residents toggle easily among several languages. The beginning of any conversation with a stranger is devoted to which one it will be conducted in. ''You speak English? No problem'' was the nearly universal reaction to us -- but the official national tongue is Luxembourgish.
As for the biking itself, the terrain is ideal for easygoing travel. The paths themselves are mostly paved, easily negotiable for any reasonably competent cyclist and generally distinct from auto routes, though there are segments where you're obliged to ride with traffic. The network rises to a peak altitude of just 1,800 feet -- the lowest point is about 430 -- and there are no quad-straining, lung-burning climbs. We covered roughly 100 miles by bike in three days.
A couple of caveats: Though the routes are often well marked, riders need to be eagle-eyed for the markers, especially passing through towns; we got thrown off the track a handful of times and ended up on roads without adequate shoulders. Luxembourg drivers, however, seem especially sensitive to cyclists and gave us a wide berth.
EATING AND SLEEPING
Brasserie Guillaume (352-26-20-20-20; brasserieguillaume.lu), where we had a late dinner our first night, has all the trappings of a place to be -- atmospheric buzz, well-dressed diners, indifferent waiters and elevated prices.
We preferred Restaurant l'Academie (Place d'Armes 11; 352-22-71-31), a homier place with an open terrace on Place d'Armes, hearty local fare (try the lamb) and large portions.
Outside Luxembourg city, the restaurants at both our hotels were satisfying -- thoughtful menus, well-prepared food.

HEADLINE: In Show's Luster, Seeing Reflections Of Europe's Chill

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
ACROSS Europe, the next generation of rich confections from luxury automakers is nowhere to be seen.
It may be a temporary condition -- restraint in the face of daunting economic headwinds -- but the effect is immediate: very little cake will be served at the Paris Motor Show this year. Instead, a menu listing mostly bread-and-butter transportation essentials will dominate automakers' displays as the show opens Thursday for two days of press previews.
Organizers claim that the Paris salon, first held in 1898, is the ''world's biggest motor show'' in terms of attendance, with more than 1.2 million visitors in 2010, its most recent run. (Paris alternates with Frankfurt in opening the European show season.) The doors open to the public Saturday, and the show runs through Oct. 14. 
The presentations and product unveilings get under way as Europe's economy continues to deteriorate, with many automakers on the Continent scaling back sales projections and issuing dark statements about the challenges ahead.
Executives from General Motors have stepped up to tell customers and investors that the company will revive its teetering Opel brand, not sell it. Even as Germany's top-of-the-market models are setting sales records in the United States, in France the government has floated the idea of a tax on luxury automobiles to help the struggling operations of Peugeot, Citroën and Renault.
There are sure to be surprises emerging from the news conferences, but statements trickling out ahead of the show's opening offer little prospect for the fanciful design studies that typically appear in this capital of style consciousness. Indeed, the important reveals scheduled for Paris skew toward economical transportation appliances like the next Golf compact from Volkswagen and the redesigned Auris, a Corolla-scale entry from Toyota.
The wide array of calorie-counting new offerings includes Smart's morsel-size Forstar E.V. concept, the cheeky Adam microcar from Opel and Mini's new Paceman. There are hatchback coupes -- the i30 from Hyundai and the Pro_cee'd by Kia -- that share a platform, a Panda 4-by-4 from Fiat, a tiny Trax crossover from Chevrolet and even compact utility wagons and hatchbacks from premium marques like Audi.
That is not to say, however, that the menu is completely fat-free: the British seem to be bringing dessert. Land Rover will display its next-generation Range Rover flagship. Jaguar will pull the wraps off a new sports car, the F-Type, Bentley promises a sporty new model and McLaren, only recently back in the roadcar business, is showing a concept of a second model, the P1.
''For the Brits, we don't have that British Motor Show any more,'' said Fiona Pargeter, a spokeswoman for Jaguar Land Rover. ''So Paris is right on our doorstep.''
Jaguar is leveraging the ''magical, romantic and culturally rich setting'' of Paris, Ms. Pargeter said, to introduce the F-Type on the eve of the show at an event featuring the chanteuse Lana Del Rey at the Musée Rodin.
But that's an anomaly: out of more than 100 world premieres and European debuts scheduled at the show, only a sprinkling will be aimed at 1-percenters. In fact, Aston Martin, which has two important new models coming out -- the DB9 and Vanquish -- is skipping Paris.
''We will wait until Geneva,'' Matthew Clarke, an Aston Martin spokesman, said in an e-mail. The Geneva event, held each March, is typically seen in the world of auto shows as a friendlier haven for the supercar crowd.
Mr. Clarke said Aston Martin generally expects to write a significant number of orders for new cars at Geneva. At Paris? Not so much. It seems more like a crowd of window shoppers, tire kickers and wishful thinkers.
In fact, France's car and light vehicle orders, a precursor to delivery trends, just declined for the fourth straight month. Many automakers have been engaging in ruinous price wars in an effort to draw buyers back into showrooms.
But it doesn't seem to be working. Renault's orders were down another 20 percent in August; Citroën was down 5.3 percent and Peugeot was off 9 percent. Toyota and Fiat orders plunged a further 24 percent, Ford dropped another 16 percent and even the volume leader, Volkswagen, fell 5 percent.
Ford was pummeled not only in France, Europe's second-largest car market, but all across the Continent. Its 29 percent sales drop last month in 27 countries across Europe was the worst among major automakers; the company said it expected to lose more than $1 billion in Europe for the year.
The company is counting on stanching the flow of red ink with the introduction of key new products like the midsize Mondeo, which will be unveiled Thursday.
Great things are expected from the new VW Golf, the meat-and-potatoes model in the German automaker's lineup. More than 29 million Golfs have been sold worldwide since the model's debut in 1974, the company says. To cut costs, the Golf shares the new MQB chassis, which also underpins several models in the constellation of VW Group brands, including the Audi A3 Sportback, another Paris debutante this year.
Cost-cutting is very much on the minds of all automakers these days. Even Porsche, which is unveiling a station wagon version of its Panamera sedan in Paris, says it may pull back one or two planned new models to preserve its profits.
The once-rapid push toward electric cars seems to have slowed in the cost crunch. But almost every manufacturer is promoting new technologies to conserve fuel use, whether it be through engine idle stop-start options, hybrid powertrains or rapid weight-loss programs.
Land Rover, for instance, says its new Range Rover is more than 900 pounds lighter than the version it replaces. The new Bentley is said to be a lightweight sports coupe. And VW is claiming its newest Golf will shed 220 pounds compared with its predecessor.
Perhaps the show's most unusual introduction involves not a car, but a sculpture. As a teaser for next year's anticipated redesign of its S-Class, Mercedes-Benz is presenting ''an artistic glimpse of the design of the luxury saloon of the foreseeable future.'' The car's silhouette is rendered in a bas-relief panel that will be creatively lighted. Closer to reality, the company is also unveiling an electrified concept of its B-Class small car that, it says, will go on sale in 2014 in various markets, including the United States.

HEADLINE: Laudable Fuel Efficiency Even Without Electricity

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
BETHLEHEM, N.H.
THERE is no vehicle more important to Mazda right now than the CX-5.
The five-seat crossover wagon, which went on sale in February, has been the main beneficiary of the company's research and development efforts over the last three years, making it something of a showcase for Mazda's strategy and intentions.
The CX-5 carries the full complement of a technology package the company calls Skyactiv, an umbrella for the hardware and processes Mazda says will enable it to meet federal fuel economy standards for the coming decade -- and do it without hybrid systems or electric powertrains.
Skyactiv is meant to chart a new course for the Zoom-Zoom company, which is angling to increase its share of the United States market to a tiny 2.5 percent, from today's minuscule 2 percent. The powertrain portion of Skyactiv was introduced in the 2012 Mazda 3, the company's best seller, helping that car to achieve E.P.A. fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon on the highway. 
But the Mazda 3 was not all-new, and Skyactiv is more comprehensive: it is a philosophy that underlies the engineering of new lightweight engines, transmissions, chassis and body structures. The goal is to create performance-oriented vehicles that are also fuel-efficient.
Other automakers have been pursuing these goals as well, but without formulating a unified approach.
''Where Mazda is different is that there seems to be an integrated approach where Skyactiv covers all the bases,'' said Mike Omotoso, senior manager for global powertrains at LMC Automotive, a market research firm.
The diet program has worked. The Skyactiv 2-liter, 4-cylinder gasoline engine in the CX-5 is 10 percent lighter than the 2-liter engine available in the 2012 Mazda 3 and MX-5 Miata. The manual transmission is lighter by 4.4 pounds, a sign of how determined Mazda's engineers were to drop weight. The body structure is 61 percent high-tensile steel, making it lighter and stronger, Mazda says.
The CX-5 replaces the Tribute crossover, which was based on the Ford Escape. It is a completely new vehicle that brings nothing from the Escape.
Typically, even vehicles billed as all-new use major components from a previous generation. But Mazda didn't want what it saw as a ''piecemeal approach,'' said Tim Barnes, the company's product planning and strategy director. Among the benefits that came from making a fresh start were fuel economy bragging rights: at 35 miles per gallon, the CX-5 gets better highway mileage than any competitor in its class sold in North America, including hybrid models.
It is a valid claim, though it glosses over some of the fine print.
First, the 35 m.p.g. figure is for the front-wheel-drive Sport with a manual transmission, which Mazda said would account for about 5 percent of sales.
So the other 95 percent of buyers are looking at either 32 m.p.g., if they choose an automatic transmission with front-wheel drive (and 26 m.p.g. in the city), or 31 m.p.g. if they choose all-wheel-drive (25 m.p.g. city). The front-wheel-drive 2013 Ford Escape is rated at 33 m.p.g. highway and the Kia Sportage matches the CX-5 at 32 m.p.g.
On roads around this part of New England I found the E.P.A. estimates for the CX-5 easy to match or beat. On separate trips to Connecticut and New York City, the all-wheel-drive CX-5 test vehicle averaged 31, 32 and 33 m.p.g. on various highway segments.
But fuel efficiency has been achieved at the expense of power, which could be a problem for a company that promotes its Zoom-Zoom image.
The 4-cylinder engine, which uses direct fuel injection, is rated at 155 horsepower and 150 pound feet of torque, and it struggles to move the all-wheel-drive CX-5's 3,426 pounds. The engine strained coming out of a rest area to merge onto busy Interstate 91. Just before that, it couldn't handle a long, gradual hill at 65 m.p.h. without the automatic's shifting down from sixth to fifth gear with only a driver aboard.
In a Motor Trend test comparing the CX-5 with four classmates, it posted the slowest zero-to-60 time, at 9.4 seconds. But perhaps it is unrealistic to expect blazing acceleration from a 155-horsepower engine, especially when all automakers have to meet higher fuel economy figures. Say goodbye to the free lunch.
Yet the lack of spunk is a bit puzzling given that Mazda engineers weren't forced to use a 10-year-old engine or transmission. And the deficiency is all the more puzzling considering the engine's high compression ratio of 13:1 -- which Mazda boasts is ''on par with the world's highest-performance racecars'' -- and the free-flowing design of its exhaust manifold.
Mazda could have tuned the engine to produce more than 155 horsepower. But it exercised restraint, said Jeremy Barnes, a Mazda spokesman, to ensure that the CX-5 could use 87-octane gasoline. ''Someone who takes into consideration the cost of fuel is someone who would walk away from a vehicle in this class if it required premium fuel,'' he said.
Instead, Mazda took advantage of the exhaust system's innovations to provide a broader torque curve than that of the Mazda 3, although both vehicles share similar peak torque figures.
It is worth remembering that there is more to performance than raw horsepower. When it comes to the handling part of the equation, a driving enthusiast would choose the CX-5 over the Honda CR-V, despite the CR-V's 185 horsepower and higher torque.
On back roads here, I found the CR-V's body motions were not as tightly controlled as the CX-5's, so the Mazda's handling on winding roads was more nimble and confident. The Mazda's steering has a fairly tight on-center feel and is predictable. On a really rumpled surface, the CX-5's ride was a bit choppy, verging on harsh. But that's a small price for such driving fun.
In the federal government's crash testing program done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the CX-5 received an overall rating of four stars, with five stars being the best; frontal and rollover ratings of four stars; and a five-star rating for side-impact protection. It received the highest rating, Good, in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's moderate frontal overlap, side, rollover and rear crash protection tests.
Pricing starts at $21,790 for the entry-level Sport model with a 6-speed manual transmission, the only trim level with a manual. The manual-shift Sport is not available with all-wheel drive.
Sport models with a 6-speed automatic and front-wheel drive start at $23,190. Front-wheel-drive Touring models start at $24,990, and the top-of-the-line Grand Touring at $28,140. Add $1,250 for all-wheel drive.
The total for my all-wheel-drive Grand Touring test vehicle was $30,415 with the $1,325 Technology Package, which includes a navigation system, high-intensity headlights with auto-leveling and adaptive front lighting that worked well on dark roads in rural New Hampshire.
Because Mazda has chosen to aim the CX-5 at the heart of the compact crossover segment where it sees future growth, it has discontinued the CX-7, which straddled the small and midsize crossover segments. But the CX-5 is larger in some important interior dimensions than the CX-7 was.
It has almost an inch more rear legroom and more cargo space. Without folding down the second row seats, we fit in a bulky wheelchair, unwieldy walker with wheels and numerous travel bags. When more space is needed, flexibility is provided by the 40-20-40 split seats.
Controls for the radio, navigation and climate are knobs -- and knobs are nice. Unlike Ford's touch screens, they do not incite anger. The front seats are supportive and well bolstered to keep the driver in place during fun-to-drive moments.
How much of a difference Skyactiv will make to Mazda's bottom line is the huge underlying issue. Sales of the CX-5 are expected to be in the 41,000 to 45,000 range annually, and Mr. Omotoso of LMC Automotive expects that the CX-5 will increase Mazda's sales by 5 to 10 percent, which could help the company sell 300,000 vehicles in the United States. That's not happened since 1994.
Through August, Mazda's year-to-date sales are up 11.8 percent. The company said its plan for the current fiscal year was -- and still is -- to sell 290,000 vehicles.
Beyond the practical matters, purchase decisions often hinge on visual appeal, and here Mazda has given the CX-5 a fighting chance with a new styling theme it calls Kodo. It has been shown on design studies before, but the CX-5 is its first use on a production vehicle.
Kodo translates roughly to ''soul of motion,'' which Mazda says is about capturing power and focusing on proportions with a more sophisticated overall look. As expressed in the new grille alone, the Kodo theme gives the CX-5 a far more attractive appearance than other Mazdas; it will show up on the 2014 Mazda 6.
The CX-5 is a welcome addition for crossover drivers who want some sport along with utility -- and good fuel economy as well. They just need to practice a little patience.
INSIDE TRACK: Less zoom, more room and plenty of fun.

HEADLINE: So You Want to Be a Broker

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
ROBIN GOLDBERG, a sales associate at Sotheby's International Realty, became a licensed agent after making a midlife career change in December 2010: she is, she says, in her 50s and previously worked in finance and fashion. A native New Yorker who grew up in the Bronx, she has lived in a loft in Little Italy for 35 years; her husband, Richard Goldberg, is a wine consultant, and they have two children, 18 and 21.
Q What drew you to the real estate industry in such a problematic economy?
A I think real estate really is a business that encompasses many different aspects of careers I'd been involved with in my past: financial, negotiating skills, creativity, being good with people, being able to multitask. ... And whoever you represent, you have to satisfy your client first and foremost. This job allows you independence, and also it's an entrepreneurial situation. Everybody has their own take on how to sell. 
Q How does a beginner in such a crowded, competitive field accumulate clients and listings?
A I was lucky to have an amazing network of family, friends and business associates. Friends of mine referred me to friends of theirs because they had confidence in me even though I was new at this. If you know how to access information, there are no answers you can't find: that's how good the technology is, but it's essential to be in the moment when it comes to technology and social media. It helps you put the financial and psychological pieces together in a deal.
Q What was your first significant sale or transaction, and how long did it take?
A A business associate was moving out of New York City and wanted to sell a co-op in Chelsea, but it was a co-ownership situation, and you know how it is, everybody in the city has a friend in real estate, so it was complicated. I brought in a more experienced colleague to help pitch the listing, and as it turned out, both owners decided to go with me. It's interesting what some agents will say to get a listing. I don't make things up. I don't want to live with lies. These clients had a time frame and a price in mind, and I accomplished both; we asked $835,000 and closed for $810,000 in less than a month. And I got another listing in that building for $1.2 million.
Q What special talent or insight do you bring to the table?
A In this particular industry, I do think age is beneficial: each client has their own emotional packaging, and I think, after raising two children, that I'm good at remaining calm and handling that. And I listen. If you don't listen to your clients, how are you ever going to achieve their wants, needs and goals?
PETER GRAZIOLI, 46, joined Halstead Properties as a sales associate in its Park Slope office in the fall of 2011 after Young Brand, the media technology firm where he had been a vice president, downsized and later filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Grazioli, a native Brooklynite, lives with his partner in a century-old Park Slope town house that he has spent the past decade renovating.
Q How does a beginner in such a crowded, competitive field accumulate clients and listings?
A It was amazing how many people I'd run into in the neighborhood or in social situations who'd say, ''Oh, I'm looking for an apartment'' or ''Oh, I'm thinking of selling my house; what do you think it's worth?'' I learned the hard way that when a friend asks you what to do to stage their apartment for a sale, you do not tell them the first thing they should do is rip down their wallpaper. I did that early on and my friend said: ''Rip it all down? But I just put it up!'' It's like you just called their baby ugly. But people get very excited when they hear you're in real estate: at dinner parties, you might as well be standing on the table giving lap dances, that's how much people want to talk about real estate. It's crazy.
Q What was your first significant sale or transaction, and how long did it take?
A My first transaction was a walk-in client looking for a rental; I showed him around Brooklyn for about two weeks, and he found a place right in my neighborhood, so not only did I gain a client, I found a new neighbor. I was always a fount of useless knowledge about Brooklyn; now it's not so useless. My first almost-million-dollar sale is a two-bedroom two-bath in Park Slope that listed for $995,000; I marketed it with another broker from the office who's been a mentor to me. If you mind splitting commissions, you're in the wrong business: you have to have a respect of team. I have three new listings for sale, all in Brooklyn, and I've got a listing coming up in Manhattan.
Q What special talent or insight do you bring to the table?
A I know every nook and cranny of this borough, and I'm honest: when somebody is standing there with their money in hand about to make the biggest purchase of their life, I would be guilt-ridden if I sent them down the primrose path to destruction. Of course, if you don't close deals, you're going to starve to death, but you want to do it with integrity and respect. And from that comes referrals, referrals, referrals.
Q Any negative experiences with clients?
A My worry when a client disappears is: ''Was it me? Was it something I did?'' The fact is, it happens. Sometimes they walk; there is no commitment in that regard. And you feel like they just broke up with you! Then there's the other extreme, the clients who want to know everything about you; it's like, ''Wait a minute here, are we dating, or am I just taking you to an open house?''
GRETCHEN de CHELLIS, 37, left Boston for New York with the notion of becoming a fashion photographer, graduated from Hunter College with a degree in studio arts, and worked in the fashion industry until 2009. That was when Simone Song Properties, a boutique firm with a focus in Washington Heights, Hudson Heights and Inwood, hired her to photograph its listings. In June 2011 Ms. de Chellis, who lives in a rental in Inwood, switched gears and became an agent.
Q Why did you decide to get your real estate license?
A I have a friend in Boston who's in real estate, and I starting thinking about how it made logical sense for me to try it, partly because I am a visual person and see every apartment as a canvas, and partly because I'm creative, and you have to be creative to put deals together and close them.
Q How did you find yourself looking for work at a real estate office in Harlem?
A I was just walking through the Hudson Heights neighborhood, which I think is the most quaint, sweet little piece of heaven in Manhattan, and I saw the Simone Song office and I decided to walk in and ask for a job: it was total serendipity. It was all about timing. I told Simone I had my license but that I wasn't ready to get into sales; she told me she needed someone to photograph her listings. So for the next two years I worked for Simone and tried to learn everything I could: I got to see a lot of properties and got to know the supers and the neighborhoods. In June of last year, I told her I thought I was ready to hit the pavement.
Q What was your first significant sale or transaction, and how long did it take?
A My first listing was a rental at Hudson 192; Simone Song Properties was the principal marketing agent for the building. That deal happened in July, just a few weeks after I'd started as an agent. The first property I sold was a sponsor unit at 60 Cooper in Inwood in March of this year. Right now I have five listings in contract, all on the buyers' side; I'm in the middle of putting together three board packages.
Q What is the biggest misconception out there regarding agents?
A People have this image that being an agent is easy, that all you have to do is show apartments. This is an undervalued job for all the work that goes into it! And real estate is a really fickle industry.
Q When buyers come to uptown Manhattan, what are they usually looking for, besides a bargain?
A They want more space, more light and a better view, all for less money. Some people who consider themselves chefs want a great kitchen; others couldn't care less about cooking. They'd just as soon store their shoes in the kitchen.

HEADLINE: Commander of the Apps, Except the One for Guilt

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
IN San Francisco recently, I was running late for a meeting, desperate for a ride. But no buses or cabs were in sight.
Then I remembered a service called Lyft. I pulled out my smartphone and quickly downloaded the application, which lets regular people act as chauffeurs for a fee. As instructed, I entered my location -- then crossed my fingers and waited.
Five anxious minutes later, a clean black Audi pulled up, with a chatty young man at the wheel. I jumped in and we made friendly small talk. I gave him advice for his future trip to New York, and he invited me to a party that night in the city. We reached my destination, and I slid out of my seat, transferred $10 to the service through the Lyft app, and walked into my meeting with a smile. 
It was the start of a series of encounters with useful apps providing services in the nick of time. At first, these successes emboldened me. The next day, for example, I found myself in yet another bind. I realized that a booking error had left me without a hotel room in San Francisco for one night. Normally, such a travel glitch would have caused me to panic. But I calmly searched until I found an application called HotelTonight, which shows last-minute rooms available in a particular city. I found and reserved a place to stay, all while drinking iced coffee and sitting outside in a park.
What couldn't I do, what problems couldn't be solved, with the tap of an app? A few hours later, I realized that the device I'd brought to supply my laptop with an Internet connection was on the fritz. I needed it for a press event starting bright and early the next day, but I also had to get to an important dinner. But, again, I didn't have a meltdown. I simply pulled out my phone and found an application called Exec. It quickly matched me with a human assistant who was willing to track down and deliver a replacement, so long as I paid him $25 an hour, which I was quite willing to do.
But a few hours later, the first signs of trouble began. While sitting at the dinner, receiving texts and questions from the patient young man who was buying my mobile hot spot at Best Buy, I started to feel guilty. Was I taking advantage of him? Was I paying him enough? Was my time worth more than his?
No doubt these services are helpful; in all three instances, they were lifesavers. This emerging on-demand economy, made up of a wave of mobile applications and services, is certainly convenient. It is intended to deliver almost anything you need or want with the flick of a finger, if you have a smartphone and the cash to spare. A game changer? Definitely.
But are there murkier issues, about the haves and have-nots in a tech world, lurking just below the surface? I certainly felt uneasy about how simple it was to command an army of mobile helpers via my phone.
My discomfort, it turns out, is not uncommon, according to Justin Kan, the founder of Exec, an online service that provides helpers for a variety of tasks. ''I don't think it comes that naturally to people at first,'' Mr. Kan said. ''There is friction. But when they see other people using it, they will find ways to use it and that it is O.K.''
Rachel Botsman, one of the authors of ''What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption,'' notes that ''it can be quite uncomfortable asking a stranger to do something for you, even if you are paying them.'' Yet, she says, many people have overcome this aversion.
She cited Airbnb, a service that lets people rent their homes to travelers, for rates comparable to a hostel or hotel, with the company taking a slice of the fee. At first, letting a stranger crash in your spare bedroom may seem hard to imagine -- yet, many have found that making extra cash from their homes is appealing enough to join in. And enough travelers have enjoyed the authenticity of staying in someone else's home to have made the service quite popular. Since 2008, when Airbnb was introduced, it has helped people book 10 million nights in more than 26,000 cities around the globe.
Such services are useful enough that at least some of them will thrive, Ms. Botsman said.
''The economics are bigger than the individual,'' she said. ''This is changing the way things get done. There are massive socioeconomic implications for the unemployed and underemployed.''
She gave the example of a skilled chef who hadn't been able to secure a culinary job. Through one of these apps, the chef could take quick requests for a caterer or a personal cook, thus getting a foot in the door.
In addition, small businesses, she said, could scale back on staff or even office space by using on-demand services like Exec and TaskRabbit, which also help find people to perform errands on the spot.
''There has always been a demand for people who will do odd jobs,'' said Kartik Hosanagar, a professor of online commerce at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''There probably always was a good amount of supply as well, although that supply has increased dramatically since the 2008 recession. However, there wasn't an efficient way to match supply and demand previously.''
The bigger question is whether these companies can grow beyond their existing markets. Airbnb is in 26,000 cities worldwide, but Lyft and Exec are relatively young companies and currently operate only in San Francisco.
''There's a fundamental issue of intimacy,'' said Susan Etlinger, an analyst at the Altimeter Group, who advises companies on how best to use the Web in their business. ''Will people feel safe and comfortable on a larger scale? They'll have to do more of what Airbnb has done, spread the word about how well regulated and managed the service is. But even then, there's always tension between the person who is the employer and the person who is the employee that could turn users off.''
FOR consumers, it may be a matter of getting accustomed to the new services, and deciding how useful they are and whether they are worth the cost. I found myself weighing my discomfort against the convenience of being able to vastly increase the number of things I could do in a short time, and all for a relatively small amount of money.
On the final night on that San Francisco trip, for example, I faced yet another crunch. I needed to be in three places at once -- buying a new iPhone charger, picking out a birthday present for a friend and meeting friends from college for a drink. I stared at my phone, debating whether to use a mobile app to enlist an assistant for help with the shopping errands.
This time, at least, I decided that I didn't need the help. I'd deal with the errands at another time. So I put down my phone and headed straight to the bar.

HEADLINE: Praise for a Wall Street Critic

 BODY:
In ''A Lonely Redemption,'' on the cover of last week's Metropolitan section, Michael Powell and Danny Hakim profiled S. B. Lewis, right, a onetime Wall Street titan who has become a fierce critic of the finance industry. On NYTimes.com, commenters applauded his message, and Mr. Lewis joined the conversation himself. Readers also responded to Ginia Bellafante's Big City column, about unpaid internships and labor laws. A selection of their comments is below.
I want to hear more from Mr. Lewis. A lot more. I want to hear about Wall Street, and where he sees things heading. He is the leader -- in spirit if not in reality -- Occupy Wall Street needed and never had. He knows what's wrong and he speaks the truth. 
Siobhan,
New York
The line ''[t]he temptation is to dismiss Mr. Lewis ... as a crank'' says it all. The mainstream news media, so desirous of walking with the ''in crowd'' on Wall Street and in Washington, has a habit of ''dismissing ... as a crank'' anyone who criticizes these cherished institutions in detail, with candor and with deep discernment. Even a ''vindication'' of Mr. Lewis manages to insert this line to attenuate his message in service to the power brokers -- a message that only the power brokers themselves need to hear, as the rest of us have been well aware of it for decades.
Ted F.,
Minneapolis
I'm not very smart, and I live a thousand miles from Wall Street, but even I can see that our whole financial system is corrupt. Tea Party members scream about the auto bailout but say nothing about bailing out our banking system after it laid an egg so giant it ruined the world economy.
The rescue should have been followed by tractor-trailer rigs full of guilty bankers being hauled off to prison. Instead, the same people stayed and have enjoyed many million-dollar bonuses since then.
Americans can handle bad deals, but they can't stomach crooked deals. At the top there is no honor or decency; I can see that from my porch also. My thanks to Sandy Lewis for his lone voice in the wilderness.
DeathbyInches,
Arkansas
Yes, from 1,000 miles and more, we are obvious. The world knows. We have lost our bearings.
There was a time when all members of the New York Stock Exchange were general partnerships, where the N.Y.S.E. itself was a general partnership of general partnerships. In other words, the partner's net worth was on the line, day in, day out.
Integrity was a man's word; self-regulation was a given. The stock exchanges were called S.R.O.'s, for self-regulatory organizations. A common ethic bound one to all and all to one.
The corporation does not have a conscience.
Self-regulation will not work with the corporate form. The individual is protected with incorporation.
With general partnership, the partner is naked to the wind in the event of a tsunami.
Today they play heads I win, tails we lose. Other people's money is at risk.
S. B. Lewis,
Lewis Family Farm, Essex, N.Y.
Working for No Pay
Now in my late 20s, I've seen quite a bit of this, and watched many friends work for free only to be left without a job at the end. Many of these employers will make ambiguous insinuations and imply these ''internships'' may turn into a job, but I've rarely seen this happen.
It isn't just the fashion and publishing industries, either. This generation has been led to believe that internships are a foot in the door to employment. This is obviously false, and shame on employers for taking advantage of this misconception.
Interesting that the people perpetrating and exploiting these fallacies are the same ones calling this generation lazy and entitled.
Hopeful Hospitalist,
Boulder, Colo.
That well-educated young people are willing to work for free suggests that there may be some value in the unpaid internship. If no one was willing to do this work for free, surely the employers would be forced to pay wages, but as it is they've got more candidates than positions. Do we need to protect ambitious students from themselves?
Peter Burka,
New York/Ottawa
No, it suggests a dearth of opportunities for real employment. People take unpaid internships because there is nothing else and because they are told (incorrectly) that working for free will lead to paid work down the road.
Adam,
Washington, D.C.
Is this not similar to asking why we have a minimum wage? Surely if the minimum wage were $2/hr there would be people working for that rate, and you could say, ''Well, they're willing to do the work.'' It seems unrealistic to expect students frightened by the current job market and looking for any opportunity for future connections to demand that their prospective employers pay them, thereby potentially forfeiting the internship.
I am currently a college student in Manhattan, and I am continually amazed by the way the diversity-seeking higher education industry can exist side by side (and even in partnership) with the internship industry that offers opportunity only to those who are willing or able to work for free. We should not be comforted by the high numbers of applicants to such internships; we should be appalled that so many students feel that this is the only option open to them.
Laura,
New York
Want an internship that pays you very well (in fact, the same salary, on a prorated basis per month, as its most junior full-time employees -- $70,000), is very egalitarian (as in, hires those with the best grades and résumés, not just those who know someone, unlike the Congressional page system or the fashion industry) and teaches you a ton? Come work in the big, bad investment banking industry. It seems we're the only industry that actually pays our interns fairly ($5,900 a month at my firm and other Wall Street firms), hires them fairly (it doesn't matter who you are or who you know: if you have the grades and résumé, we'll hire you) and teaches them something. Who would have thought?
Sharon,
New York

HEADLINE: Power, Pollution and the Internet

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Jeff Rothschild's machines at Facebook had a problem he knew he had to solve immediately. They were about to melt.
The company had been packing a 40-by-60-foot rental space here with racks of computer servers that were needed to store and process information from members' accounts. The electricity pouring into the computers was overheating Ethernet sockets and other crucial components.
Thinking fast, Mr. Rothschild, the company's engineering chief, took some employees on an expedition to buy every fan they could find -- ''We cleaned out all of the Walgreens in the area,'' he said -- to blast cool air at the equipment and prevent the Web site from going down.
That was in early 2006, when Facebook had a quaint 10 million or so users and the one main server site. Today, the information generated by nearly one billion people requires outsize versions of these facilities, called data centers, with rows and rows of servers spread over hundreds of thousands of square feet, and all with industrial cooling systems. 
They are a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of data centers that now exist to support the overall explosion of digital information. Stupendous amounts of data are set in motion each day as, with an innocuous click or tap, people download movies on iTunes, check credit card balances on Visa's Web site, send Yahoo e-mail with files attached, buy products on Amazon, post on Twitter or read newspapers online.
A yearlong examination by The New York Times has revealed that this foundation of the information industry is sharply at odds with its image of sleek efficiency and environmental friendliness.
Most data centers, by design, consume vast amounts of energy in an incongruously wasteful manner, interviews and documents show. Online companies typically run their facilities at maximum capacity around the clock, whatever the demand. As a result, data centers can waste 90 percent or more of the electricity they pull off the grid, The Times found.
To guard against a power failure, they further rely on banks of generators that emit diesel exhaust. The pollution from data centers has increasingly been cited by the authorities for violating clean air regulations, documents show. In Silicon Valley, many data centers appear on the state government's Toxic Air Contaminant Inventory, a roster of the area's top stationary diesel polluters.
Worldwide, the digital warehouses use about 30 billion watts of electricity, roughly equivalent to the output of 30 nuclear power plants, according to estimates industry experts compiled for The Times. Data centers in the United States account for one-quarter to one-third of that load, the estimates show.
''It's staggering for most people, even people in the industry, to understand the numbers, the sheer size of these systems,'' said Peter Gross, who helped design hundreds of data centers. ''A single data center can take more power than a medium-size town.''
Energy efficiency varies widely from company to company. But at the request of The Times, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company analyzed energy use by data centers and found that, on average, they were using only 6 percent to 12 percent of the electricity powering their servers to perform computations. The rest was essentially used to keep servers idling and ready in case of a surge in activity that could slow or crash their operations.
A server is a sort of bulked-up desktop computer, minus a screen and keyboard, that contains chips to process data. The study sampled about 20,000 servers in about 70 large data centers spanning the commercial gamut: drug companies, military contractors, banks, media companies and government agencies.
''This is an industry dirty secret, and no one wants to be the first to say mea culpa,'' said a senior industry executive who asked not to be identified to protect his company's reputation. ''If we were a manufacturing industry, we'd be out of business straightaway.''
These physical realities of data are far from the mythology of the Internet: where lives are lived in the ''virtual'' world and all manner of memory is stored in ''the cloud.''
The inefficient use of power is largely driven by a symbiotic relationship between users who demand an instantaneous response to the click of a mouse and companies that put their business at risk if they fail to meet that expectation.
Even running electricity at full throttle has not been enough to satisfy the industry. In addition to generators, most large data centers contain banks of huge, spinning flywheels or thousands of lead-acid batteries -- many of them similar to automobile batteries -- to power the computers in case of a grid failure as brief as a few hundredths of a second, an interruption that could crash the servers.
''It's a waste,'' said Dennis P. Symanski, a senior researcher at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit industry group. ''It's too many insurance policies.''
At least a dozen major data centers have been cited for violations of air quality regulations in Virginia and Illinois alone, according to state records. Amazon was cited with more than 24 violations over a three-year period in Northern Virginia, including running some of its generators without a basic environmental permit.
A few companies say they are using extensively re-engineered software and cooling systems to decrease wasted power. Among them are Facebook and Google, which also have redesigned their hardware. Still, according to recent disclosures, Google's data centers consume nearly 300 million watts and Facebook's about 60 million watts.
Many of these solutions are readily available, but in a risk-averse industry, most companies have been reluctant to make wholesale change, according to industry experts.
Improving or even assessing the field is complicated by the secretive nature of an industry that is largely built around accessing other people's personal data.
For security reasons, companies typically do not even reveal the locations of their data centers, which are housed in anonymous buildings and vigilantly protected. Companies also guard their technology for competitive reasons, said Michael Manos, a longtime industry executive. ''All of those things play into each other to foster this closed, members-only kind of group,'' he said.
That secrecy often extends to energy use. To further complicate any assessment, no single government agency has the authority to track the industry. In fact, the federal government was unable to determine how much energy its own data centers consume, according to officials involved in a survey completed last year.
The survey did discover that the number of federal data centers grew from 432 in 1998 to 2,094 in 2010.
To investigate the industry, The Times obtained thousands of pages of local, state and federal records, some through freedom of information laws, that are kept on industrial facilities that use large amounts of energy. Copies of permits for generators and information about their emissions were obtained from environmental agencies, which helped pinpoint some data center locations and details of their operations.
In addition to reviewing records from electrical utilities, The Times also visited data centers across the country and conducted hundreds of interviews with current and former employees and contractors.
Some analysts warn that as the amount of data and energy use continue to rise, companies that do not alter their practices could eventually face a shake-up in an industry that has been prone to major upheavals, including the bursting of the first Internet bubble in the late 1990s.
''It's just not sustainable,'' said Mark Bramfitt, a former utility executive who now consults for the power and information technology industries. ''They're going to hit a brick wall.''
Bytes by the Billions
Wearing an FC Barcelona T-shirt and plaid Bermuda shorts, Andre Tran strode through a Yahoo data center in Santa Clara where he was the site operations manager. Mr. Tran's domain -- there were servers assigned to fantasy sports and photo sharing, among other things -- was a fair sample of the countless computer rooms where the planet's sloshing tides of data pass through or come to rest.
Aisle after aisle of servers, with amber, blue and green lights flashing silently, sat on a white floor punctured with small round holes that spit out cold air. Within each server were the spinning hard drives that store the data. The only hint that the center was run by Yahoo, whose name was nowhere in sight, could be found in a tangle of cables colored in the company's signature purple and yellow.
''There could be thousands of people's e-mails on these,'' Mr. Tran said, pointing to one storage aisle. ''People keep old e-mails and attachments forever, so you need a lot of space.''
This is the mundane face of digital information -- player statistics flowing into servers that calculate fantasy points and league rankings, snapshots from nearly forgotten vacations kept forever in storage devices. It is only when the repetitions of those and similar transactions are added up that they start to become impressive.
Each year, chips in servers get faster, and storage media get denser and cheaper, but the furious rate of data production goes a notch higher.
Jeremy Burton, an expert in data storage, said that when he worked at a computer technology company 10 years ago, the most data-intensive customer he dealt with had about 50,000 gigabytes in its entire database. (Data storage is measured in bytes. The letter N, for example, takes 1 byte to store. A gigabyte is a billion bytes of information.)
Today, roughly a million gigabytes are processed and stored in a data center during the creation of a single 3-D animated movie, said Mr. Burton, now at EMC, a company focused on the management and storage of data.
Just one of the company's clients, the New York Stock Exchange, produces up to 2,000 gigabytes of data per day that must be stored for years, he added.
EMC and the International Data Corporation together estimated that more than 1.8 trillion gigabytes of digital information were created globally last year.
''It is absolutely a race between our ability to create data and our ability to store and manage data,'' Mr. Burton said.
About three-quarters of that data, EMC estimated, was created by ordinary consumers.
With no sense that data is physical or that storing it uses up space and energy, those consumers have developed the habit of sending huge data files back and forth, like videos and mass e-mails with photo attachments. Even the seemingly mundane actions like running an app to find an Italian restaurant in Manhattan or a taxi in Dallas requires servers to be turned on and ready to process the information instantaneously.
The complexity of a basic transaction is a mystery to most users: Sending a message with photographs to a neighbor could involve a trip through hundreds or thousands of miles of Internet conduits and multiple data centers before the e-mail arrives across the street.
''If you tell somebody they can't access YouTube or download from Netflix, they'll tell you it's a God-given right,'' said Bruce Taylor, vice president of the Uptime Institute, a professional organization for companies that use data centers.
To support all that digital activity, there are now more than three million data centers of widely varying sizes worldwide, according to figures from the International Data Corporation.
Nationwide, data centers used about 76 billion kilowatt-hours in 2010, or roughly 2 percent of all electricity used in the country that year, based on an analysis by Jonathan G. Koomey, a research fellow at Stanford University who has been studying data center energy use for more than a decade. DatacenterDynamics, a London-based firm, derived similar figures.
The industry has long argued that computerizing business transactions and everyday tasks like banking and reading library books has the net effect of saving energy and resources. But the paper industry, which some predicted would be replaced by the computer age, consumed 67 billion kilowatt-hours from the grid in 2010, according to Census Bureau figures reviewed by the Electric Power Research Institute for The Times.
Direct comparisons between the industries are difficult: paper uses additional energy by burning pulp waste and transporting products. Data centers likewise involve tens of millions of laptops, personal computers and mobile devices.
Chris Crosby, chief executive of the Dallas-based Compass Datacenters, said there was no immediate end in sight to the proliferation of digital infrastructure.
''There are new technologies and improvements,'' Mr. Crosby said, ''but it still all runs on a power cord.''
'Comatose' Power Drains
Engineers at Viridity Software, a start-up that helped companies manage energy resources, were not surprised by what they discovered on the floor of a sprawling data center near Atlanta.
Viridity had been brought on board to conduct basic diagnostic testing. The engineers found that the facility, like dozens of others they had surveyed, was using the majority of its power on servers that were doing little except burning electricity, said Michael Rowan, who was Viridity's chief technology officer.
A senior official at the data center already suspected that something was amiss. He had previously conducted his own informal survey, putting red stickers on servers he believed to be ''comatose'' -- the term engineers use for servers that are plugged in and using energy even as their processors are doing little if any computational work.
''At the end of that process, what we found was our data center had a case of the measles,'' said the official, Martin Stephens, during a Web seminar with Mr. Rowan. ''There were so many red tags out there it was unbelievable.''
The Viridity tests backed up Mr. Stephens's suspicions: in one sample of 333 servers monitored in 2010, more than half were found to be comatose. All told, nearly three-quarters of the servers in the sample were using less than 10 percent of their computational brainpower, on average, to process data.
The data center's operator was not some seat-of-the-pants app developer or online gambling company, but LexisNexis, the database giant. And it was hardly unique.
In many facilities, servers are loaded with applications and left to run indefinitely, even after nearly all users have vanished or new versions of the same programs are running elsewhere.
''You do have to take into account that the explosion of data is what aids and abets this,'' said Mr. Taylor of the Uptime Institute. ''At a certain point, no one is responsible anymore, because no one, absolutely no one, wants to go in that room and unplug a server.''
Kenneth Brill, an engineer who in 1993 founded the Uptime Institute, said low utilization began with the field's ''original sin.''
In the early 1990s, Mr. Brill explained, software operating systems that would now be considered primitive crashed if they were asked to do too many things, or even if they were turned on and off. In response, computer technicians seldom ran more than one application on each server and kept the machines on around the clock, no matter how sporadically that application might be called upon.
So as government energy watchdogs urged consumers to turn off computers when they were not being used, the prime directive at data centers became running computers at all cost.
A crash or a slowdown could end a career, said Michael Tresh, formerly a senior official at Viridity. A field born of cleverness and audacity is now ruled by something else: fear of failure.
''Data center operators live in fear of losing their jobs on a daily basis,'' Mr. Tresh said, ''and that's because the business won't back them up if there's a failure.''
In technical terms, the fraction of a computer's brainpower being used on computations is called ''utilization.''
McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm that analyzed utilization figures for The Times, has been monitoring the issue since at least 2008, when it published a report that received little notice outside the field. The figures have remained stubbornly low: the current findings of 6 percent to 12 percent are only slightly better than those in 2008. Because of confidentiality agreements, McKinsey is unable to name the companies that were sampled.
David Cappuccio, a managing vice president and chief of research at Gartner, a technology research firm, said his own recent survey of a large sample of data centers found that typical utilizations ran from 7 percent to 12 percent.
''That's how we've overprovisioned and run data centers for years,'' Mr. Cappuccio said. '' 'Let's overbuild just in case we need it' -- that level of comfort costs a lot of money. It costs a lot of energy.''
Servers are not the only components in data centers that consume energy. Industrial cooling systems, circuitry to keep backup batteries charged and simple dissipation in the extensive wiring all consume their share.
In a typical data center, those losses combined with low utilization can mean that the energy wasted is as much as 30 times the amount of electricity used to carry out the basic purpose of the data center.
Some companies, academic organizations and research groups have shown that vastly more efficient practices are possible, although it is difficult to compare different types of tasks.
The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which consists of clusters of servers and mainframe computers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, ran at 96.4 percent utilization in July, said Jeff Broughton, the director of operations. The efficiency is achieved by queuing up large jobs and scheduling them so that the machines are running nearly full-out, 24 hours a day.
A company called Power Assure, based in Santa Clara, markets a technology that enables commercial data centers to safely power down servers when they are not needed -- overnight, for example.
But even with aggressive programs to entice its major customers to save energy, Silicon Valley Power has not been able to persuade a single data center to use the technique in Santa Clara, said Mary Medeiros McEnroe, manager of energy efficiency programs at the utility.
''It's a nervousness in the I.T. community that something isn't going to be available when they need it,'' Ms. McEnroe said.
The streamlining of the data center done by Mr. Stephens for LexisNexis Risk Solutions is an illustration of the savings that are possible.
In the first stage of the project, he said that by consolidating the work in fewer servers and updating hardware, he was able to shrink a 25,000-square-foot facility into 10,000 square feet.
Of course, data centers must have some backup capacity available at all times and achieving 100 percent utilization is not possible. They must be prepared to handle surges in traffic.
Mr. Symanski, of the Electric Power Research Institute, said that such low efficiencies made sense only in the obscure logic of the digital infrastructure.
''You look at it and say, 'How in the world can you run a business like that,' '' Mr. Symanski said. The answer is often the same, he said: ''They don't get a bonus for saving on the electric bill. They get a bonus for having the data center available 99.999 percent of the time.''
The Best-Laid Plans
In Manassas, Va., the retailing colossus Amazon runs servers for its cloud amid a truck depot, a defunct grain elevator, a lumberyard and junk-strewn lots where machines compress loads of trash for recycling.
The servers are contained in two Amazon data centers run out of three buildings shaped like bulky warehouses with green, corrugated sides. Air ducts big enough to accommodate industrial cooling systems sprout along the rooftops; huge diesel generators sit in rows around the outside.
The term ''cloud'' is often generally used to describe a data center's functions. More specifically, it refers to a service for leasing computing capacity. These facilities are primarily powered from the national grid, but generators and batteries are nearly always present to provide electricity if the grid goes dark.
The Manassas sites are among at least eight major data centers Amazon operates in Northern Virginia, according to records of Virginia's Department of Environmental Quality.
The department is on familiar terms with Amazon. As a result of four inspections beginning in October 2010, the company was told it would be fined $554,476 by the agency for installing and repeatedly running diesel generators without obtaining standard environmental permits required to operate in Virginia.
Even if there are no blackouts, backup generators still emit exhaust because they must be regularly tested.
After months of negotiations, the penalty was reduced to $261,638. In a ''degree of culpability'' judgment, all 24 violations were given the ranking ''high.''
Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, agreed that the company ''did not get the proper permits'' before the generators were turned on. ''All of these generators were all subsequently permitted and approved,'' Mr. Herdener said.
The violations came in addition to a series of lesser infractions at one of Amazon's data centers in Ashburn, Va., in 2009, for which the company paid $3,496, according to the department's records.
Of all the things the Internet was expected to become, it is safe to say that a seed for the proliferation of backup diesel generators was not one of them.
Terry Darton, a former manager at Virginia's environmental agency, said permits had been issued to enough generators for data centers in his 14-county corner of Virginia to nearly match the output of a nuclear power plant.
''It's shocking how much potential power is available,'' said Mr. Darton, who retired in August.
No national figures on environmental violations by data centers are available, but a check of several environmental districts suggests that the centers are beginning to catch the attention of regulators across the country.
Over the past five years in the Chicago area, for example, the Internet powerhouses Savvis and Equinix received violation notices, according to records from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Aside from Amazon, Northern Virginia officials have also cited data centers run by Qwest, Savvis, VeriSign and NTT America.
Despite all the precautions -- the enormous flow of electricity, the banks of batteries and the array of diesel generators -- data centers still crash.
Amazon, in particular, has had a series of failures in Northern Virginia over the last several years. One, in May 2010 at a facility in Chantilly, took businesses dependent on Amazon's cloud offline for what the company said was more than an hour -- an eternity in the data business.
Pinpointing the cause became its own information glitch.
Amazon announced that the failure ''was triggered when a vehicle crashed into a high-voltage utility pole on a road near one of our data centers.''
As it turns out, the car accident was mythical, a misunderstanding passed from a local utility lineman to a data center worker to Amazon headquarters. Instead, Amazon said that its backup gear mistakenly shut down part of the data center after what Dominion Virginia Power said was a short on an electrical pole that set off two momentary failures.
Mr. Herdener of Amazon said the backup system had been redesigned, and that ''we don't expect this condition to repeat.''
The Source of the Problem
Last year in the Northeast, a $1 billion feeder line for the national power grid went into operation, snaking roughly 215 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania, through the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia and terminating in Loudon County, Va.
The work was financed by millions of ordinary ratepayers. Steven R. Herling, a senior official at PJM Interconnection, a regional authority for the grid, said the need to feed the mushrooming data centers in Northern Virginia was the ''tipping point'' for the project in an otherwise down economy.
Data centers in the area now consume almost 500 million watts of electricity, said Jim Norvelle, a spokesman for Dominion Virginia Power, the major utility there. Dominion estimates that the load could rise to more than a billion watts over the next five years.
Data centers are among utilities' most prized customers. Many utilities around the country recruit the facilities for their almost unvarying round-the-clock loads. Large, steady consumption is profitable for utilities because it allows them to plan their own power purchases in advance and market their services at night, when demand by other customers plummets.
Mr. Bramfitt, the former utility executive, said he feared that this dynamic was encouraging a wasteful industry to cling to its pedal-to-the-metal habits. Even with all the energy and hardware pouring into the field, others believe it will be a challenge for current methods of storing and processing data to keep up with the digital tsunami.
Some industry experts believe a solution lies in the cloud: centralizing computing among large and well-operated data centers. Those data centers would rely heavily on a technology called virtualization, which in effect allows servers to merge their identities into large, flexible computing resources that can be doled out as needed to users, wherever they are.
One advocate of that approach is Mr. Koomey, the Stanford data center expert. But he said that many companies that try to manage their own data centers, either in-house or in rental spaces, are still unfamiliar with or distrustful of the new cloud technology. Unfortunately, those companies account for the great majority of energy usage by data centers, Mr. Koomey said.
Others express deep skepticism of the cloud, saying that the sometimes mystical-sounding belief in its possibilities is belied by the physicality of the infrastructure needed to support it.
Using the cloud ''just changes where the applications are running,'' said Hank Seader, managing principal for research and education at the Uptime Institute. ''It all goes to a data center somewhere.''
Some wonder if the very language of the Internet is a barrier to understanding how physical it is, and is likely to stay. Take, for example, the issue of storing data, said Randall H. Victora, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota who does research on magnetic storage devices.
''When somebody says, 'I'm gong to store something in the cloud, we don't need disk drives anymore' -- the cloud is disk drives,'' Mr. Victora said. ''We get them one way or another. We just don't know it.''
Whatever happens within the companies, it is clear that among consumers, what are now settled expectations largely drive the need for such a formidable infrastructure.
''That's what's driving that massive growth -- the end-user expectation of anything, anytime, anywhere,'' said David Cappuccio, a managing vice president and chief of research at Gartner, the technology research firm. ''We're what's causing the problem.''

HEADLINE: Washington Versus America

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
WHEN I moved to Washington, D.C., in 2002, you could sense that the nation's capital had turned a corner after decades of decline. But the Washington of 10 years ago still looked basically like the city that had been scarred by riots in the 1960s and then emptied by white flight, with a prosperous northwest divided from a blighted south and east, and frontiers of gentrification that weren't that many blocks from the Capitol itself.
No doubt there were boomtowns in the 19th-century Wild West that changed faster than D.C. did over the ensuing decade. But the changes to Washington have been staggering to watch. High-rises have leaped up, office buildings have risen, neighborhoods have been transformed. Streets once deserted after dusk are now crowded with restaurants and bars. A luxurious waterfront area is taking shape around the stadium that the playoff-bound Nationals call home. Million-dollar listings abound in neighborhoods that 10 years ago were transitional at best. 
And that's just inside the District proper. Cross the bridges into Virginia or shoot north into Maryland, and you'll find concentrations of wealth greater than in the richest counties around New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. Last week, new census data revealed that 7 of the 10 richest American counties in 2011 were in the Washington, D.C., region. Fairfax, Loudoun and Arlington Counties, all in Northern Virginia, have higher median incomes than every other county in the United States.
Whence comes this wealth? Mostly from Washington's one major industry: the federal government. Not from direct federal employment, which has risen only modestly of late, but from the growing armies of lobbyists and lawyers, contractors and consultants, who make their living advising and influencing and facilitating the public sector's work.
This growth is a bipartisan affair. It's been driven by the contracting-out of government services under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (as Andrew Ferguson put it in a wonderful Time magazine essay on the new Washington, ''government hasn't shrunk; it's just changed clothes''); by the Bush-era security buildup, whose ripples are spreading to this day (witness the new Department of Homeland Security facility intended for still-impoverished Anacostia); and by the bright young college graduates who flooded the city at the dawn of Barack Obama's presidency and the lobbyists who followed to claim a piece of his attempt at a new New Deal.
If you don't mind congested roads and insanely competitive child rearing, all this growth is good news for those of us inside the Beltway bubble. But is it good for America? After all, like the ruthless Capital in ''The Hunger Games,'' the wealth of Washington is ultimately extracted from taxpayers more than it is earned. And over the last five years especially, D.C.'s gains have coincided with the country's losses.
There aren't tributes from Michigan and New Mexico fighting to the death in Dupont Circle just yet. But it doesn't seem like a sign of national health that America's political capital is suddenly richer than our capitals of manufacturing and technology and finance, or that our leaders are more insulated than ever from the trends buffeting the people they're supposed to serve.
For Mitt Romney and the Republican Party, what's happened in Washington these last 10 years should be a natural part of the case against Obamanomics. Our gilded District is a case study in how federal spending often finds its way to the well connected rather than the people it's supposed to help, how every new program spawns an array of influence peddlers, and how easily corporations and government become corrupt allies rather than opponents.
The state of life inside the Beltway also points to the broader story of our spending problem, which has less to do with how much we spend on the poor than how much we lavish on subsidies for highly inefficient economic sectors, from health care to higher education, and on entitlements for people who aren't supposed to need a safety net -- affluent retirees, well-heeled homeowners, agribusiness owners, and so on.
There's a case that this president's policies have made these problems worse, sluicing more borrowed dollars into programs that need structural reform, and privileging favored industries and constituencies over the common good.
But this story is one that Romney and his party seem incapable of telling. Instead, many conservatives prefer to refight the welfare battles of the 1990s, and insist that our spending problem is all about an excess of ''dependency'' among the non-income-tax-paying 47 percent.
In reality, our government isn't running trillion-dollar deficits because we're letting the working class get away with not paying its fair share. We're running those deficits because too many powerful interest groups have a stake in making sure the party doesn't stop.
When you look around the richest precincts of today's Washington, you don't see a city running on paternalism or dependency. You see a city running on exploitation.

HEADLINE: Pamper 'Em or Lose 'Em? Not So Fast

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
CORPORATIONS are forever defending big executive paydays. If we don't pay up, the argument goes, our sharpest minds will jump to our rivals.
Now, there are good reasons for rewarding top executives. The decisions they make are so crucial to their companies that the priority should be to hire competent people rather than scrimp on pay.
But a study released last week pretty much drives a stake through that old ''pay 'em or lose 'em'' line -- what you might call the brain-drain defense. It also debunks the idea that companies must keep up with the Joneses by constantly comparing their executives' compensation with that of similar companies.
This peer-group benchmark -- how executive pay at one company stacks up against pay at another -- is a big driver of ever-rising compensation. Boards say it helps them set pay based on what the market will bear. 
Well, maybe not.
New research by Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, and Craig K. Ferrere, one of its Edgar S. Woolard fellows, begins by attacking this conventional wisdom. Mr. Elson and Mr. Ferrere conclude, contrary to the prevailing line, that chief executives can't readily transfer their skills from one company to another. In other words, the argument that C.E.O.'s will leave if they aren't compensated well, perhaps even lavishly, is bogus. Using the peer-group benchmark only pushes pay up and up.
''It's a false paradox,'' Mr. Elson said in an interview last week. ''The peer group is based on the theory of transferability of talent. But we found that C.E.O. skills are very firm-specific. C.E.O.'s don't move very often, but when they do, they're flops.''
Executive pay has come under scrutiny -- and criticism -- in recent years, in part because so many ordinary Americans are struggling in a difficult economy. Companies have pushed back, often pointing to the peer-group benchmark. But that benchmark has had a pronounced effect on pay levels across corporate America. As the Delaware study notes, one company's showering of rewards on its executives affects executive pay at every one of its peers.
In annual proxy statements, compensation committees of corporate boards tell shareholders which companies they placed in their peer groups and why. Last year, for example, I.B.M. said it began by including all companies in the technology industry with annual revenue of more than $15 billion. But it also added companies in other industries with revenue of at least $40 billion and ''a global complexity similar to I.B.M.,'' the company said. The result was that 28 companies were in the group, including AT&T, Ford and Pfizer.
Peer groups have come under attack periodically, especially when they appear to inflate pay.
In 2003, a firestorm erupted over the peer group chosen by the board of the New York Stock Exchange to compute a $140 million payday for Richard A. Grasso, its former chairman. Even though the Big Board was then a nonprofit organization, the board's peer group included highly profitable investment banks and huge financial institutions. Benchmarking against companies that are much larger and more complex has the effect of increasing pay, experts say.
But even when peer groups are compiled prudently, the Delaware study contends, they are deeply flawed measures. ''Whether the excess compensation is awarded for merit or otherwise,'' the authors wrote, ''a talented individual who is paid on a scale deserving of their abilities should not, through the peer group mechanism, be allowed to bolster the pay of less able executives.''
Importantly, the study disputes the notion that executive pay today is a result of an efficient bidding process for finding and retaining a scarce and valuable commodity: managerial talent. ''In essence, this process creates a model of a competitive market for executives where it otherwise does not exist,'' the authors wrote. ''Through the operation of a market, it is argued, wages are bid up to an executive's outside opportunities.''
But there is little evidence, according to Mr. Elson and Mr. Ferrere, that a hot market exists for interchangeable chief executives. First, they note numerous academic studies indicating that C.E.O.'s selected from within a company perform better than outsiders, especially in the creation of long-term shareholder value.
''There is no conclusive empirical evidence that outside succession leads to more favorable corporate performance, or even that good performance at one company can accurately predict success at another,'' the authors conclude. ''In short, executive skills cannot pass the most basic test of generality: transferability.''
TO be sure, this flies in the face of the widely held view that skilled managers have become generalists and are therefore far more interchangeable than in previous years. Proponents of this thesis argue that top managers today can accumulate a broad knowledge of economics, finance and management science, giving them the ability to manage any type of company effectively. Technological advancements also give chief executives access to untold amounts of data about a particular company that in previous times would have taken years to amass and synthesize, this view holds.
But the data on actual C.E.O. moves raises questions about just how portable C.E.O. skills really are. The Delaware paper cites several studies indicating that relatively few chief executives land new top jobs elsewhere. One study, a 2011 analysis of roughly 1,800 C.E.O. successions from 1993 to 2005, found that less than 2 percent had been public-company chief executives before their new jobs.
''It appears that the threat to go elsewhere is muted for a sitting C.E.O.,'' the authors concluded. ''Particularly for the large firms comprising the S.& P. 500, C.E.O.'s are rarely traded in any market for their talents.''
Nevertheless, the notion persists that chief executives and their skills are transferable -- and that they will walk if their pay doesn't keep rising.
This, Mr. Elson and Mr. Ferrere argue, has given rise to a new type of captured corporate director. ''Rather than being beholden to management and thus ineffective in negotiating pay because of a lack of arm's-length bargaining, boards are now often seen as captive to the market,'' the two wrote.
Because that market is largely based upon the questionable use of peer groups, the authors contend that those interested in changing executive pay practices should begin by junking these benchmarks. ''Instead,'' the authors said, ''the independent and shareholder-conscious compensation committee must develop internally consistent standards of pay based on the individual nature of the organization concerned, its particular competitive environment and its internal dynamics.''
Directors may not like the extra work. Shareholders should insist on it.
''Everyone wants a formula and peer grouping is part of that,'' said Jon Lukomnik, executive director at the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, which financed the Delaware study. ''We need objective measures but we also need to understand their limitations.''

HEADLINE: The Fans Are Irrelevant In the Business of the N.H.L.

BYLINE: By PAUL BROWNFIELD

 BODY:
The last time the N.H.L. and its team owners locked out the players, the Tampa Bay Lightning were the reigning Stanley Cup champions; this time around, it's the Los Angeles Kings.
It's fitting. The two franchises play in nontraditional hockey cities and have a rich history of losing money, dragged along by corporations that see the hockey team as a loss leader for bigger and better real estate investments (Kings) or as an example of Commissioner Gary Bettman's unwavering commitment to keeping the sport in failing United States markets (Lightning).
It is not that the owners of the Lightning and the Kings don't want to win; they do; they would just like more of a guarantee that they will have a shot at turning a profit, even in seasons when they don't make a run at the Stanley Cup. 
That is at the heart of what is an interesting philosophical as well as economic dispute between men taking risks in business and younger men ebulliently risking catastrophic head injuries nine months of the year. Where this leaves the fans is simple. They are largely irrelevant to the discussion, which helps explain why the league remains in places like Columbus, Ohio, and Sunrise, Fla.
A year ago, Bettman let the Atlanta Thrashers go to Winnipeg, Manitoba, but he has been holding the fort in Phoenix, where the money-losing Coyotes were bought out of bankruptcy by the N.H.L. in 2009. Apparently, they have since been losing tens of millions a season but have not failed enough yet. A tentative new arena lease agreement and ownership group are in place, led by Greg Jamison, the former chief executive of the San Jose Sharks.
The Sharks' current ownership, by the way, told The San Jose Mercury News recently that the team lost $15 million last season, despite selling out every home game. Nothing bothers fans more than to hear that their team, whose filled-to-capacity arena creates a raucous, hostile environment for opponents, is losing money despite their intense emotional involvement.
''We're a completely liquid organization and so far have continued to fund operations by choice,'' Kevin Compton, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who is a Sharks owner, assured the fans. ''This isn't Phoenix.''
Except that the viability of the league, metaphorically at least, is based on hockey working out in Phoenix. Yes, the Coyotes again. The day before the collective bargaining agreement expired, the Coyotes re-signed the free agent Shane Doan -- the heart and soul of the team, who started with the franchise when it was the old Winnipeg Jets -- to a four-year, $21.2 million contract.
Can they afford to pay that? Or can they afford not to?
In 2004-5, the owners wanted a salary cap to control escalating player salaries and create more parity on the ice. They got it, along with a larger share of hockey revenue. This time around, they want to reduce the players' percentage of revenue even more. It is said that apart from the elites (the Rangers, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs among them), more teams are awash in red ink than are turning a profit.
This seems serious, but there is no need to panic -- yet. After all, on the 10-month hockey calendar, only preseason games through Sept. 30 have been canceled.
But the ides of October loom, and one can become wistful thinking of the postgame clichés (''It's early, but we have to play more desperate'') that will not be uttered.
It is also worrisome that a number of the league's biggest stars, as they did during the 2004-5 lockout, have left to stay sharp playing with professional teams in places like Switzerland, Sweden and Russia, home of the high-paying Kontinental Hockey League.
The buttoned-down N.H.L. doesn't much care for the K.H.L.'s style of getting into the heads of young Russian stars and meddling with player development by dangling fat contract offers. So it was hard to miss the schadenfreude in the news release the K.H.L. issued this month, outlining the requirements for locked-out foreign players wanting to compete in Russia.
Job applicants, the K.H.L. said, would be considered if, for instance, they had ''experience as a Stanley Cup winner or finalist,'' or had won ''one of the individual prizes awarded by the N.H.L. at the close of their season.'' In other words, welcome home, Ilya Kovalchuk, Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk and Alex Ovechkin.
For all the N.H.L.'s discussion of economic viability and cost certainty, it's worth noting that neither the players nor the owners are saying much of anything about the biggest threat to the league's stability: concussions. This time a year ago, the N.H.L. was wondering if its biggest star, Sidney Crosby, would ever play again.
Then the season started with a raft of concussion-related injuries and player suspensions, as the league hoped to legislate head hits out of the game. Crosby, concussed during the 2010-11 season, returned last Nov. 21, scoring two goals against the Islanders, then reported more symptoms in December. He came back again for the playoffs in April.
Crosby's agent, Pat Brisson, conceded on a Toronto sports radio show last week that a factor in whether Crosby plays in Europe during a prolonged lockout is the issue of insuring his head. The notion neatly encapsulates where the situation stands: at money and headaches.

HEADLINE: Underdogged

BYLINE: By JILL LEPORE. 
A history professor at Harvard, staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of the forthcoming book ''The Story of America.''

 BODY:
''I DEFINITELY think Mitt goes in as an underdog,'' Ann Romney said in a television interview earlier this month. Mr. Romney's campaign happens to be imploding at the moment, but his supporters have been calling him an underdog since the primaries. In February, Mr. Romney said he was the underdog in Michigan, his home state. In June, Gov. Scott Walker said Mr. Romney was the underdog in Wisconsin. Sometimes, being just any old underdog isn't enough. ''He's the tremendous underdog,'' said a Republican committeeman in New Hampshire.
In August, the Republican nominee was somehow the underdog at his own nominating convention. ''Romney entered the G.O.P. convention the underdog and left the convention the underdog,'' as one blogger put it. Mr. Romney said it best: ''It's always a good thing to be seen as the underdog.'' 
The word ''underdog'' is an Americanism. I went into the archives to sniff out these sous-chiens. The expression dates from at least 1859, and a widely printed poem, ''The Under Dog in the Fight.'' The underdog is the cur who's been bitten and trampled and who, at the end of the fight, lies bloodied and beaten. Sympathy for the underdog meant sympathy for the downtrodden. (''For my heart will beat, while it beats at all,/For the under dog in the fight.'')
The term became common during Reconstruction. In a Harriet Beecher Stowe novel published in 1871, one character says about another that he always ''goes for the under dog: he is always ready to help the poor.'' In 1879, a New York newspaper reported on a speech written by Frederick Douglass. ''Besides occasional outbreaks of violence and bloodshed, the negro has been the 'under dog,' and treated as such,'' the story reads, summarizing Douglass's remarks. ''Only a few years ago the negroes were bought and sold like cattle, and flogged and outraged, and sometimes murdered.'' To be an underdog was to be treated like an animal.
Not long after that, underdogs entered politics. During the presidential election of 1884, supporters of James G. Blaine, who was defeated by Grover Cleveland, were referred to as ''under-dogs.'' But, more usually, underdogs weren't the losers in political contests; they were the working poor. In 1912, in Congressional hearings on industrial relations, labor representatives referred to themselves as ''we, the underdogs.'' One told Congress that if a longshoreman was injured at work and went to a hospital, he'd be left untreated, ''dirty and dusty... the last sort of person they want in the hospital'' because he's ''the underdog.''
In the 1940s, social scientists used the word ''underdog'' as shorthand for ''socially and economically underprivileged Americans.'' A subject of great fascination, at the time, was that Americans tended to have a lot of sympathy for underdogs. (That sympathy is why we fight for equality.) This got political consultants thinking: what if we sold our candidates as underdogs? By 1954, the political scientist Herbert A. Simon had coined the phrase ''the underdog effect,'' to describe how doing badly in early polls can be a boon because American voters sometimes sympathize with losers.
IN 1963, Howard Schuman at Harvard and John Harding at Cornell published an article called ''Sympathetic Identification with the Underdog.'' They defined an underdog as an ''ethnic minority facing discrimination.'' They conducted an experiment on a sociology class in a northern college, two summer school classes at a college in the South, the white students in a class at Harvard on race relations, and a group of adults from Boston. They asked questions like this:
A colored man born in New England goes South for the first time and sees in a Mississippi bus station two waiting rooms, one for colored and one for whites. How do you think he would be likely to react to this?
(a) He probably thinks it is a good thing at present, since it prevents trouble from arising.
(b) He may notice it at first, but after a while he probably gets used to it and it doesn't make much difference to him.
(c) He very likely feels hurt by it, and perhaps angry.
(d) It is hard to know exactly how he would react to such a situation, though with more information one might be able to tell.
One of their more interesting findings was that the people who were most sympathetic with underdogs were sympathetic with top dogs, too. Sympathy is sympathy. A white middle-aged Boston housewife who, answering a different question, expressed concern about how the people sitting on the back of a bus must feel, added that she was also worried about the people on the front of the bus, mainly because she found it so hard to put herself in their shoes. She said, ''I think it's probably hard for us here to understand how the white people there feel about it.''
''Underdog,'' an animated television show that started in 1964, featured a beagle whose mission was to protect the poor and helpless from ''those whose hearts are filled with greed.'' An early idea for the series called him Downtrodden Man.
Mitt Romney is no Downtrodden Man. In May, at a fund-raiser in Florida, Mr. Romney expressed contempt for the ''47 percent'' of Americans who, he said, ''believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.'' This is not a man who loves underdogs.
When Mr. Romney says he's an underdog, that's not humility: that's branding. Last year, a team of scholars that included Harvard's Neeru Paharia and Anat Keinan published a study called ''The Underdog Effect: The Marketing of Disadvantage and Determination through Brand Biography.'' They defined ''underdog brand biography'' as ''an emerging trend in branding in which firms author a historical account of their humble origins, lack of resources, and determined struggle against the odds.'' Their research, they say, demonstrates that telling a story about yourself in which you are an underdog builds brand loyalty, especially in cultures where ''underdog narratives are part of the national identity.'' Pretending to be an underdog is good business.
Mr. Romney's branding himself an underdog to earn voter sympathy might not be the weirdest feature of his topsy-turvy campaign. It's not even the most ruthless. But it is one of the saddest.

HEADLINE: Help for the Underemployed

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
ONE of the best ways for homeowners to cut costs is to refinance their mortgage, but qualifying for a new loan that would lower monthly payments can be difficult for those who are underemployed.
Besides earning less than they did in a previous job, these homeowners often have accumulated debt, and if they are living in an area where home values are depressed, they have the added burden of watching their home equity shrink. Both factors can adversely affect their ability to qualify for a refinancing.
Last month, eight million people worked part time involuntarily because their hours had been cut back or they couldn't find full-time work, according to a recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported separately that of those who did find full-time work, one in five earned at least 20 percent less. 
The ''grave'' condition of the job market led the Federal Reserve to announce recently that it would institute an economic stimulus plan in which each month it will buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
Underemployed homeowners ''want to refinance to make the mortgage more affordable,'' said Martha Cedeno-Ross, a counselor with Neighborhood Housing Services in Waterbury, Conn., adding that many cannot meet lenders' required debt-to-income ratios, because ''they have so much credit-card debt or other liabilities.''
Total debts, including the mortgage and all other bills, usually cannot exceed 45 percent of total income, industry experts say.
Adding on a second part-time job just before beginning the application process won't necessarily improve their situation, said Cari Sweet-Kristopolis, an assistant vice president of the Jersey Mortgage Corporation in Parsippany, because guidelines of government-sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require borrowers to have held their second jobs for at least 12 months, and ideally 24, before refinancing or obtaining a home loan.
But, ''being at your desk a year and getting a raise, absolutely it will help you,'' Ms. Sweet-Kristopolis said.
What will also help is a change in the family income -- say a spouse has found a higher-paying job or was promoted, or you inherited an annuity or another source of steady income. (Short-term sources like disability payments usually will not be counted in the income tally.)
Mrs. Cedeno-Ross suggests that homeowners pay down their credit-card balances before applying to refinance and also that they seek the help of a housing counselor approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Two federal programs that could be useful for refinancing are the HARP, or Home Affordable Refinance Program, which is intended to help financially troubled borrowers stay in their homes, and the Federal Housing Authority Streamlined Refinancing, which is available to people who have their loans through the Federal Housing Administration.
HARP was created to simplify refinancing and place homeowners in loans with less onerous terms; it generally focuses more on a borrower's repayment history than income.
Some states, like Connecticut, also offer home refinancing programs for homeowners who are ''underwater,'' or owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.
''Some banks offer their own internal streamlining as well,'' Mrs. Cedeno-Ross said.
She suggested that homeowners with financial problems keep their lenders abreast of their job situation.
They could also ask for a loan modification, which typically would lower the interest rate and may allow for any overdue payments to be added onto the loan's balance, Mrs. Cedeno-Ross said.
''Know your options, understand your options,'' she said, ''then know what is going to be best for you.''

HEADLINE: Failed Efforts and Challenges Of America's Last Months in Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON. 
This article is adapted from ''The Endgame: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Iraq, from George W. Bush to , Barack Obama,'' by Michael R. Gordon and retired Lt. Gen. Bernard E. Trainor, to be published by Pantheon Books, an imprint of Random House, on Tuesday.

 BODY:
The request was an unusual one, and President Obama himself made the confidential phone call to Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president.
Marshaling his best skills at persuasion, Mr. Obama asked Mr. Talabani, a consummate political survivor, to give up his post. It was Nov. 4, 2010, and the plan was for Ayad Allawi to take Mr. Talabani's place.
With Mr. Allawi, a secular Shiite and the leader of a bloc with broad Sunni support, the Obama administration calculated, Iraq would have a more inclusive government and would check the worrisome drift toward authoritarianism under Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.
But Mr. Obama did not make the sale. 
''They were afraid what would happen if the different groups of Iraq did not reach an agreement,'' recalled Mr. Talabani, who turned down the request.
Mr. Obama has pointed to the American troop withdrawal last year as proof that he has fulfilled his promise to end the Iraq war. Winding down a conflict, however, entails far more than extracting troops.
In the case of Iraq, the American goal has been to leave a stable and representative government, avoid a power vacuum that neighboring states and terrorists could exploit and maintain sufficient influence so that Iraq would be a partner or, at a minimum, not an opponent in the Middle East.
But the Obama administration has fallen frustratingly short of some of those objectives.
The attempt by Mr. Obama and his senior aides to fashion an extraordinary power-sharing arrangement between Mr. Maliki and Mr. Allawi never materialized. Neither did an agreement that would have kept a small American force in Iraq to train the Iraqi military and patrol the country's skies. A plan to use American civilians to train the Iraqi police has been severely cut back. The result is an Iraq that is less stable domestically and less reliable internationally than the United States had envisioned.
The story of these efforts has received little attention in a nation weary of the conflict in Iraq, and administration officials have rarely talked about them. This account is based on interviews with many of the principals, in Washington and Baghdad.
White House officials portray their exit strategy as a success, asserting that the number of civilian fatalities in Iraq is low compared with 2006, when the war was at its height. Politics, not violence, has become the principal means for Iraqis to resolve their differences, they say. ''Recent news coverage of Iraq would suggest that as our troops departed, American influence went with them and our administration shifted its focus away from Iraq,'' Antony Blinken, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said in a speech in March. ''The fact is, our engagements have increased.''
To many Iraqis, the United States' influence is greatly diminished. ''American policy is very weak,'' observed Fuad Hussein, the chief of staff to Massoud Barzani, the president of the semiautonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. ''It is not clear to us how they have defined their interests in Iraq,'' Mr. Hussein said. ''They are picking events and reacting on the basis of events. That is the policy.''
Campaign vs. Reality
As a presidential candidate in 2008, Mr. Obama had one basic position on Iraq -- he was going to bring a ''responsible end'' to the conflict. He vowed to remove all American combat brigades within 16 months, a deadline that enabled him to outflank his main rival in the Democratic primary, Hillary Rodham Clinton, but which the military said was too risky. Once in office, he adjusted the withdrawal schedule, keeping American brigades in place longer but making their primary mission to advise Iraqi forces.
All American forces were to leave Iraq by the end of 2011, the departure date set in an agreement signed by President George W. Bush and Mr. Maliki in 2008. Even so, Mr. Obama left the door open to keeping troops in Iraq to train Iraqi forces if an agreement could be negotiated.
The situation the Obama administration inherited was complex. Many Iraqi politicians were worried that Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, was amassing too much power and overstepping the Iraqi constitution by bypassing the formal military chain of command and seeding intelligence agencies with loyalists. Those concerns were aggravated by the political gridlock that plagued Baghdad after the March 2010 elections.
Convening a videoconference on Oct. 6, 2010, Mr. Biden and top American officials reviewed the options. The vice president favored a plan that would keep Mr. Maliki as prime minister, but which involved installing his main rival, Mr. Allawi, leader of the Iraqiya bloc, near the top of the pyramid. To make way for Mr. Allawi, Mr. Biden suggested that Mr. Talabani, an ethnic Kurd, be shifted from the presidency and given another position. ''Let's make him foreign minister,'' Mr. Biden said, according to the notes of the meeting.
''Thanks a lot, Joe,'' Mrs. Clinton said, noting that Mr. Biden had cast the Foreign Ministry as a consolation prize.
Mr. Biden also predicted that the Americans could work out a deal with a government led by Mr. Maliki. ''Maliki wants us to stick around because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I'll bet you my vice presidency Maliki will extend the SOFA,'' he added, referring to the Status of Forces Agreement the Obama administration hoped to negotiate.
James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, questioned whether Mr. Biden's plan would make the already inefficient Iraqi government more dysfunctional, and suggested an alternative to Mr. Maliki: Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shiite and former finance minister. A quiet American effort to explore this option was made, but Iran opposed it and, thus, so did hard-line Shiite figures. Concerned about the need to seat an Iraqi government, Mr. Obama decided to accept Mr. Maliki as prime minister while pursuing a deal that would bring Mr. Allawi and other members of his Iraqiya bloc into the fold.
But engineering a power-sharing arrangement was not easy. After Mr. Talabani rebuffed Mr. Obama's request, the White House decided to go around him.
In a letter to Mr. Barzani, Mr. Obama again argued that Mr. Talabani should give up the presidency and noted the help the United States would continue to provide to the Kurds. But Mr. Barzani rejected the proposal, complaining that he was being asked to solve a problem between Shiite and Sunni Arabs at the expense of the Kurds.
The Americans had a fallback position: a new council on strategic policy would be established, with Mr. Allawi in charge. But Mr. Maliki and Mr. Allawi wrangled over what powers the new council would have, and it was never formed. Some members of Mr. Allawi's party secured prominent government posts. But the most important feature the White House had pressed for in a power-sharing arrangement existed only on paper. The White House, a spokeswoman said, had not been ''wedded'' to any specific option and had achieved an ''inclusive government.''
Internal Debates
As the process of forming a new Iraqi government dragged on, the Obama administration began in January 2011 to turn its attention to negotiating an agreement that would enable American forces to stay beyond 2011.
The first talks the Americans had were among themselves. Pentagon officials had gotten an earful from Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, which were worried that the United States was pulling back from the region. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates favored leaving 16,000 troops to train the Iraqi forces, prepare them to carry out counterterrorism missions, protect Iraqi airspace, tamp down Arab and Kurdish tensions and to maintain American influence.
But the White House, which was wary of big military missions and also looking toward Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, had a lower number in mind. At a meeting on April 29, Thomas E. Donilon, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, asked Mr. Gates whether he could accept up to 10,000 troops. Mr. Gates agreed.
Concerned that decisions were being made without careful consideration of all the military factors, Admiral Mullen sent a classified letter to Mr. Donilon that recommended keeping 16,000 troops. ''In light of the risks noted above and the opportunities that might emerge, that is my best military advice to the president,'' he wrote. He added that the recommendation was supported by Gen. Lloyd Austin, the American commander in Iraq, and Gen. James N. Mattis, head of Central Command, which has responsibility for the Middle East.
Admiral Mullen's letter arrived with a thud at the White House. An angry Mr. Donilon complained about it in a phone call to Michèle A. Flournoy, the under secretary of defense for policy. But she responded that Admiral Mullen had a professional responsibility to provide his independent advice. She did not see her role as ensuring that only politically acceptable advice was provided to the White House. Mr. Donilon declined to be interviewed, and his spokesman insisted that his discussions with the Pentagon concerned military issues, not politics.
Mr. Obama overruled Admiral Mullen, setting the stage for the negotiations over the troops.
Another Obstacle
In a June 2 videoconference with Mr. Maliki, the president emphasized that any agreement would need to be ratified by the Iraqi Parliament. But not everybody in the American camp agreed with this stipulation.
Brett H. McGurk, a former Bush administration aide whom the Obama administration had asked to return to Baghdad to help with the talks, thought that a bruising parliamentary battle could be avoided by working out an understanding under an existing umbrella agreement on economic and security cooperation -- an approach Mr. Maliki himself suggested several times. But the White House wanted airtight immunities for any troops staying in Iraq, which American government lawyers, the Iraqi chief justice and James F. Jeffrey, the American ambassador in Baghdad, insisted would require a new agreement that was endorsed by the Iraqi Parliament.
The negotiations were complicated by the Americans' failure to broker a power-sharing arrangement. With Iraqi leaders jockeying for influence and Mr. Allawi still out of the government, neither Mr. Maliki nor his rival wanted to stick his neck out by supporting a continuing American military presence, no matter how small.
The White House, meanwhile, wanted to avoid any perception that it was chasing after a deal to keep troops in Iraq after promising that combat forces would be brought home. By August, White House aides were pressing to scale back the mission and to reopen the issue of how many troops might be needed.
Mrs. Clinton and Leon E. Panetta, who succeeded Mr. Gates as the defense secretary, argued that talks should continue and that the goal, as before, should be to keep a force of up to 10,000.
On Aug. 13, Mr. Obama settled the matter in a conference call in which he ruled out the 10,000 troop option and a smaller 7,000 variant. The talks would proceed but the size of the force the United States might keep was shrunk: the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16's.
But there was no agreement. Some experts say that given the Iraqis' concerns about sovereignty, and Iranian pressure, the politicians in Baghdad were simply not prepared to make the hard decisions that were needed to secure parliamentary approval. Others say the Iraqis sensed the Americans' ambivalence and were being asked to make unpopular political decisions for a modest military benefit.
Ending the Effort
On Oct. 21, Mr. Obama held another videoconference with Mr. Maliki -- his first such discussion since the talks began in June. The negotiations were over, and all of the American troops would be coming home.
The White House insisted that the collapse of the talks was not a setback. ''As we reviewed the 10,000 option, we came to the conclusion that achieving the goal of a security partnership was not dependent on the size of our footprint in-country, and that stability in Iraq did not depend on the presence of U.S. forces,'' a senior Obama administration said.
It is too soon to fully assess that prediction. But tensions have increased to the point that Mr. Barzani has insisted Mr. Maliki be replaced and Iraq's lone Sunni vice president has fled to Turkey to avoid arrest.
Without American forces to train and assist Iraqi commandos, the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Iraq is still active in Iraq and is increasingly involved in Syria. With no American aircraft to patrol Iraqi airspace, Iraq has become a corridor for Iranian flights of military supplies to Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, American officials say. It is also a potential avenue for an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear installations, something the White House is laboring to avoid.
Ryan C. Crocker, the former ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan, offered his own perspective on the last tortured negotiations in the country where American troops fought for more than eight years. ''I don't think either government handled it as well as it could have been handled,'' he said. ''The U.S. side came to it late. You have got to leave a lot of latitude for difficulties, foreseen and unforeseen. On the Iraqi side, they should have said, 'If you want this don't try to determine our own procedures.' ''

We are losing the real lesson in Ohio -- no one man and no one policy is going to make the dif erence. Columbus has always been a bit recession-proof, but the real leadership comes from the bipartisan work of the Republican business leaders and the Democratic city and county government of cials. Let's stop the divide and conquer. We are all in peril if we continue this path. SALLY LUKEN, Columbus, Ohio 
Gov. John R. Kasich is being very unwise when he states: ''I don't care what the reason is. I don't care if it's because of some little green man on Mars. When people are working, families are stronger, children are healthier and families are better.'' All governors should show interest in the welfare of their citizens, but without understanding the reasons for economic growth, you cannot stimulate growth when the economy is down. His JobsOhio initiative could be very productive, but if it is just a matter of persuading companies to move to Ohio, he is taking jobs from another state. He needs to think about how jobs are created, not how jobs are stolen.

In 2008, there was a real fear that what happened to Pittsburgh and Youngstown in the late 1970s with the collapse of the steel industry would happen to Toledo and many small cities in the region if G.M. failed. For Northwest Ohio, the bailout kept the economy af oat. Manufacturing remains central to Ohio's economy, but that sector cannot continue to reliably employ Ohioans in large numbers. As a result, few people move to Ohio, which has one of the most ''native'' populations in the country. Without fresh blood, the state will languish.
CHRISTOPHER FREY, Toledo, Ohio, posted on nytimes.com
Do citizens understand their tax dollars are paying corporations, which are sitting on massive prof ts due to high worker productivity and low wages, to remain in their cities? Isn't this corporate welfare? How do people square it with their ''government is bad, private industry is good'' beliefs? These are the same corporations that are lobbying Congress to lower the corporate tax rate, which they don't pay anyway.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Sleep

BYLINE: By DAVID K. RANDALL. 
A senior reporter at Reuters and the author of ''Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep.''

 BODY:
SOMETIME in the dark stretch of the night it happens. Perhaps it's the chime of an incoming text message. Or your iPhone screen lights up to alert you to a new e-mail. Or you find yourself staring at the ceiling, replaying the day in your head. Next thing you know, you're out of bed and engaged with the world, once again ignoring the often quoted fact that eight straight hours of sleep is essential.
Sound familiar? You're not alone. Thanks in part to technology and its constant pinging and chiming, roughly 41 million people in the United States -- nearly a third of all working adults -- get six hours or fewer of sleep a night, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And sleep deprivation is an affliction that crosses economic lines. About 42 percent of workers in the mining industry are sleep-deprived, while about 27 percent of financial or insurance industry workers share the same complaint. 
Typically, mention of our ever increasing sleeplessness is followed by calls for earlier bedtimes and a longer night's sleep. But this directive may be part of the problem. Rather than helping us to get more rest, the tyranny of the eight-hour block reinforces a narrow conception of sleep and how we should approach it. Some of the time we spend tossing and turning may even result from misconceptions about sleep and our bodily needs: in fact neither our bodies nor our brains are built for the roughly one-third of our lives that we spend in bed.
The idea that we should sleep in eight-hour chunks is relatively recent. The world's population sleeps in various and surprising ways. Millions of Chinese workers continue to put their heads on their desks for a nap of an hour or so after lunch, for example, and daytime napping is common from India to Spain.
One of the first signs that the emphasis on a straight eight-hour sleep had outlived its usefulness arose in the early 1990s, thanks to a history professor at Virginia Tech named A. Roger Ekirch, who spent hours investigating the history of the night and began to notice strange references to sleep. A character in the ''Canterbury Tales,'' for instance, decides to go back to bed after her ''firste sleep.'' A doctor in England wrote that the time between the ''first sleep'' and the ''second sleep'' was the best time for study and reflection. And one 16th-century French physician concluded that laborers were able to conceive more children because they waited until after their ''first sleep'' to make love. Professor Ekirch soon learned that he wasn't the only one who was on to the historical existence of alternate sleep cycles. In a fluke of history, Thomas A. Wehr, a psychiatrist then working at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., was conducting an experiment in which subjects were deprived of artificial light. Without the illumination and distraction from light bulbs, televisions or computers, the subjects slept through the night, at least at first. But, after a while, Dr. Wehr noticed that subjects began to wake up a little after midnight, lie awake for a couple of hours, and then drift back to sleep again, in the same pattern of segmented sleep that Professor Ekirch saw referenced in historical records and early works of literature.
It seemed that, given a chance to be free of modern life, the body would naturally settle into a split sleep schedule. Subjects grew to like experiencing nighttime in a new way. Once they broke their conception of what form sleep should come in, they looked forward to the time in the middle of the night as a chance for deep thinking of all kinds, whether in the form of self-reflection, getting a jump on the next day or amorous activity. Most of us, however, do not treat middle-of-the-night awakenings as a sign of a normal, functioning brain.
Doctors who peddle sleep aid products and call for more sleep may unintentionally reinforce the idea that there is something wrong or off-kilter about interrupted sleep cycles. Sleep anxiety is a common result: we know we should be getting a good night's rest but imagine we are doing something wrong if we awaken in the middle of the night. Related worries turn many of us into insomniacs and incite many to reach for sleeping pills or sleep aids, which reinforces a cycle that the Harvard psychologist Daniel M. Wegner has called ''the ironic processes of mental control.''
As we lie in our beds thinking about the sleep we're not getting, we diminish the chances of enjoying a peaceful night's rest.
This, despite the fact that a number of recent studies suggest that any deep sleep -- whether in an eight-hour block or a 30-minute nap -- primes our brains to function at a higher level, letting us come up with better ideas, find solutions to puzzles more quickly, identify patterns faster and recall information more accurately. In a NASA-financed study, for example, a team of researchers led by David F. Dinges, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, found that letting subjects nap for as little as 24 minutes improved their cognitive performance.
In another study conducted by Simon Durrant, a professor at the University of Lincoln, in England, the amount of time a subject spent in deep sleep during a nap predicted his or her later performance at recalling a short burst of melodic tones. And researchers at the City University of New York found that short naps helped subjects identify more literal and figurative connections between objects than those who simply stayed awake.
Robert Stickgold, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, proposes that sleep -- including short naps that include deep sleep -- offers our brains the chance to decide what new information to keep and what to toss. That could be one reason our dreams are laden with strange plots and characters, a result of the brain's trying to find connections between what it's recently learned and what is stored in our long-term memory. Rapid eye movement sleep -- so named because researchers who discovered this sleep stage were astonished to see the fluttering eyelids of sleeping subjects -- is the only phase of sleep during which the brain is as active as it is when we are fully conscious, and seems to offer our brains the best chance to come up with new ideas and hone recently acquired skills. When we awaken, our minds are often better able to make connections that were hidden in the jumble of information.
Gradual acceptance of the notion that sequential sleep hours are not essential for high-level job performance has led to increased workplace tolerance for napping and other alternate daily schedules.
Employees at Google, for instance, are offered the chance to nap at work because the company believes it may increase productivity. Thomas Balkin, the head of the department of behavioral biology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, imagines a near future in which military commanders can know how much total sleep an individual soldier has had over a 24-hour time frame thanks to wristwatch-size sleep monitors. After consulting computer models that predict how decision-making abilities decline with fatigue, a soldier could then be ordered to take a nap to prepare for an approaching mission. The cognitive benefit of a nap could last anywhere from one to three hours, depending on what stage of sleep a person reaches before awakening.
Most of us are not fortunate enough to work in office environments that permit, much less smile upon, on-the-job napping. But there are increasing suggestions that greater tolerance for altered sleep schedules might be in our collective interest. Researchers have observed, for example, that long-haul pilots who sleep during flights perform better when maneuvering aircraft through the critical stages of descent and landing.
Several Major League Baseball teams have adapted to the demands of a long season by changing their sleep patterns. Fernando Montes, the former strength and conditioning coach for the Texas Rangers, counseled his players to fall asleep with the curtains in their hotel rooms open so that they would naturally wake up at sunrise no matter what time zone they were in -- even if it meant cutting into an eight-hour sleeping block. Once they arrived at the ballpark, Montes would set up a quiet area where they could sleep before the game. Players said that, thanks to this schedule, they felt great both physically and mentally over the long haul.
Strategic napping in the Rangers style could benefit us all. No one argues that sleep is not essential. But freeing ourselves from needlessly rigid and quite possibly outdated ideas about what constitutes a good night's sleep might help put many of us to rest, in a healthy and productive, if not eight-hour long, block.

HEADLINE: Tijuana Rebuilds on Its Art

BYLINE: By SAM LUBELL

 BODY:
ANY city whose most widely known symbol is a painted donkey is used to being the butt of jokes. But Tijuana, often derided as a lowbrow center of debauchery and more recently as a hub of drug-related violence, is transforming itself through something that has quietly always been a strong suit: culture.
Sure, Tijuana's seedy side still exists. But its faltering economy has slowly recovered, and the violence that plagued the city has sharply receded. In its place, a thriving cultural community that already encompassed a major Mexican institution, the Centro Cultural Tijuana, as well as music, dance and visual arts groups, has expanded. In this chaotic, messy, visceral place, the resurgence has been from the ground up, and art has landed in unexpected places. 
''There is the feeling that the city has retaken itself,'' said Teddy Cruz, an architect and professor at the University of California, San Diego, whose work has examined Tijuana. ''There's a kind of a vibrancy that is really unique in recent times. There's something about the city taking back its spaces.''
One example of the sort of urban reclamation afoot is La Caja Galería (Callejón de las Moras 118B; 52-664-686-6791), a space in the 20 de Noviembre neighborhood -- a dusty mix of big industrial buildings and small houses. The gallery, designed by a local architect, Jorge Gracia, opened here two years ago in an old paint warehouse. Its exterior is covered in an explosion of graffiti painted by street artists from Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Oaxaca, Mexico City and Tijuana. Inside, steel floors made from recycled shipping containers are warmed by wood salvaged from the Port of San Pedro in Los Angeles. La Caja features a lineup of well-known local and international artists, is home to an art school, and hosts dinners in which guests are blindfolded and exposed to sensations related to the exhibits.
Just a few minutes away in the emerging Colonia Federal neighborhood is the Casa del Túnel (Calle Chapo Márquez 133; 52-664-682-9570), a gallery in a long, raised house along the border that once contained a tunnel leading to the United States used by smugglers. (People and items would surface in California into a car with a hole in the bottom.) The gallery hosts exhibitions by local artists. Its permanent collection includes a bullet-riddled car found in the desert by the artist Charles Linder, now displayed out front. There are occasional events and parties on the center's roof, which provides a view of the border's steel fences and barbed wire about 20 feet away. The Casa is 20 years old, but the city's turnaround spurred the opening last year of an arts collective called Mariposa (Spanish for butterfly) across the street, with studios inside a former motel that was a base for people-smuggling ''coyotes.''
The city's true new cultural nexus is the Avenida Revolución, long known among Americans as a center for tequila binges and questionable variety shows. At its heart are remade pasajes, half-century-old covered arcades that until recently were run-down afterthoughts selling the usual cheapie standbys and pharmaceuticals. The most successful is Pasaje Gómez, a collection of colorful buildings covered with tiles and topped with a plastic roof. Since it opened a year and a half ago, it has rented out 60 spaces to tenants including cutting-edge art galleries like La Tentación, which came from San Diego. The pasaje also contains bookstores, cafes and crafts booths selling locally produced paintings, metalwork, T-shirts and cupcakes. It recently hosted its first art walk, a packed affair that its owners, Miguel Buenrostro and Jaime Brambila, plan to hold monthly.
''Tijuana has this cliché of living by American rules and supplying things that Americans want,'' Mr. Buenrostro said. ''We're not American, we're Mexican. We need to have our own things.'' The Pasaje Rodríguez across the street is not as packed, but it does contain several interesting galleries and stores.
Cecilia Novano, who owns the four-year-old District 10 Gallery near the city's former racetrack (now a casino), said the pasajes have energized the city. ''It's a new moment,'' she said. ''It's building. I think people are starting to believe in art. I think people are starting to believe in Tijuana.''

HEADLINE: Lady Liberty, Inspiring Even in Pieces

BYLINE: By HILARIE M. SHEETS

 BODY:
OVER the past two years Danh Vo has been recasting a life-size Statue of Liberty from 30 tons of copper sheets the width of just two pennies -- same as the original. Rather than assemble the hundreds of sections, Mr. Vo has shipped the giant elements -- disorienting in their gleaming raw material and fragmentation -- to some 15 sites around the world after they roll off the production line in China. Starting Sunday an ear, some hair, part of a heel and portions of drapery will be on view at the Art Institute of Chicago while more pieces that echo both minimalist sculptures and remnants from antiquity are scattered around the campus of the University of Chicago.
''If you engage in building a monumental thing, you should also be able to treat it as water,'' said Mr. Vo, who referred to his re-creation, titled ''We the People,'' as both a monster and a virus that can move fluidly and mutate as it is shuffled to new places. He said he hopes that after production is finished this fall, every piece will be visible somewhere at a certain moment. 
This 37-year-old conceptual artist, who grew up in Copenhagen after his family fled Vietnam by boat in 1979 and was rescued by a Danish freighter, had never actually seen the statue when he began. But he was hooked by the discovery that its shell was so thin. ''It's such a strong icon, tracing back to so many histories, and then just discovering the fragility of it,'' said Mr. Vo, a finalist for the Guggenheim's Hugo Boss Prize this year. ''I thought it would be interesting to make something that people felt so familiar with, in all the different ways that people project on the sculpture, and try to destabilize your own thinking of it.''
Resistant to assigning specific meaning to such a potent symbol of freedom, Mr. Vo prefers instead to talk about the logistics and economics of his project. Yet interpretation is unavoidable for Susanne Ghez, director of the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, who organized a gallery exhibition of Mr. Vo's work titled ''Uterus,'' also opening Sunday, as well as the campus installation of ''We the People.''
''It raises the question of democratization in the U.S. and our history of imperialism,'' she said. ''Are the elements spreading this democratization or is the comment more skeptical, that it's in tatters today?''
Lisa Dorin, an associate curator at the Art Institute who collaborated with Ms. Ghez on bringing ''We the People'' to Chicago, added: ''Danh has a beautiful way of finding issues that are important in a global sense and weaving in his own biography. It kind of sneaks in there and gives you something that you're not expecting.''
The fabrication involved in ''We the People'' is unusual for Mr. Vo. More typically he collects culturally loaded ready-made objects through eBay, estate sales, travel and negotiation. These include the typewriter on which Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, composed his manifesto in 1995. Mr. Vo juxtaposed it with the 1945 wedding announcement of the future parents of President George W. Bush.
''I think of it as the range of what we can claim as freedom,'' said Mr. Vo, who placed these objects on top of a stack of raw copper sheets to introduce the first exhibition of ''We the People'' at Kunsthalle Fridericianum in Kassel, Germany, last November.
Mr. Vo has been based in Berlin since 2005, after finishing school in Frankfurt, where he went after quitting painting at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen. He touched down briefly last month for an interview at a sparse studio apartment he keeps in New York, after traveling in the footsteps of Caravaggio in Italy and before heading to Mexico, California, Vancouver and finally Chicago for the installation of his shows.
Mr. Vo, who has a way of being open and elliptical at the same time, says it suits him temperamentally to move unencumbered from place to place. ''The way you live your life, that's the cradle of the works you're producing and the thinking as well,'' he said. Often the information or material he acquires along the way becomes the basis of artworks.
One example is a set of letters now on view at the Renaissance Society, written by Henry A. Kissinger when he was secretary of state in the 1970s to the newspaper columnist Leonard Lyons, which Mr. Vo bought at auction. ''All the letters are about thanking Leonard for tickets he would provide for Kissinger,'' said Mr. Vo. ''In one he writes he's sorry he couldn't attend this ballet, but Leonard must understand that if he was allowed, he would prefer that anytime over contemplating Cambodia.
''That's a quite wild thing as a letter. He was conducting this secret war and bombing of Cambodia.''
Mr. Vo built a tunnel-like space, with the letters embedded in the walls in vitrines, that viewers pass through to enter the exhibition. ''The information is just there.''
''Danh is an excellent poker player, very unsentimental in his approach to the game,'' said Michael Elmgreen, half of the collaborative Elmgreen & Dragset, who became friends with Mr. Vo in Berlin. ''Historical facts as well as the present reality or even personal context are his instruments, the cards in his hand, and the rules of the game are set by the art world itself.''
Mr. Vo discovered another letter, a beautiful farewell written to his father by a French missionary working in Asia on the eve of his execution, one of many killings that precipitated the French colonization of Vietnam in the mid-19th century. Mr. Vo asked his own father, Phung Vo, a Roman Catholic who ran small food businesses for 30 years in his transplanted home of Denmark, to rewrite the French letter in his exceptional penmanship. ''It activated something he was very good at but that he never used,'' said Mr. Vo, who asked his father to send an original transcription of the letter to anyone requesting it for 100 euros and to archive all the exchanges. More than 200 of the transcriptions have spread virally to individuals and institutions around the world, in a way that recalls both ''We the People'' and missionary work.
His father also played a role in Mr. Vo's quest to purchase three spectacular glass chandeliers from the ballroom of the former Hotel Majestic in Paris, where the peace accord was reached among the Americans, North Vietnamese, South Vietnamese and Vietcong in 1973, which was supposed to have ended the Vietnam War. ''Of course history turns out to be different,'' Mr. Vo said of the north's aggression into the south in 1975 after the withdrawal of American troops. He shows a photograph from the front page of The New York Times with one chandelier hovering over the drama at the negotiating table. When he found out the hotel was being sold several years ago, he entered into his own negotiations to buy the chandeliers.
During the process he took his father to the ballroom in Paris. ''In the taxi he complained that we were going to the room of death and betrayal,'' said Mr. Vo, who presented one chandelier, disassembled, last year on the floor at the Museum of Modern Art, which acquired the piece. ''Then when we entered the room, the only thing out of his mouth was, 'I think the Queen of Denmark must have such things in her castle.'

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Conflicts Over Religion

 BODY:
Readers discuss faith-based disagreement, vitriol and violence.
To the Editor:
Recent events, though different in many ways, have highlighted the misunderstanding and intolerance often generated by expression of religious belief. When Dan Cathy, president of the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain, expressed mainstream conservative views on marriage, saying same-sex unions invite ''God's judgment,'' he was labeled a bigot and a Neanderthal. Though I disagree with him, I was appalled by the viciousness of the response. Recent Muslim outrage at an offensive film has again led to violence in the Middle East.
The bloodshed predictably led to claims that Islam is a violent religion or not a religion at all. Yet for every demonstrator or terrorist who uses any offense to maim and kill, there are thousands of Muslims who are horrified by such behavior. If they are offended, the majority of Muslims seek only to express their outrage and receive an acknowledgment of the offense.
A major problem in our world is our inability to live side by side as people of different faiths or no faith at all. Though the problem is certainly not new, globalization, immigration and instant electronic communication have all aggravated the problem. 
The Catholic theologian Hans Küng famously said there would never be peace in this world ''without dialogue between religions.'' He added that there would be ''no dialogue between the religions without investigation of the foundation of the religions.''
If we are ever to have better understanding, we must start with the young people. In our present climate, it is often the most extreme and violent adherents whose beliefs are disseminated. It ought to be policy in this nation that every high school student take a course in comparative religions.
Let us equip our citizens with accurate information; otherwise we are allowing the violent fringe to control both the conversation and our international relationships.
(Rev.) ANNE-MARIE HISLOP Chicago, Sept. 17, 2012
The writer is a minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
Readers React
Although I cannot doubt the sincerity and good intentions of Ms. Hislop, I don't see her approach as suggesting a solution to faith-based controversy and violence. It is very possible to be spiritual and philosophical without adhering to the illusions and outmoded rituals of established religions. As long as these religions indoctrinate their constituents into so-called ''faith,'' there will be new generations of zealots, creating problems for all of us.
If you look at the demonstrators around the world in this conflict, they are often those with a minimum of education and economic means who cling to religion as their sole safety net and express their frustrations at their living conditions through violence. As long as the world is mired in poverty and superstition, I don't see much hope for a solution through ''dialogue between the religions.''
BERNARD LANGS New Providence, N.J., Sept. 19, 2012
How can there be peace when two major religions, Christianity and Islam, consider nonbelievers to be infidels, or worse? As long as Christianity and Islam teach that each is the only way to God, that all else is wrong, there will be no peace.
Unless or until someone, God help us all, is proven to be correct.
HARRY FREIBERG Brookings, Ore., Sept. 19, 2012
Ms. Hislop seems to equate liberals' response to Dan Cathy's views on gay marriage and Muslims' response to an anti-Islam movie. Mr. Cathy received what is the norm when a conservative expresses an opinion -- name-calling and vitriol. Yet these are just words -- painful maybe, but there was no physical damage or loss of life.
On the other hand, Muslims murdered, destroyed property and denied the right of others to criticize their religion. Ms. Hislop claims that there are thousands of Muslims who are offended by such behavior. I am still waiting to hear the thousands of voices express their outrage. So far, the silence is deafening.
ELLEN MINAKER Jamaica, Queens, Sept. 19, 2012
I am an atheist, and grateful for that. I have spent time in many Middle Eastern and African countries; I have met and shared homes with people of many faiths. The difference between them and me is small: I allow that it is possible that I am wrong. They allow no such possibility.
Many extremists want to prove the righteousness of their beliefs by violence, law and coercion. I am willing to wait until I am dead to find out whether I am right or wrong. The majority of Muslims, Jews and Christians are decent, loving people. It is time for us ordinary people to raise our voices in protest over the fight to claim the inside track on righteousness. I don't know the truth for certain, and neither do you!
NOREEN HULTEEN Ashland, Ore., Sept. 19, 2012
I am reminded of a comment by the late Rabbi Gerald Klein of Dallas that ''we are usually down on what we are not up on.'' Most of us do not know or understand our own religion, much less that of others. In teaching a class on world religions at Brookhaven Community College, I found that my students, who included Protestants, Catholics, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and practitioners of Shinto, were equally ignorant of their religions. Most were practitioners -- that is, they did what others did -- without having an understanding of what they were doing or why.
Ignorance leads to fear, and fear leads to hatred. Hatred easily manifests itself in violence.
STEVE LANDREGAN Dallas, Sept. 19, 2012
The writer is an archivist and historian for the Catholic Diocese of Dallas.
I feel that Ms. Hislop may have missed one salient point regarding the strength of the reaction to Dan Cathy's public stance on same-sex marriage. Many of us who still place our trust in a secular American society were not reacting at all to his religion; he certainly has a right to depend on his interpretation of it for his moral sense. We are Americans reacting to a prominent member of our society who has neither compassion nor the sense of inclusiveness that we must have in a diverse country.
His religion is his private concern, but his intolerant voice with its considerable effect is reason enough for many Americans to react strongly.
PETER M. TEMKO Decatur, Ga., Sept. 19, 2012
I agree with Ms. Hislop that the comparative study of religions be made a required study in schools. I would urge that interfaith education be instituted not only in the schools in the United States but also in Muslim countries, in forums such as mosques and Sunday schools. Universities in Muslim countries should consider introducing Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Buddhist studies and related languages like Hebrew and Syriac. Whereas knowledge about other faiths enhances understanding, what truly makes for peaceful coexistence is getting to know one another -- in person. When you put a face to a community, you humanize it. When a Jewish friend in New York called me and invited me and my family to his home for a post-Yom Kippur dinner, I was touched and wish I had extended the same invitation to him on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan.
I call upon Muslims to invite their Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist and atheist neighbors into their mosques, and into their homes. Invite them to listen to a Friday sermon, break bread over an iftar (breaking the fast) dinner in Ramadan, celebrate a birthday.
And I call upon non-Muslims to reach out to their Muslim friends and invite themselves over.
(Imam) FEISAL ABDUL RAUF New York, Sept. 20, 2012
The writer is the chairman of the Cordoba Initiative, which promotes interfaith understanding. He was associated with a plan to build an Islamic center near ground zero.
Must I respect someone's belief that 2+2=5? If not, then why must I respect someone's belief that the Earth is only thousands of years old instead of billions, or that a child was born without a sperm fertilizing an egg? Because it was written in a religious text? Of course, violence should never be the answer, but it's hard to have a ''dialogue'' unless both parties agree on some fundamental scientific principles.
In my opinion, it is the overall acceptance and condoning of these false beliefs that allow ''the violent fringe to control both the conversation and our international relationships.'' If we, as a society, won't denounce these religious readings as false (while still being useful and gratifying as fictional works), how can we expect the ''violent fringe'' to disobey their religious readings, which they may interpret as condoning violence?
If we accept religious texts as the writings of an omnipresent being, then we must either accept the texts fully with all their necessary consequences or reject the texts outright and just enjoy the morals and values that they impose.
SETH BLUMNew York, Sept 19, 2012
When Ms. Hislop says that ''it ought to be policy in this nation that every high school student take a course in comparative religions,'' why does she limit it to ''this nation''? It would be more apropos if all nations, especially Muslim nations, presented their students with such a course.
In fact, instead of studying comparative religions, it would make more sense for students to study comparative political and governing systems. Some might find our constitutional right to free speech interesting.
LARRY HOFFNER New York, Sept. 19, 2012
Ms. Hislop recommends that ''every high school student take a course in comparative religions.'' However, parents who have absolute faith that theirs is the only true religion would never allow their children to attend such a course.
Religion can be beautiful. It has inspired great music and great architecture. It comforts us in time of grief; it gives us rituals to celebrate joyous milestones in our lives. It also led to witch trials, the Inquisition -- and the murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
Can blind faith be cured? Let us pray that it can be.
GEORGE JOCHNOWITZ New York, Sept. 19, 2012
Here we go again.
Often when there is a perceived societal or political problem, some in leadership positions suggest that an additional high school course is the answer. Teenage pregnancy? Sex education classes. Teenage auto accidents? Driver education. Insufficient community involvement? Courses in volunteerism and community service.
Our high schools are under sufficient siege at this time with demands for reform that an added requirement ''that every high school student take a course in comparative religions'' is untenable. The variety of world religions, cultures and traditions are best addressed in traditional subject areas like history, literature and languages taught by creative and imaginative teachers.
Areas of conflict already exist in our schools. If we cannot agree, either locally or nationally, on the role of evolutionary biology in human development or even on which holidays to close school, how can the course content on world religions be designed, considering the emotionally charged nature of the subject?
JOSHUA SEGAL Arnold, Md., Sept. 19, 2012
The Writer Responds
One of the contradictions of our national life is that we see ourselves as a religious people, yet cling to the belief that we can separate the secular and the religious with a clear line. Mr. Temko's claim that outrage at Dan Cathy had nothing to do with Mr. Cathy's religious belief is an attempt to draw that elusive line. Yet the qualities that Mr. Temko equates with a secular society -- compassion and inclusiveness -- are intimately intertwined with individual belief systems. For a person of faith, inclusiveness is not separate from religious belief.
For one reason or another, several respondents saw little possibility of any interfaith understanding. Mr. Freiberg rightly notes that both ''Christianity and Islam teach that each is the only way to God.'' While that may lead to evangelizing by some, it need not be a source of violence. Neither should it be an excuse for failure to try to understand one another. As Mr. Landregan wisely concludes: ''Ignorance leads to fear, and fear leads to hatred. Hatred easily manifests itself in violence.''
It was not my intention, despite what Ms. Minaker writes, to equate vitriol with violence. Each situation is a recent example of outrage around religious faith. Even in a secular society, all people, believers and atheists alike, speak and act out of their personal beliefs. My contention is that a clear understanding of different belief systems better prepares our citizens to live in our religiously pluralistic world.
While teaching accurate information is important, I am grateful to Imam Feisal for adding the valuable interpersonal dimension. It is always easier to hate people we see only as nameless, faceless stereotypes than it is to hate those whose bread we have shared.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Affliction

BYLINE: By STEPHEN TOBOLOWSKY. 
This article is adapted from ''The Dangerous Animals Club,'' a memoir due out from Simon & Schuster this month.

 BODY:
I came to Los Angeles when I was 25 to be an actor. I thought I was ready for anything: unemployment, rejection, acting classes. I didn't expect illness.
One night not long after I arrived, I felt a burning pain deep in my middle, just below my navel. At first I suspected it was pepperoni pizza. I went to bed and didn't think anything of it. The next morning, it hit me again.
I needed a doctor, but I didn't know any. How does someone find a doctor? I resorted to geometry. I drove in ever-widening circles, using my apartment as the center. I figured the first doctor I found would at least be the closest. 
After 20 minutes, I ran into an Urgent Care Facility in the heart of West Hollywood. I told the physician in charge about the burning pain in my middle. He raised his eyebrows and asked me to ''drop my drawers.''
I had never had a prostate exam. It was as if someone were ripping out my insides with a red-hot pair of pliers. He felt around and mumbled, ''Hmmm, I think we have a boggy prostate here.''
I did not know what he was talking about. He hit me with the hard facts. He said, ''Prostatitis and epididymitis.''
''What's that?'' I said.
''Inflammation of the balls.''
I was horrified. I remembered looking through an encyclopedia in sixth grade and seeing a picture of African natives with scrotums so gigantic they almost touched the ground. Was that my future? Kiss my acting career goodbye. How would I ever shop for pants?
I needed antibiotics. The doctor asked me if I had a ''strong'' jock strap at home. He wasn't kidding. He said jostling made the condition worse. I should wear the strongest jock strap I could find.
At home, my girlfriend, Beth, asked me what was wrong. I started to tell her. All relationships have limits. Ours was discussions about scrotal swelling. Some maladies have no curb appeal.
Time passed. We slid from earthquake season to fire season and neared flood season once again. The fire I had down below kept intruding into my life. There was no cure, just containment -- the antibiotics didn't penetrate the prostate wall. I might have problems on and off for the rest of my life. I felt like Job.
Some friends of mine from Texas came to town. I took them to the French Market for breakfast. Over omelets I started explaining what a boggy prostate was.
Their eyes glazed over as I spun the tragic tale of my life. I was starting Act 2 -- the inefficiency of antibiotics -- when I began registering some changes in my fine old eatery. Empty tables. That was odd. The place was always packed. Some of the regulars looked as if they'd lost a lot of weight. Some had bandages on their arms. A man at the counter appeared to have holes in his face.
We didn't know that something called GRID (gay-related immune deficiency) was on the loose. In a couple of years, we'd hear the word AIDS for the first time.
If I were to give Armageddon a face, it would not be the fires or the earthquakes, but the faces of these young men. Like me, they came to Los Angeles to find something. But it turned out to be nothing like what they expected.
My malady had become trivial. I was no longer the central victim in my life.
During this time of horror and fear, when no one knew what was going on, I went to a barbershop. There were three chairs. Two of the barbers were old, Italian men who had been cutting hair their entire life. The third chair opened up. The barber was a young, painfully thin gay man, probably in his late 20s.
I sat in his chair with some hesitation. He smiled and told me not to worry, I wouldn't catch anything. He started cutting my hair. He told me he had come out from Indiana. He wanted to be in show business. It hadn't worked out, but fortunately he had gone to beauty school and could work as a barber. Then he got sick. His mother wanted him to come home, but he was going stay in Los Angeles with his friends and work as long as he could.
He decided he would write the story of his life and give it to his mother as a gift. But he had one practical problem. He knew how the story began, and how it ended, but he had no middle chapters.
That young man's face has haunted me for years. He taught me that the middle chapters begin whenever you decide to tell your story. They may have begun for me that afternoon.

A Rust-Belt Miracle
We are losing the real lesson in Ohio -- no one man and no one policy is going to make the difference. Columbus has always been a bit recession-proof, but the real leadership comes from the bipartisan work of the Republican business leaders and the Democratic city and county government officials. Let's stop the divide and conquer. We are all in peril if we continue this path.
SALLY LUKEN, Columbus, Ohio 
Gov. John R. Kasich is being very unwise when he states: ''I don't care what the reason is. I don't care if it's because of some little green man on Mars. When people are working, families are stronger, children are healthier and families are better.'' All governors should show interest in the welfare of their citizens, but without understanding the reasons for economic growth, you cannot stimulate growth when the economy is down. His JobsOhio initiative could be very productive, but if it is just a matter of persuading companies to move to Ohio, he is taking jobs from another state. He needs to think about how jobs are created, not how jobs are stolen.
JANET ELLINGSON, Salt Lake City, posted on nytimes.com
In 2008, there was a real fear that what happened to Pittsburgh and Youngstown in the late 1970s with the collapse of the steel industry would happen to Toledo and many small cities in the region if G.M. failed. For Northwest Ohio, the bailout kept the economy afloat. Manufacturing remains central to Ohio's economy, but that sector cannot continue to reliably employ Ohioans in large numbers. As a result, few people move to Ohio, which has one of the most ''native'' populations in the country. Without fresh blood, the state will languish.
CHRISTOPHER FREY, Toledo, Ohio, posted on nytimes.com
Do citizens understand their tax dollars are paying corporations, which are sitting on massive profits due to high worker productivity and low wages, to remain in their cities? Isn't this corporate welfare? How do people square it with their ''government is bad, private industry is good'' beliefs? These are the same corporations that are lobbying Congress to lower the corporate tax rate, which they don't pay anyway.

Is This the Most Dangerous Thing in Your House?
The toxicity of chlorine- and bromine-based flame-retardant formulations is alarming, and I appreciate Dr. Arlene Blum's efforts in eliminating them from the market. There is, however, a movement in flame-retardant research to make use of alternate chemicals, like phosphorous, nitrogen and silicon compounds. No acknowledgment is made in the article of these alternatives, although many of the flame-retardant manufacturers she mentioned produce these substances. Those who have experienced the tragedy of house fires know that there is a necessity for flame-retardant materials. To eradicate all flame retardants from the market is to increase the risk of such catastrophes.
TEHILA STONE, Teaneck, N.J.
When my daughter was born, she had an organic cotton futon for her crib, and I made all her pajamas myself from untreated fabric. I am not a scientist. I just instinctively knew that I didn't want her to sleep on something chemically treated. Now she is a teen and spends a lot of time on our new sofa, doing homework and knitting. It looks like I just postponed the inevitable. Is there nothing we can do to contain the stuff, if we can't get rid of it entirely?
KIM EVANS, Washington State, posted on nytimes.com
How My Mother Disappeared
The good news is that being a caregiver for a family member with dementia gets emotionally easier with time; in the nine years since my husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I have learned that change is a part of the condition but isn't always for the worse. One coping strategy that has evolved is to view him as my second husband (the first being his former self). I am happier thinking of him as a recent addition to the family than as the man I married 30 years ago.
MARGARET EARL COOPER, New Canaan, Conn.
My parents both suffered from dementia. They declined in parallel and spent the last five years in a nursing home, sharing a room but barely able to converse with each other. Now I am 73, and I have no fear of death, only of a life that lingers too long. Dementia is not the only end-of-life tragedy. There are other physical conditions that conspire to keep us alive. I am in favor of more liberal assisted-suicide laws.

HEADLINE: A Tidy Sum

BYLINE: By CHUCK KLOSTERMAN

 BODY:
I'm a math teacher at an international school in Mombasa, Kenya, and a woman who cleans some of the teachers' apartments offered me her services. Here's the problem: She is asking for only 300 Kenyan shillings, or about $3.50, for two hours of work. She will be cleaning my bathroom and my kitchen, as well as the floor and my clothing. To me, her work is worth much more than $3.50, and it feels wrong to accept without providing what I believe to be fair payment. If I pay her more, however, she might raise her prices for other customers or pressure my co-workers to pay more than they are willing. What should I do: accept the price she has offered or pay her adequately for her services? NAME WITHHELD, MOMBASA, KENYA 
Before we get to the crux of your question, it should be noted that the average per capita income in Kenya is $820 a year. The average per capita income in the United States is $48,450, so $3.50 in Mombasa is the imperfect equivalent of $206 here. The cleaning woman wouldn't be soliciting your business if she didn't believe the extra shillings were worth the effort. But those specifics distract from the heart of your query, which seems to be this: Is it ethical to accept an extreme bargain that's solely a product of cultural disparity?
When traveling in poorer countries, you're going to find that certain things cost much less than what seems reasonable. When these things are meals or lodging, nobody tends to mind. The reason your situation feels different is that you're dealing with services instead of goods; you can instantly relate to the experience of cleaning an apartment and how profoundly awful it can be. You'd never do that job for $3.50. But money is an unreal construct; its value is relative to time and place. Your definition of fairness is not universal. The cleaning woman is setting the terms of this transaction, so your ethical responsibility is to abide by the terms she has established. However, as a conscientious citizen in an economically unfair world, tip this woman well. If you fear that doing so would generate the problems you cite -- if a robust weekly tip would be perceived as overpayment -- direct the bulk of the tip in one lump sum (at an appropriate holiday or after the final cleaning).HAVING YOUR CAKE
My mother-in-law tells the server at any restaurant we're dining at that it's someone's birthday so that she can receive a free piece of cake. She's happy to pay a $500 tab, but she insists on making up that someone at the table is celebrating. Your thoughts? MICHAEL HADLEY EPSTEIN, SANTA MONICA, CALIF.
Are you really unsure about whether lying to get free cake is unethical? Your mother-in-law sounds like an interesting person, though.

HEADLINE: A Prison, a Paradise

BYLINE: By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN

 BODY:
On the plane, something odd but also vaguely magical-seeming happened: namely, nobody knew what time it was. Right before we landed, the flight attendant made an announcement, in English and Spanish, that although daylight saving time recently went into effect in the States, the island didn't observe that custom. As a result, we had caught up -- our time had passed into sync with Cuban time. You will not need to change your watches. Then, moments later, she came on again and apologized. She had been wrong, she said. The time in Cuba was different. She didn't specify how many hours ahead. At that point, people around us looked at one another. How could the airline not know what time it is where we're going? Another flight attendant, hurrying down the aisle, said loudly, ''I just talked to some actual Cubans, in the back, and they say it'll be the same time.'' That settled it: we would be landing in ignorance. We knew our phones weren't going to work because they were tied to a U.S. company that didn't operate on the island.
The 6-year-old sat between us, looking back and forth at our faces. ''Is something wrong?'' she asked. 
''No,'' my wife, Mariana, said, ''just funny.'' But to me she did the eyebrows up and down.
''What?'' I said.
''Nothing,'' she said, ''just -- into the zone.''
Mi esposa travels to Cuba every so many years, to do movie-related research (she's a film-studies professor) and to visit her mother's family, a dwindling number of which, as death and emigration have surpassed the birthrate, still live in the same small inland town, a dusty, colonial-looking agricultural town, not a place anyone's heard of. To them, even after half a century, it's the querencia, an untranslatable Spanish word that means something like ''the place where you are your most authentic self.'' They won't go on about Cuba around you in a magic-realist way. Nor do they dream of trying to reclaim their land when the Castros die. Destiny settled their branch of the family not in Florida, where, if you're Cuban-American, your nostalgia and anger (and sense of community) are continually stoked, but in Carolina del Norte, where nobody cares. They tend to be fairly laid back about politics. But their memories stitch helplessly back to and through that town over generations, back to the ur-ancestors who came from a small village in the Canary Islands.
My wife's 91-year-old Cuban grandmother, who lives with us much of the time, once drew for me on top of a white cake box a map of their hometown. It started out like something you would make to give someone directions but ended up as detailed in places as a highway atlas. More so, really, because it was personally annotated. Here is the corner where my father have the bodega. Here is the alley where the old man used to walk his grandson, in a white suit, and we always say, 'Let's go to watch it,' because he have his pocket full of stones, and when the boy runs, the old man throw and hit him in the legs. She was remembering back through Castro and Batista, back through all of that, into the time of Machado, even back through him into her parents' time, the years of mustachioed GÃ³mez in his black frock coat. The night I met her, 18 years ago, she cooked me Turkish-delight-level black beans with Spanish olives, and flan in a coffee can. She said: ''Mira, Yon, at this time'' -- she meant the early '40s -- ''they make a census, all the teacher go to have a census in Cuba. We see places nobody know the name. I ride a small horse. One night there is a storm -- we pass the storm under a palma. In one house is un enano. You know what is? A dwarf. He say, 'I count half!' '' Her stories are like that. You actually want them to go longer. This is no small thing for me, as my life has evolved by unforeseen paths such that I see more of this abuelita than of any other human being. Neither of us ever leaves the house, and during the day it's the two of us. Those could be some paw-chewingly long hours in the kitchen, if she were talking to me about religion or something. Mostly she calls people in Miami and watches Univision at the same time, waiting for my wife and daughters to get home, after which she perks up.
Because my wife and her family have living relatives in Cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from Miami. The legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. But you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. I first tagged along 12 years ago. It's hands down the strangest way to travel to Cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it's the simplest. But the airport bureaucracy in Miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. That first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of Miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. I spoke hardly any Spanish then. My wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about Havana and messages for various people in their town. Now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that I took to mean, ''Words aren't necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,'' but that when I think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, ''You, simpleton.''
One line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. A couple of muscly Latin guys in shorts were waiting there. They lifted each suitcase or bag onto a little spinning platform, turned it blazingly fast to seal it in industrial-strength shrink-wrap from a roll that looked like it held a landfill's worth and charged you for it. Their spinning was so energetic, it doubled as a feat of strength. Everyone watched. The reasons behind the plastic were not laid out. Later in the waiting area, a woman told us it was to discourage quick-fingered Cuban bag handlers on the other side. They took not gold and money, which few people were foolish enough to pack, but toothpaste and shampoo, necessities. This year, however, the plastic wrap was optional.
There were other post-Bush differences in the direct-to-Cuba zone. The lines had grown fewer and shorter. Most noticeable, the Cubans on our flight -- a mixture of Cuban-Americans and returning Cuban nationals who had been in Florida or D.C. on visas of their own (some people do move back and forth) -- weren't carrying as much stuff. The crowd cast a fairly normal profile. Last time, people had multiple pairs of shoes tied around their necks by the laces. Thick gorgets of reading glasses. Men wearing 10 hats, several pairs of pants, everybody's pockets bulging. Everybody wearing fanny packs. The rule was, if you could get it onto your body, you could bring it aboard. At least five people carried giant stuffed animals and other large toys. That's one of the things in the Cuban-American community, in which going back is generally frowned upon -- but if it's to meet your nieto for the first time. . . .
None of that, though, is what makes the Miami-to-Havana flights strange. It's that this most obvious route, more than any of the much longer workarounds by which American citizens can get to the island, lets you feel most fully the truth of Cuba's sheer proximity. It's one of those flights in which, almost as soon as you reach your maximum altitude, you begin your descent, and within minutes you're looking down on a diorama of palm trees growing incongruously in green fields, and within seconds you hit the ground and everyone bursts into applause. The country you land in is too unlike your own to have been reached that quickly, all but instantaneously, and is after all, you recall, on hostile terms with your own. As if you've passed through a warp. â[#x20ac]©''Why are they clapping?'' the 6-year-old asked.
I explained that it was special, coming here. Some of these people, when they left Cuba, might have thought they would never see it again. Some had been hearing about it all their lives and were seeing it for the first time.
''Also, they like to clap and yell,'' my wife said.
The 6-year-old did her philosopher face, gazing out the window. She gets a little dimple on her forehead when the big thoughts are brewing. ''Now I'm here,'' she said.
''Yes, you are.''
''And I'm Cuban,'' she said.
''You are part Cuban, that's true.''
''You're not any Cuban,'' she said, not meanly, just sort of marveling.
She looks like me, pale with blue eyes and light brown hair and freckles. Yet she has largely been raised day to day by intense, dark-eyed Cuban-American women, and their blood is in her, and the history of their family, with all of its drama and all of its issues, has exerted an incalculable influence on who and what she is. At some point in her life, she'll have to figure out what all of that means to her; the whole story and the way she looks will be part of its strangeness. For me it was all behind glass. I felt the sudden separation between us, between the relative depths of what this trip would mean to us, many years on. One of those moments of generational wooziness that come with having kids, like realizing there's a part of their lives you won't see.
We landed under searingly vivid skies, something like what the blue tablet from a packet of Easter dye lets off. The land right around the airport is farmed; we saw a man plowing with oxen. The fertility of Cuba is the thing you can't put into words. I've never stood on a piece of ground as throbbingly, even pornographically, generative. Throw a used battery into a divot, and it will put out shoots -- that's how it feels. You could smell it, in the smoky, slightly putrid smell of turned fields. More and more, as we drove, that odor mingled with the smell of the sea.
This was the first time I was in post-Fidel Cuba. It was funny to think that not long ago, there were smart people who doubted that such a thing could exist, i.e., who believed that with the fall of Fidel would come the fall of Communism on the island. But Fidel didn't fall. He did fall, physically -- on the tape that gets shown over and over in Miami, of him coming down the ramp after giving that speech in 2004 and tumbling and breaking his knee -- but his leadership didn't. He executed one of the most brilliantly engineered successions in history, a succession that was at the same time a self-entrenchment. First, he faked his own death in a way: serious intestinal operation, he might not make it. RaÃºl is brought in as ''acting president.'' A year and a half later, Castro mostly recovered. But RaÃºl is officially named president, with Castro's approval. It was almost as if, ''Is Fidel still . . . ?'' Amazing. So now they rule together, with RaÃºl out front, but everyone understanding that Fidel retains massive authority. Not to say that RaÃºl doesn't wield power -- he has always had plenty -- but it's a partnership of some kind. What comes after is as much of a mystery as ever.
Our relationship with them seems just as uncertain. Barack Obama was going to open things up, and he did tinker with the rules regarding travel, but now they say that when you try to follow these rules, you get caught up in all kinds of forms and tape. He eased the restrictions on remittances, so more money is making it back to the island, and that may have made the biggest difference so far. Boats with medical and other relief supplies have recently left Miami, sailing straight to the island, which hasn't happened in decades. These humanitarian shipments can, according to The Miami Herald, include pretty much anything a Cuban-American family wants to send to its relatives: Barbie dolls, electronics, sugary cereal. In many cases, you have a situation in which the family is first wiring money over, then shipping the goods. The money is used on the other side to pay the various fees associated with getting the stuff. So it's as if you're reaching over and re-buying the merchandise for your relatives. The money, needless to say, goes to the government. Still, capitalism is making small inroads. And RaÃºl has taken baby steps toward us: Cubans can own their own cars, operate their own businesses, own property. That's all new. For obvious reasons it's not an immediate possibility for a vast majority of the people, and it could be taken away tomorrow morning by decree, but it matters.
Otherwise, our attitude toward Cuba feels very wait and see, as what we're waiting to see grows less and less clear. We've learned to live with it, like when the doctor says, ''What you have could kill you, but not before you die a natural death.'' Earlier this year Obama said to a Spanish newspaper: ''No authoritarian regime will last forever. The day will come in which the Cuban people will be free.'' Not, notice, no dictator can live forever, but no ''authoritarian regime.'' But how long can one last? Two hundred years?
Perhaps a second term will be different. All presidents, if they want to mess with our Cuba relations at even the microscopic level, find themselves up against the Florida community, and those are large, powerful and arguably insane forces.
My wife's people got out in the early 1960s, so they've been in the States for half a century. Lax regulations, strict regulations. It's all a oneness. They take, I suppose, a Cuban view, that matters on the island are perpetually and in some way inherently screwed up and have been forever.
There was a moment in the taxi, a little nothing exchange but so densely underlayered with meaning that if you could pass it through an extracting machine, you would understand a lot about how it is between Cubans and Cuban-Americans. The driver, a guy who said he grew up in Havana, told a tiny lie, or a half lie. The fact that you can't even say whether it was a lie or not is significant. My wife had asked him to explain for me the way it works with Cuba's two separate currencies, CUPs and CUCs, Cuban pesos and convertible pesos (also called ''chavitos'' or simply ''dollars''). When I was last there, we didn't use either of these, though both existed. We paid for everything in actual, green U.S. dollars. That's what people wanted. There were stores in which you could pay in only dollars. But in 2004, Castro decided -- partly as a gesture of contempt for the U.S. embargo -- that he would abolish the use of U.S. dollars on the island and enforce the use of CUCs, pegged to the U.S. dollar but distinct from it. This coexisted alongside the original currency, which would remain pegged to the spirit of the revolution. For obvious reasons, the actual Cuban peso is worth much less than the other, dollar-equivalent Cuban peso, something on the order of 25 to 1. But the driver said simply, ''No, they are equal.''
''Really?'' my wife said. ''No . . . that can't be.''
He insisted that there was no difference between the relative values of the currencies. They were the same.
He knew that this was wrong. He probably could have told you the exchange rates from that morning. But he also knew that it had a rightness in it. For official accounting purposes, the two currencies are considered equivalent. Their respective values might fluctuate on a given day, of course, but it couldn't be said that the CUP was worth less than the CUC That's partly what he meant. He also meant that if you're going to fly to Cuba from Miami and rub it in my face that our money is worth one twenty-fifth of yours, I'm gonna feed you some hilarious communist math and see how you like it. Cubans call it la doble moral. Meaning, different situations call forth different ethical codes. He wasn't being deceptive. He was saying what my wife forced him to say. She had been a bit breezy, it seemed, in mentioning the unevenness between the currencies, which is the kind of absurdity her family would laugh at affectionately in the kitchen. But they don't have to suffer it anymore. And he was partly reminding her of that, fencing her off from a conversation in which Cubans would joke together about the notion that the CUP and the CUC had even the slightest connection to each other. That was for them, that laughter. So, a very complex statement, that not-quite-lie. After it, he was totally friendly and dropped us at one of the Cuban-owned tourist hotels on the edge of Havana.
People walking by on the street didn't seem as skinny. That was the most instantly perceptible difference, if you were seeing RaÃºl's Cuba for the first time. They weren't sickly looking before, but under Fidel you noticed more the way men's shirts flapped about them and the knobbiness of women's knees. Now people were filling out their clothes. The island's overall dietary level had apparently gone up a tick. (One possible factor involved was an increase in the amount of food coming over from the United States. Unknown to most people, we do sell a lot of agricultural products to Cuba, second only in value to Brazil. Under a law that Bill Clinton squeaked through on his way out, Cuba purchases food and medicine from us on a cash basis, meaning, bizarrely, that a lot of the chicken in the arroz con pollo consumed on the island by Canadian tourists is raised in the Midwest -- the embargo/blockade has always been messy when you lean in close).
The idea was to spend some days traveling around, before going to see family. Once you see them, it gets emotional, and after that, sightseeing feels wrong somehow.
The ladies wanted to visit the Havana aquarium before it closed for the day -- my wife went there when she was younger -- so they took off. The hostility of the hotel workers was to be experienced. I started making up reasons to approach them, just to provoke it and make sure I hadn't imagined it. My reflex during an odd social interaction is to assume fault, and this can create its own distortion, making it hard to see what the other person is doing, but no, these people were being fantastically unfriendly. It was one of the big, newly built Gaviota hotels -- Gaviota is the quasi-official Cuban tourist organization (financed in part by transnational investment but controlled by a prominent Cuban general). Loosely speaking, these men and women worked for the government. It's not that they were incompetent or mean; they just had zero motivation to be nice to tourists or in a hurry to do anything for them, and for me, after years immersed in a may-I-pour-you-more-sweet-tea culture, the contrast held a fascination. In a way it was refreshing to see people so emphatically not kowtowing to rich white tourists, even if that was you, but of course this feeling was not to be trusted: you liked their unfriendliness because they seemed more authentically anti-capitalist that way. Especially wild was a woman about my age at the main reception desk, who evidently had to handle all the complaints about the wee-fee service in the lobby. She looked at you dead-level and half-smiling when you approached as if in her mind she were already pushing in the blade. At the desk, they sold little scratch cards, with passwords on them, that looked like lottery tickets and in hindsight had much else in common with lottery tickets. But there were no cards that day. ''They are in the city,'' she said -- and in my mind I saw them being unloaded from small boats at night -- ''but we don't have them here.'' I was advised to try the hotel next door, a few minutes' walk -- another, equally massive, equally generically pan-Latin-style Gaviota hotel. Would a card I bought there work here? ''I hope so,'' she said, still doing that smile. ''But,'' I said, ''we made reservations at this hotel specifically because you advertised the wee-fee service.'' A total lie. We didn't need it. I wanted to see if she would crack. She shook her head so slowly with exaggeratedly sincere sorrow, like a long-suffering teacher forced to tell her most obnoxious pupil he had failed. ''I understand,'' she murmured, and went back to work.
Partly what had been clashing were our respective ideas about the role of an individual in solving a crisis. In the United States, we all go around so empowered-feeling all the time, and when you travel you feel it, a sense of hypertrophy, the thing that makes us look like giant babies to the Europeans. Bring us our soda refills or we'll get them ourselves! The sheer notion that I thought she herself could do anything about the wee-fee, about getting the cards here faster, was probably genuinely amusing to her. Did I not think she wanted the wee-fee fixed? Did I think she actually liked standing there answering the exact same question from a never-ending line of childishly outraged foreigners?
At the neighboring hotel, they did have cards. But their wee-fee was down. ''It's not working?'' I asked the man. ''It's working,'' he said, ''but not right now.'' The whole island's Internet runs through three unpredictable satellites, although I had read that a cable of some kind was recently installed. If so, it did not get routed to these hotels. Which was lucky in the end -- it accelerated the technological molting that had to happen and left you feeling more present. In the basement, near the business center (where a woman took delight in telling travelers from all lands that they could not do various simple-sounding things on the computer consoles), I noticed a small postcard that showed a picture of Fidel, and the caption read in Spanish, ''In the history of U.S. intelligence, no greater amount of money and resources have been put toward bringing down a single man than have been spent to get Fidel.'' And below that, ''El mÃ©rito es estar vivo.'' Roughly, ''the victory lies in staying alive.''
I kept seeing small groups of Asian men get on and off the elevators. That was new. Ten years ago the only Asian faces you might have seen were in Chinatown -- there is one in Havana, Barrio Chino, several square blocks of ostensibly Chinese restaurants and faded signs with lanterns and pagodas on them, a neighborhood left behind by thousands of Chinese agricultural workers who arrived in the 19th century, and where very occasionally you might still see Asian features. These guys -- all men, I saw no women -- seemed dressed as inconspicuously as possible, loosefitting light-blue jeans and generic polo shirts and sunglasses. The bartender told me that they were here to do business. China was doing ''bastante de negocios'' in Cuba these days, including in oil, he said. At that moment a Chinese-made exploratory rig sat about 30 miles off the northern coast. We would be able to see it, he said, driving along the main highway. Cuba has lately been partnering with foreign petroleum companies to explore prospective undersea oil fields. A major discovery would be a mainline to economic independence, that most long-elusive goal of the revolution. So far, though, the wells have come up dry or disappointing.
Cuba's involvement with China has been intensifying for more than a decade, as Russian influence has receded. The Chinese have built an amusement park and sold fleets of buses. They have been granted use -- if our intelligence can be trusted -- of a large signals-intelligence base on the outskirts of Havana near the airport, a giant electronic ear-horn right off our shores, the price we pay for renouncing any involvement with a country so close. There is the sheer geopolitical weirdness of GuantÃ¡namo's being there, too: the Chinese and the Americans operating on the same island, off the coast of Florida. GuantÃ¡namo was supposed to be gone. It's holding on like the Castros.
The empty midafternoon lobby was vast and square-tiled and full of the drone of floor waxing, and the 6-year-old spilled into it laughing, her mother racewalking behind her, trying to catch her. They saw me at the bar and ran over. ''We have to show you this,'' the 6-year-old said. She was pulling on my wife's purse. Mariana pulled out her phone and pushed play on a movie, handing it to me. At the aquarium, a little boy had celebrated his birthday, and his parents had gone in for the dolphin special. You put the kid on a raft and pushed it out into the pool. Shortly thereafter, one of the aquarium's giant 500-pound dolphins started jumping over the kid and raft, in great looping leaps, one after the other. The splash was considerable. The kid looked terrified, he was face forward, clutching the raft at the edges. The repeating image of the dolphin -- frozen massive and pendulous directly above him -- got better every time. The audience laughed and clapped in the concrete bleachers, you could hear it on the video. My wife was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. ''You wouldn't see that in the States,'' she said proudly.
We scanned for the Chinese-built oil platform the next day, and thought we saw something once, though it may have been a ship. To ride along the coastal road with the windows down was sublime. The gaps between houses kept giving you glimpses of the sea behind. There weren't many other cars, but the few that passed left a heavy, organic smell of exhaust in the air. You could taste dinosaurs in it. It carried that precatalytic-converter nostalgia. We were driving down the spine of Cuba, into the vast green interior of the island. Hitchhikers were scattered along the highway, as were people selling various things -- garlic, strings of fish. They ran at you as you passed, yelling and seeming to come too close to the car.
I woke up the next day to the sounds of morning pool activity. Water splashing on concrete. Insistent, unfamiliar bird song. Sleepy murmurs of people rubbing lotion on themselves. Hotel carts rattled by outside the double glass doors. It was about 8 a.m. in Varadero on a warm spring day, which I'm pretty sure is literally Utopia, in some vague historico-linguistic way: the northern shore of Cuba, that supposedly moved Columbus to call this the most beautiful place human eyes had ever seen. My wife has a thing about going to Varadero when she goes to Cuba. I don't know if she even likes it. She does it for her family. To them it would seem insane to skip it -- it was the place they most wanted to go when they lived there -- not to go, on returning, would be like taking a trip to Keystone, S.D., and not going to see Mount Rushmore.
Sitting up in my twin bed, I looked over at the queen bed -- they were already gone. The massive cafeteria operation swung into motion for only a couple of hours each morning. You had to be there for the stampede. We were moving through different micro-Cubas so quickly; too quickly, really. The day before we rode horses through the jungle to see the ruins of ancient coffee plantations and the stone huts where the slaves were kept. We passed cooperative villages of campesinos in the forest and heard political speeches coming from loudspeakers, something about the new agriculture laws. The previous night, coming in on the suddenly pitch-black Cuban highways, zooming up to unlighted ''Road Closed'' signs at 60 miles an hour, swerving to miss car-killing potholes and horse-drawn wagons . . . that was already dreamlike. And now we were navigating the omelet and cereal stations, in lines of mainly European tourists: Germans, Italians, Central Europeans and also Brazilians, Argentines and Canadians. (You know when you're meeting a Canadian, because they always ask, in the same shocked tone, ''How did you get into the country?'' It's an opportunity to remind you that you can't go legally, and they can. And by extension, that they come from a more enlightened land. ''You need to grow up about that stuff,'' one guy that I met at a nature preserve said, to which I wanted to tell him to get a large and powerful population of Cuban exiles and move them into an election-determining province of Canada and call me in the morning.)
The cook at the omelet station, when he asked where I was from and I told him, put up his fists like a boxer, as if we were about to have it out, then started laughing. He told me that he had family in the United States, in Florida. That's what everyone says. You can't understand the transnationally dysfunctional, mutually implicated relationship between Cuba and Miami, that defies all embargoes and policies of ''definitive abandonment,'' until you realize that the line often cuts through families, almost always, in fact. People make all sorts of inner adjustments. I told the man I hated the embargo (the blockade, as they call it) and thought it was stupid, which was both true and what he wanted to hear. He gave me a manly clap-grasp. I didn't go on and say, of course, that I disliked the embargo most because it, more than anything, has kept the Castros in power for half a century, given them a ready-made Goliath for their David. Thanks to the embargo, when the Castros rail against us as an imperialist enemy, they aren't really lying. We have in effect declared ourselves the enemy of the Cuban people and done it under the banner of their freedom, hitting Cuba in a way that, after all, makes only the people suffer, and far from punishing those in power, rewards them and buttresses their story. As for the argument that to deal with tyrants would render our foreign policy incoherent, we deal with worse every day -- we've armed worse -- and in countries that don't have a deeply intimate history with ours, going back centuries. All this because a relatively small but highly mobilized exile community holds sway in a state that has the power to elect presidents. There was no way to gauge how much of this the man would agree with. We left it at mutually thinking the embargo sucked.
Out by the pool, where my wife and daughter were swimming, I lay on a chaise in the shade, feeling paler and softer than I ever had in my life and unlocatably depressed in the way that resorts do so well. I read ''Doctor Zhivago,'' a new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (the husband-and-wife team who have been retranslating the Russian classics for more than 20 years). ''Zhivago'' isn't on the Tolstoy/Chekhov level, but there are wonderful passages, including one that I thought spoke to the gruffness you often encounter in Cubans, the excessive suspicion of introductory small talk they sometimes demonstrate. ''The fear known as spymania,'' Pasternak wrote about Russia after the revolution, ''had reduced all speech to a single formal, predictable pattern. The display of good intentions in discourse was not conducive to conversation.''
Every time I looked up from the book, there were more people in and by the pool, as if they were surfacing out of the water, out of the ripples. I had black sunglasses on, so after a while I propped myself at an angle at which I could seem to read the book but really be moving my eyeballs, staring at everybody. God, the human body! It was Speedos and bikinis, no matter the age or body type. You would never see a poolside scene in the United States with people showing this much skin, except at a pool where people were there precisely to show off the perfection of their bodies. The body not consciously sculptured through working out has become a secret shame and grotesquerie in America, but this upper-class Euro-Latin crowd had not received that news, to my distraction. I took in veins and cellulite, paunches and man-paps, the weird shinglelike sagging that starts to occur on the back of the thighs, cleavage that showed a spoiled-grape-like wrinkling, the ash-mottled skin of permanently sun-torched shoulders, all of it beautiful. All of it beautiful and tormenting. You watched an 18-year-old Argentine girl in her reproductive springtime walk past an ancient Soviet-looking woman, her body a sculpture of blocks atop blocks, and both of them wearing black bikinis, the furtive looks they gave each other, full of emotions straight from the Pliocene, from the savanna. The old men scowled from behind mirrored shades. The young men tensed every muscle in order to seem not obsessed with how the girls saw them, a level of self-consciousness I found I could no longer really re-enter, as if it had been a drunken state. Everybody was stealing looks at one another, envying or disdaining or gazing, like me. We were all inside a matrix of lust and erotic sadness, all turning into versions of one another, or seeing our past selves.
My wife's people come from a small town with a strange name, a rare Spanish word that almost doesn't look Spanish when you see it. When they lived there, the place was not considered all that far from things, from the cities, but the decay of infrastructure, the collapse of the trains, has left it stranded. There's simply no reason to have heard of it.
The first time I went, before we were married, they made a big thing of me. Yankees almost never appear in this town, unless they are lost. I walked into a stuccoed, leafy house on a quiet street, a house full of loud talking, hands grabbing my arms. Everyone kissed and cried over my wife, whom they hadn't seen since she was a teenager. They nicknamed me ''Wao,'' because everything they would tell me, I would say, ''Wow.'' It seemed the appropriate response. Wei-Wei, the abuelita, had come with us, or rather we had gone with her -- it ended up being probably the last time she would ever go back -- and she sent money ahead of our visit, for them to buy food with. She's always sending money, but this time she sent more, and they laid in pork and all the spices they needed. There was a long table. All of the men were named some version of Rafael, Rafaelito, RafaelÃn. The matriarch, a shy and tiny woman named Haydee (eye-day), presided with birdlike hands, making little apologies. You didn't even have to chew the pork, you could just sort of let it melt. They made chicharrones de viento, wind-crackers, the Cubans' witty name for a kind of poverty-inspired something, frisked up out of salt and flour and a little lard. There was a bottle of Havana Club on the table -- the first time I ever saw or tasted it. Knowing only a little classroom Spanish, I struggled to follow their phrases, the swift and expressive but mud-mouthed Spanish spoken on the island.
After dinner, I made the mistake of saying something about a cigar. It wasn't as if I asked for one. I probably said something like, ''I hear that your country is famous for its cigars.'' But they took this as an overpolite way of asking for one, so the hunt began. The shops were closed, but the Rafaels started working on the car. You've heard, no doubt, how in Cuba they still drive working American cars from the 1950s, but this was something else, a Frankenstein made from the parts of about four different cars from the '50s and one Russian car apparently from the '70s. They got this creature going, and we started moving through the streets. No headlights -- one of them held an electric lantern out the window. It was wired to the cigarette lighter. We needed it badly. Within a mile of leaving the town, we were in the face-close darkness of unlighted rural roads. They took me to a kind of kiosk, an open bar in the middle of a field. I don't know what it was, really. A kind of club. All of the men, about seven of them, were workers in the tobacco fields. They would smuggle out a cigar or two each week, maybe defective ones, for personal use or the chance to trade it away. Rafelito told me, ''This is the puro puro.''
Back at the house, half the neighborhood gathered to watch me huff on this thing, many, I slowly realized, hoping to see me vomit. I stood outside on a back patio, amid chicken coops. The cigar went to my head like thunder. My knees became untrustworthy. But no throwing up. Rafaelito had too much to drink and danced like a crazy person. As a boy, he lost his only brother, drowned in the river. His father, Rafael, approached me with a wagging finger, asking me if I liked the country. Of course, I said, bonita, linda y la gente.
''Si.'' He looked a little bit like a Cuban Groucho Marx. ''Si, te gusta el pais,'' he said. ''Pero, te gusta el sistema?'' He pulled the syllables of el sistema out of his mouth like draws of taffy.
Now they were all gone, all the Rafaels. The two older ones were dead from disease, and the youngest one had gone to Miami, I don't even know how. There is a kind of lottery, apparently. Perhaps he won it. He's working as a mechanic. The house was completely different. The ground floor was empty and quiet.
Haydee, the old woman of the house, was still there, even more ancient but seemingly unchanged. I saw her do the same thing now to the 6-year-old that she did to my wife those years ago, wrap her arms around the girl and sort of refuse to leave, the way a child would. ''I'm keeping her here,'' she said. ''You, go back.''
Her husband and son were gone, her grandson gone to Miami. Her other grandson, Erik, half-brother of the boy who left, was still around. In fact, he was thriving. He had started a little furniture business. He was living in the house with his wife and daughter, and all had been going well. But just months before, they lost a son, an infant, to a respiratory disease. So within a short span of years, he lost his father, grandfather and his brother (to emigration), and now his son. He was the only male in the house.
Erik's daughter, a young girl with glasses and reddish-brown hair, was as shy as her grandmother. She stayed on the edges of whatever room we were in. My daughter was at my feet, peeking through my legs at her. I could feel their intense awareness of each other, but neither would approach.
After lunch, while Erik was explaining different aspects of the furniture operation to me, my 6-year-old came up and started tugging on my shirt. She was mouthing something at me. I kept saying, ''Please don't interrupt, sweetheart.'' She said, ''Give me your phone!'' I excused myself from Erik for a second to give her a little lecture. I knew she was bored, I said, but this was an important day, and she needed to use her manners, not play with the phone. ''Give me the phone!'' she said, and ran off in a huff when I refused.
Barely 20 minutes later we went back upstairs and passed by the little girl's room. She and the 6-year-old were sitting on the bed, playing on a phone. It was my wife's. The 6-year-old had taught her cousin to play Angry Birds. They were smiling and leaning on each other. For the next two days they were completely inseparable and wanted to sleep in the same room. They communicated through my wife when they really needed to work something out. They will probably know each other for the rest of their lives now, because of that game.
We went out walking the streets, making the rounds to see other family members -- to the old church, with its brightly painted statue of St. Julian, where Wei-Wei was married and where they remembered her, ''la maestra,'' past the school where she taught and the corner store her father owned, where first she and then her children, my mother-in-law and her brother, grew up playing, before it was taken away -- and as we strolled, I had a diminished, doubtless much-flawed version of the old woman's cake-box map in my head. I was hearing her voice-over, all the stories she told me over almost 20 years now, some of them repetitive, but with details emerging and receding.
Her memories of the revolution begin with the shortwave radio, kept in the back room by her husband. Wei-Wei and her husband would gather with friends to listen to the transmissions that the Castro brothers and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos (the best loved of the young comandantes, at least by my wife's family, worshiped as a pop star by my mother-in-law, then 11) were broadcasting from the mountains, giving assurance that they were about to ride down and liberate the island. For years I assumed that the family had been listening to these speeches in fear -- as a couple, they were about as solidly middle class as could be, a teacher and a tobacco salesman, and their later experience of the revolution involved only pain and regret -- but the abuelita surprised me one night, at the table, by saying that, on the contrary, they heard those speeches with great excitement. No one liked Batista, no one who wasn't directly benefiting from his thuggery and favoritism. The powerful charisma of the freedom fighters had percolated down into even quiet, apolitical homes.
There was a night back home, after a long meal, when for the first time after knowing her for so long, I got a bit pushy with her -- asked her follow-up questions instead of just mm-hmming -- and she gave me a description of what it had actually been like to watch this optimism turn to fear, and something worse, what that had actually looked like. When the milicianos first came from the mountains, she said, ''they come to say hello with this necklace made of pieces of wood and a gold cross.'' They mugged for the cameras with these crosses in their teeth. I asked why. ''For you to look at. To pretend that they are Christian. That they believe in God.''
''Everybody cooperate with Fidel,'' she said. ''Everybody was happy that we had the opportunity to have all the freedom that he promise.'' She taught adult literacy classes at night.
Change came with the arrival of the comites, one house per block, appointed as the government representative for its households. The rapidity with which that degenerated into spying and becoming complicit in spying had been breathtaking to watch play out in stark anthropological terms. Within months, they were taking children aside at school and asking them about their parents. The parents started pulling the children out. The first nonpolitical families started to flee. People betrayed their neighbors to the comites. A woman who lived in the neighborhood, a woman named Solita, ''somebody accuse her of having fried pork in her house. And they make -- she was a teacher -- they make a public, Â¿come se llama?, juicio?'' Trial. ''Exactly. Accusing her of having pork.''
My wife's grandfather had let it be known that he was against the Castros -- not because he had preferred Batista; in fact, the family had some obscure connection, that I've never been able to get anyone to be forthcoming about, to one of the other revolutionaries in the mountains, a rival who was executed not long after the uprising -- in any case it was known that the family's sympathies did not lie with the communists. ''I remember one time we going to the farm,'' she said, ''and when we was coming back, we stop in Mario's grandmother's house, and we saw my brother passing on the road very fast. We get scared. We say, 'What happened?' He says, 'The police is going to ask for, getting into your house.' And at this time we was already saving some American money to come here. And you believe or not? The first thing that I do in the house was burning the dollars. To be sure that they don't find it out.''
The party came and took away the family business. They took the store. They took the car, covered in tobacco advertisements. They took ''a house of birds.'' Not yours anymore. They took a little dog, named Mocha. They took pictures off the wall. They came in and counted the number of pictures, and took a certain percentage of them. Absurd things. They took away the family's tiny beach house in Playa del Rosario, ''gave it to some fishman.'' But this succession of losses came to seem indistinct against what was happening outside. The picture had darkened. ''So bad, so cruel all the things that they do it,'' she said. ''The television was on all day long.'' She meant both that they were watching all day long, and that the revolutionaries were transmitting constantly. There was ''a man that the name Blanco,'' she said. And his trial concerned ''if he abuse the farmers, if he do all these things that accuse him to do it.'' They found him guilty. ''Then the people go to the street, singing, 'Paredon paredon paredon! Paredon means 'kill in front of the wall.'' And then they put this in television. And you see the brain of this man jumping out. It was getting gross and gross and gross.'' She resigned her job, and they essentially went into hiding.
She got her two children out first, my mother-in-law and her brother, on waivers made possible by the C.I.A.-initiated, Catholic-sponsored airlift known as Pedro Pan. The story goes that the C.I.A. started spreading rumors on the island that the government was about to take away the children, raise them in camps. People panicked, and the planes were waiting to fly them away. The children wound up living with Catholic families all over the United States or, in this case, with an aunt in North Carolina. Eventually Wei-Wei and her husband got out, through Mexico, and joined the children. But Pedro Pan tore apart many families.
We arrived at the house of some cousins, two twins, small men now in their 50s, one with a mustache and one without, who live with their mother, whom they tend to hover about protectively. Their father died after having walked himself to the hospital, after a heart attack. Nobody had a car, nobody's phone worked. The revolution is famous around the world for its health care, but for a Cuban, that care can be hard to access, especially if you live far from one of the major cities.
The six-year-old and her cousin were sitting on the sofa, ignoring everyone. They were holding up dolls to each other in different poses, sort of: ''What do you think of this? Do you approve of this?'' We unloaded the presents we brought for the twins. They handed my wife a book of socialist Cuban film reviews from before the revolution, actually a rare and useful book -- one of them is a from-home bookseller, and he had come across it somewhere.
As we were standing around he said, ''Did you know that my brother'' -- the one with no mustache -- ''was on a game show?''
They brought forth a VHS tape and started reconfiguring the wires to make the VCR work. Soon a picture of the studio appeared, three contestants behind their buzzers. The tape had been recorded over many times. There was a constant flickering of white meteors across the image. Felipe to the far left, smiling, looking confident in a light-green short-sleeve shirt. The game had to do with rhyming. They would say, ''Two words: one of them describes a fruit, one describes a family member.'' Answer: lima and prima. Felipe didn't win, but did well enough, as I understood it, to be invited back. He looked on screen like he was having a great time. The show had a carefree attitude, compared with something similar in the United States. The stakes were very low. You can't have games of chance or leisure games involving any amount of money, they said. It was outlawed by the revolution, as part of the purifying backlash against the mob-led casino power. So the prizes were things like a signed poster of a famous Spanish pop singer or a decorative mirror. Nobody was going to cry over losing. We congratulated Felipe on having held his own. He brought out the small metal lamp-sculpture he won.
Before we left the country, we spent a last day and night in Havana. Heaven weather. We stepped into the grand cathedral, on one of the main squares in the old part of town, and listened to a women's choir that was practicing for the pope. I saw blue-and-red signs announcing his impending visit, ''Viene el Papa!'' The women and girls were dressed in their everyday clothes. They sang beautifully. I'm sure that they were the best that Cuba had.
In the evening, we stood on the Morro, the Spanish castillo across the bay from the MalecÃ³n, and looked at the city. There is a Havana -- this was the second time I saw it, a confirmation -- that cannot be captured on photographs, because it involves a totality of light from symphonic Caribbean clouds and the way they play on the whole city, and that appears often enough to represent one of the characteristic faces of the city. The diffused light turns all the buildings a range of pastels. Then as the sun reddens, it becomes rose-colored.
It was 9:30 by the time we got back to our hotel. Normally that would have been past the 6-year-old's bedtime, but my wife had a telephone interview -- meant to happen during the day, it got bumped -- so she needed us out of the room for an hour.
Downstairs we sat and listened to the band do the inescapable (in Havana) ''Hasta Siempre, Comandante,'' with its strange lyrics, ''Here lies the clear/the precious transparency/of your dear presence/Comandante Che Guevara.'' Cats were slinking around. The people going by were of every shade, and many with striking faces. In the most Spanish faces you could see flashes of the Old World stock that supplied the island with settlers: the equine noses, the long mouths, at times a Middle Eastern cast, features I knew from my wife's family pictures.
On the sidewalk a young bicycle-taxi driver named Manuel approached us, a well-built kid in jean shorts and a tank-top, about 19. He said he knew an ice cream place that was still open. We set out through the night. Many of the streets were dark. It was chilly already, and the 6-year-old huddled against my side. It was one of those moments when you know that you are where you're supposed to be. If your destiny wavered, it has at least momentarily recovered its track. We ate our chocolate ice cream at an outdoor bar, under a half moon.
On the way back to the hotel, Manuel asked what I did. When I told him I was a reporter, he said: ''You'd hate it here. There is no freedom of expression here.''
He launched into a tirade against the regime. ''It is basically a prison,'' he said. ''Everyone is afraid.''
The things he said, which I had heard many times before -- that you can go to prison for nothing, that there's no opportunity, that people are terrified to speak out -- are the reason I can never quite get with my leftie-most friends on Cuba, when they want to make excuses for the regime. It's simply a fact that nearly every Cuban I've ever come to know beyond a passing acquaintance, everyone not involved with the party, will turn to you at some point and say something along the lines of, ''It is a prison here.'' I just heard it from one of the men who worked for Erik, back in the hometown. I remarked to him that storefronts on the streets looked a little bit better, more freshly painted. It was a shallow, small-talky observation.
''No,'' he said, turning his head and exhaling smoke.
''You mean things haven't improved?'' I said.
''There is no future,'' he said. ''We are lost.''
The 6-year-old kept asking me what Manuel was saying. I was doing my best to describe el sistema. Interesting trying to explain to a child educated in a Quaker Montessori school what could possibly be wrong with everyone sharing.
We passed the museum with the Granma, the leisure boat that in 1956 carried Fidel and RaÃºl and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos and 78 other Cuban revolutionaries from Mexico to a beach on the island's southeast coast. The cruiser was all lighted up with aquamarine lights, in a building made of glass. It looked underwater. Manuel stopped the bicycle-taxi and gazed on it with obvious pride.
''There's always an armed guard in front of it,'' he said, nodding his head toward a young man in a green uniform, who was standing with a machine gun over his shoulder.
''They're worried that someone will try to blow it up or something?'' I said.
''They're worried that someone will steal it and go to Miami,'' he said.
There was a time Mariana took me to Cuba, and we went to a town called Remedios, in the central part of the island. It is one of the most ancient Cuban cities. The church on the main square dates from the Renaissance. When it was restored in the 1950s, the workers discovered that under the white paint on the high ceiling was a layer of pure gold. The townspeople had safeguarded it from the pirates in that manner. We stayed in the home of a man named Piloto. A friendly bicycle-taxi driver, who introduced himself as Max, told us that Piloto worked for the government and rented out his spare room only in order to spy on tourists, and that we should be careful what we said there. But all we ever got from Piloto and his wife was a nearly silent politeness and one night a superb lobster dinner. My most vivid memory of Remedios is of being taken to the house of an artist who lived there, a woodcarver. The bicycle-taxi driver told us that anyone who had ''a great interest in culture'' needed to visit the home of this particular artist. The next day he took us there, in the afternoon. We rode behind a row of houses that had strange paintings and animal figures hanging in their breezeways. After what seemed a long time for a bicycle-taxi ride, we arrived at the woman's place. Taking out a cigarette, Max told us to walk ahead, he would wait. At the door of a small, salmon-colored house, an old woman met us. Not the artist, it emerged. This was the artist's mother. We sat with her in a kind of narrow front parlor, where she made sweetly formal small talk for maybe 20 minutes, telling us every so often that the artist would be out soon.
At a certain moment, a woman appeared in the passageway that led from the front room into the main part of the house, a woman with rolls of fat on her limbs, like a baby, and skin covered in moles. She walked on crutches with braces on her knees. She had a beautiful natural Afro with a scarf tied around it. She was simply a visually magnificent human being. She told us the prices of her works, and we bought a little chicken carving. She said almost nothing otherwise -- she had difficulty speaking -- but when we stood up to leave, she lifted a hand and spoke, or rather delivered, this sentence. It was evidently the message among all others that she deemed most essential for U.S. visitors. ''I know that at present there are great differences between our peoples,'' she said, ''but in the future all will be well, because we are all the sons and daughters of Abraham Lincoln.''

HEADLINE: Rich as the Devil, But No Gordon Gekko

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
The television series ''666 Park Avenue,'' whose title invites little thematic speculation, arrives next week on ABC and will be, to the best of my knowledge, the second time an architecturally significant apartment building in Manhattan has been deployed as a fictional vessel for Satanism. The reason would seem fairly clear; you just can't situate allegories of demonic venality or depraved ambition as persuasively in places like Philadelphia, White Plains or San Diego. Had New York City as we now know it existed in 1600, civilization would have been forever left to reckon with the Macbeths of East 78th Street.
Roman Polanski famously filmed the Dakota as the setting for ''Rosemary's Baby,'' the story of an actor who trades his wife's uterus and sanity for the promise of his own career ascension. Oh, for the time when aspiration in New York meant How Far You'd Go to Advance in Theater. In the era of the '60s, when the film was made, the devil worshipers arrived in the form of the young couple's aging eccentric neighbors. On ''666 Park Avenue,'' the Ansonia on Broadway stands in for a residence on the East Side, and the Satanists aren't oddballs; they're in real estate. 
Gavin and Olivia Doran, the building's owners, live in a world of galas, minions, Chanel and patois that carries with it a Romneyesque disdain for the unheralded.
''What can I say? It's New York,'' they'll tell you. ''Not everyone gets to make it.''
The show stands as the latest in a series of pop cultural products created in the years of the downturn to render the world of moneyed New York in all of its aesthetically tantalizing moral vacuity -- big, art-filled apartments, avaricious judgments. But it is arguably indicative of how temperate the ostensible class wars have actually been that few of these efforts have gained any real traction or approached the status of cultural obligation.
The '80s weren't even over by the time we were handed iconic portrayals of the city during the leveraged buyout years: Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities''; Mike Nichols's ''Working Girl,'' the story of a Staten Island secretary whose intuitive business sense allows her to vanquish her slimy, patrician investment-banker boss. Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' was released in 1987 and immediately created, in the name of Gordon Gekko, a synonym for the grossly immodest habits of the '80s. The 2010 sequel, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,'' which deposited Gekko in the world of 2008 only to have him shaking his head at the deceits committed in the name of credit default swaps, failed to meet commercial expectations (and delivered not a single phrase to the vernacular).
More recently, we've had ''Arbitrage,'' the new film starring Richard Gere as an investor known as ''the Oracle of Gracie Square,'' a man so cosseted he is forced to ask, ''What's an Applebee's?'' His private behavior hardly compensates for his professional betrayals. Battling in two theaters of operation, the film has him working to conceal his suspicious bookkeeping as he tries to obscure his complicity in the death of his mistress. Well reviewed and indisputably timely, the film might have attracted a large audience, or at least what passes for one today. Instead, its box-office earnings have been meager; when I went to see it one evening last week, there were approximately a half-dozen people in the audience.
Other movies, television shows and books similar in subject and perspective have gone to dust or have been contained at the margins. ''Dirty Sexy Money,'' a campy ABC satire about a rich Manhattan family and the compromised lawyer entrusted to protect it, managed only a short life. ''The Darlings,'' a former Goldman Sachs analyst's novel of hedge fund Ponzi scheming, published this year, seemed merely to come and go. ''Damages,'' the truly addictive legal drama that spun plots out of the Bernard Madoff tale of greed, reprobate chief executives and the evils of insider trading, ended its five-season run on DirecTV two weeks ago with very little fanfare or discussion.
''Stop Beating Up the Rich,'' reads the title of an article in the current issue of Fortune magazine. But one is compelled to ask: Is anyone throwing punches? The recent one-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street served only to remind us how little has really changed.
This summer, a survey from GlobeScan, a research company that works for corporations and nonprofit organizations, revealed that 58 percent of Americans agreed with the statement ''The rich deserved their wealth.'' By comparison, the international study revealed that just 45 percent of Britons and 31 percent of the French felt that way.
And economic disparity, especially in New York, is hardly diminishing. Last week, census numbers showed that the median income for the lowest fifth of New Yorkers was $8,844, down $463 from 2010. For the highest, it was $223,285, up $1,919. The wealthiest fifth of Manhattanites made more than 40 times as much as what the lowest fifth reported, a gap that widened over the previous year. Isn't the devil in the differentials?

HEADLINE: A Prison, a Paradise

BYLINE: By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN

 BODY:
On the plane, something odd but also vaguely magical-seeming happened: namely, nobody knew what time it was. Right before we landed, the flight attendant made an announcement, in English and Spanish, that although daylight saving time recently went into effect in the States, the island didn't observe that custom. As a result, we had caught up -- our time had passed into sync with Cuban time. You will not need to change your watches. Then, moments later, she came on again and apologized. She had been wrong, she said. The time in Cuba was different. She didn't specify how many hours ahead. At that point, people around us looked at one another. How could the airline not know what time it is where we're going? Another flight attendant, hurrying down the aisle, said loudly, ''I just talked to some actual Cubans, in the back, and they say it'll be the same time.'' That settled it: we would be landing in ignorance. We knew our phones weren't going to work because they were tied to a U.S. company that didn't operate on the island.
The 6-year-old sat between us, looking back and forth at our faces. ''Is something wrong?'' she asked. 
''No,'' my wife, Mariana, said, ''just funny.'' But to me she did the eyebrows up and down.
''What?'' I said.
''Nothing,'' she said, ''just -- into the zone.''
Mi esposa travels to Cuba every so many years, to do movie-related research (she's a film-studies professor) and to visit her mother's family, a dwindling number of which, as death and emigration have surpassed the birthrate, still live in the same small inland town, a dusty, colonial-looking agricultural town, not a place anyone's heard of. To them, even after half a century, it's the querencia, an untranslatable Spanish word that means something like ''the place where you are your most authentic self.'' They won't go on about Cuba around you in a magic-realist way. Nor do they dream of trying to reclaim their land when the Castros die. Destiny settled their branch of the family not in Florida, where, if you're Cuban-American, your nostalgia and anger (and sense of community) are continually stoked, but in Carolina del Norte, where nobody cares. They tend to be fairly laid back about politics. But their memories stitch helplessly back to and through that town over generations, back to the ur-ancestors who came from a small village in the Canary Islands.
My wife's 91-year-old Cuban grandmother, who lives with us much of the time, once drew for me on top of a white cake box a map of their hometown. It started out like something you would make to give someone directions but ended up as detailed in places as a highway atlas. More so, really, because it was personally annotated. Here is the corner where my father have the bodega. Here is the alley where the old man used to walk his grandson, in a white suit, and we always say, 'Let's go to watch it,' because he have his pocket full of stones, and when the boy runs, the old man throw and hit him in the legs. She was remembering back through Castro and Batista, back through all of that, into the time of Machado, even back through him into her parents' time, the years of mustachioed GÃ³mez in his black frock coat. The night I met her, 18 years ago, she cooked me Turkish-delight-level black beans with Spanish olives, and flan in a coffee can. She said: ''Mira, Yon, at this time'' -- she meant the early '40s -- ''they make a census, all the teacher go to have a census in Cuba. We see places nobody know the name. I ride a small horse. One night there is a storm -- we pass the storm under a palma. In one house is un enano. You know what is? A dwarf. He say, 'I count half!' '' Her stories are like that. You actually want them to go longer. This is no small thing for me, as my life has evolved by unforeseen paths such that I see more of this abuelita than of any other human being. Neither of us ever leaves the house, and during the day it's the two of us. Those could be some paw-chewingly long hours in the kitchen, if she were talking to me about religion or something. Mostly she calls people in Miami and watches Univision at the same time, waiting for my wife and daughters to get home, after which she perks up.
Because my wife and her family have living relatives in Cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from Miami. The legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. But you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. I first tagged along 12 years ago. It's hands down the strangest way to travel to Cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it's the simplest. But the airport bureaucracy in Miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. That first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of Miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. I spoke hardly any Spanish then. My wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about Havana and messages for various people in their town. Now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that I took to mean, ''Words aren't necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,'' but that when I think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, ''You, simpleton.''
One line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. A couple of muscly Latin guys in shorts were waiting there. They lifted each suitcase or bag onto a little spinning platform, turned it blazingly fast to seal it in industrial-strength shrink-wrap from a roll that looked like it held a landfill's worth and charged you for it. Their spinning was so energetic, it doubled as a feat of strength. Everyone watched. The reasons behind the plastic were not laid out. Later in the waiting area, a woman told us it was to discourage quick-fingered Cuban bag handlers on the other side. They took not gold and money, which few people were foolish enough to pack, but toothpaste and shampoo, necessities. This year, however, the plastic wrap was optional.
There were other post-Bush differences in the direct-to-Cuba zone. The lines had grown fewer and shorter. Most noticeable, the Cubans on our flight -- a mixture of Cuban-Americans and returning Cuban nationals who had been in Florida or D.C. on visas of their own (some people do move back and forth) -- weren't carrying as much stuff. The crowd cast a fairly normal profile. Last time, people had multiple pairs of shoes tied around their necks by the laces. Thick gorgets of reading glasses. Men wearing 10 hats, several pairs of pants, everybody's pockets bulging. Everybody wearing fanny packs. The rule was, if you could get it onto your body, you could bring it aboard. At least five people carried giant stuffed animals and other large toys. That's one of the things in the Cuban-American community, in which going back is generally frowned upon -- but if it's to meet your nieto for the first time. . . .
None of that, though, is what makes the Miami-to-Havana flights strange. It's that this most obvious route, more than any of the much longer workarounds by which American citizens can get to the island, lets you feel most fully the truth of Cuba's sheer proximity. It's one of those flights in which, almost as soon as you reach your maximum altitude, you begin your descent, and within minutes you're looking down on a diorama of palm trees growing incongruously in green fields, and within seconds you hit the ground and everyone bursts into applause. The country you land in is too unlike your own to have been reached that quickly, all but instantaneously, and is after all, you recall, on hostile terms with your own. As if you've passed through a warp. â[#x20ac]©''Why are they clapping?'' the 6-year-old asked.
I explained that it was special, coming here. Some of these people, when they left Cuba, might have thought they would never see it again. Some had been hearing about it all their lives and were seeing it for the first time.
''Also, they like to clap and yell,'' my wife said.
The 6-year-old did her philosopher face, gazing out the window. She gets a little dimple on her forehead when the big thoughts are brewing. ''Now I'm here,'' she said.
''Yes, you are.''
''And I'm Cuban,'' she said.
''You are part Cuban, that's true.''
''You're not any Cuban,'' she said, not meanly, just sort of marveling.
She looks like me, pale with blue eyes and light brown hair and freckles. Yet she has largely been raised day to day by intense, dark-eyed Cuban-American women, and their blood is in her, and the history of their family, with all of its drama and all of its issues, has exerted an incalculable influence on who and what she is. At some point in her life, she'll have to figure out what all of that means to her; the whole story and the way she looks will be part of its strangeness. For me it was all behind glass. I felt the sudden separation between us, between the relative depths of what this trip would mean to us, many years on. One of those moments of generational wooziness that come with having kids, like realizing there's a part of their lives you won't see.
We landed under searingly vivid skies, something like what the blue tablet from a packet of Easter dye lets off. The land right around the airport is farmed; we saw a man plowing with oxen. The fertility of Cuba is the thing you can't put into words. I've never stood on a piece of ground as throbbingly, even pornographically, generative. Throw a used battery into a divot, and it will put out shoots -- that's how it feels. You could smell it, in the smoky, slightly putrid smell of turned fields. More and more, as we drove, that odor mingled with the smell of the sea.
This was the first time I was in post-Fidel Cuba. It was funny to think that not long ago, there were smart people who doubted that such a thing could exist, i.e., who believed that with the fall of Fidel would come the fall of Communism on the island. But Fidel didn't fall. He did fall, physically -- on the tape that gets shown over and over in Miami, of him coming down the ramp after giving that speech in 2004 and tumbling and breaking his knee -- but his leadership didn't. He executed one of the most brilliantly engineered successions in history, a succession that was at the same time a self-entrenchment. First, he faked his own death in a way: serious intestinal operation, he might not make it. RaÃºl is brought in as ''acting president.'' A year and a half later, Castro mostly recovered. But RaÃºl is officially named president, with Castro's approval. It was almost as if, ''Is Fidel still . . . ?'' Amazing. So now they rule together, with RaÃºl out front, but everyone understanding that Fidel retains massive authority. Not to say that RaÃºl doesn't wield power -- he has always had plenty -- but it's a partnership of some kind. What comes after is as much of a mystery as ever.
Our relationship with them seems just as uncertain. Barack Obama was going to open things up, and he did tinker with the rules regarding travel, but now they say that when you try to follow these rules, you get caught up in all kinds of forms and tape. He eased the restrictions on remittances, so more money is making it back to the island, and that may have made the biggest difference so far. Boats with medical and other relief supplies have recently left Miami, sailing straight to the island, which hasn't happened in decades. These humanitarian shipments can, according to The Miami Herald, include pretty much anything a Cuban-American family wants to send to its relatives: Barbie dolls, electronics, sugary cereal. In many cases, you have a situation in which the family is first wiring money over, then shipping the goods. The money is used on the other side to pay the various fees associated with getting the stuff. So it's as if you're reaching over and re-buying the merchandise for your relatives. The money, needless to say, goes to the government. Still, capitalism is making small inroads. And RaÃºl has taken baby steps toward us: Cubans can own their own cars, operate their own businesses, own property. That's all new. For obvious reasons it's not an immediate possibility for a vast majority of the people, and it could be taken away tomorrow morning by decree, but it matters.
Otherwise, our attitude toward Cuba feels very wait and see, as what we're waiting to see grows less and less clear. We've learned to live with it, like when the doctor says, ''What you have could kill you, but not before you die a natural death.'' Earlier this year Obama said to a Spanish newspaper: ''No authoritarian regime will last forever. The day will come in which the Cuban people will be free.'' Not, notice, no dictator can live forever, but no ''authoritarian regime.'' But how long can one last? Two hundred years?
Perhaps a second term will be different. All presidents, if they want to mess with our Cuba relations at even the microscopic level, find themselves up against the Florida community, and those are large, powerful and arguably insane forces.
My wife's people got out in the early 1960s, so they've been in the States for half a century. Lax regulations, strict regulations. It's all a oneness. They take, I suppose, a Cuban view, that matters on the island are perpetually and in some way inherently screwed up and have been forever.
There was a moment in the taxi, a little nothing exchange but so densely underlayered with meaning that if you could pass it through an extracting machine, you would understand a lot about how it is between Cubans and Cuban-Americans. The driver, a guy who said he grew up in Havana, told a tiny lie, or a half lie. The fact that you can't even say whether it was a lie or not is significant. My wife had asked him to explain for me the way it works with Cuba's two separate currencies, CUPs and CUCs, Cuban pesos and convertible pesos (also called ''chavitos'' or simply ''dollars''). When I was last there, we didn't use either of these, though both existed. We paid for everything in actual, green U.S. dollars. That's what people wanted. There were stores in which you could pay in only dollars. But in 2004, Castro decided -- partly as a gesture of contempt for the U.S. embargo -- that he would abolish the use of U.S. dollars on the island and enforce the use of CUCs, pegged to the U.S. dollar but distinct from it. This coexisted alongside the original currency, which would remain pegged to the spirit of the revolution. For obvious reasons, the actual Cuban peso is worth much less than the other, dollar-equivalent Cuban peso, something on the order of 25 to 1. But the driver said simply, ''No, they are equal.''
''Really?'' my wife said. ''No . . . that can't be.''
He insisted that there was no difference between the relative values of the currencies. They were the same.
He knew that this was wrong. He probably could have told you the exchange rates from that morning. But he also knew that it had a rightness in it. For official accounting purposes, the two currencies are considered equivalent. Their respective values might fluctuate on a given day, of course, but it couldn't be said that the CUP was worth less than the CUC That's partly what he meant. He also meant that if you're going to fly to Cuba from Miami and rub it in my face that our money is worth one twenty-fifth of yours, I'm gonna feed you some hilarious communist math and see how you like it. Cubans call it la doble moral. Meaning, different situations call forth different ethical codes. He wasn't being deceptive. He was saying what my wife forced him to say. She had been a bit breezy, it seemed, in mentioning the unevenness between the currencies, which is the kind of absurdity her family would laugh at affectionately in the kitchen. But they don't have to suffer it anymore. And he was partly reminding her of that, fencing her off from a conversation in which Cubans would joke together about the notion that the CUP and the CUC had even the slightest connection to each other. That was for them, that laughter. So, a very complex statement, that not-quite-lie. After it, he was totally friendly and dropped us at one of the Cuban-owned tourist hotels on the edge of Havana.
People walking by on the street didn't seem as skinny. That was the most instantly perceptible difference, if you were seeing RaÃºl's Cuba for the first time. They weren't sickly looking before, but under Fidel you noticed more the way men's shirts flapped about them and the knobbiness of women's knees. Now people were filling out their clothes. The island's overall dietary level had apparently gone up a tick. (One possible factor involved was an increase in the amount of food coming over from the United States. Unknown to most people, we do sell a lot of agricultural products to Cuba, second only in value to Brazil. Under a law that Bill Clinton squeaked through on his way out, Cuba purchases food and medicine from us on a cash basis, meaning, bizarrely, that a lot of the chicken in the arroz con pollo consumed on the island by Canadian tourists is raised in the Midwest -- the embargo/blockade has always been messy when you lean in close).
The idea was to spend some days traveling around, before going to see family. Once you see them, it gets emotional, and after that, sightseeing feels wrong somehow.
The ladies wanted to visit the Havana aquarium before it closed for the day -- my wife went there when she was younger -- so they took off. The hostility of the hotel workers was to be experienced. I started making up reasons to approach them, just to provoke it and make sure I hadn't imagined it. My reflex during an odd social interaction is to assume fault, and this can create its own distortion, making it hard to see what the other person is doing, but no, these people were being fantastically unfriendly. It was one of the big, newly built Gaviota hotels -- Gaviota is the quasi-official Cuban tourist organization (financed in part by transnational investment but controlled by a prominent Cuban general). Loosely speaking, these men and women worked for the government. It's not that they were incompetent or mean; they just had zero motivation to be nice to tourists or in a hurry to do anything for them, and for me, after years immersed in a may-I-pour-you-more-sweet-tea culture, the contrast held a fascination. In a way it was refreshing to see people so emphatically not kowtowing to rich white tourists, even if that was you, but of course this feeling was not to be trusted: you liked their unfriendliness because they seemed more authentically anti-capitalist that way. Especially wild was a woman about my age at the main reception desk, who evidently had to handle all the complaints about the wee-fee service in the lobby. She looked at you dead-level and half-smiling when you approached as if in her mind she were already pushing in the blade. At the desk, they sold little scratch cards, with passwords on them, that looked like lottery tickets and in hindsight had much else in common with lottery tickets. But there were no cards that day. ''They are in the city,'' she said -- and in my mind I saw them being unloaded from small boats at night -- ''but we don't have them here.'' I was advised to try the hotel next door, a few minutes' walk -- another, equally massive, equally generically pan-Latin-style Gaviota hotel. Would a card I bought there work here? ''I hope so,'' she said, still doing that smile. ''But,'' I said, ''we made reservations at this hotel specifically because you advertised the wee-fee service.'' A total lie. We didn't need it. I wanted to see if she would crack. She shook her head so slowly with exaggeratedly sincere sorrow, like a long-suffering teacher forced to tell her most obnoxious pupil he had failed. ''I understand,'' she murmured, and went back to work.
Partly what had been clashing were our respective ideas about the role of an individual in solving a crisis. In the United States, we all go around so empowered-feeling all the time, and when you travel you feel it, a sense of hypertrophy, the thing that makes us look like giant babies to the Europeans. Bring us our soda refills or we'll get them ourselves! The sheer notion that I thought she herself could do anything about the wee-fee, about getting the cards here faster, was probably genuinely amusing to her. Did I not think she wanted the wee-fee fixed? Did I think she actually liked standing there answering the exact same question from a never-ending line of childishly outraged foreigners?
At the neighboring hotel, they did have cards. But their wee-fee was down. ''It's not working?'' I asked the man. ''It's working,'' he said, ''but not right now.'' The whole island's Internet runs through three unpredictable satellites, although I had read that a cable of some kind was recently installed. If so, it did not get routed to these hotels. Which was lucky in the end -- it accelerated the technological molting that had to happen and left you feeling more present. In the basement, near the business center (where a woman took delight in telling travelers from all lands that they could not do various simple-sounding things on the computer consoles), I noticed a small postcard that showed a picture of Fidel, and the caption read in Spanish, ''In the history of U.S. intelligence, no greater amount of money and resources have been put toward bringing down a single man than have been spent to get Fidel.'' And below that, ''El mÃ©rito es estar vivo.'' Roughly, ''the victory lies in staying alive.''
I kept seeing small groups of Asian men get on and off the elevators. That was new. Ten years ago the only Asian faces you might have seen were in Chinatown -- there is one in Havana, Barrio Chino, several square blocks of ostensibly Chinese restaurants and faded signs with lanterns and pagodas on them, a neighborhood left behind by thousands of Chinese agricultural workers who arrived in the 19th century, and where very occasionally you might still see Asian features. These guys -- all men, I saw no women -- seemed dressed as inconspicuously as possible, loosefitting light-blue jeans and generic polo shirts and sunglasses. The bartender told me that they were here to do business. China was doing ''bastante de negocios'' in Cuba these days, including in oil, he said. At that moment a Chinese-made exploratory rig sat about 30 miles off the northern coast. We would be able to see it, he said, driving along the main highway. Cuba has lately been partnering with foreign petroleum companies to explore prospective undersea oil fields. A major discovery would be a mainline to economic independence, that most long-elusive goal of the revolution. So far, though, the wells have come up dry or disappointing.
Cuba's involvement with China has been intensifying for more than a decade, as Russian influence has receded. The Chinese have built an amusement park and sold fleets of buses. They have been granted use -- if our intelligence can be trusted -- of a large signals-intelligence base on the outskirts of Havana near the airport, a giant electronic ear-horn right off our shores, the price we pay for renouncing any involvement with a country so close. There is the sheer geopolitical weirdness of GuantÃ¡namo's being there, too: the Chinese and the Americans operating on the same island, off the coast of Florida. GuantÃ¡namo was supposed to be gone. It's holding on like the Castros.
The empty midafternoon lobby was vast and square-tiled and full of the drone of floor waxing, and the 6-year-old spilled into it laughing, her mother racewalking behind her, trying to catch her. They saw me at the bar and ran over. ''We have to show you this,'' the 6-year-old said. She was pulling on my wife's purse. Mariana pulled out her phone and pushed play on a movie, handing it to me. At the aquarium, a little boy had celebrated his birthday, and his parents had gone in for the dolphin special. You put the kid on a raft and pushed it out into the pool. Shortly thereafter, one of the aquarium's giant 500-pound dolphins started jumping over the kid and raft, in great looping leaps, one after the other. The splash was considerable. The kid looked terrified, he was face forward, clutching the raft at the edges. The repeating image of the dolphin -- frozen massive and pendulous directly above him -- got better every time. The audience laughed and clapped in the concrete bleachers, you could hear it on the video. My wife was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. ''You wouldn't see that in the States,'' she said proudly.
We scanned for the Chinese-built oil platform the next day, and thought we saw something once, though it may have been a ship. To ride along the coastal road with the windows down was sublime. The gaps between houses kept giving you glimpses of the sea behind. There weren't many other cars, but the few that passed left a heavy, organic smell of exhaust in the air. You could taste dinosaurs in it. It carried that precatalytic-converter nostalgia. We were driving down the spine of Cuba, into the vast green interior of the island. Hitchhikers were scattered along the highway, as were people selling various things -- garlic, strings of fish. They ran at you as you passed, yelling and seeming to come too close to the car.
I woke up the next day to the sounds of morning pool activity. Water splashing on concrete. Insistent, unfamiliar bird song. Sleepy murmurs of people rubbing lotion on themselves. Hotel carts rattled by outside the double glass doors. It was about 8 a.m. in Varadero on a warm spring day, which I'm pretty sure is literally Utopia, in some vague historico-linguistic way: the northern shore of Cuba, that supposedly moved Columbus to call this the most beautiful place human eyes had ever seen. My wife has a thing about going to Varadero when she goes to Cuba. I don't know if she even likes it. She does it for her family. To them it would seem insane to skip it -- it was the place they most wanted to go when they lived there -- not to go, on returning, would be like taking a trip to Keystone, S.D., and not going to see Mount Rushmore.
Sitting up in my twin bed, I looked over at the queen bed -- they were already gone. The massive cafeteria operation swung into motion for only a couple of hours each morning. You had to be there for the stampede. We were moving through different micro-Cubas so quickly; too quickly, really. The day before we rode horses through the jungle to see the ruins of ancient coffee plantations and the stone huts where the slaves were kept. We passed cooperative villages of campesinos in the forest and heard political speeches coming from loudspeakers, something about the new agriculture laws. The previous night, coming in on the suddenly pitch-black Cuban highways, zooming up to unlighted ''Road Closed'' signs at 60 miles an hour, swerving to miss car-killing potholes and horse-drawn wagons . . . that was already dreamlike. And now we were navigating the omelet and cereal stations, in lines of mainly European tourists: Germans, Italians, Central Europeans and also Brazilians, Argentines and Canadians. (You know when you're meeting a Canadian, because they always ask, in the same shocked tone, ''How did you get into the country?'' It's an opportunity to remind you that you can't go legally, and they can. And by extension, that they come from a more enlightened land. ''You need to grow up about that stuff,'' one guy that I met at a nature preserve said, to which I wanted to tell him to get a large and powerful population of Cuban exiles and move them into an election-determining province of Canada and call me in the morning.)
The cook at the omelet station, when he asked where I was from and I told him, put up his fists like a boxer, as if we were about to have it out, then started laughing. He told me that he had family in the United States, in Florida. That's what everyone says. You can't understand the transnationally dysfunctional, mutually implicated relationship between Cuba and Miami, that defies all embargoes and policies of ''definitive abandonment,'' until you realize that the line often cuts through families, almost always, in fact. People make all sorts of inner adjustments. I told the man I hated the embargo (the blockade, as they call it) and thought it was stupid, which was both true and what he wanted to hear. He gave me a manly clap-grasp. I didn't go on and say, of course, that I disliked the embargo most because it, more than anything, has kept the Castros in power for half a century, given them a ready-made Goliath for their David. Thanks to the embargo, when the Castros rail against us as an imperialist enemy, they aren't really lying. We have in effect declared ourselves the enemy of the Cuban people and done it under the banner of their freedom, hitting Cuba in a way that, after all, makes only the people suffer, and far from punishing those in power, rewards them and buttresses their story. As for the argument that to deal with tyrants would render our foreign policy incoherent, we deal with worse every day -- we've armed worse -- and in countries that don't have a deeply intimate history with ours, going back centuries. All this because a relatively small but highly mobilized exile community holds sway in a state that has the power to elect presidents. There was no way to gauge how much of this the man would agree with. We left it at mutually thinking the embargo sucked.
Out by the pool, where my wife and daughter were swimming, I lay on a chaise in the shade, feeling paler and softer than I ever had in my life and unlocatably depressed in the way that resorts do so well. I read ''Doctor Zhivago,'' a new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (the husband-and-wife team who have been retranslating the Russian classics for more than 20 years). ''Zhivago'' isn't on the Tolstoy/Chekhov level, but there are wonderful passages, including one that I thought spoke to the gruffness you often encounter in Cubans, the excessive suspicion of introductory small talk they sometimes demonstrate. ''The fear known as spymania,'' Pasternak wrote about Russia after the revolution, ''had reduced all speech to a single formal, predictable pattern. The display of good intentions in discourse was not conducive to conversation.''
Every time I looked up from the book, there were more people in and by the pool, as if they were surfacing out of the water, out of the ripples. I had black sunglasses on, so after a while I propped myself at an angle at which I could seem to read the book but really be moving my eyeballs, staring at everybody. God, the human body! It was Speedos and bikinis, no matter the age or body type. You would never see a poolside scene in the United States with people showing this much skin, except at a pool where people were there precisely to show off the perfection of their bodies. The body not consciously sculptured through working out has become a secret shame and grotesquerie in America, but this upper-class Euro-Latin crowd had not received that news, to my distraction. I took in veins and cellulite, paunches and man-paps, the weird shinglelike sagging that starts to occur on the back of the thighs, cleavage that showed a spoiled-grape-like wrinkling, the ash-mottled skin of permanently sun-torched shoulders, all of it beautiful. All of it beautiful and tormenting. You watched an 18-year-old Argentine girl in her reproductive springtime walk past an ancient Soviet-looking woman, her body a sculpture of blocks atop blocks, and both of them wearing black bikinis, the furtive looks they gave each other, full of emotions straight from the Pliocene, from the savanna. The old men scowled from behind mirrored shades. The young men tensed every muscle in order to seem not obsessed with how the girls saw them, a level of self-consciousness I found I could no longer really re-enter, as if it had been a drunken state. Everybody was stealing looks at one another, envying or disdaining or gazing, like me. We were all inside a matrix of lust and erotic sadness, all turning into versions of one another, or seeing our past selves.
My wife's people come from a small town with a strange name, a rare Spanish word that almost doesn't look Spanish when you see it. When they lived there, the place was not considered all that far from things, from the cities, but the decay of infrastructure, the collapse of the trains, has left it stranded. There's simply no reason to have heard of it.
The first time I went, before we were married, they made a big thing of me. Yankees almost never appear in this town, unless they are lost. I walked into a stuccoed, leafy house on a quiet street, a house full of loud talking, hands grabbing my arms. Everyone kissed and cried over my wife, whom they hadn't seen since she was a teenager. They nicknamed me ''Wao,'' because everything they would tell me, I would say, ''Wow.'' It seemed the appropriate response. Wei-Wei, the abuelita, had come with us, or rather we had gone with her -- it ended up being probably the last time she would ever go back -- and she sent money ahead of our visit, for them to buy food with. She's always sending money, but this time she sent more, and they laid in pork and all the spices they needed. There was a long table. All of the men were named some version of Rafael, Rafaelito, RafaelÃn. The matriarch, a shy and tiny woman named Haydee (eye-day), presided with birdlike hands, making little apologies. You didn't even have to chew the pork, you could just sort of let it melt. They made chicharrones de viento, wind-crackers, the Cubans' witty name for a kind of poverty-inspired something, frisked up out of salt and flour and a little lard. There was a bottle of Havana Club on the table -- the first time I ever saw or tasted it. Knowing only a little classroom Spanish, I struggled to follow their phrases, the swift and expressive but mud-mouthed Spanish spoken on the island.
After dinner, I made the mistake of saying something about a cigar. It wasn't as if I asked for one. I probably said something like, ''I hear that your country is famous for its cigars.'' But they took this as an overpolite way of asking for one, so the hunt began. The shops were closed, but the Rafaels started working on the car. You've heard, no doubt, how in Cuba they still drive working American cars from the 1950s, but this was something else, a Frankenstein made from the parts of about four different cars from the '50s and one Russian car apparently from the '70s. They got this creature going, and we started moving through the streets. No headlights -- one of them held an electric lantern out the window. It was wired to the cigarette lighter. We needed it badly. Within a mile of leaving the town, we were in the face-close darkness of unlighted rural roads. They took me to a kind of kiosk, an open bar in the middle of a field. I don't know what it was, really. A kind of club. All of the men, about seven of them, were workers in the tobacco fields. They would smuggle out a cigar or two each week, maybe defective ones, for personal use or the chance to trade it away. Rafelito told me, ''This is the puro puro.''
Back at the house, half the neighborhood gathered to watch me huff on this thing, many, I slowly realized, hoping to see me vomit. I stood outside on a back patio, amid chicken coops. The cigar went to my head like thunder. My knees became untrustworthy. But no throwing up. Rafaelito had too much to drink and danced like a crazy person. As a boy, he lost his only brother, drowned in the river. His father, Rafael, approached me with a wagging finger, asking me if I liked the country. Of course, I said, bonita, linda y la gente.
''Si.'' He looked a little bit like a Cuban Groucho Marx. ''Si, te gusta el pais,'' he said. ''Pero, te gusta el sistema?'' He pulled the syllables of el sistema out of his mouth like draws of taffy.
Now they were all gone, all the Rafaels. The two older ones were dead from disease, and the youngest one had gone to Miami, I don't even know how. There is a kind of lottery, apparently. Perhaps he won it. He's working as a mechanic. The house was completely different. The ground floor was empty and quiet.
Haydee, the old woman of the house, was still there, even more ancient but seemingly unchanged. I saw her do the same thing now to the 6-year-old that she did to my wife those years ago, wrap her arms around the girl and sort of refuse to leave, the way a child would. ''I'm keeping her here,'' she said. ''You, go back.''
Her husband and son were gone, her grandson gone to Miami. Her other grandson, Erik, half-brother of the boy who left, was still around. In fact, he was thriving. He had started a little furniture business. He was living in the house with his wife and daughter, and all had been going well. But just months before, they lost a son, an infant, to a respiratory disease. So within a short span of years, he lost his father, grandfather and his brother (to emigration), and now his son. He was the only male in the house.
Erik's daughter, a young girl with glasses and reddish-brown hair, was as shy as her grandmother. She stayed on the edges of whatever room we were in. My daughter was at my feet, peeking through my legs at her. I could feel their intense awareness of each other, but neither would approach.
After lunch, while Erik was explaining different aspects of the furniture operation to me, my 6-year-old came up and started tugging on my shirt. She was mouthing something at me. I kept saying, ''Please don't interrupt, sweetheart.'' She said, ''Give me your phone!'' I excused myself from Erik for a second to give her a little lecture. I knew she was bored, I said, but this was an important day, and she needed to use her manners, not play with the phone. ''Give me the phone!'' she said, and ran off in a huff when I refused.
Barely 20 minutes later we went back upstairs and passed by the little girl's room. She and the 6-year-old were sitting on the bed, playing on a phone. It was my wife's. The 6-year-old had taught her cousin to play Angry Birds. They were smiling and leaning on each other. For the next two days they were completely inseparable and wanted to sleep in the same room. They communicated through my wife when they really needed to work something out. They will probably know each other for the rest of their lives now, because of that game.
We went out walking the streets, making the rounds to see other family members -- to the old church, with its brightly painted statue of St. Julian, where Wei-Wei was married and where they remembered her, ''la maestra,'' past the school where she taught and the corner store her father owned, where first she and then her children, my mother-in-law and her brother, grew up playing, before it was taken away -- and as we strolled, I had a diminished, doubtless much-flawed version of the old woman's cake-box map in my head. I was hearing her voice-over, all the stories she told me over almost 20 years now, some of them repetitive, but with details emerging and receding.
Her memories of the revolution begin with the shortwave radio, kept in the back room by her husband. Wei-Wei and her husband would gather with friends to listen to the transmissions that the Castro brothers and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos (the best loved of the young comandantes, at least by my wife's family, worshiped as a pop star by my mother-in-law, then 11) were broadcasting from the mountains, giving assurance that they were about to ride down and liberate the island. For years I assumed that the family had been listening to these speeches in fear -- as a couple, they were about as solidly middle class as could be, a teacher and a tobacco salesman, and their later experience of the revolution involved only pain and regret -- but the abuelita surprised me one night, at the table, by saying that, on the contrary, they heard those speeches with great excitement. No one liked Batista, no one who wasn't directly benefiting from his thuggery and favoritism. The powerful charisma of the freedom fighters had percolated down into even quiet, apolitical homes.
There was a night back home, after a long meal, when for the first time after knowing her for so long, I got a bit pushy with her -- asked her follow-up questions instead of just mm-hmming -- and she gave me a description of what it had actually been like to watch this optimism turn to fear, and something worse, what that had actually looked like. When the milicianos first came from the mountains, she said, ''they come to say hello with this necklace made of pieces of wood and a gold cross.'' They mugged for the cameras with these crosses in their teeth. I asked why. ''For you to look at. To pretend that they are Christian. That they believe in God.''
''Everybody cooperate with Fidel,'' she said. ''Everybody was happy that we had the opportunity to have all the freedom that he promise.'' She taught adult literacy classes at night.
Change came with the arrival of the comites, one house per block, appointed as the government representative for its households. The rapidity with which that degenerated into spying and becoming complicit in spying had been breathtaking to watch play out in stark anthropological terms. Within months, they were taking children aside at school and asking them about their parents. The parents started pulling the children out. The first nonpolitical families started to flee. People betrayed their neighbors to the comites. A woman who lived in the neighborhood, a woman named Solita, ''somebody accuse her of having fried pork in her house. And they make -- she was a teacher -- they make a public, Â¿come se llama?, juicio?'' Trial. ''Exactly. Accusing her of having pork.''
My wife's grandfather had let it be known that he was against the Castros -- not because he had preferred Batista; in fact, the family had some obscure connection, that I've never been able to get anyone to be forthcoming about, to one of the other revolutionaries in the mountains, a rival who was executed not long after the uprising -- in any case it was known that the family's sympathies did not lie with the communists. ''I remember one time we going to the farm,'' she said, ''and when we was coming back, we stop in Mario's grandmother's house, and we saw my brother passing on the road very fast. We get scared. We say, 'What happened?' He says, 'The police is going to ask for, getting into your house.' And at this time we was already saving some American money to come here. And you believe or not? The first thing that I do in the house was burning the dollars. To be sure that they don't find it out.''
The party came and took away the family business. They took the store. They took the car, covered in tobacco advertisements. They took ''a house of birds.'' Not yours anymore. They took a little dog, named Mocha. They took pictures off the wall. They came in and counted the number of pictures, and took a certain percentage of them. Absurd things. They took away the family's tiny beach house in Playa del Rosario, ''gave it to some fishman.'' But this succession of losses came to seem indistinct against what was happening outside. The picture had darkened. ''So bad, so cruel all the things that they do it,'' she said. ''The television was on all day long.'' She meant both that they were watching all day long, and that the revolutionaries were transmitting constantly. There was ''a man that the name Blanco,'' she said. And his trial concerned ''if he abuse the farmers, if he do all these things that accuse him to do it.'' They found him guilty. ''Then the people go to the street, singing, 'Paredon paredon paredon! Paredon means 'kill in front of the wall.'' And then they put this in television. And you see the brain of this man jumping out. It was getting gross and gross and gross.'' She resigned her job, and they essentially went into hiding.
She got her two children out first, my mother-in-law and her brother, on waivers made possible by the C.I.A.-initiated, Catholic-sponsored airlift known as Pedro Pan. The story goes that the C.I.A. started spreading rumors on the island that the government was about to take away the children, raise them in camps. People panicked, and the planes were waiting to fly them away. The children wound up living with Catholic families all over the United States or, in this case, with an aunt in North Carolina. Eventually Wei-Wei and her husband got out, through Mexico, and joined the children. But Pedro Pan tore apart many families.
We arrived at the house of some cousins, two twins, small men now in their 50s, one with a mustache and one without, who live with their mother, whom they tend to hover about protectively. Their father died after having walked himself to the hospital, after a heart attack. Nobody had a car, nobody's phone worked. The revolution is famous around the world for its health care, but for a Cuban, that care can be hard to access, especially if you live far from one of the major cities.
The six-year-old and her cousin were sitting on the sofa, ignoring everyone. They were holding up dolls to each other in different poses, sort of: ''What do you think of this? Do you approve of this?'' We unloaded the presents we brought for the twins. They handed my wife a book of socialist Cuban film reviews from before the revolution, actually a rare and useful book -- one of them is a from-home bookseller, and he had come across it somewhere.
As we were standing around he said, ''Did you know that my brother'' -- the one with no mustache -- ''was on a game show?''
They brought forth a VHS tape and started reconfiguring the wires to make the VCR work. Soon a picture of the studio appeared, three contestants behind their buzzers. The tape had been recorded over many times. There was a constant flickering of white meteors across the image. Felipe to the far left, smiling, looking confident in a light-green short-sleeve shirt. The game had to do with rhyming. They would say, ''Two words: one of them describes a fruit, one describes a family member.'' Answer: lima and prima. Felipe didn't win, but did well enough, as I understood it, to be invited back. He looked on screen like he was having a great time. The show had a carefree attitude, compared with something similar in the United States. The stakes were very low. You can't have games of chance or leisure games involving any amount of money, they said. It was outlawed by the revolution, as part of the purifying backlash against the mob-led casino power. So the prizes were things like a signed poster of a famous Spanish pop singer or a decorative mirror. Nobody was going to cry over losing. We congratulated Felipe on having held his own. He brought out the small metal lamp-sculpture he won.
Before we left the country, we spent a last day and night in Havana. Heaven weather. We stepped into the grand cathedral, on one of the main squares in the old part of town, and listened to a women's choir that was practicing for the pope. I saw blue-and-red signs announcing his impending visit, ''Viene el Papa!'' The women and girls were dressed in their everyday clothes. They sang beautifully. I'm sure that they were the best that Cuba had.
In the evening, we stood on the Morro, the Spanish castillo across the bay from the MalecÃ³n, and looked at the city. There is a Havana -- this was the second time I saw it, a confirmation -- that cannot be captured on photographs, because it involves a totality of light from symphonic Caribbean clouds and the way they play on the whole city, and that appears often enough to represent one of the characteristic faces of the city. The diffused light turns all the buildings a range of pastels. Then as the sun reddens, it becomes rose-colored.
It was 9:30 by the time we got back to our hotel. Normally that would have been past the 6-year-old's bedtime, but my wife had a telephone interview -- meant to happen during the day, it got bumped -- so she needed us out of the room for an hour.
Downstairs we sat and listened to the band do the inescapable (in Havana) ''Hasta Siempre, Comandante,'' with its strange lyrics, ''Here lies the clear/the precious transparency/of your dear presence/Comandante Che Guevara.'' Cats were slinking around. The people going by were of every shade, and many with striking faces. In the most Spanish faces you could see flashes of the Old World stock that supplied the island with settlers: the equine noses, the long mouths, at times a Middle Eastern cast, features I knew from my wife's family pictures.
On the sidewalk a young bicycle-taxi driver named Manuel approached us, a well-built kid in jean shorts and a tank-top, about 19. He said he knew an ice cream place that was still open. We set out through the night. Many of the streets were dark. It was chilly already, and the 6-year-old huddled against my side. It was one of those moments when you know that you are where you're supposed to be. If your destiny wavered, it has at least momentarily recovered its track. We ate our chocolate ice cream at an outdoor bar, under a half moon.
On the way back to the hotel, Manuel asked what I did. When I told him I was a reporter, he said: ''You'd hate it here. There is no freedom of expression here.''
He launched into a tirade against the regime. ''It is basically a prison,'' he said. ''Everyone is afraid.''
The things he said, which I had heard many times before -- that you can go to prison for nothing, that there's no opportunity, that people are terrified to speak out -- are the reason I can never quite get with my leftie-most friends on Cuba, when they want to make excuses for the regime. It's simply a fact that nearly every Cuban I've ever come to know beyond a passing acquaintance, everyone not involved with the party, will turn to you at some point and say something along the lines of, ''It is a prison here.'' I just heard it from one of the men who worked for Erik, back in the hometown. I remarked to him that storefronts on the streets looked a little bit better, more freshly painted. It was a shallow, small-talky observation.
''No,'' he said, turning his head and exhaling smoke.
''You mean things haven't improved?'' I said.
''There is no future,'' he said. ''We are lost.''
The 6-year-old kept asking me what Manuel was saying. I was doing my best to describe el sistema. Interesting trying to explain to a child educated in a Quaker Montessori school what could possibly be wrong with everyone sharing.
We passed the museum with the Granma, the leisure boat that in 1956 carried Fidel and RaÃºl and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos and 78 other Cuban revolutionaries from Mexico to a beach on the island's southeast coast. The cruiser was all lighted up with aquamarine lights, in a building made of glass. It looked underwater. Manuel stopped the bicycle-taxi and gazed on it with obvious pride.
''There's always an armed guard in front of it,'' he said, nodding his head toward a young man in a green uniform, who was standing with a machine gun over his shoulder.
''They're worried that someone will try to blow it up or something?'' I said.
''They're worried that someone will steal it and go to Miami,'' he said.
There was a time Mariana took me to Cuba, and we went to a town called Remedios, in the central part of the island. It is one of the most ancient Cuban cities. The church on the main square dates from the Renaissance. When it was restored in the 1950s, the workers discovered that under the white paint on the high ceiling was a layer of pure gold. The townspeople had safeguarded it from the pirates in that manner. We stayed in the home of a man named Piloto. A friendly bicycle-taxi driver, who introduced himself as Max, told us that Piloto worked for the government and rented out his spare room only in order to spy on tourists, and that we should be careful what we said there. But all we ever got from Piloto and his wife was a nearly silent politeness and one night a superb lobster dinner. My most vivid memory of Remedios is of being taken to the house of an artist who lived there, a woodcarver. The bicycle-taxi driver told us that anyone who had ''a great interest in culture'' needed to visit the home of this particular artist. The next day he took us there, in the afternoon. We rode behind a row of houses that had strange paintings and animal figures hanging in their breezeways. After what seemed a long time for a bicycle-taxi ride, we arrived at the woman's place. Taking out a cigarette, Max told us to walk ahead, he would wait. At the door of a small, salmon-colored house, an old woman met us. Not the artist, it emerged. This was the artist's mother. We sat with her in a kind of narrow front parlor, where she made sweetly formal small talk for maybe 20 minutes, telling us every so often that the artist would be out soon.
At a certain moment, a woman appeared in the passageway that led from the front room into the main part of the house, a woman with rolls of fat on her limbs, like a baby, and skin covered in moles. She walked on crutches with braces on her knees. She had a beautiful natural Afro with a scarf tied around it. She was simply a visually magnificent human being. She told us the prices of her works, and we bought a little chicken carving. She said almost nothing otherwise -- she had difficulty speaking -- but when we stood up to leave, she lifted a hand and spoke, or rather delivered, this sentence. It was evidently the message among all others that she deemed most essential for U.S. visitors. ''I know that at present there are great differences between our peoples,'' she said, ''but in the future all will be well, because we are all the sons and daughters of Abraham Lincoln.''

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Bracing for Hurricane Barclays

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
THEY talk about it as if it were a force of nature.
''We're bracing ourselves, almost like hurricane preparedness, where you go out and tape the windows and buy the candles and you are not sure if it's going to come -- and if it does, if it's ever going to get back to normal,'' said Susan Doban, an architect who lives with her family on Bergen Street in Park Slope.
''It's like a volcano,'' said Lenny Goodstein, taking a break from renovating his brownstone in Prospect Heights. ''We don't know where the lava is going to land.''
For some, the uncertainty is almost apocalyptic. ''It's the end of the community as we know it,'' said Michelle de la Uz, the director of a nonprofit housing organization in Brooklyn, ''and the beginning of something new. What that 'new' is, we don't yet understand.'' 
On Friday, the Barclays Center arena, wedged into the borough's busiest intersection like a giant, rusty bread basket, will open after nine years of operatic disputation and delays: community lawsuits over New York State's ability to seize private land and over the developer's obligations; the collapse of the real estate market; the replacement of a star architect; the rescue from a Russian oligarch; racial friction; rats; traffic; and unfulfilled promises.
Into this den of contention move the Brooklyn Nets, a professional basketball team (with its own pockmarked past) that once again gives the borough a reason to cheer.
Amid the festivities, though, the arena stands as an island, a reminder of what is missing. The 16 surrounding towers -- primarily residential -- that were originally planned by the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, for the 22-acre, $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards project have yet to be built. The 10,000 or so jobs promised have not materialized. Of the 2,250 affordable housing units pledged out of 6,300, only 181 are planned for a first tower, and ground for the building has yet to be broken.
In the days before the hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, a part owner of the Nets, inaugurates the arena with a series of concerts, the air tingles with the dust of last-second construction and mixed emotions: excitement and wariness, anger and resignation.
Surrounding residents fear that unruly basketball fans will stagger drunkenly onto their sidewalks, that Armageddon-like traffic will blockade their streets, that already-squeezed parking spaces will be swallowed, that crime and rodents will run rampant and that housing and jobs will never come about.
Others hope that the 1,900 part-time jobs offered at the arena will help lift a severely underemployed borough, that retail chains opening along Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues will spur small businesses and that property values will soar.
For Forest City Ratner, it is a triumph just to have built the 18,200-seat sports and entertainment complex when other large-scale public-private developments, like the West Side stadium, have failed. The company deployed a sophisticated lobbying network, spent millions of dollars on legal fees and public relations efforts, leveraged $305 million in public subsidies and found allies in a divided community beyond the development-friendly Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the unrelenting borough president, Marty Markowitz.
The developer says it will build the remainder of the project, though it could take up to 25 years, and not the 10 originally planned.
''When you look at the record of this company -- and this is very serious -- we finish virtually everything,'' said Bruce C. Ratner, the chairman and chief executive of Forest City Ratner, which built The New York Times's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. ''We don't give up.''
On the precipice of change, all that people can do is wait.
''I was never particularly happy with the process to get to this point,'' Ms. Doban, the architect from Park Slope, said. ''Now I am of the mind-set that I am living in this amazing experiment and I am going to see what happens. I feel like I either have to do that or move.''
APPEARING on T-shirts and billboards and in Brooklyn coffee shop windows, the Nets' crisp two-toned logo is ubiquitous these days. The tangled history of the project is anything but black and white.
By 2002, Forest City Ratner was already Brooklyn's largest developer, best known for its seven-million-square-foot MetroTech office complex downtown and its two malls at the Atlantic Terminal transportation hub. The Bloomberg administration was rezoning and extending Downtown Brooklyn. A prime site sat opposite the malls, just outside the planned redevelopment area, with more than 8.5 acres of state-owned railroad tracks surrounded by four distinct neighborhoods bounded by Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, and Vanderbilt Avenue and Dean Street.
Unlocking the land's potential required a city administration willing to cede authority to the state government that controlled the rail yards. The arena would be the cornerstone of the development; the Nets, which Mr. Ratner bought for $300 million, would be the linchpin.
The city and the community would get jobs and housing in exchange for subsidies; the state, would get a new subway terminal and $100 million for rebuilt rail yards; the developer would make a legacy and maybe even a profit on luxury condominiums.
Brooklyn would have a major professional team for the first time since the Dodgers left for Los Angeles after the 1957 season. Frank Gehry designed a glass world that would loom over the low-rise neighborhoods of brownstones and housing projects. A park on the arena roof would connect to a 60-story office building named Miss Brooklyn that would surpass the Williamsburgh Savings Bank as the tallest building in the borough.
The project was billed as a win for all. But opponents emerged at the first news conference in December 2003, handing out cookies shaped like turkeys. Upset over the project's scale and the displacement of hundreds of people it would involve, that group evolved into Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, the plan's most vocal critic, led by Daniel Goldstein, who would later refuse to leave his condominium on the condemned arena land.
Forest City conducted an aggressive public relations campaign with the slogan ''Jobs, Housing, Hoops,'' hoping to use that platform to secure support from community organizers, public-housing residents and Brooklyn's influential black clergy.
In June 2005, it signed a ''Community Benefits Agreement'' with eight nonprofit organizations, establishing obligations of housing and hiring, and vowing to create amenities like a health care center, a meditation room, a school and eight acres of open space. The deal, lacking city authority, had inherent conflicts; three of the signatories got financing from Forest City.
An independent compliance monitor was supposed to determine if the company hit its targets. If not, it would pay $500,000 to be used by the lead signatory, Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development, or Build, a job-training group that, financed by Forest City, operates out of MetroTech. The monitor has yet to be hired.
Among the contract's signatories were Acorn, a national low-income housing advocacy group, since disbanded, that had received contributions from Forest City, and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a longtime civil rights advocate who initially led seven pastors in seeking to mitigate the development's impact.
''At one point, it became clear to me that this project is going to move,'' Mr. Daughtry, 81, said recently. He recalled telling the other pastors: ''It seems to me that you all are just going to be talking and when you get finished, other groups will have negotiated other parts of this project.''
Mr. Daughtry formed the Downtown Brooklyn Neighborhood Alliance with $50,000 in seed money from Forest City. His organization is being given 54 tickets and the use of a suite at every Barclays Center event. The tickets will be distributed to community members through a lottery, Mr. Daughtry said.
By promoting jobs and affordable housing, said the Rev. Clinton Miller of Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Clinton Hill, Forest City was able to sell the project to members of the black community and create an early schism between them and the residents of the nearby brownstone neighborhoods, many of whom were white. Mr. Miller did not join the plaintiffs, led by Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, who first sued in 2006 to block the use of eminent domain to acquire the property for Atlantic Yards.
''We were never against the project; we just wanted the process to be fair and inclusive,'' said Mr. Miller, who has formed a new group of 25 pastors to monitor the project.
When the company enlisted Jay-Z and engaged other leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton, Mr. Ratner made it difficult for some in the black community to criticize the project, Mr. Miller said.
''The racial dynamic,'' he added, ''was tremendously manipulated by Forest City.''
Ms. de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, whose group will join protests at the arena's opening, said the division became more along economic lines. ''Now, because the project has evolved, you find black and white all on the same side -- feeling like we've been hoodwinked, we've been bamboozled,'' she said.
INSIDE the Barclays Center, the drone of discontent drops away. The space is at once cavernous and intimate; an expansive hall peers into the bowl of the arena, with its sleek black seats and brilliant flashing scoreboards. The V.I.P. areas are marked by modern chandeliers, carpets shaded in gray, leather couches, Italian-made stainless steel beer towers and a vaulted Champagne bar.
From the street, passers-by can see the suspended scoreboard and look through the glass windows on Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues into the arena's ground-floor retail spaces.
Mr. Gehry's elaborate design, jettisoned once the financial crisis hit, was replaced by a more compact plan: Ellerbe Becket designed the arena structure, while SHoP Architects created the weathered steel exterior and coordinating interiors. With tax-free bonds and more than $200 million from the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who now owns 80 percent of the Nets, the arena was built in just two years. So much for cost-cutting; at $1 billion, Barclays Center is the nation's most expensive new arena, and it shows.
What is left unseen is more problematic.
Forest City never clearly announced the number of jobs it would deliver. Instead, politicians like Senator Charles E. Schumer proclaimed the creation of 10,000 jobs in 2004 at the state of Brooklyn address.
The 2006 environmental impact study done by the state agency overseeing the project, the Empire State Development Corporation, projected Atlantic Yards would generate 8,560 permanent jobs and 16,924 construction jobs.
A Forest City spokesman, Joe DePlasco, said that an average of 841 workers per day were on site over the past year, and that more construction jobs would come in the full build-out of the residential towers, though he declined to be specific. An office tower that would have supplied thousands of jobs has been delayed.
This spring, Forest City sponsored job fairs for Brooklyn residents that drew more than 35,000 people -- for 2,000 arena jobs, 1,900 of which were part time.
Build, the job-training organization connected to Forest City, enrolled just 36 participants in an unpaid internship program, promising them construction jobs and union cards.
Only two participants received union cards. Seven participants, however, filed a lawsuit in 2011 against Build and Forest City Ratner, claiming they had been misled. An appeal by Forest City was denied in June.
According to its agreement with Empire State Development, Forest City has until May 2013 to begin work on the first residential tower or pay a $5 million penalty. Mr. Ratner said the ground-breaking would be on Dec. 18.
Forest City wants to use modular construction for that 32-story tower to reduce costs. While 50 percent of the units will be affordable, the developer made a subtle switch: adding more one-bedroom and studio apartments than the two-bedrooms it was supposed to build. City subsidies are paid per unit, not per bedroom, allowing the company to build smaller units while getting the same financing.
''The first building is not going to be the perfect building, but unless we start building, we are never going to get where we want to go,'' said Bertha Lewis, the former head of Acorn, who is still involved in the process.
But opponents wonder if Forest City will be able to finance the other 11 residential towers planned for Phase 2, which it must complete by 2035. (Forest City negotiated to pay the $100 million it owes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the rail yards in installments through 2031.) The company lost an appeal in court and must submit a new environmental impact study for the project.
''This should not be a construction zone for 25 years,'' said Councilwoman Letitia James, a longtime critic who represents Prospect Heights and Fort Greene. Mr. Ratner said that the affordable housing, half of the 4,500 rental units, would be built, as would the remaining 1,800 market-rate condominiums, fulfilling Atlantic Yards' purpose.
''I think most people who live in Brooklyn today will be very proud of having a basketball team,'' Mr. Ratner said. ''They will be very proud of having an arena. They will be very proud of the housing part of the project.''
THOSE ''in the footprint'' are left waiting for the approaching storm.
In the past year, the state liquor board has granted about 40 liquor licenses to establishments near the arena, and Barclays Center's four premium bars, with a combined maximum capacity of 1,800, will serve alcohol up to an hour after events, with last call at 1 a.m.
At a meeting in early September, residents expressed concern about alcohol use by arena patrons. The new police precinct commander, Capt. Michael Ameri, tried to dismiss their fears. ''These are very wealthy people,'' he said, and many in the crowd of about 50 gasped at his equation of money and decorum.
Regina Cahill, who lives about 400 feet from the arena and is a board member of the North Flatbush Area Business Improvement District, preached caution. ''I feel very strongly that it is unfair to characterize every patron of the arena as an uncivilized outsider, a driver 'under the influence' looking to loiter and destroy our quality of life,'' she said.
Parking looms as the other specter. This spring, the state cut parking spaces at the arena's lot two blocks away by half, to 550, and residents fear that rather than promoting the use of public transportation, the move will just increase the number of drivers trolling for street parking.
At yet another meeting with Forest City officials, Louis Galdieri, a Park Slope resident, asked whether the company would support residential-permit parking for the neighborhood, an idea that the city's Transportation Department shot down, but will revisit. Ashley Cotton, Forest City's vice president for external affairs, said it was ''not opposed'' to permit parking, but passed responsibility to the state.
''Suddenly, Forest City is powerless to address it after kicking people off their land? I don't think so,'' Mr. Galdieri said with disgust.
Michael Pintchik's company owns 65 properties near the arena, and he said some areas had been ''poking up weeds'' before the project. Now he is courting upscale restaurateurs and national retailers like Pottery Barn to storefronts currently occupied by furniture stores and computer repair shops. Before Forest City broke ground, he said, rents were running $45 to $50 a square foot. Now, they are $150 to $175.
The Triangle Sports building, owned by one family for the past 96 years at Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street, sold this past week for $4.1 million, $900 per square foot, said Benjamin Bernstein of Redsky Capital LLC, which bought the three-story building for retail purposes. Timothy King, a founding partner of CPEX Real Estate Services in Brooklyn, a commercial firm, said the price was in a ''rarefied stratosphere for Brooklyn.''
Ravi Aggarwal is one of the small-business owners hoping to benefit from proximity to the site. In 2007, he opened Arena Bagels on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, two blocks from the project. But the name got so much backlash that he changed it to A.R.E.A. Bagels, for the initials of family members, he said.
Mr. Aggarwal put the ''N'' from the sign away for safekeeping, and is not likely to put it back up after the arena opens.
He said, ''My first priority is to serve the neighborhood,'' which he hopes will be upgraded by the arena. Then again, he added, ''I don't know the future.''

HEADLINE: A Prison, a Paradise

BYLINE: By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN

 BODY:
On the plane, something odd but also vaguely magical-seeming happened: namely, nobody knew what time it was. Right before we landed, the flight attendant made an announcement, in English and Spanish, that although daylight saving time recently went into effect in the States, the island didn't observe that custom. As a result, we had caught up -- our time had passed into sync with Cuban time. You will not need to change your watches. Then, moments later, she came on again and apologized. She had been wrong, she said. The time in Cuba was different. She didn't specify how many hours ahead. At that point, people around us looked at one another. How could the airline not know what time it is where we're going? Another flight attendant, hurrying down the aisle, said loudly, ''I just talked to some actual Cubans, in the back, and they say it'll be the same time.'' That settled it: we would be landing in ignorance. We knew our phones weren't going to work because they were tied to a U.S. company that didn't operate on the island.
The 6-year-old sat between us, looking back and forth at our faces. ''Is something wrong?'' she asked. 
''No,'' my wife, Mariana, said, ''just funny.'' But to me she did the eyebrows up and down.
''What?'' I said.
''Nothing,'' she said, ''just -- into the zone.''
Mi esposa travels to Cuba every so many years, to do movie-related research (she's a film-studies professor) and to visit her mother's family, a dwindling number of which, as death and emigration have surpassed the birthrate, still live in the same small inland town, a dusty, colonial-looking agricultural town, not a place anyone's heard of. To them, even after half a century, it's the querencia, an untranslatable Spanish word that means something like ''the place where you are your most authentic self.'' They won't go on about Cuba around you in a magic-realist way. Nor do they dream of trying to reclaim their land when the Castros die. Destiny settled their branch of the family not in Florida, where, if you're Cuban-American, your nostalgia and anger (and sense of community) are continually stoked, but in Carolina del Norte, where nobody cares. They tend to be fairly laid back about politics. But their memories stitch helplessly back to and through that town over generations, back to the ur-ancestors who came from a small village in the Canary Islands.
My wife's 91-year-old Cuban grandmother, who lives with us much of the time, once drew for me on top of a white cake box a map of their hometown. It started out like something you would make to give someone directions but ended up as detailed in places as a highway atlas. More so, really, because it was personally annotated. Here is the corner where my father have the bodega. Here is the alley where the old man used to walk his grandson, in a white suit, and we always say, 'Let's go to watch it,' because he have his pocket full of stones, and when the boy runs, the old man throw and hit him in the legs. She was remembering back through Castro and Batista, back through all of that, into the time of Machado, even back through him into her parents' time, the years of mustachioed GÃ³mez in his black frock coat. The night I met her, 18 years ago, she cooked me Turkish-delight-level black beans with Spanish olives, and flan in a coffee can. She said: ''Mira, Yon, at this time'' -- she meant the early '40s -- ''they make a census, all the teacher go to have a census in Cuba. We see places nobody know the name. I ride a small horse. One night there is a storm -- we pass the storm under a palma. In one house is un enano. You know what is? A dwarf. He say, 'I count half!' '' Her stories are like that. You actually want them to go longer. This is no small thing for me, as my life has evolved by unforeseen paths such that I see more of this abuelita than of any other human being. Neither of us ever leaves the house, and during the day it's the two of us. Those could be some paw-chewingly long hours in the kitchen, if she were talking to me about religion or something. Mostly she calls people in Miami and watches Univision at the same time, waiting for my wife and daughters to get home, after which she perks up.
Because my wife and her family have living relatives in Cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from Miami. The legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. But you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. I first tagged along 12 years ago. It's hands down the strangest way to travel to Cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it's the simplest. But the airport bureaucracy in Miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. That first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of Miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. I spoke hardly any Spanish then. My wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about Havana and messages for various people in their town. Now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that I took to mean, ''Words aren't necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,'' but that when I think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, ''You, simpleton.''
One line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. A couple of muscly Latin guys in shorts were waiting there. They lifted each suitcase or bag onto a little spinning platform, turned it blazingly fast to seal it in industrial-strength shrink-wrap from a roll that looked like it held a landfill's worth and charged you for it. Their spinning was so energetic, it doubled as a feat of strength. Everyone watched. The reasons behind the plastic were not laid out. Later in the waiting area, a woman told us it was to discourage quick-fingered Cuban bag handlers on the other side. They took not gold and money, which few people were foolish enough to pack, but toothpaste and shampoo, necessities. This year, however, the plastic wrap was optional.
There were other post-Bush differences in the direct-to-Cuba zone. The lines had grown fewer and shorter. Most noticeable, the Cubans on our flight -- a mixture of Cuban-Americans and returning Cuban nationals who had been in Florida or D.C. on visas of their own (some people do move back and forth) -- weren't carrying as much stuff. The crowd cast a fairly normal profile. Last time, people had multiple pairs of shoes tied around their necks by the laces. Thick gorgets of reading glasses. Men wearing 10 hats, several pairs of pants, everybody's pockets bulging. Everybody wearing fanny packs. The rule was, if you could get it onto your body, you could bring it aboard. At least five people carried giant stuffed animals and other large toys. That's one of the things in the Cuban-American community, in which going back is generally frowned upon -- but if it's to meet your nieto for the first time. . . .
None of that, though, is what makes the Miami-to-Havana flights strange. It's that this most obvious route, more than any of the much longer workarounds by which American citizens can get to the island, lets you feel most fully the truth of Cuba's sheer proximity. It's one of those flights in which, almost as soon as you reach your maximum altitude, you begin your descent, and within minutes you're looking down on a diorama of palm trees growing incongruously in green fields, and within seconds you hit the ground and everyone bursts into applause. The country you land in is too unlike your own to have been reached that quickly, all but instantaneously, and is after all, you recall, on hostile terms with your own. As if you've passed through a warp. â[#x20ac]©''Why are they clapping?'' the 6-year-old asked.
I explained that it was special, coming here. Some of these people, when they left Cuba, might have thought they would never see it again. Some had been hearing about it all their lives and were seeing it for the first time.
''Also, they like to clap and yell,'' my wife said.
The 6-year-old did her philosopher face, gazing out the window. She gets a little dimple on her forehead when the big thoughts are brewing. ''Now I'm here,'' she said.
''Yes, you are.''
''And I'm Cuban,'' she said.
''You are part Cuban, that's true.''
''You're not any Cuban,'' she said, not meanly, just sort of marveling.
She looks like me, pale with blue eyes and light brown hair and freckles. Yet she has largely been raised day to day by intense, dark-eyed Cuban-American women, and their blood is in her, and the history of their family, with all of its drama and all of its issues, has exerted an incalculable influence on who and what she is. At some point in her life, she'll have to figure out what all of that means to her; the whole story and the way she looks will be part of its strangeness. For me it was all behind glass. I felt the sudden separation between us, between the relative depths of what this trip would mean to us, many years on. One of those moments of generational wooziness that come with having kids, like realizing there's a part of their lives you won't see.
We landed under searingly vivid skies, something like what the blue tablet from a packet of Easter dye lets off. The land right around the airport is farmed; we saw a man plowing with oxen. The fertility of Cuba is the thing you can't put into words. I've never stood on a piece of ground as throbbingly, even pornographically, generative. Throw a used battery into a divot, and it will put out shoots -- that's how it feels. You could smell it, in the smoky, slightly putrid smell of turned fields. More and more, as we drove, that odor mingled with the smell of the sea.
This was the first time I was in post-Fidel Cuba. It was funny to think that not long ago, there were smart people who doubted that such a thing could exist, i.e., who believed that with the fall of Fidel would come the fall of Communism on the island. But Fidel didn't fall. He did fall, physically -- on the tape that gets shown over and over in Miami, of him coming down the ramp after giving that speech in 2004 and tumbling and breaking his knee -- but his leadership didn't. He executed one of the most brilliantly engineered successions in history, a succession that was at the same time a self-entrenchment. First, he faked his own death in a way: serious intestinal operation, he might not make it. RaÃºl is brought in as ''acting president.'' A year and a half later, Castro mostly recovered. But RaÃºl is officially named president, with Castro's approval. It was almost as if, ''Is Fidel still . . . ?'' Amazing. So now they rule together, with RaÃºl out front, but everyone understanding that Fidel retains massive authority. Not to say that RaÃºl doesn't wield power -- he has always had plenty -- but it's a partnership of some kind. What comes after is as much of a mystery as ever.
Our relationship with them seems just as uncertain. Barack Obama was going to open things up, and he did tinker with the rules regarding travel, but now they say that when you try to follow these rules, you get caught up in all kinds of forms and tape. He eased the restrictions on remittances, so more money is making it back to the island, and that may have made the biggest difference so far. Boats with medical and other relief supplies have recently left Miami, sailing straight to the island, which hasn't happened in decades. These humanitarian shipments can, according to The Miami Herald, include pretty much anything a Cuban-American family wants to send to its relatives: Barbie dolls, electronics, sugary cereal. In many cases, you have a situation in which the family is first wiring money over, then shipping the goods. The money is used on the other side to pay the various fees associated with getting the stuff. So it's as if you're reaching over and re-buying the merchandise for your relatives. The money, needless to say, goes to the government. Still, capitalism is making small inroads. And RaÃºl has taken baby steps toward us: Cubans can own their own cars, operate their own businesses, own property. That's all new. For obvious reasons it's not an immediate possibility for a vast majority of the people, and it could be taken away tomorrow morning by decree, but it matters.
Otherwise, our attitude toward Cuba feels very wait and see, as what we're waiting to see grows less and less clear. We've learned to live with it, like when the doctor says, ''What you have could kill you, but not before you die a natural death.'' Earlier this year Obama said to a Spanish newspaper: ''No authoritarian regime will last forever. The day will come in which the Cuban people will be free.'' Not, notice, no dictator can live forever, but no ''authoritarian regime.'' But how long can one last? Two hundred years?
Perhaps a second term will be different. All presidents, if they want to mess with our Cuba relations at even the microscopic level, find themselves up against the Florida community, and those are large, powerful and arguably insane forces.
My wife's people got out in the early 1960s, so they've been in the States for half a century. Lax regulations, strict regulations. It's all a oneness. They take, I suppose, a Cuban view, that matters on the island are perpetually and in some way inherently screwed up and have been forever.
There was a moment in the taxi, a little nothing exchange but so densely underlayered with meaning that if you could pass it through an extracting machine, you would understand a lot about how it is between Cubans and Cuban-Americans. The driver, a guy who said he grew up in Havana, told a tiny lie, or a half lie. The fact that you can't even say whether it was a lie or not is significant. My wife had asked him to explain for me the way it works with Cuba's two separate currencies, CUPs and CUCs, Cuban pesos and convertible pesos (also called ''chavitos'' or simply ''dollars''). When I was last there, we didn't use either of these, though both existed. We paid for everything in actual, green U.S. dollars. That's what people wanted. There were stores in which you could pay in only dollars. But in 2004, Castro decided -- partly as a gesture of contempt for the U.S. embargo -- that he would abolish the use of U.S. dollars on the island and enforce the use of CUCs, pegged to the U.S. dollar but distinct from it. This coexisted alongside the original currency, which would remain pegged to the spirit of the revolution. For obvious reasons, the actual Cuban peso is worth much less than the other, dollar-equivalent Cuban peso, something on the order of 25 to 1. But the driver said simply, ''No, they are equal.''
''Really?'' my wife said. ''No . . . that can't be.''
He insisted that there was no difference between the relative values of the currencies. They were the same.
He knew that this was wrong. He probably could have told you the exchange rates from that morning. But he also knew that it had a rightness in it. For official accounting purposes, the two currencies are considered equivalent. Their respective values might fluctuate on a given day, of course, but it couldn't be said that the CUP was worth less than the CUC That's partly what he meant. He also meant that if you're going to fly to Cuba from Miami and rub it in my face that our money is worth one twenty-fifth of yours, I'm gonna feed you some hilarious communist math and see how you like it. Cubans call it la doble moral. Meaning, different situations call forth different ethical codes. He wasn't being deceptive. He was saying what my wife forced him to say. She had been a bit breezy, it seemed, in mentioning the unevenness between the currencies, which is the kind of absurdity her family would laugh at affectionately in the kitchen. But they don't have to suffer it anymore. And he was partly reminding her of that, fencing her off from a conversation in which Cubans would joke together about the notion that the CUP and the CUC had even the slightest connection to each other. That was for them, that laughter. So, a very complex statement, that not-quite-lie. After it, he was totally friendly and dropped us at one of the Cuban-owned tourist hotels on the edge of Havana.
People walking by on the street didn't seem as skinny. That was the most instantly perceptible difference, if you were seeing RaÃºl's Cuba for the first time. They weren't sickly looking before, but under Fidel you noticed more the way men's shirts flapped about them and the knobbiness of women's knees. Now people were filling out their clothes. The island's overall dietary level had apparently gone up a tick. (One possible factor involved was an increase in the amount of food coming over from the United States. Unknown to most people, we do sell a lot of agricultural products to Cuba, second only in value to Brazil. Under a law that Bill Clinton squeaked through on his way out, Cuba purchases food and medicine from us on a cash basis, meaning, bizarrely, that a lot of the chicken in the arroz con pollo consumed on the island by Canadian tourists is raised in the Midwest -- the embargo/blockade has always been messy when you lean in close).
The idea was to spend some days traveling around, before going to see family. Once you see them, it gets emotional, and after that, sightseeing feels wrong somehow.
The ladies wanted to visit the Havana aquarium before it closed for the day -- my wife went there when she was younger -- so they took off. The hostility of the hotel workers was to be experienced. I started making up reasons to approach them, just to provoke it and make sure I hadn't imagined it. My reflex during an odd social interaction is to assume fault, and this can create its own distortion, making it hard to see what the other person is doing, but no, these people were being fantastically unfriendly. It was one of the big, newly built Gaviota hotels -- Gaviota is the quasi-official Cuban tourist organization (financed in part by transnational investment but controlled by a prominent Cuban general). Loosely speaking, these men and women worked for the government. It's not that they were incompetent or mean; they just had zero motivation to be nice to tourists or in a hurry to do anything for them, and for me, after years immersed in a may-I-pour-you-more-sweet-tea culture, the contrast held a fascination. In a way it was refreshing to see people so emphatically not kowtowing to rich white tourists, even if that was you, but of course this feeling was not to be trusted: you liked their unfriendliness because they seemed more authentically anti-capitalist that way. Especially wild was a woman about my age at the main reception desk, who evidently had to handle all the complaints about the wee-fee service in the lobby. She looked at you dead-level and half-smiling when you approached as if in her mind she were already pushing in the blade. At the desk, they sold little scratch cards, with passwords on them, that looked like lottery tickets and in hindsight had much else in common with lottery tickets. But there were no cards that day. ''They are in the city,'' she said -- and in my mind I saw them being unloaded from small boats at night -- ''but we don't have them here.'' I was advised to try the hotel next door, a few minutes' walk -- another, equally massive, equally generically pan-Latin-style Gaviota hotel. Would a card I bought there work here? ''I hope so,'' she said, still doing that smile. ''But,'' I said, ''we made reservations at this hotel specifically because you advertised the wee-fee service.'' A total lie. We didn't need it. I wanted to see if she would crack. She shook her head so slowly with exaggeratedly sincere sorrow, like a long-suffering teacher forced to tell her most obnoxious pupil he had failed. ''I understand,'' she murmured, and went back to work.
Partly what had been clashing were our respective ideas about the role of an individual in solving a crisis. In the United States, we all go around so empowered-feeling all the time, and when you travel you feel it, a sense of hypertrophy, the thing that makes us look like giant babies to the Europeans. Bring us our soda refills or we'll get them ourselves! The sheer notion that I thought she herself could do anything about the wee-fee, about getting the cards here faster, was probably genuinely amusing to her. Did I not think she wanted the wee-fee fixed? Did I think she actually liked standing there answering the exact same question from a never-ending line of childishly outraged foreigners?
At the neighboring hotel, they did have cards. But their wee-fee was down. ''It's not working?'' I asked the man. ''It's working,'' he said, ''but not right now.'' The whole island's Internet runs through three unpredictable satellites, although I had read that a cable of some kind was recently installed. If so, it did not get routed to these hotels. Which was lucky in the end -- it accelerated the technological molting that had to happen and left you feeling more present. In the basement, near the business center (where a woman took delight in telling travelers from all lands that they could not do various simple-sounding things on the computer consoles), I noticed a small postcard that showed a picture of Fidel, and the caption read in Spanish, ''In the history of U.S. intelligence, no greater amount of money and resources have been put toward bringing down a single man than have been spent to get Fidel.'' And below that, ''El mÃ©rito es estar vivo.'' Roughly, ''the victory lies in staying alive.''
I kept seeing small groups of Asian men get on and off the elevators. That was new. Ten years ago the only Asian faces you might have seen were in Chinatown -- there is one in Havana, Barrio Chino, several square blocks of ostensibly Chinese restaurants and faded signs with lanterns and pagodas on them, a neighborhood left behind by thousands of Chinese agricultural workers who arrived in the 19th century, and where very occasionally you might still see Asian features. These guys -- all men, I saw no women -- seemed dressed as inconspicuously as possible, loosefitting light-blue jeans and generic polo shirts and sunglasses. The bartender told me that they were here to do business. China was doing ''bastante de negocios'' in Cuba these days, including in oil, he said. At that moment a Chinese-made exploratory rig sat about 30 miles off the northern coast. We would be able to see it, he said, driving along the main highway. Cuba has lately been partnering with foreign petroleum companies to explore prospective undersea oil fields. A major discovery would be a mainline to economic independence, that most long-elusive goal of the revolution. So far, though, the wells have come up dry or disappointing.
Cuba's involvement with China has been intensifying for more than a decade, as Russian influence has receded. The Chinese have built an amusement park and sold fleets of buses. They have been granted use -- if our intelligence can be trusted -- of a large signals-intelligence base on the outskirts of Havana near the airport, a giant electronic ear-horn right off our shores, the price we pay for renouncing any involvement with a country so close. There is the sheer geopolitical weirdness of GuantÃ¡namo's being there, too: the Chinese and the Americans operating on the same island, off the coast of Florida. GuantÃ¡namo was supposed to be gone. It's holding on like the Castros.
The empty midafternoon lobby was vast and square-tiled and full of the drone of floor waxing, and the 6-year-old spilled into it laughing, her mother racewalking behind her, trying to catch her. They saw me at the bar and ran over. ''We have to show you this,'' the 6-year-old said. She was pulling on my wife's purse. Mariana pulled out her phone and pushed play on a movie, handing it to me. At the aquarium, a little boy had celebrated his birthday, and his parents had gone in for the dolphin special. You put the kid on a raft and pushed it out into the pool. Shortly thereafter, one of the aquarium's giant 500-pound dolphins started jumping over the kid and raft, in great looping leaps, one after the other. The splash was considerable. The kid looked terrified, he was face forward, clutching the raft at the edges. The repeating image of the dolphin -- frozen massive and pendulous directly above him -- got better every time. The audience laughed and clapped in the concrete bleachers, you could hear it on the video. My wife was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. ''You wouldn't see that in the States,'' she said proudly.
We scanned for the Chinese-built oil platform the next day, and thought we saw something once, though it may have been a ship. To ride along the coastal road with the windows down was sublime. The gaps between houses kept giving you glimpses of the sea behind. There weren't many other cars, but the few that passed left a heavy, organic smell of exhaust in the air. You could taste dinosaurs in it. It carried that precatalytic-converter nostalgia. We were driving down the spine of Cuba, into the vast green interior of the island. Hitchhikers were scattered along the highway, as were people selling various things -- garlic, strings of fish. They ran at you as you passed, yelling and seeming to come too close to the car.
I woke up the next day to the sounds of morning pool activity. Water splashing on concrete. Insistent, unfamiliar bird song. Sleepy murmurs of people rubbing lotion on themselves. Hotel carts rattled by outside the double glass doors. It was about 8 a.m. in Varadero on a warm spring day, which I'm pretty sure is literally Utopia, in some vague historico-linguistic way: the northern shore of Cuba, that supposedly moved Columbus to call this the most beautiful place human eyes had ever seen. My wife has a thing about going to Varadero when she goes to Cuba. I don't know if she even likes it. She does it for her family. To them it would seem insane to skip it -- it was the place they most wanted to go when they lived there -- not to go, on returning, would be like taking a trip to Keystone, S.D., and not going to see Mount Rushmore.
Sitting up in my twin bed, I looked over at the queen bed -- they were already gone. The massive cafeteria operation swung into motion for only a couple of hours each morning. You had to be there for the stampede. We were moving through different micro-Cubas so quickly; too quickly, really. The day before we rode horses through the jungle to see the ruins of ancient coffee plantations and the stone huts where the slaves were kept. We passed cooperative villages of campesinos in the forest and heard political speeches coming from loudspeakers, something about the new agriculture laws. The previous night, coming in on the suddenly pitch-black Cuban highways, zooming up to unlighted ''Road Closed'' signs at 60 miles an hour, swerving to miss car-killing potholes and horse-drawn wagons . . . that was already dreamlike. And now we were navigating the omelet and cereal stations, in lines of mainly European tourists: Germans, Italians, Central Europeans and also Brazilians, Argentines and Canadians. (You know when you're meeting a Canadian, because they always ask, in the same shocked tone, ''How did you get into the country?'' It's an opportunity to remind you that you can't go legally, and they can. And by extension, that they come from a more enlightened land. ''You need to grow up about that stuff,'' one guy that I met at a nature preserve said, to which I wanted to tell him to get a large and powerful population of Cuban exiles and move them into an election-determining province of Canada and call me in the morning.)
The cook at the omelet station, when he asked where I was from and I told him, put up his fists like a boxer, as if we were about to have it out, then started laughing. He told me that he had family in the United States, in Florida. That's what everyone says. You can't understand the transnationally dysfunctional, mutually implicated relationship between Cuba and Miami, that defies all embargoes and policies of ''definitive abandonment,'' until you realize that the line often cuts through families, almost always, in fact. People make all sorts of inner adjustments. I told the man I hated the embargo (the blockade, as they call it) and thought it was stupid, which was both true and what he wanted to hear. He gave me a manly clap-grasp. I didn't go on and say, of course, that I disliked the embargo most because it, more than anything, has kept the Castros in power for half a century, given them a ready-made Goliath for their David. Thanks to the embargo, when the Castros rail against us as an imperialist enemy, they aren't really lying. We have in effect declared ourselves the enemy of the Cuban people and done it under the banner of their freedom, hitting Cuba in a way that, after all, makes only the people suffer, and far from punishing those in power, rewards them and buttresses their story. As for the argument that to deal with tyrants would render our foreign policy incoherent, we deal with worse every day -- we've armed worse -- and in countries that don't have a deeply intimate history with ours, going back centuries. All this because a relatively small but highly mobilized exile community holds sway in a state that has the power to elect presidents. There was no way to gauge how much of this the man would agree with. We left it at mutually thinking the embargo sucked.
Out by the pool, where my wife and daughter were swimming, I lay on a chaise in the shade, feeling paler and softer than I ever had in my life and unlocatably depressed in the way that resorts do so well. I read ''Doctor Zhivago,'' a new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (the husband-and-wife team who have been retranslating the Russian classics for more than 20 years). ''Zhivago'' isn't on the Tolstoy/Chekhov level, but there are wonderful passages, including one that I thought spoke to the gruffness you often encounter in Cubans, the excessive suspicion of introductory small talk they sometimes demonstrate. ''The fear known as spymania,'' Pasternak wrote about Russia after the revolution, ''had reduced all speech to a single formal, predictable pattern. The display of good intentions in discourse was not conducive to conversation.''
Every time I looked up from the book, there were more people in and by the pool, as if they were surfacing out of the water, out of the ripples. I had black sunglasses on, so after a while I propped myself at an angle at which I could seem to read the book but really be moving my eyeballs, staring at everybody. God, the human body! It was Speedos and bikinis, no matter the age or body type. You would never see a poolside scene in the United States with people showing this much skin, except at a pool where people were there precisely to show off the perfection of their bodies. The body not consciously sculptured through working out has become a secret shame and grotesquerie in America, but this upper-class Euro-Latin crowd had not received that news, to my distraction. I took in veins and cellulite, paunches and man-paps, the weird shinglelike sagging that starts to occur on the back of the thighs, cleavage that showed a spoiled-grape-like wrinkling, the ash-mottled skin of permanently sun-torched shoulders, all of it beautiful. All of it beautiful and tormenting. You watched an 18-year-old Argentine girl in her reproductive springtime walk past an ancient Soviet-looking woman, her body a sculpture of blocks atop blocks, and both of them wearing black bikinis, the furtive looks they gave each other, full of emotions straight from the Pliocene, from the savanna. The old men scowled from behind mirrored shades. The young men tensed every muscle in order to seem not obsessed with how the girls saw them, a level of self-consciousness I found I could no longer really re-enter, as if it had been a drunken state. Everybody was stealing looks at one another, envying or disdaining or gazing, like me. We were all inside a matrix of lust and erotic sadness, all turning into versions of one another, or seeing our past selves.
My wife's people come from a small town with a strange name, a rare Spanish word that almost doesn't look Spanish when you see it. When they lived there, the place was not considered all that far from things, from the cities, but the decay of infrastructure, the collapse of the trains, has left it stranded. There's simply no reason to have heard of it.
The first time I went, before we were married, they made a big thing of me. Yankees almost never appear in this town, unless they are lost. I walked into a stuccoed, leafy house on a quiet street, a house full of loud talking, hands grabbing my arms. Everyone kissed and cried over my wife, whom they hadn't seen since she was a teenager. They nicknamed me ''Wao,'' because everything they would tell me, I would say, ''Wow.'' It seemed the appropriate response. Wei-Wei, the abuelita, had come with us, or rather we had gone with her -- it ended up being probably the last time she would ever go back -- and she sent money ahead of our visit, for them to buy food with. She's always sending money, but this time she sent more, and they laid in pork and all the spices they needed. There was a long table. All of the men were named some version of Rafael, Rafaelito, RafaelÃn. The matriarch, a shy and tiny woman named Haydee (eye-day), presided with birdlike hands, making little apologies. You didn't even have to chew the pork, you could just sort of let it melt. They made chicharrones de viento, wind-crackers, the Cubans' witty name for a kind of poverty-inspired something, frisked up out of salt and flour and a little lard. There was a bottle of Havana Club on the table -- the first time I ever saw or tasted it. Knowing only a little classroom Spanish, I struggled to follow their phrases, the swift and expressive but mud-mouthed Spanish spoken on the island.
After dinner, I made the mistake of saying something about a cigar. It wasn't as if I asked for one. I probably said something like, ''I hear that your country is famous for its cigars.'' But they took this as an overpolite way of asking for one, so the hunt began. The shops were closed, but the Rafaels started working on the car. You've heard, no doubt, how in Cuba they still drive working American cars from the 1950s, but this was something else, a Frankenstein made from the parts of about four different cars from the '50s and one Russian car apparently from the '70s. They got this creature going, and we started moving through the streets. No headlights -- one of them held an electric lantern out the window. It was wired to the cigarette lighter. We needed it badly. Within a mile of leaving the town, we were in the face-close darkness of unlighted rural roads. They took me to a kind of kiosk, an open bar in the middle of a field. I don't know what it was, really. A kind of club. All of the men, about seven of them, were workers in the tobacco fields. They would smuggle out a cigar or two each week, maybe defective ones, for personal use or the chance to trade it away. Rafelito told me, ''This is the puro puro.''
Back at the house, half the neighborhood gathered to watch me huff on this thing, many, I slowly realized, hoping to see me vomit. I stood outside on a back patio, amid chicken coops. The cigar went to my head like thunder. My knees became untrustworthy. But no throwing up. Rafaelito had too much to drink and danced like a crazy person. As a boy, he lost his only brother, drowned in the river. His father, Rafael, approached me with a wagging finger, asking me if I liked the country. Of course, I said, bonita, linda y la gente.
''Si.'' He looked a little bit like a Cuban Groucho Marx. ''Si, te gusta el pais,'' he said. ''Pero, te gusta el sistema?'' He pulled the syllables of el sistema out of his mouth like draws of taffy.
Now they were all gone, all the Rafaels. The two older ones were dead from disease, and the youngest one had gone to Miami, I don't even know how. There is a kind of lottery, apparently. Perhaps he won it. He's working as a mechanic. The house was completely different. The ground floor was empty and quiet.
Haydee, the old woman of the house, was still there, even more ancient but seemingly unchanged. I saw her do the same thing now to the 6-year-old that she did to my wife those years ago, wrap her arms around the girl and sort of refuse to leave, the way a child would. ''I'm keeping her here,'' she said. ''You, go back.''
Her husband and son were gone, her grandson gone to Miami. Her other grandson, Erik, half-brother of the boy who left, was still around. In fact, he was thriving. He had started a little furniture business. He was living in the house with his wife and daughter, and all had been going well. But just months before, they lost a son, an infant, to a respiratory disease. So within a short span of years, he lost his father, grandfather and his brother (to emigration), and now his son. He was the only male in the house.
Erik's daughter, a young girl with glasses and reddish-brown hair, was as shy as her grandmother. She stayed on the edges of whatever room we were in. My daughter was at my feet, peeking through my legs at her. I could feel their intense awareness of each other, but neither would approach.
After lunch, while Erik was explaining different aspects of the furniture operation to me, my 6-year-old came up and started tugging on my shirt. She was mouthing something at me. I kept saying, ''Please don't interrupt, sweetheart.'' She said, ''Give me your phone!'' I excused myself from Erik for a second to give her a little lecture. I knew she was bored, I said, but this was an important day, and she needed to use her manners, not play with the phone. ''Give me the phone!'' she said, and ran off in a huff when I refused.
Barely 20 minutes later we went back upstairs and passed by the little girl's room. She and the 6-year-old were sitting on the bed, playing on a phone. It was my wife's. The 6-year-old had taught her cousin to play Angry Birds. They were smiling and leaning on each other. For the next two days they were completely inseparable and wanted to sleep in the same room. They communicated through my wife when they really needed to work something out. They will probably know each other for the rest of their lives now, because of that game.
We went out walking the streets, making the rounds to see other family members -- to the old church, with its brightly painted statue of St. Julian, where Wei-Wei was married and where they remembered her, ''la maestra,'' past the school where she taught and the corner store her father owned, where first she and then her children, my mother-in-law and her brother, grew up playing, before it was taken away -- and as we strolled, I had a diminished, doubtless much-flawed version of the old woman's cake-box map in my head. I was hearing her voice-over, all the stories she told me over almost 20 years now, some of them repetitive, but with details emerging and receding.
Her memories of the revolution begin with the shortwave radio, kept in the back room by her husband. Wei-Wei and her husband would gather with friends to listen to the transmissions that the Castro brothers and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos (the best loved of the young comandantes, at least by my wife's family, worshiped as a pop star by my mother-in-law, then 11) were broadcasting from the mountains, giving assurance that they were about to ride down and liberate the island. For years I assumed that the family had been listening to these speeches in fear -- as a couple, they were about as solidly middle class as could be, a teacher and a tobacco salesman, and their later experience of the revolution involved only pain and regret -- but the abuelita surprised me one night, at the table, by saying that, on the contrary, they heard those speeches with great excitement. No one liked Batista, no one who wasn't directly benefiting from his thuggery and favoritism. The powerful charisma of the freedom fighters had percolated down into even quiet, apolitical homes.
There was a night back home, after a long meal, when for the first time after knowing her for so long, I got a bit pushy with her -- asked her follow-up questions instead of just mm-hmming -- and she gave me a description of what it had actually been like to watch this optimism turn to fear, and something worse, what that had actually looked like. When the milicianos first came from the mountains, she said, ''they come to say hello with this necklace made of pieces of wood and a gold cross.'' They mugged for the cameras with these crosses in their teeth. I asked why. ''For you to look at. To pretend that they are Christian. That they believe in God.''
''Everybody cooperate with Fidel,'' she said. ''Everybody was happy that we had the opportunity to have all the freedom that he promise.'' She taught adult literacy classes at night.
Change came with the arrival of the comites, one house per block, appointed as the government representative for its households. The rapidity with which that degenerated into spying and becoming complicit in spying had been breathtaking to watch play out in stark anthropological terms. Within months, they were taking children aside at school and asking them about their parents. The parents started pulling the children out. The first nonpolitical families started to flee. People betrayed their neighbors to the comites. A woman who lived in the neighborhood, a woman named Solita, ''somebody accuse her of having fried pork in her house. And they make -- she was a teacher -- they make a public, Â¿come se llama?, juicio?'' Trial. ''Exactly. Accusing her of having pork.''
My wife's grandfather had let it be known that he was against the Castros -- not because he had preferred Batista; in fact, the family had some obscure connection, that I've never been able to get anyone to be forthcoming about, to one of the other revolutionaries in the mountains, a rival who was executed not long after the uprising -- in any case it was known that the family's sympathies did not lie with the communists. ''I remember one time we going to the farm,'' she said, ''and when we was coming back, we stop in Mario's grandmother's house, and we saw my brother passing on the road very fast. We get scared. We say, 'What happened?' He says, 'The police is going to ask for, getting into your house.' And at this time we was already saving some American money to come here. And you believe or not? The first thing that I do in the house was burning the dollars. To be sure that they don't find it out.''
The party came and took away the family business. They took the store. They took the car, covered in tobacco advertisements. They took ''a house of birds.'' Not yours anymore. They took a little dog, named Mocha. They took pictures off the wall. They came in and counted the number of pictures, and took a certain percentage of them. Absurd things. They took away the family's tiny beach house in Playa del Rosario, ''gave it to some fishman.'' But this succession of losses came to seem indistinct against what was happening outside. The picture had darkened. ''So bad, so cruel all the things that they do it,'' she said. ''The television was on all day long.'' She meant both that they were watching all day long, and that the revolutionaries were transmitting constantly. There was ''a man that the name Blanco,'' she said. And his trial concerned ''if he abuse the farmers, if he do all these things that accuse him to do it.'' They found him guilty. ''Then the people go to the street, singing, 'Paredon paredon paredon! Paredon means 'kill in front of the wall.'' And then they put this in television. And you see the brain of this man jumping out. It was getting gross and gross and gross.'' She resigned her job, and they essentially went into hiding.
She got her two children out first, my mother-in-law and her brother, on waivers made possible by the C.I.A.-initiated, Catholic-sponsored airlift known as Pedro Pan. The story goes that the C.I.A. started spreading rumors on the island that the government was about to take away the children, raise them in camps. People panicked, and the planes were waiting to fly them away. The children wound up living with Catholic families all over the United States or, in this case, with an aunt in North Carolina. Eventually Wei-Wei and her husband got out, through Mexico, and joined the children. But Pedro Pan tore apart many families.
We arrived at the house of some cousins, two twins, small men now in their 50s, one with a mustache and one without, who live with their mother, whom they tend to hover about protectively. Their father died after having walked himself to the hospital, after a heart attack. Nobody had a car, nobody's phone worked. The revolution is famous around the world for its health care, but for a Cuban, that care can be hard to access, especially if you live far from one of the major cities.
The six-year-old and her cousin were sitting on the sofa, ignoring everyone. They were holding up dolls to each other in different poses, sort of: ''What do you think of this? Do you approve of this?'' We unloaded the presents we brought for the twins. They handed my wife a book of socialist Cuban film reviews from before the revolution, actually a rare and useful book -- one of them is a from-home bookseller, and he had come across it somewhere.
As we were standing around he said, ''Did you know that my brother'' -- the one with no mustache -- ''was on a game show?''
They brought forth a VHS tape and started reconfiguring the wires to make the VCR work. Soon a picture of the studio appeared, three contestants behind their buzzers. The tape had been recorded over many times. There was a constant flickering of white meteors across the image. Felipe to the far left, smiling, looking confident in a light-green short-sleeve shirt. The game had to do with rhyming. They would say, ''Two words: one of them describes a fruit, one describes a family member.'' Answer: lima and prima. Felipe didn't win, but did well enough, as I understood it, to be invited back. He looked on screen like he was having a great time. The show had a carefree attitude, compared with something similar in the United States. The stakes were very low. You can't have games of chance or leisure games involving any amount of money, they said. It was outlawed by the revolution, as part of the purifying backlash against the mob-led casino power. So the prizes were things like a signed poster of a famous Spanish pop singer or a decorative mirror. Nobody was going to cry over losing. We congratulated Felipe on having held his own. He brought out the small metal lamp-sculpture he won.
Before we left the country, we spent a last day and night in Havana. Heaven weather. We stepped into the grand cathedral, on one of the main squares in the old part of town, and listened to a women's choir that was practicing for the pope. I saw blue-and-red signs announcing his impending visit, ''Viene el Papa!'' The women and girls were dressed in their everyday clothes. They sang beautifully. I'm sure that they were the best that Cuba had.
In the evening, we stood on the Morro, the Spanish castillo across the bay from the MalecÃ³n, and looked at the city. There is a Havana -- this was the second time I saw it, a confirmation -- that cannot be captured on photographs, because it involves a totality of light from symphonic Caribbean clouds and the way they play on the whole city, and that appears often enough to represent one of the characteristic faces of the city. The diffused light turns all the buildings a range of pastels. Then as the sun reddens, it becomes rose-colored.
It was 9:30 by the time we got back to our hotel. Normally that would have been past the 6-year-old's bedtime, but my wife had a telephone interview -- meant to happen during the day, it got bumped -- so she needed us out of the room for an hour.
Downstairs we sat and listened to the band do the inescapable (in Havana) ''Hasta Siempre, Comandante,'' with its strange lyrics, ''Here lies the clear/the precious transparency/of your dear presence/Comandante Che Guevara.'' Cats were slinking around. The people going by were of every shade, and many with striking faces. In the most Spanish faces you could see flashes of the Old World stock that supplied the island with settlers: the equine noses, the long mouths, at times a Middle Eastern cast, features I knew from my wife's family pictures.
On the sidewalk a young bicycle-taxi driver named Manuel approached us, a well-built kid in jean shorts and a tank-top, about 19. He said he knew an ice cream place that was still open. We set out through the night. Many of the streets were dark. It was chilly already, and the 6-year-old huddled against my side. It was one of those moments when you know that you are where you're supposed to be. If your destiny wavered, it has at least momentarily recovered its track. We ate our chocolate ice cream at an outdoor bar, under a half moon.
On the way back to the hotel, Manuel asked what I did. When I told him I was a reporter, he said: ''You'd hate it here. There is no freedom of expression here.''
He launched into a tirade against the regime. ''It is basically a prison,'' he said. ''Everyone is afraid.''
The things he said, which I had heard many times before -- that you can go to prison for nothing, that there's no opportunity, that people are terrified to speak out -- are the reason I can never quite get with my leftie-most friends on Cuba, when they want to make excuses for the regime. It's simply a fact that nearly every Cuban I've ever come to know beyond a passing acquaintance, everyone not involved with the party, will turn to you at some point and say something along the lines of, ''It is a prison here.'' I just heard it from one of the men who worked for Erik, back in the hometown. I remarked to him that storefronts on the streets looked a little bit better, more freshly painted. It was a shallow, small-talky observation.
''No,'' he said, turning his head and exhaling smoke.
''You mean things haven't improved?'' I said.
''There is no future,'' he said. ''We are lost.''
The 6-year-old kept asking me what Manuel was saying. I was doing my best to describe el sistema. Interesting trying to explain to a child educated in a Quaker Montessori school what could possibly be wrong with everyone sharing.
We passed the museum with the Granma, the leisure boat that in 1956 carried Fidel and RaÃºl and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos and 78 other Cuban revolutionaries from Mexico to a beach on the island's southeast coast. The cruiser was all lighted up with aquamarine lights, in a building made of glass. It looked underwater. Manuel stopped the bicycle-taxi and gazed on it with obvious pride.
''There's always an armed guard in front of it,'' he said, nodding his head toward a young man in a green uniform, who was standing with a machine gun over his shoulder.
''They're worried that someone will try to blow it up or something?'' I said.
''They're worried that someone will steal it and go to Miami,'' he said.
There was a time Mariana took me to Cuba, and we went to a town called Remedios, in the central part of the island. It is one of the most ancient Cuban cities. The church on the main square dates from the Renaissance. When it was restored in the 1950s, the workers discovered that under the white paint on the high ceiling was a layer of pure gold. The townspeople had safeguarded it from the pirates in that manner. We stayed in the home of a man named Piloto. A friendly bicycle-taxi driver, who introduced himself as Max, told us that Piloto worked for the government and rented out his spare room only in order to spy on tourists, and that we should be careful what we said there. But all we ever got from Piloto and his wife was a nearly silent politeness and one night a superb lobster dinner. My most vivid memory of Remedios is of being taken to the house of an artist who lived there, a woodcarver. The bicycle-taxi driver told us that anyone who had ''a great interest in culture'' needed to visit the home of this particular artist. The next day he took us there, in the afternoon. We rode behind a row of houses that had strange paintings and animal figures hanging in their breezeways. After what seemed a long time for a bicycle-taxi ride, we arrived at the woman's place. Taking out a cigarette, Max told us to walk ahead, he would wait. At the door of a small, salmon-colored house, an old woman met us. Not the artist, it emerged. This was the artist's mother. We sat with her in a kind of narrow front parlor, where she made sweetly formal small talk for maybe 20 minutes, telling us every so often that the artist would be out soon.
At a certain moment, a woman appeared in the passageway that led from the front room into the main part of the house, a woman with rolls of fat on her limbs, like a baby, and skin covered in moles. She walked on crutches with braces on her knees. She had a beautiful natural Afro with a scarf tied around it. She was simply a visually magnificent human being. She told us the prices of her works, and we bought a little chicken carving. She said almost nothing otherwise -- she had difficulty speaking -- but when we stood up to leave, she lifted a hand and spoke, or rather delivered, this sentence. It was evidently the message among all others that she deemed most essential for U.S. visitors. ''I know that at present there are great differences between our peoples,'' she said, ''but in the future all will be well, because we are all the sons and daughters of Abraham Lincoln.''

HEADLINE: A Prison, a Paradise

BYLINE: By JOHN JEREMIAH SULLIVAN

 BODY:
On the plane, something odd but also vaguely magical-seeming happened: namely, nobody knew what time it was. Right before we landed, the flight attendant made an announcement, in English and Spanish, that although daylight saving time recently went into effect in the States, the island didn't observe that custom. As a result, we had caught up -- our time had passed into sync with Cuban time. You will not need to change your watches. Then, moments later, she came on again and apologized. She had been wrong, she said. The time in Cuba was different. She didn't specify how many hours ahead. At that point, people around us looked at one another. How could the airline not know what time it is where we're going? Another flight attendant, hurrying down the aisle, said loudly, ''I just talked to some actual Cubans, in the back, and they say it'll be the same time.'' That settled it: we would be landing in ignorance. We knew our phones weren't going to work because they were tied to a U.S. company that didn't operate on the island.
The 6-year-old sat between us, looking back and forth at our faces. ''Is something wrong?'' she asked. 
''No,'' my wife, Mariana, said, ''just funny.'' But to me she did the eyebrows up and down.
''What?'' I said.
''Nothing,'' she said, ''just -- into the zone.''
Mi esposa travels to Cuba every so many years, to do movie-related research (she's a film-studies professor) and to visit her mother's family, a dwindling number of which, as death and emigration have surpassed the birthrate, still live in the same small inland town, a dusty, colonial-looking agricultural town, not a place anyone's heard of. To them, even after half a century, it's the querencia, an untranslatable Spanish word that means something like ''the place where you are your most authentic self.'' They won't go on about Cuba around you in a magic-realist way. Nor do they dream of trying to reclaim their land when the Castros die. Destiny settled their branch of the family not in Florida, where, if you're Cuban-American, your nostalgia and anger (and sense of community) are continually stoked, but in Carolina del Norte, where nobody cares. They tend to be fairly laid back about politics. But their memories stitch helplessly back to and through that town over generations, back to the ur-ancestors who came from a small village in the Canary Islands.
My wife's 91-year-old Cuban grandmother, who lives with us much of the time, once drew for me on top of a white cake box a map of their hometown. It started out like something you would make to give someone directions but ended up as detailed in places as a highway atlas. More so, really, because it was personally annotated. Here is the corner where my father have the bodega. Here is the alley where the old man used to walk his grandson, in a white suit, and we always say, 'Let's go to watch it,' because he have his pocket full of stones, and when the boy runs, the old man throw and hit him in the legs. She was remembering back through Castro and Batista, back through all of that, into the time of Machado, even back through him into her parents' time, the years of mustachioed Gómez in his black frock coat. The night I met her, 18 years ago, she cooked me Turkish-delight-level black beans with Spanish olives, and flan in a coffee can. She said: ''Mira, Yon, at this time'' -- she meant the early '40s -- ''they make a census, all the teacher go to have a census in Cuba. We see places nobody know the name. I ride a small horse. One night there is a storm -- we pass the storm under a palma. In one house is un enano. You know what is? A dwarf. He say, 'I count half!' '' Her stories are like that. You actually want them to go longer. This is no small thing for me, as my life has evolved by unforeseen paths such that I see more of this abuelita than of any other human being. Neither of us ever leaves the house, and during the day it's the two of us. Those could be some paw-chewingly long hours in the kitchen, if she were talking to me about religion or something. Mostly she calls people in Miami and watches Univision at the same time, waiting for my wife and daughters to get home, after which she perks up.
Because my wife and her family have living relatives in Cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from Miami. The legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. But you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. I first tagged along 12 years ago. It's hands down the strangest way to travel to Cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it's the simplest. But the airport bureaucracy in Miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. That first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of Miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. I spoke hardly any Spanish then. My wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about Havana and messages for various people in their town. Now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that I took to mean, ''Words aren't necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,'' but that when I think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, ''You, simpleton.''
One line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. A couple of muscly Latin guys in shorts were waiting there. They lifted each suitcase or bag onto a little spinning platform, turned it blazingly fast to seal it in industrial-strength shrink-wrap from a roll that looked like it held a landfill's worth and charged you for it. Their spinning was so energetic, it doubled as a feat of strength. Everyone watched. The reasons behind the plastic were not laid out. Later in the waiting area, a woman told us it was to discourage quick-fingered Cuban bag handlers on the other side. They took not gold and money, which few people were foolish enough to pack, but toothpaste and shampoo, necessities. This year, however, the plastic wrap was optional.
There were other post-Bush differences in the direct-to-Cuba zone. The lines had grown fewer and shorter. Most noticeable, the Cubans on our flight -- a mixture of Cuban-Americans and returning Cuban nationals who had been in Florida or D.C. on visas of their own (some people do move back and forth) -- weren't carrying as much stuff. The crowd cast a fairly normal profile. Last time, people had multiple pairs of shoes tied around their necks by the laces. Thick gorgets of reading glasses. Men wearing 10 hats, several pairs of pants, everybody's pockets bulging. Everybody wearing fanny packs. The rule was, if you could get it onto your body, you could bring it aboard. At least five people carried giant stuffed animals and other large toys. That's one of the things in the Cuban-American community, in which going back is generally frowned upon -- but if it's to meet your nieto for the first time. . . .
None of that, though, is what makes the Miami-to-Havana flights strange. It's that this most obvious route, more than any of the much longer workarounds by which American citizens can get to the island, lets you feel most fully the truth of Cuba's sheer proximity. It's one of those flights in which, almost as soon as you reach your maximum altitude, you begin your descent, and within minutes you're looking down on a diorama of palm trees growing incongruously in green fields, and within seconds you hit the ground and everyone bursts into applause. The country you land in is too unlike your own to have been reached that quickly, all but instantaneously, and is after all, you recall, on hostile terms with your own. As if you've passed through a warp. ''Why are they clapping?'' the 6-year-old asked.
I explained that it was special, coming here. Some of these people, when they left Cuba, might have thought they would never see it again. Some had been hearing about it all their lives and were seeing it for the first time.
''Also, they like to clap and yell,'' my wife said.
The 6-year-old did her philosopher face, gazing out the window. She gets a little dimple on her forehead when the big thoughts are brewing. ''Now I'm here,'' she said.
''Yes, you are.''
''And I'm Cuban,'' she said.
''You are part Cuban, that's true.''
''You're not any Cuban,'' she said, not meanly, just sort of marveling.
She looks like me, pale with blue eyes and light brown hair and freckles. Yet she has largely been raised day to day by intense, dark-eyed Cuban-American women, and their blood is in her, and the history of their family, with all of its drama and all of its issues, has exerted an incalculable influence on who and what she is. At some point in her life, she'll have to figure out what all of that means to her; the whole story and the way she looks will be part of its strangeness. For me it was all behind glass. I felt the sudden separation between us, between the relative depths of what this trip would mean to us, many years on. One of those moments of generational wooziness that come with having kids, like realizing there's a part of their lives you won't see.
We landed under searingly vivid skies, something like what the blue tablet from a packet of Easter dye lets off. The land right around the airport is farmed; we saw a man plowing with oxen. The fertility of Cuba is the thing you can't put into words. I've never stood on a piece of ground as throbbingly, even pornographically, generative. Throw a used battery into a divot, and it will put out shoots -- that's how it feels. You could smell it, in the smoky, slightly putrid smell of turned fields. More and more, as we drove, that odor mingled with the smell of the sea.
This was the first time I was in post-Fidel Cuba. It was funny to think that not long ago, there were smart people who doubted that such a thing could exist, i.e., who believed that with the fall of Fidel would come the fall of Communism on the island. But Fidel didn't fall. He did fall, physically -- on the tape that gets shown over and over in Miami, of him coming down the ramp after giving that speech in 2004 and tumbling and breaking his knee -- but his leadership didn't. He executed one of the most brilliantly engineered successions in history, a succession that was at the same time a self-entrenchment. First, he faked his own death in a way: serious intestinal operation, he might not make it. Raúl is brought in as ''acting president.'' A year and a half later, Castro mostly recovered. But Raúl is officially named president, with Castro's approval. It was almost as if, ''Is Fidel still . . . ?'' Amazing. So now they rule together, with Raúl out front, but everyone understanding that Fidel retains massive authority. Not to say that Raúl doesn't wield power -- he has always had plenty -- but it's a partnership of some kind. What comes after is as much of a mystery as ever.
Our relationship with them seems just as uncertain. Barack Obama was going to open things up, and he did tinker with the rules regarding travel, but now they say that when you try to follow these rules, you get caught up in all kinds of forms and tape. He eased the restrictions on remittances, so more money is making it back to the island, and that may have made the biggest difference so far. Boats with medical and other relief supplies have recently left Miami, sailing straight to the island, which hasn't happened in decades. These humanitarian shipments can, according to The Miami Herald, include pretty much anything a Cuban-American family wants to send to its relatives: Barbie dolls, electronics, sugary cereal. In many cases, you have a situation in which the family is first wiring money over, then shipping the goods. The money is used on the other side to pay the various fees associated with getting the stuff. So it's as if you're reaching over and re-buying the merchandise for your relatives. The money, needless to say, goes to the government. Still, capitalism is making small inroads. And Raúl has taken baby steps toward us: Cubans can own their own cars, operate their own businesses, own property. That's all new. For obvious reasons it's not an immediate possibility for a vast majority of the people, and it could be taken away tomorrow morning by decree, but it matters.
Otherwise, our attitude toward Cuba feels very wait and see, as what we're waiting to see grows less and less clear. We've learned to live with it, like when the doctor says, ''What you have could kill you, but not before you die a natural death.'' Earlier this year Obama said to a Spanish newspaper: ''No authoritarian regime will last forever. The day will come in which the Cuban people will be free.'' Not, notice, no dictator can live forever, but no ''authoritarian regime.'' But how long can one last? Two hundred years?
Perhaps a second term will be different. All presidents, if they want to mess with our Cuba relations at even the microscopic level, find themselves up against the Florida community, and those are large, powerful and arguably insane forces.
My wife's people got out in the early 1960s, so they've been in the States for half a century. Lax regulations, strict regulations. It's all a oneness. They take, I suppose, a Cuban view, that matters on the island are perpetually and in some way inherently screwed up and have been forever.
There was a moment in the taxi, a little nothing exchange but so densely underlayered with meaning that if you could pass it through an extracting machine, you would understand a lot about how it is between Cubans and Cuban-Americans. The driver, a guy who said he grew up in Havana, told a tiny lie, or a half lie. The fact that you can't even say whether it was a lie or not is significant. My wife had asked him to explain for me the way it works with Cuba's two separate currencies, CUPs and CUCs, Cuban pesos and convertible pesos (also called ''chavitos'' or simply ''dollars''). When I was last there, we didn't use either of these, though both existed. We paid for everything in actual, green U.S. dollars. That's what people wanted. There were stores in which you could pay in only dollars. But in 2004, Castro decided -- partly as a gesture of contempt for the U.S. embargo -- that he would abolish the use of U.S. dollars on the island and enforce the use of CUCs, pegged to the U.S. dollar but distinct from it. This coexisted alongside the original currency, which would remain pegged to the spirit of the revolution. For obvious reasons, the actual Cuban peso is worth much less than the other, dollar-equivalent Cuban peso, something on the order of 25 to 1. But the driver said simply, ''No, they are equal.''
''Really?'' my wife said. ''No . . . that can't be.''
He insisted that there was no difference between the relative values of the currencies. They were the same.
He knew that this was wrong. He probably could have told you the exchange rates from that morning. But he also knew that it had a rightness in it. For official accounting purposes, the two currencies are considered equivalent. Their respective values might fluctuate on a given day, of course, but it couldn't be said that the CUP was worth less than the CUC That's partly what he meant. He also meant that if you're going to fly to Cuba from Miami and rub it in my face that our money is worth one twenty-fifth of yours, I'm gonna feed you some hilarious communist math and see how you like it. Cubans call it la doble moral. Meaning, different situations call forth different ethical codes. He wasn't being deceptive. He was saying what my wife forced him to say. She had been a bit breezy, it seemed, in mentioning the unevenness between the currencies, which is the kind of absurdity her family would laugh at affectionately in the kitchen. But they don't have to suffer it anymore. And he was partly reminding her of that, fencing her off from a conversation in which Cubans would joke together about the notion that the CUP and the CUC had even the slightest connection to each other. That was for them, that laughter. So, a very complex statement, that not-quite-lie. After it, he was totally friendly and dropped us at one of the Cuban-owned tourist hotels on the edge of Havana.
People walking by on the street didn't seem as skinny. That was the most instantly perceptible difference, if you were seeing Raúl's Cuba for the first time. They weren't sickly looking before, but under Fidel you noticed more the way men's shirts flapped about them and the knobbiness of women's knees. Now people were filling out their clothes. The island's overall dietary level had apparently gone up a tick. (One possible factor involved was an increase in the amount of food coming over from the United States. Unknown to most people, we do sell a lot of agricultural products to Cuba, second only in value to Brazil. Under a law that Bill Clinton squeaked through on his way out, Cuba purchases food and medicine from us on a cash basis, meaning, bizarrely, that a lot of the chicken in the arroz con pollo consumed on the island by Canadian tourists is raised in the Midwest -- the embargo/blockade has always been messy when you lean in close).
The idea was to spend some days traveling around, before going to see family. Once you see them, it gets emotional, and after that, sightseeing feels wrong somehow.
The ladies wanted to visit the Havana aquarium before it closed for the day -- my wife went there when she was younger -- so they took off. The hostility of the hotel workers was to be experienced. I started making up reasons to approach them, just to provoke it and make sure I hadn't imagined it. My reflex during an odd social interaction is to assume fault, and this can create its own distortion, making it hard to see what the other person is doing, but no, these people were being fantastically unfriendly. It was one of the big, newly built Gaviota hotels -- Gaviota is the quasi-official Cuban tourist organization (financed in part by transnational investment but controlled by a prominent Cuban general). Loosely speaking, these men and women worked for the government. It's not that they were incompetent or mean; they just had zero motivation to be nice to tourists or in a hurry to do anything for them, and for me, after years immersed in a may-I-pour-you-more-sweet-tea culture, the contrast held a fascination. In a way it was refreshing to see people so emphatically not kowtowing to rich white tourists, even if that was you, but of course this feeling was not to be trusted: you liked their unfriendliness because they seemed more authentically anti-capitalist that way. Especially wild was a woman about my age at the main reception desk, who evidently had to handle all the complaints about the wee-fee service in the lobby. She looked at you dead-level and half-smiling when you approached as if in her mind she were already pushing in the blade. At the desk, they sold little scratch cards, with passwords on them, that looked like lottery tickets and in hindsight had much else in common with lottery tickets. But there were no cards that day. ''They are in the city,'' she said -- and in my mind I saw them being unloaded from small boats at night -- ''but we don't have them here.'' I was advised to try the hotel next door, a few minutes' walk -- another, equally massive, equally generically pan-Latin-style Gaviota hotel. Would a card I bought there work here? ''I hope so,'' she said, still doing that smile. ''But,'' I said, ''we made reservations at this hotel specifically because you advertised the wee-fee service.'' A total lie. We didn't need it. I wanted to see if she would crack. She shook her head so slowly with exaggeratedly sincere sorrow, like a long-suffering teacher forced to tell her most obnoxious pupil he had failed. ''I understand,'' she murmured, and went back to work.
Partly what had been clashing were our respective ideas about the role of an individual in solving a crisis. In the United States, we all go around so empowered-feeling all the time, and when you travel you feel it, a sense of hypertrophy, the thing that makes us look like giant babies to the Europeans. Bring us our soda refills or we'll get them ourselves! The sheer notion that I thought she herself could do anything about the wee-fee, about getting the cards here faster, was probably genuinely amusing to her. Did I not think she wanted the wee-fee fixed? Did I think she actually liked standing there answering the exact same question from a never-ending line of childishly outraged foreigners?
At the neighboring hotel, they did have cards. But their wee-fee was down. ''It's not working?'' I asked the man. ''It's working,'' he said, ''but not right now.'' The whole island's Internet runs through three unpredictable satellites, although I had read that a cable of some kind was recently installed. If so, it did not get routed to these hotels. Which was lucky in the end -- it accelerated the technological molting that had to happen and left you feeling more present. In the basement, near the business center (where a woman took delight in telling travelers from all lands that they could not do various simple-sounding things on the computer consoles), I noticed a small postcard that showed a picture of Fidel, and the caption read in Spanish, ''In the history of U.S. intelligence, no greater amount of money and resources have been put toward bringing down a single man than have been spent to get Fidel.'' And below that, ''El mérito es estar vivo.'' Roughly, ''the victory lies in staying alive.''
I kept seeing small groups of Asian men get on and off the elevators. That was new. Ten years ago the only Asian faces you might have seen were in Chinatown -- there is one in Havana, Barrio Chino, several square blocks of ostensibly Chinese restaurants and faded signs with lanterns and pagodas on them, a neighborhood left behind by thousands of Chinese agricultural workers who arrived in the 19th century, and where very occasionally you might still see Asian features. These guys -- all men, I saw no women -- seemed dressed as inconspicuously as possible, loosefitting light-blue jeans and generic polo shirts and sunglasses. The bartender told me that they were here to do business. China was doing ''bastante de negocios'' in Cuba these days, including in oil, he said. At that moment a Chinese-made exploratory rig sat about 30 miles off the northern coast. We would be able to see it, he said, driving along the main highway. Cuba has lately been partnering with foreign petroleum companies to explore prospective undersea oil fields. A major discovery would be a mainline to economic independence, that most long-elusive goal of the revolution. So far, though, the wells have come up dry or disappointing.
Cuba's involvement with China has been intensifying for more than a decade, as Russian influence has receded. The Chinese have built an amusement park and sold fleets of buses. They have been granted use -- if our intelligence can be trusted -- of a large signals-intelligence base on the outskirts of Havana near the airport, a giant electronic ear-horn right off our shores, the price we pay for renouncing any involvement with a country so close. There is the sheer geopolitical weirdness of Guantánamo's being there, too: the Chinese and the Americans operating on the same island, off the coast of Florida. Guantánamo was supposed to be gone. It's holding on like the Castros.
The empty midafternoon lobby was vast and square-tiled and full of the drone of floor waxing, and the 6-year-old spilled into it laughing, her mother racewalking behind her, trying to catch her. They saw me at the bar and ran over. ''We have to show you this,'' the 6-year-old said. She was pulling on my wife's purse. Mariana pulled out her phone and pushed play on a movie, handing it to me. At the aquarium, a little boy had celebrated his birthday, and his parents had gone in for the dolphin special. You put the kid on a raft and pushed it out into the pool. Shortly thereafter, one of the aquarium's giant 500-pound dolphins started jumping over the kid and raft, in great looping leaps, one after the other. The splash was considerable. The kid looked terrified, he was face forward, clutching the raft at the edges. The repeating image of the dolphin -- frozen massive and pendulous directly above him -- got better every time. The audience laughed and clapped in the concrete bleachers, you could hear it on the video. My wife was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. ''You wouldn't see that in the States,'' she said proudly.
We scanned for the Chinese-built oil platform the next day, and thought we saw something once, though it may have been a ship. To ride along the coastal road with the windows down was sublime. The gaps between houses kept giving you glimpses of the sea behind. There weren't many other cars, but the few that passed left a heavy, organic smell of exhaust in the air. You could taste dinosaurs in it. It carried that precatalytic-converter nostalgia. We were driving down the spine of Cuba, into the vast green interior of the island. Hitchhikers were scattered along the highway, as were people selling various things -- garlic, strings of fish. They ran at you as you passed, yelling and seeming to come too close to the car.
I woke up the next day to the sounds of morning pool activity. Water splashing on concrete. Insistent, unfamiliar bird song. Sleepy murmurs of people rubbing lotion on themselves. Hotel carts rattled by outside the double glass doors. It was about 8 a.m. in Varadero on a warm spring day, which I'm pretty sure is literally Utopia, in some vague historico-linguistic way: the northern shore of Cuba, that supposedly moved Columbus to call this the most beautiful place human eyes had ever seen. My wife has a thing about going to Varadero when she goes to Cuba. I don't know if she even likes it. She does it for her family. To them it would seem insane to skip it -- it was the place they most wanted to go when they lived there -- not to go, on returning, would be like taking a trip to Keystone, S.D., and not going to see Mount Rushmore.
Sitting up in my twin bed, I looked over at the queen bed -- they were already gone. The massive cafeteria operation swung into motion for only a couple of hours each morning. You had to be there for the stampede. We were moving through different micro-Cubas so quickly; too quickly, really. The day before we rode horses through the jungle to see the ruins of ancient coffee plantations and the stone huts where the slaves were kept. We passed cooperative villages of campesinos in the forest and heard political speeches coming from loudspeakers, something about the new agriculture laws. The previous night, coming in on the suddenly pitch-black Cuban highways, zooming up to unlighted ''Road Closed'' signs at 60 miles an hour, swerving to miss car-killing potholes and horse-drawn wagons . . . that was already dreamlike. And now we were navigating the omelet and cereal stations, in lines of mainly European tourists: Germans, Italians, Central Europeans and also Brazilians, Argentines and Canadians. (You know when you're meeting a Canadian, because they always ask, in the same shocked tone, ''How did you get into the country?'' It's an opportunity to remind you that you can't go legally, and they can. And by extension, that they come from a more enlightened land. ''You need to grow up about that stuff,'' one guy that I met at a nature preserve said, to which I wanted to tell him to get a large and powerful population of Cuban exiles and move them into an election-determining province of Canada and call me in the morning.)
The cook at the omelet station, when he asked where I was from and I told him, put up his fists like a boxer, as if we were about to have it out, then started laughing. He told me that he had family in the United States, in Florida. That's what everyone says. You can't understand the transnationally dysfunctional, mutually implicated relationship between Cuba and Miami, that defies all embargoes and policies of ''definitive abandonment,'' until you realize that the line often cuts through families, almost always, in fact. People make all sorts of inner adjustments. I told the man I hated the embargo (the blockade, as they call it) and thought it was stupid, which was both true and what he wanted to hear. He gave me a manly clap-grasp. I didn't go on and say, of course, that I disliked the embargo most because it, more than anything, has kept the Castros in power for half a century, given them a ready-made Goliath for their David. Thanks to the embargo, when the Castros rail against us as an imperialist enemy, they aren't really lying. We have in effect declared ourselves the enemy of the Cuban people and done it under the banner of their freedom, hitting Cuba in a way that, after all, makes only the people suffer, and far from punishing those in power, rewards them and buttresses their story. As for the argument that to deal with tyrants would render our foreign policy incoherent, we deal with worse every day -- we've armed worse -- and in countries that don't have a deeply intimate history with ours, going back centuries. All this because a relatively small but highly mobilized exile community holds sway in a state that has the power to elect presidents. There was no way to gauge how much of this the man would agree with. We left it at mutually thinking the embargo sucked.
Out by the pool, where my wife and daughter were swimming, I lay on a chaise in the shade, feeling paler and softer than I ever had in my life and unlocatably depressed in the way that resorts do so well. I read ''Doctor Zhivago,'' a new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (the husband-and-wife team who have been retranslating the Russian classics for more than 20 years). ''Zhivago'' isn't on the Tolstoy/Chekhov level, but there are wonderful passages, including one that I thought spoke to the gruffness you often encounter in Cubans, the excessive suspicion of introductory small talk they sometimes demonstrate. ''The fear known as spymania,'' Pasternak wrote about Russia after the revolution, ''had reduced all speech to a single formal, predictable pattern. The display of good intentions in discourse was not conducive to conversation.''
Every time I looked up from the book, there were more people in and by the pool, as if they were surfacing out of the water, out of the ripples. I had black sunglasses on, so after a while I propped myself at an angle at which I could seem to read the book but really be moving my eyeballs, staring at everybody. God, the human body! It was Speedos and bikinis, no matter the age or body type. You would never see a poolside scene in the United States with people showing this much skin, except at a pool where people were there precisely to show off the perfection of their bodies. The body not consciously sculptured through working out has become a secret shame and grotesquerie in America, but this upper-class Euro-Latin crowd had not received that news, to my distraction. I took in veins and cellulite, paunches and man-paps, the weird shinglelike sagging that starts to occur on the back of the thighs, cleavage that showed a spoiled-grape-like wrinkling, the ash-mottled skin of permanently sun-torched shoulders, all of it beautiful. All of it beautiful and tormenting. You watched an 18-year-old Argentine girl in her reproductive springtime walk past an ancient Soviet-looking woman, her body a sculpture of blocks atop blocks, and both of them wearing black bikinis, the furtive looks they gave each other, full of emotions straight from the Pliocene, from the savanna. The old men scowled from behind mirrored shades. The young men tensed every muscle in order to seem not obsessed with how the girls saw them, a level of self-consciousness I found I could no longer really re-enter, as if it had been a drunken state. Everybody was stealing looks at one another, envying or disdaining or gazing, like me. We were all inside a matrix of lust and erotic sadness, all turning into versions of one another, or seeing our past selves.
My wife's people come from a small town with a strange name, a rare Spanish word that almost doesn't look Spanish when you see it. When they lived there, the place was not considered all that far from things, from the cities, but the decay of infrastructure, the collapse of the trains, has left it stranded. There's simply no reason to have heard of it.
The first time I went, before we were married, they made a big thing of me. Yankees almost never appear in this town, unless they are lost. I walked into a stuccoed, leafy house on a quiet street, a house full of loud talking, hands grabbing my arms. Everyone kissed and cried over my wife, whom they hadn't seen since she was a teenager. They nicknamed me ''Wao,'' because everything they would tell me, I would say, ''Wow.'' It seemed the appropriate response. Wei-Wei, the abuelita, had come with us, or rather we had gone with her -- it ended up being probably the last time she would ever go back -- and she sent money ahead of our visit, for them to buy food with. She's always sending money, but this time she sent more, and they laid in pork and all the spices they needed. There was a long table. All of the men were named some version of Rafael, Rafaelito, Rafaelín. The matriarch, a shy and tiny woman named Haydee (eye-day), presided with birdlike hands, making little apologies. You didn't even have to chew the pork, you could just sort of let it melt. They made chicharrones de viento, wind-crackers, the Cubans' witty name for a kind of poverty-inspired something, frisked up out of salt and flour and a little lard. There was a bottle of Havana Club on the table -- the first time I ever saw or tasted it. Knowing only a little classroom Spanish, I struggled to follow their phrases, the swift and expressive but mud-mouthed Spanish spoken on the island.
After dinner, I made the mistake of saying something about a cigar. It wasn't as if I asked for one. I probably said something like, ''I hear that your country is famous for its cigars.'' But they took this as an overpolite way of asking for one, so the hunt began. The shops were closed, but the Rafaels started working on the car. You've heard, no doubt, how in Cuba they still drive working American cars from the 1950s, but this was something else, a Frankenstein made from the parts of about four different cars from the '50s and one Russian car apparently from the '70s. They got this creature going, and we started moving through the streets. No headlights -- one of them held an electric lantern out the window. It was wired to the cigarette lighter. We needed it badly. Within a mile of leaving the town, we were in the face-close darkness of unlighted rural roads. They took me to a kind of kiosk, an open bar in the middle of a field. I don't know what it was, really. A kind of club. All of the men, about seven of them, were workers in the tobacco fields. They would smuggle out a cigar or two each week, maybe defective ones, for personal use or the chance to trade it away. Rafelito told me, ''This is the puro puro.''
Back at the house, half the neighborhood gathered to watch me huff on this thing, many, I slowly realized, hoping to see me vomit. I stood outside on a back patio, amid chicken coops. The cigar went to my head like thunder. My knees became untrustworthy. But no throwing up. Rafaelito had too much to drink and danced like a crazy person. As a boy, he lost his only brother, drowned in the river. His father, Rafael, approached me with a wagging finger, asking me if I liked the country. Of course, I said, bonita, linda y la gente.
''Si.'' He looked a little bit like a Cuban Groucho Marx. ''Si, te gusta el pais,'' he said. ''Pero, te gusta el sistema?'' He pulled the syllables of el sistema out of his mouth like draws of taffy.
Now they were all gone, all the Rafaels. The two older ones were dead from disease, and the youngest one had gone to Miami, I don't even know how. There is a kind of lottery, apparently. Perhaps he won it. He's working as a mechanic. The house was completely different. The ground floor was empty and quiet.
Haydee, the old woman of the house, was still there, even more ancient but seemingly unchanged. I saw her do the same thing now to the 6-year-old that she did to my wife those years ago, wrap her arms around the girl and sort of refuse to leave, the way a child would. ''I'm keeping her here,'' she said. ''You, go back.''
Her husband and son were gone, her grandson gone to Miami. Her other grandson, Erik, half-brother of the boy who left, was still around. In fact, he was thriving. He had started a little furniture business. He was living in the house with his wife and daughter, and all had been going well. But just months before, they lost a son, an infant, to a respiratory disease. So within a short span of years, he lost his father, grandfather and his brother (to emigration), and now his son. He was the only male in the house.
Erik's daughter, a young girl with glasses and reddish-brown hair, was as shy as her grandmother. She stayed on the edges of whatever room we were in. My daughter was at my feet, peeking through my legs at her. I could feel their intense awareness of each other, but neither would approach.
After lunch, while Erik was explaining different aspects of the furniture operation to me, my 6-year-old came up and started tugging on my shirt. She was mouthing something at me. I kept saying, ''Please don't interrupt, sweetheart.'' She said, ''Give me your phone!'' I excused myself from Erik for a second to give her a little lecture. I knew she was bored, I said, but this was an important day, and she needed to use her manners, not play with the phone. ''Give me the phone!'' she said, and ran off in a huff when I refused.
Barely 20 minutes later we went back upstairs and passed by the little girl's room. She and the 6-year-old were sitting on the bed, playing on a phone. It was my wife's. The 6-year-old had taught her cousin to play Angry Birds. They were smiling and leaning on each other. For the next two days they were completely inseparable and wanted to sleep in the same room. They communicated through my wife when they really needed to work something out. They will probably know each other for the rest of their lives now, because of that game.
We went out walking the streets, making the rounds to see other family members -- to the old church, with its brightly painted statue of St. Julian, where Wei-Wei was married and where they remembered her, ''la maestra,'' past the school where she taught and the corner store her father owned, where first she and then her children, my mother-in-law and her brother, grew up playing, before it was taken away -- and as we strolled, I had a diminished, doubtless much-flawed version of the old woman's cake-box map in my head. I was hearing her voice-over, all the stories she told me over almost 20 years now, some of them repetitive, but with details emerging and receding.
Her memories of the revolution begin with the shortwave radio, kept in the back room by her husband. Wei-Wei and her husband would gather with friends to listen to the transmissions that the Castro brothers and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos (the best loved of the young comandantes, at least by my wife's family, worshiped as a pop star by my mother-in-law, then 11) were broadcasting from the mountains, giving assurance that they were about to ride down and liberate the island. For years I assumed that the family had been listening to these speeches in fear -- as a couple, they were about as solidly middle class as could be, a teacher and a tobacco salesman, and their later experience of the revolution involved only pain and regret -- but the abuelita surprised me one night, at the table, by saying that, on the contrary, they heard those speeches with great excitement. No one liked Batista, no one who wasn't directly benefiting from his thuggery and favoritism. The powerful charisma of the freedom fighters had percolated down into even quiet, apolitical homes.
There was a night back home, after a long meal, when for the first time after knowing her for so long, I got a bit pushy with her -- asked her follow-up questions instead of just mm-hmming -- and she gave me a description of what it had actually been like to watch this optimism turn to fear, and something worse, what that had actually looked like. When the milicianos first came from the mountains, she said, ''they come to say hello with this necklace made of pieces of wood and a gold cross.'' They mugged for the cameras with these crosses in their teeth. I asked why. ''For you to look at. To pretend that they are Christian. That they believe in God.''
''Everybody cooperate with Fidel,'' she said. ''Everybody was happy that we had the opportunity to have all the freedom that he promise.'' She taught adult literacy classes at night.
Change came with the arrival of the comites, one house per block, appointed as the government representative for its households. The rapidity with which that degenerated into spying and becoming complicit in spying had been breathtaking to watch play out in stark anthropological terms. Within months, they were taking children aside at school and asking them about their parents. The parents started pulling the children out. The first nonpolitical families started to flee. People betrayed their neighbors to the comites. A woman who lived in the neighborhood, a woman named Solita, ''somebody accuse her of having fried pork in her house. And they make -- she was a teacher -- they make a public, ¿come se llama?, juicio?'' Trial. ''Exactly. Accusing her of having pork.''
My wife's grandfather had let it be known that he was against the Castros -- not because he had preferred Batista; in fact, the family had some obscure connection, that I've never been able to get anyone to be forthcoming about, to one of the other revolutionaries in the mountains, a rival who was executed not long after the uprising -- in any case it was known that the family's sympathies did not lie with the communists. ''I remember one time we going to the farm,'' she said, ''and when we was coming back, we stop in Mario's grandmother's house, and we saw my brother passing on the road very fast. We get scared. We say, 'What happened?' He says, 'The police is going to ask for, getting into your house.' And at this time we was already saving some American money to come here. And you believe or not? The first thing that I do in the house was burning the dollars. To be sure that they don't find it out.''
The party came and took away the family business. They took the store. They took the car, covered in tobacco advertisements. They took ''a house of birds.'' Not yours anymore. They took a little dog, named Mocha. They took pictures off the wall. They came in and counted the number of pictures, and took a certain percentage of them. Absurd things. They took away the family's tiny beach house in Playa del Rosario, ''gave it to some fishman.'' But this succession of losses came to seem indistinct against what was happening outside. The picture had darkened. ''So bad, so cruel all the things that they do it,'' she said. ''The television was on all day long.'' She meant both that they were watching all day long, and that the revolutionaries were transmitting constantly. There was ''a man that the name Blanco,'' she said. And his trial concerned ''if he abuse the farmers, if he do all these things that accuse him to do it.'' They found him guilty. ''Then the people go to the street, singing, 'Paredon paredon paredon! Paredon means 'kill in front of the wall.'' And then they put this in television. And you see the brain of this man jumping out. It was getting gross and gross and gross.'' She resigned her job, and they essentially went into hiding.
She got her two children out first, my mother-in-law and her brother, on waivers made possible by the C.I.A.-initiated, Catholic-sponsored airlift known as Pedro Pan. The story goes that the C.I.A. started spreading rumors on the island that the government was about to take away the children, raise them in camps. People panicked, and the planes were waiting to fly them away. The children wound up living with Catholic families all over the United States or, in this case, with an aunt in North Carolina. Eventually Wei-Wei and her husband got out, through Mexico, and joined the children. But Pedro Pan tore apart many families.
We arrived at the house of some cousins, two twins, small men now in their 50s, one with a mustache and one without, who live with their mother, whom they tend to hover about protectively. Their father died after having walked himself to the hospital, after a heart attack. Nobody had a car, nobody's phone worked. The revolution is famous around the world for its health care, but for a Cuban, that care can be hard to access, especially if you live far from one of the major cities.
The six-year-old and her cousin were sitting on the sofa, ignoring everyone. They were holding up dolls to each other in different poses, sort of: ''What do you think of this? Do you approve of this?'' We unloaded the presents we brought for the twins. They handed my wife a book of socialist Cuban film reviews from before the revolution, actually a rare and useful book -- one of them is a from-home bookseller, and he had come across it somewhere.
As we were standing around he said, ''Did you know that my brother'' -- the one with no mustache -- ''was on a game show?''
They brought forth a VHS tape and started reconfiguring the wires to make the VCR work. Soon a picture of the studio appeared, three contestants behind their buzzers. The tape had been recorded over many times. There was a constant flickering of white meteors across the image. Felipe to the far left, smiling, looking confident in a light-green short-sleeve shirt. The game had to do with rhyming. They would say, ''Two words: one of them describes a fruit, one describes a family member.'' Answer: lima and prima. Felipe didn't win, but did well enough, as I understood it, to be invited back. He looked on screen like he was having a great time. The show had a carefree attitude, compared with something similar in the United States. The stakes were very low. You can't have games of chance or leisure games involving any amount of money, they said. It was outlawed by the revolution, as part of the purifying backlash against the mob-led casino power. So the prizes were things like a signed poster of a famous Spanish pop singer or a decorative mirror. Nobody was going to cry over losing. We congratulated Felipe on having held his own. He brought out the small metal lamp-sculpture he won.
Before we left the country, we spent a last day and night in Havana. Heaven weather. We stepped into the grand cathedral, on one of the main squares in the old part of town, and listened to a women's choir that was practicing for the pope. I saw blue-and-red signs announcing his impending visit, ''Viene el Papa!'' The women and girls were dressed in their everyday clothes. They sang beautifully. I'm sure that they were the best that Cuba had.
In the evening, we stood on the Morro, the Spanish castillo across the bay from the Malecón, and looked at the city. There is a Havana -- this was the second time I saw it, a confirmation -- that cannot be captured on photographs, because it involves a totality of light from symphonic Caribbean clouds and the way they play on the whole city, and that appears often enough to represent one of the characteristic faces of the city. The diffused light turns all the buildings a range of pastels. Then as the sun reddens, it becomes rose-colored.
It was 9:30 by the time we got back to our hotel. Normally that would have been past the 6-year-old's bedtime, but my wife had a telephone interview -- meant to happen during the day, it got bumped -- so she needed us out of the room for an hour.
Downstairs we sat and listened to the band do the inescapable (in Havana) ''Hasta Siempre, Comandante,'' with its strange lyrics, ''Here lies the clear/the precious transparency/of your dear presence/Comandante Che Guevara.'' Cats were slinking around. The people going by were of every shade, and many with striking faces. In the most Spanish faces you could see flashes of the Old World stock that supplied the island with settlers: the equine noses, the long mouths, at times a Middle Eastern cast, features I knew from my wife's family pictures.
On the sidewalk a young bicycle-taxi driver named Manuel approached us, a well-built kid in jean shorts and a tank-top, about 19. He said he knew an ice cream place that was still open. We set out through the night. Many of the streets were dark. It was chilly already, and the 6-year-old huddled against my side. It was one of those moments when you know that you are where you're supposed to be. If your destiny wavered, it has at least momentarily recovered its track. We ate our chocolate ice cream at an outdoor bar, under a half moon.
On the way back to the hotel, Manuel asked what I did. When I told him I was a reporter, he said: ''You'd hate it here. There is no freedom of expression here.''
He launched into a tirade against the regime. ''It is basically a prison,'' he said. ''Everyone is afraid.''
The things he said, which I had heard many times before -- that you can go to prison for nothing, that there's no opportunity, that people are terrified to speak out -- are the reason I can never quite get with my leftie-most friends on Cuba, when they want to make excuses for the regime. It's simply a fact that nearly every Cuban I've ever come to know beyond a passing acquaintance, everyone not involved with the party, will turn to you at some point and say something along the lines of, ''It is a prison here.'' I just heard it from one of the men who worked for Erik, back in the hometown. I remarked to him that storefronts on the streets looked a little bit better, more freshly painted. It was a shallow, small-talky observation.
''No,'' he said, turning his head and exhaling smoke.
''You mean things haven't improved?'' I said.
''There is no future,'' he said. ''We are lost.''
The 6-year-old kept asking me what Manuel was saying. I was doing my best to describe el sistema. Interesting trying to explain to a child educated in a Quaker Montessori school what could possibly be wrong with everyone sharing.
We passed the museum with the Granma, the leisure boat that in 1956 carried Fidel and Raúl and Che and Camilo Cienfuegos and 78 other Cuban revolutionaries from Mexico to a beach on the island's southeast coast. The cruiser was all lighted up with aquamarine lights, in a building made of glass. It looked underwater. Manuel stopped the bicycle-taxi and gazed on it with obvious pride.
''There's always an armed guard in front of it,'' he said, nodding his head toward a young man in a green uniform, who was standing with a machine gun over his shoulder.
''They're worried that someone will try to blow it up or something?'' I said.
''They're worried that someone will steal it and go to Miami,'' he said.
There was a time Mariana took me to Cuba, and we went to a town called Remedios, in the central part of the island. It is one of the most ancient Cuban cities. The church on the main square dates from the Renaissance. When it was restored in the 1950s, the workers discovered that under the white paint on the high ceiling was a layer of pure gold. The townspeople had safeguarded it from the pirates in that manner. We stayed in the home of a man named Piloto. A friendly bicycle-taxi driver, who introduced himself as Max, told us that Piloto worked for the government and rented out his spare room only in order to spy on tourists, and that we should be careful what we said there. But all we ever got from Piloto and his wife was a nearly silent politeness and one night a superb lobster dinner. My most vivid memory of Remedios is of being taken to the house of an artist who lived there, a woodcarver. The bicycle-taxi driver told us that anyone who had ''a great interest in culture'' needed to visit the home of this particular artist. The next day he took us there, in the afternoon. We rode behind a row of houses that had strange paintings and animal figures hanging in their breezeways. After what seemed a long time for a bicycle-taxi ride, we arrived at the woman's place. Taking out a cigarette, Max told us to walk ahead, he would wait. At the door of a small, salmon-colored house, an old woman met us. Not the artist, it emerged. This was the artist's mother. We sat with her in a kind of narrow front parlor, where she made sweetly formal small talk for maybe 20 minutes, telling us every so often that the artist would be out soon.
At a certain moment, a woman appeared in the passageway that led from the front room into the main part of the house, a woman with rolls of fat on her limbs, like a baby, and skin covered in moles. She walked on crutches with braces on her knees. She had a beautiful natural Afro with a scarf tied around it. She was simply a visually magnificent human being. She told us the prices of her works, and we bought a little chicken carving. She said almost nothing otherwise -- she had difficulty speaking -- but when we stood up to leave, she lifted a hand and spoke, or rather delivered, this sentence. It was evidently the message among all others that she deemed most essential for U.S. visitors. ''I know that at present there are great differences between our peoples,'' she said, ''but in the future all will be well, because we are all the sons and daughters of Abraham Lincoln.''

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
IN July, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced his competition to create a building of residential ''micro-units'' in Manhattan, each ranging from 275 to 300 square feet, the plan ignited the imagination of countless architects and developers.
It also gave many New Yorkers a joltingly fresh perspective. For those who already consider themselves space-starved, quarters that are even more cramped seemed inconceivable. Yet to others, an apartment of that size sounded crazy-huge.
Consider Gab Stolarski, who happily renewed the lease for her West Village studio apartment-- all 170 square feet of it.
As she welcomes a visitor to her fourth-floor walk-up, Ms. Stolarski, a manager in the digital sales group at Condé Nast, recites the stock reaction to her pinkie toehold in Manhattan: '' 'Oh! Ohhh. It's ... cute! And you have a bathroom, too!' '' 
Plus 35 pairs of shoes.
Although her charming aerie has a working fireplace and a courtyard view, here is what Ms. Stolarski's apartment does not have: a couch; tchotchkes; specks of dirt; paperwork (''I'm 25,'' she shrugs. ''I'm a digital girl.''); food.
Yet the studio, which was represented by Prudential Douglas Elliman, perfectly matches her priorities. A clotheshorse who doesn't cook, she stores sweaters, not soy sauce, in her kitchen cabinets. She covers her stove burners with a cutting board -- not for serving cheese and crackers, but as a counter area to dump sunglasses and her purse du jour. More important, she lives in her favorite neighborhood, near transportation, and for a rent that is almost bearable: $1,745 a month (Manhattan one-bedroom rents have inched over $3,300). As for entertaining guests? Like many others with no space to spare, she usually meets friends at bars and restaurants.
''The city as living room is key,'' said Susanne Schindler, an architect with Team R8, a design group that contributed to Making Room, an initiative of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which explores designs for diverse housing options, including micro-units.
The allure of living in New York City, particularly for young singles, is as inexorable as the cruel math of making it happen. With rents heading in one direction only and more people wanting to live here, it's a good bet that most people who move to the city will get considerably less space than they had hoped. But after they work through all the mental moves required to justify their choice to the dumbfounded -- ''You're paying that much for this?''-- comes the real adjustment: nesting in a space scarcely bigger than a bird's nest.
For newcomers, that mental realignment can take considerable effort. Yes, large wall mirrors are a venerable design trick. The overstuffed couch can find its way to the street. But how do you fit your brain into the tight corset of your new home?
That is the challenge to renters that the Bloomberg administration set up with its competitive bid for architects and developers. The goal, said city housing officials, is to help singles remain in New York, contributing to its financial and creative lifeblood. According to the mayor's office, the city has 1.8 million one- and two-person households, but scarcely half the available housing scaled to fit -- only one million studios and one-bedroom apartments. The need for smaller housing will only increase: planning officials project that by 2030, the population will grow by 900,000, most of whom will not be in traditional nuclear families.
The administration is trying to jump-start a model for small-space affordable housing before the mayor leaves office in January 2014. (Officials declined to put a specific dollar figure on ''affordable.'') Earlier this month, the city received 33 proposals, from as far afield as London and Amsterdam, for a building of at least 50 micro-units on East 27th Street, replacing what is now a parking lot. The winning proposal is expected to be announced in December, with groundbreaking planned, fingers crossed, for December 2013.
For the new building's potential renters, worry not. There is extensive precedent for living tiny and tranquilly in Manhattan.
As Ms. Stolarski and others who live in studios smaller than the mayor's minimum can attest, the experience can be liberating. If you downsize your stuff along with your expectations of square footage, you really can do more with less. And surely you can do more with less rent.
''I thought I'd crave more space,'' said Lauren Applebaum, 30, who used to live in a 700-square-foot Toronto apartment. In January, when she started graduate school at New York University, she and her Yorkshire terrier moved into a 200-square foot studio on West 75th Street. But after her broker, Citi Habitats' Rory Bolger, a studio man himself, showed her tips to expand the room -- a cubbyhole divider to screen off her bed; furniture that does double duty, like a dresser-TV stand -- ''I think that extra space would be unnecessary.''
In June, J. Michael Moore, an interior designer, traded a 700-square-foot one-bedroom plus a storefront, both in the East 70s, for the 225-square-foot studio that is now his home and office on East 55th. He pronounces his budget healthier and himself happier, with only one regret: his queen-size bed. ''I'm 6-4,'' he said, ''and it's different to crawl on a loft.''
Living small in New York becomes an exercise in craftiness, and discovering multiple uses for a surface. What others may see as deprivation, Mr. Moore and others have reframed as pride, with Shaker-like design values of simplicity and utility.
But not necessarily Shaker celibacy. In 2009, Kittie Lonsdale, a small-space designer, left behind a 4,500-square-foot home in Dallas and moved herself, her business and her ''microsize dog,'' a 10-pound Shih Tzu whose raincoats, treats, leads and sleeping box ''take up more real estate than anything else,'' into a 225-square-foot studio in Tudor City. Ten days a month, her husband joins her from Dallas, the headquarters for his private investment firm.
''We think of the apartment as a haven,'' Mrs. Lonsdale said. ''We don't go out much: we work, work, work, and at night, all we want is each other.
''But living here as a couple, it's like a dance: you both have to know the steps. You have to orchestrate your moves.'' Accommodation and compatibility are critical: ''On Saturdays, if we both get work calls, one of us has to take theirs into the bathroom.''
Leonard Koren, who writes books about design and aesthetics, said that for a relationship to thrive in close quarters, the couple must acquiesce to the constraints of the space, which could otherwise grind them down.
In the early 1990s, he and his then-wife lived in a 240-square-foot Tokyo apartment. It included a washer, a dryer, a bath and a shower.
''It was a learning curve,'' said Mr. Koren, who now lives in Point Reyes, Calif. ''What is essential is that the place can't feel like a prison. You have to have some natural external light and preferably a view that you could construe as pleasant, so you can project yourself onto a borrowed landscape that extends the psychological space.''
It requires work to live small, Mr. Koren added. Clutter is more glaring and emotionally disruptive. Food trash has to be disposed of immediately, the futon tucked into its slot every morning, each object stored after use. ''The psychological wear and tear on us was very much evident the first year and a half we lived there,'' he said.
But when they looked at larger apartments, they decided to stay put: ''We had modified our behavior,'' he said. ''Our apartment became cozy as opposed to oppressively small.''
At that time, Mr. Koren recalled, Japanese businessmen who had moved to New York were returning to Tokyo after the burst of the economic bubble. Reporters would sometimes ask them whether they missed their large Manhattan apartments. ''They said: 'They're great, but Japanese abodes are more convenient. You're not searching all over the place for stuff. You don't need an intercom system to find each other.' ''
Neither claustrophobia nor loneliness was mentioned by the studio dwellers. Mrs. Lonsdale, who prepares elaborate meals with a hideaway induction cooktop and a slow cooker, says she feels catlike in her retreat. Ms. Stolarski treasures the quiet and solitude, not least because she doesn't spend much time at home. She has a crowded, noisy life outside, exploring the city, and gathers with friends for hours in Washington Square Park, ''having an awesome time, looking at the people,'' she said. They consider the park their communal living room.
As for the startling concept of the affordable, minimal apartment, New York is an arriviste. San Francisco, Seattle and Boston have micro-units in various stages of planning, construction and completion. Cheekily marketed as ''micro-suites,'' ''aPodments,'' ''solos'' and ''inno (as in innovation) units,'' they vary in amenity levels, square footage and rent, but are smaller and cheaper than market-rate apartments.
Jim Potter, a Seattle developer, has been building small-unit housing since 2009. Although the tiniest measures about 90 square feet, most have about 200, in five-story buildings that average 55 rooms. One project is in Redmond, Wash., biking distance from Microsoft's offices. The rents range from $600 to $800, much cheaper than typical one-bedrooms nearby that rent for about $1,500. Each room includes a bed, a table, a chair, Internet access and a ''convenience center'' -- microwave, minifridge, sink.
The buildings have full kitchens that can be shared by residents of every eight rooms, but they are used so rarely that Mr. Potter faulted the Bloomberg requirement for full kitchens as a waste of money and space.
Moreover, he added: ''We don't do closets. Our customers say they don't need them,'' preferring racks and open shelving. ''We don't do cars. We are big on bikes.''
His buildings, he said, are always at 100 percent occupancy. He offers three-month-minimum leases. But the ''customers'' (a term he prefers to ''tenants'') are more diverse than the solo 20-somethings for whom similarly sized dwellings in, say, Boston are being envisioned.
The customers range in age from 18 to 72: students, baristas, the newly separated, scientists hired for short-term research projects, truck drivers, an elderly couple from North Carolina who visit a grandchild who is undergoing several brain operations.
Patrick C. Kennedy, a Bay Area developer, is building 300-square-foot units -- SmartSpaces -- in a San Francisco neighborhood. He expects that rents will start around $960.
''We want to find the optimal size to satisfy the needs of most individuals,'' Mr. Kennedy said. He believes this to be 220 square feet -- although San Francisco zoning codes require 290. Mr. Kennedy, who built a 160-square-foot prototype to experiment with furnished, prefabricated options, says those needs include large windows, a full bathroom and built-in furniture that will allow the tenant to have ''cocktails and dinner for four.''
ADD Inc, a Boston architecture firm, has been gripped by the potential for small apartments for the city's ''innovation district'' and has also entered New York's competition. While designing models for ''inno units,'' the firm organized focus groups of young professionals, showing them elegant examples that, for example, hid beds and transformed tables for multiple uses. Designers asked which elements were essential for small-space survival.
''They said, 'This is for architect nerds,' '' said Tamara Roy, an ADD Inc architect. '' 'We want it to be flexible and cheap. We can fill it with Ikea.' ''
What did they require individually, and what could they share?
''They wanted a bathroom, a bed and a microkitchen,'' Ms. Roy said. ''The living room could be outside, a party space they could share with others in the building. They would much rather have that face-to-face social networking.''
And, of course, a city they could afford to work and play in, just outside the building's front door.

HEADLINE: Republican Adopts Cuts In Defense As His Issue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
STAFFORD, Va. -- Just outside the gates of the storied Quantico Marine Base, George Allen, the Republican nominee for a Senate seat from Virginia, sat down in the offices of a moving van company with more than a dozen defense contractors from his state last Monday to listen to them fret over government spending cuts.
Scott Hirons's small software firm will probably have to shrink to five employees from 15 by the end of October if nothing is done to head off automatic, across-the-board defense cuts, he said. The cuts will not begin until January, if ever, but the threat alone has already frozen the contracting world, Mr. Hirons said. John Radziszewski worried not just about spending cuts but also about the Pentagon's recent moves to ''in-source'' work to government research labs to save money.
''I personally could never imagine voting for something so devastating to our national security and jobs in Virginia,'' said Mr. Allen, a former senator seeking to regain the seat he lost six years ago to Jim Webb, a Democrat, who is retiring. 
In an election year when the Republican Party has set itself up as a paragon of small government and the scourge of federal debt, Mr. Allen is taking a different tack. He has made opposition to the bipartisan deficit reduction law of 2011 the centerpiece of his campaign. In Virginia, home to thousands of defense contractors ringing the Pentagon and vast military bases around Norfolk, Mr. Allen is seen as the Old Dominion's version of Senator Pothole -- as former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, was known for his attention to local issues.
It is a delicate target. After all, the Budget Control Act was written to end a Republican-made standoff over raising the nation's statutory borrowing limit. It passed with the votes of the entire Republican leadership, including Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. One person who did not vote for it was Mr. Allen's Democratic opponent, former Gov. Tim Kaine, who has never held a seat in Congress.
But in what may still be the closest Senate contest in the country, Mr. Allen believes he has found an issue he can ride back to Washington. A recent round of polls suggests that Mr. Kaine has opened his first real lead of the contest. That has pushed Mr. Allen to press his case against the defense cuts even harder.
''These folks really regret doing it,'' Mr. Allen said of fellow Republicans and their votes. ''Tim Kaine thinks it was the right thing to do. That's beyond me.''
Mr. Allen faces two risks. For one, the more he presses his case against the automatic defense cuts, the more opportunities Mr. Kaine has to demand a specific Allen program of deficit reduction to replace those cuts. For another, conservatives are questioning the fiscal bona fides of Republicans trying to undo the automatic cuts, which are known as sequestration.
Chris Chocola, the president of the conservative political action committee Club for Growth, has been urging Republican candidates to stand by $1 trillion in additional spending cuts. ''I need to see some sign that Congress is willing to do something really hard,'' he said. ''Sequestration is really hard, but they said they were going to do it.''
The automatic cuts are the ugly result of the showdown last year over raising the nation's statutory borrowing limit. A potentially crippling default was averted only after House Republicans and President Obama agreed to 10 years of caps on federal programs at the annual discretion of Congress. Moreover, a special committee was established to find an additional $1 trillion to cut over 10 years. If it failed, the cuts -- half in defense, half in domestic programs -- would kick in.
It failed, and as the deadline for the cuts approaches, a blame game has begun. House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio on Friday again labeled it ''the president's defense sequester.'' Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, called that ''monstrously cynical,'' since the cuts were ''100 percent their creation.''
''It's like a man who kills his mother and father and throws himself on the mercy of the court because he's an orphan,'' he said.
At a debate in Northern Virginia on Thursday, both Senate candidates jumped into the issue almost immediately, but they took very different approaches.
In an interview, Mr. Allen said, ''The responsible thing to do is to propose a way to avert these cuts.'' But at the debate, he spoke generally about how to head off the defense cuts while maintaining deficit reduction targets.
His suggestions: repeal the Obama health care law, although the Congressional Budget Office said a repeal would raise the deficit; expand domestic energy production on federal lands and use royalties to reduce the deficit; and put into effect a voluntary flat tax, which households could choose instead of the existing tax code. That, too, would most likely expand the deficit as taxpayers opted for the tax that saved them money.
Mr. Allen also suggested that Congress start with a bill, already passed by the House, that would cancel the first year of automatic defense cuts by shifting the cuts to domestic programs. But last Monday, when asked if he was endorsing that House measure, he would not commit.
''I haven't had a chance to look at every detail of it,'' he said, ''but if I were in the Senate I'd be saying let's look at this.''
What Mr. Allen said he would not do was raise taxes. ''The men and women in our armed forces should never be used as bargaining chips to raise taxes on job-creating small businesses,'' he said.
Mr. Kaine proposed letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire on incomes over $500,000, which he said would raise $500 billion; repealing tax breaks for oil and gas companies, to raise $24 billion; and allowing the federal government to bargain for lower prescription drug prices for Medicare, for a $240 billion savings. That would leave Congress to find $250 billion in spending cuts over 10 years to avert all the automatic cuts, defense and domestic.
''We have to have shared sacrifice,'' Mr. Kaine said. ''Everybody has to be in the game if we are going to solve our budget issues.''
As Republicans grow more nervous about the defense cuts, some conservatives fear that the party is preparing to cave -- either by agreeing to raise taxes or by simply canceling the cuts. On National Review's Web site last week, Veronique de Rugy, a conservative economist, wrote that even if the automatic cuts were carried out, overall military spending would continue to increase. Republicans who want to stop the cuts, she asserted, are falling into Democratic thinking that the government must prop up employment.
''The Department of Defense is not a jobs program,'' she wrote. ''Its role isn't to sustain defense contractors' profits independently of the security they are actually meant to provide.''
Here in Virginia, where defense contractors make up a substantial chunk of the economy, such ideals may not fly. Mr. Allen's campaign has received nearly $89,000 from the defense industry, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics; Mr. Kaine's campaign has received nearly $70,000.
For now, many defense contractors are sticking with Mr. Allen. Mr. Radziszewski, the executive vice president of the software unit of QinetiQ North America, here in Stafford, said he trusted the Republican to bargain in good faith on behalf of the state's contractors once he returned to the Senate.
But Mr. Radziszewski also delivered a message to the man he says he will vote for. Everything has to be on the table, taxes, domestic spending, even defense.
''The thing that keeps me awake is the bipartisan bickering,'' he told Mr. Allen. ''There's the right wing. There's the left wing. But the answer is always in the middle.''

HEADLINE: The Son Also Sets

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
SOMETIMES in the course of human events, we must ask, as Hemingway did in ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' what is that leopard doing at this altitude?
As a candidate, Mitt Romney is awkward, off-putting and hollow, so bad that if he were a Bain company, he would shut himself down.
The billion-dollar Republican campaign should be sweeping the floor with the deflated President Obama after four years of 8 percent-plus unemployment. Yet it is curdling. The little donations have dried up; how long before the big money follows? 
We must also ask the Hemingway question about Stuart Stevens, the Hemingway manqué running Mitt's campaign. ''The Square and the Flair,'' The New Republic dubbed the synthetic candidate and his sentient adviser, who started as Eudora Welty's paperboy and lived by the Oscar Wilde maxim: ''Nothing succeeds like excess.''
The 58-year-old Mississippi native has written a sexy political novel, scripts for ''Northern Exposure'' and Evelyn Waugh-style travel odysseys. He was a consultant for George Clooney on ''The Ides of March'' and has even written an HBO docudrama about W.'s warrantless domestic spying program, centering on The Times's decision to publish the article by James Risen and Eric Lichtblau that exposed it.
It's hard to believe that the self-styled Renaissance Man who wrote this in ''Feeding Frenzy'' -- ''But next there was the Fricassee De Homard Breton Au Jus De Viande aux chicons confits au gingembre et citron vert. It was fabulous, contradictory but not conflicting, every taste a surprise'' -- works for the Tin Man, whose favorite meal is chocolate milk and peanut butter.
Stevens skied 100 miles to the North Pole and biked 450 miles through the Pyrenees. He wrote a piece for Outside magazine about taking steroids for a French bike race. After Oxford and U.C.L.A. film school, he fell into politics as an escapade, and he likes to maintain that larky affect.
In 2000, when he worked for W., as New Hampshire Republicans headed to the polls on Primary Day to deliver a near-fatal 19-point drubbing of his candidate, Stevens headed out from his hotel carrying skis. Asked by a reporter about his insouciance, he replied that there was nothing he could do at that point.
But his ''devil-may-care routine,'' as The New Republic calls it, may be wearing thin. This isn't merely a plotline for some future script.
This is the real deal.
You get the sense that the strategist considers himself cooler than the candidate, that he's too hip to walk through fire for Mitt and that he lacks confidence that Romney could be a better campaigner. He treats Mitt like a cardboard cutout, never asking him to risk anything or pushing him to be big, bold and inspirational.
Ann Romney is clearly feeling the strain. On Radio Iowa, she ordered whining Republicans: ''Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.'' She said Americans should realize ''how lucky'' they were to have Mitt. She sounded entitled, even as her husband dismissed half the country as entitlement junkies.
An Obama adviser calls the Romney campaign ''a study in mismanagement,'' while the conservative columnist Peggy Noonan deems it ''a rolling calamity.'' Yet after Tampa, Romney gave promised bonuses totaling $192,440 to at least nine senior campaign staff members working under Stevens.
Even if voters are inclined to fire the incumbent, they need reassurance about what the replacement would do. Romney has failed to give details where needed, and when he does give details, they contradict his own past stands.
He finally released a tax return from 2011, showing he paid a higher tax rate than required. The press immediately unearthed a Romney quote from July: ''If I had paid more than are legally due, I don't think I'd be qualified to become president.'' Case closed.
Aside from Mitt's penchant for being a piñata, the campaign is a moveable feast of missteps: spending money at the wrong time; putting on biographical ads too late; letting the Obama camp define Romney before he defined himself; staging a disastrous foreign trip; fumbling the convention; and somehow neglecting to tell the candidate that there is no longer any such thing as off the record, if there ever was.
Some Republican strategists, watching it slip away, privately complain that Stevens is a poseur and political atheist who is so busy being a dilettante that he forgets the need to actually have faith.
Was the Hollywood dabbler so swept up in the idea of Clint Eastwood's benediction that he didn't vet the 82-year-old actor's script, or wonder about that empty chair?
He doesn't realize that having Romney stand for nothing and everything is not as good as having Romney say: Follow me, we're going to go over here.
''If you don't believe your guy can lead you to a better place,'' said one G.O.P. strategist, ''it's hard to get anybody else to believe it.''
Romney said he liked to fire people. But his downfall may be that he does not.

HEADLINE: In Round 3 for the Fed, A Challenge for Investors

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
''DON'T fight the Fed,'' the saying goes. In the current circumstances, with the Federal Reserve using monetary policy to try to spur economic growth, the adage implies that investors should go with the flow by betting on stocks.
Yet it's not entirely clear which stocks they should bet on. 
When the Fed started its first round of so-called quantitative easing in late 2008, the move -- wherein the central bank bought up Treasury bonds and other assets to keep interest rates low and promote growth -- eventually led to a period of rising stock prices. And the most economically sensitive groups, like technology shares, were the market's best performers.
In the second round of this strategy, known as QE2, the broad market rose much less, and ''the information technology sector did the worst,'' observed John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist for Oppenheimer Asset Management.
This time around, days after Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, announced yet another round of bond-buying, market strategists and money managers say it's important to look to history as well as to Mr. Bernanke's intent to determine which areas of the market stand to benefit.
For starters, the central bankers assured investors that they would maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy ''for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.'' In fact, Fed officials said short-term interest rates would remain at extremely low levels through at least mid-2015.
In such an income-starved environment, this means that dividend-paying stocks -- many of which yield more than 10-year Treasury notes -- should do particularly well, market watchers say.
But not just any dividend-paying stock. Because the Fed is making a concerted effort to bolster employment and growth, Mr. Stoltzfus argues that economically cyclical dividend payers stand to benefit the most. This group includes the technology sector, which used to distribute few dividends but has recently become the second-largest source of such income, in dollar terms, among all sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Chris J. Retzler, co-manager of the Needham Growth fund, said the Fed ''is trying to push investors into higher-risk assets.'' As a result, investors should also look at technology companies within the small-company universe, which is generally regarded as a riskier bet than blue chips but offers potentially greater long-term rewards.
Since investors began to anticipate QE3 last month, small-company stocks in general have outpaced the S.& P. 500 index. And small-cap tech stocks have posted market-leading total returns of 11 percent, versus 9.3 percent for tech shares in the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Retzler said that low interest rates could help increase consumer spending, and that one company that could benefit is MaxLinear, whose equipment helps transmit broadband video to cable boxes and mobile phones, he said.
Another higher-risk area that investors shouldn't overlook is the financial sector, Mr. Retzler said, especially because it is directly affected by the Fed's efforts to keep interest rates low and drive asset prices higher.
He favors investment management companies, which generate fees based on the value of total assets under management. One of the top holdings in his fund is Financial Engines, an advisory firm that uses technology to offer portfolio management and advice to 401(k) investors.
''When the markets are doing well, companies like this tend to do well, too,'' he said.
Ron Muhlenkamp, manager of the Muhlenkamp Fund, said investors should also consider some direct investments in banks. He noted that commercial and industrial loan demand was rising. What's more, as troubled European banks continue to repair their balance sheets, American banks like JPMorgan Chase could start to pick up some global market share.
He also likes regional banks, direct beneficiaries of the improving housing market. Since the start of this month, financial stocks have led the S.& P. 500, posting gains of 5 percent. Yet regional bank shares have done even better, returning nearly 7 percent.
WHERE else could investors look? In each of the first two rounds of quantitative easing, the dollar weakened in value against a basket of foreign currencies. That makes sense, because the Fed is artificially lowering the interest that investors can earn by parking their money in dollar-denominated securities.
True to form, the dollar has lost around 6 percent of its value from summer highs. Yet because crude oil is priced in dollars, the weakening currency has played a part in the recent jump in oil prices. ''Elevated oil prices should bode well for the energy sector,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Finally, the Fed's ultimate goal may be to reinflate the economy, said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for Harris Private Bank. One way to profit from inflation down the road is to bet on housing-related assets, like real estate investment trusts. Another, he said, is to invest in companies that can maintain pricing power no matter what happens to costs. This group, he said, includes health care companies, as well as consumer staples companies that make products like soap and toothpaste that households need, regardless of price.

HEADLINE: An Evangelical Back From Exile, Lifting Romney

BYLINE: By JO BECKER

 BODY:
DULUTH, Ga. -- Ralph Reed is clearly relishing his revival.
Just six years ago, the man who turned the Christian Coalition into such a powerful political force that he was called ''God's right-hand man'' was all but written off, tarnished by his ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, then trounced in his campaign to become Georgia's lieutenant governor.
But after several years in political purgatory, Mr. Reed has found his way back.
At the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., he was sought after by party luminaries and afforded the ultimate status accommodation, a room in the same hotel as Mitt Romney. And soon he plans to unleash a sophisticated, microtargeted get-out-the-evangelical-vote operation that he believes could nudge open a margin of victory if Mr. Romney can keep the race close. 
The other day, sitting in an office lined with framed photographs from back in the heyday -- here with President George W. Bush at a White House Christmas party, there with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican -- the preternaturally youthful evangelical operative, 51, propped his black ostrich cowboy boots on a coffee table and made what he admits seems an audacious prediction: that record numbers of socially conservative evangelical Protestants will turn out for the first presidential election in history without a Protestant on the Republican ticket.
''God,'' he said with a laugh, ''has a sense of humor.''
That may be, but Mr. Reed has a plan. And he has the money to back it up: an estimated $10 million to $12 million from contributors across the Republican spectrum, according to a partial list of donors and people with direct knowledge of his operation.
Three years ago, Mr. Reed formed the Faith and Freedom Coalition and began assembling what he calls the largest-ever database of reliably conservative religious voters. In the coming weeks, he says, each of those 17.1 million registered voters in 15 key states will receive three phone calls and at least three pieces of mail. Seven million of them will get e-mail and text messages. Two million will be visited by one of more than 5,000 volunteers. Over 25 million voter guides will be distributed in 117,000 churches.
White evangelicals are a crucial voting constituency, 26 percent of the 2008 electorate and overwhelmingly Republican in recent presidential cycles, exit polls show. With so few truly undecided voters left, bumping up evangelical turnout in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio would almost certainly help Mr. Romney.
But the success of Mr. Reed's turnout-stimulus campaign will hinge on a variety of factors, not least whether those voters so dislike some of President Obama's policies that they can overcome their mistrust of Mr. Romney's Mormon faith and reversals on issues like abortion. And in an election dominated by jobs and the economy, it remains an open question whether culture-war hot buttons, like the president's support for same-sex marriage, will be as potent as in the past.
In 2004, Mr. Reed was an architect of an evangelical turnout apparatus that is credited with helping Mr. Bush win re-election. Then came the Abramoff influence-peddling scandal. Though Mr. Reed was not charged, the work his consulting firm did for Mr. Abramoff's Indian gambling clients by opposing plans for rivals' casinos sullied his reputation among Christian conservatives, many of whom oppose gambling. Mr. Reed acknowledges that he used bad judgment.
Clint Austin, a Christian lobbyist who used to work with Mr. Reed, said, ''Money and power always find a way to get in the same room, and it's sometimes hard to resist the allure of that. I want to say this with humility because I'm not his judge, but there were so many causes for concern, and a lot of us felt like he needed to step back and get himself refocused.
''And I think that's what he's now done.''
Mr. Reed began by aligning himself with Mr. Romney during the primary campaign against Senator John McCain, the eventual Republican nominee in 2008, said Mr. Reed's friend Deal W. Hudson, president of the Pennsylvania Catholics Network. Mr. Reed distributed a film, ''Amendment 6,'' that linked the idea of religious tolerance to evangelicals' acceptance of Mormonism.
''That movie was a great example of how Ralph works,'' said Matt Towery, a Georgia political analyst. ''I don't mean this pejoratively, but he is an opportunist. He finds himself an opportunity and he hits it, and he hits it hard.''
With much of the work once done by party committees and campaigns now outsourced to ''super PACs'' and other outside groups, Mr. Reed saw another opportunity. In 2008, the Obama campaign won the turnout wars with technology and microtargeting data made available by the growth in online shopping.
The Faith and Freedom Coalition, formed in 2009, is Mr. Reed's attempt to do the same on the right.
To identify religious voters most likely to vote Republican, the group used 171 data points.
It acquired megachurch membership lists. It mined public records for holders of hunting or boating licenses, and warranty surveys for people who answered yes to the question ''Do you read the Bible?'' It determined who had downloaded conservative-themed books, like ''Going Rogue'' by Sarah Palin, onto their e-readers, and whether those people also drove pickup trucks. It drilled down further, looking for married voters with children, preferably owners of homes worth more than $100,000.
Finally, names that overlapped at least a dozen or so data points were overlaid with voting records to yield a database with the addresses and, in many cases, e-mail addresses and cellphone numbers of the more than 17 million faith-centric registered voters -- not just evangelical Protestants but also Mass-attending Catholics. The group is also reaching out to nearly two million more people who have never registered to vote.
One measure of the coalition's potential influence is its contributors, who represent a broader Republican constituency than simply the religious right. The group is not required to disclose its donors, but a partial list was obtained by The New York Times.
For example, one donor, Bernard Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, supports abortion rights but wants smaller government. On the other hand, the mutual fund manager Foster Friess is a patron of religious conservative causes and was a leading donor to a super PAC that supported Rick Santorum. Another donor is John M. Templeton Jr., who runs a foundation devoted to pursuing ''new insights at the boundary between theology and science.''
In addition to its presidential election turnout campaign, the group plans to focus on two state ballot measures: a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in Minnesota and an effort to recall an Iowa Supreme Court justice who voted to legalize same-sex marriage in the state.
Mr. Reed and his allies agree that social issues alone will not turn the election.
Same-sex marriage, for instance, ''doesn't raise the temperature of the bulk of the Catholic Mass-going voters,'' said Mr. Hudson, adding that while it was still a concern, ''attitudes about homosexuals have changed so much over the last several years.''
So the group plans to pair its social message with a broader economic one. The president's health care overhaul will be depicted as both big government spending and an assault on religious liberty; the law mandates that employees of organizations affiliated with religions, like hospitals, universities and charities, be able to obtain free contraception through their health care plans.
In addition, Mr. Obama's testy relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, an important issue for many evangelicals, will be highlighted, said Gary Marx, the Faith and Freedom Coalition's executive director.
Some Republican operatives doubt Mr. Reed will be able to mobilize a new evangelical army.
Still, one early test was the coalition's work in the 2009 Virginia governor's race, where exit polls showed that evangelicals' share of the electorate had jumped to 34 percent from 28 percent in 2008.
''Ralph's organization played an incredibly important role,'' said Phil Cox, the campaign manager for the Republican winner, Bob McDonnell. ''He speaks the language.''

HEADLINE: With Aid Cutoff, Kremlin Recalibrates

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Andrew Roth, Anna Kordunsky and Ellen Barry contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- It began as an urgent effort to stave off political chaos, build basic institutions, and even prevent starvation in the anxiety-ridden aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union.
Over the next 20 years, through the United States Agency for International Development, American taxpayers would come to spend nearly $3 billion on programs touching nearly every facet of society in the former Communist state -- fighting the spread of tuberculosis and H.I.V., developing judicial systems and training lawyers and judges, promoting child welfare, job readiness, youth engagement, human rights and democracy, even helping modernize the electric grid.
The decision by the Kremlin this month to terminate all the agency's programs here, amid a swirl of ominous accusations of meddling in Russia's internal affairs, has stunned aid workers, infuriated American diplomats and left many nonprofit groups on the brink of collapse. 
It also marks the end of an extraordinary collaboration between the two former cold war enemies, one that was unimpeded, at least initially, by the suspicion that often shadows foreign aid, in part because such programs have historically in many places provided cover for intelligence activities.
''In the fall of 1991 and early in 1992, the door for Western engagement and influence in remaking the Russian economy and polity was wide open,'' Michael A. McFaul, the American ambassador, and his co-author, James M. Goldgeier, wrote in ''Power and Purpose,'' a 2003 history of American policy after the cold war. ''Issues of sovereignty that often emerge as major sources of tension between donors and recipients in other countries were simply not an issue.''
They are now.
With President Vladimir V. Putin facing the biggest political challenges since his rise to power 12 years ago, including an ongoing series of big street demonstrations in Moscow, the Kremlin has been moving aggressively to clamp down on dissent.
When Mr. Putin last winter accused Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of sending ''a signal'' to opposition groups in Russia to take to the streets, many American officials dismissed it as election-year rhetoric, aimed at propping up his campaign for president. But the move to cancel long-established foreign aid programs, including many with no connection to politics, suggests that the fear of external influence is a deeper concern, and that an effort by Mr. Putin to recalibrate his relationship with the United States is under way.
The Kremlin's ire seems largely directed at two groups: Golos, the country's only independent election monitoring organization, which helped expose fraud that favored the governing party in parliamentary elections last December; and Transparency International, an anticorruption group, which for a while seemed to have a good working relationship with former President Dmitri A. Medvedev.
Russian officials insist that the United States should not have been surprised by their decision. ''We have long warned the U.S. side that we are not satisfied with some aspects of U.S.A.I.D., in particular political aspects,'' said Aleksei Pushkov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament. Aleksandr Lukashevich, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said there were ''serious questions'' about the agency's work in Russia, including ''attempts to influence the political process through the distribution of grants.''
Aid programs sometimes have ulterior motives. In their book, Mr. McFaul and Mr. Goldgeier described how American officials in the 1990s directed food aid to some areas in Russia that had been off-limits in Soviet times to get a look at those places.
Still, leaders of the nonprofit groups active in the political arena reject the allegations that they are puppets of the West, and say their efforts are driven by a desire to fix problems in Russia.
''It's hysterics and a nervous reaction from the government,'' said Grigory A. Melkonyants, the deputy director of Golos. ''It's useful for the government to blame the daily problems in Russia that we all see on NGOs.''
Critics of the cancellation of aid programs say the Russian government's anger is misdirected. ''It is difficult to say what result is expected in the Kremlin from the closure of Russian U.S.A.I.D. programs,'' Maria Eismont wrote in a column in the daily newspaper Vedmosti. ''The protest movement is not going anywhere because people are not put on the streets by the State Department but by election fraud, the degradation of law enforcement and the judicial system, lack of a coherent social and migration policy, the collapse of health and education services and total disregard for citizens demonstrated by officials.''
Shutting down the international development agency in Russia may deal little more than a short-term setback, at least for the groups that have become political foes of the Kremlin; many of them have other sources of financing. Some groups, including Golos, already receive American aid through channels other than the agency, including the National Endowment for Democracy, a private group that receives financing from Congress.
American officials have said they are working to find ways around Russia's decision, including the possibility of endowing a private foundation set up within Russia under Russian law.
But many nonprofit programs stand to be devastated. Dmitry Goliaev, the director of the Russian Health Care Foundation, which employs 30 people in its fight against tuberculosis and H.I.V., said the group would be forced to stop work. ''I am not going to assess every sector of U.S.A.I.D.'s work,'' he said, ''but I am convinced that its work in the health care sector responds to an acute need for Russia.''
Paige Alexander, the assistant administrator for Europe and Eurasia at the development agency, said the Kremlin's decision would only hurt its own citizens. ''We have always been doing this from the American people to the Russian people,'' she said. ''And that's who is losing out.''

HEADLINE: Where Is That Class Divide?

BYLINE: By JULIET LAPIDOS

 BODY:
Among the many fallacies in Mitt Romney's now-infamous "47 percent" speech is that "people who pay no income tax" will "vote for the president no matter what." More than one-fifth of non-filers are elderly, a constituency likely to favor Mr. Romney. 
But even assuming Mr. Romney only had non-elderly, low-income voters in mind, it's misleading to suggest that the country splits evenly into income-based voting blocs, with the poor and the working-class automatically favoring Democrats, and vice versa.
This is, or ought to be, obvious. Lots of ink has been spilled examining why working-class Americans are willing to vote against their economic interests.
Gallup reported yesterday that "while income is correlated with voter support, it is by no means a total determinant of vote choice." Voters with annual household income below $24,000 prefer Mr. Obama, 58 to 34; and voters with annual household income above $180,000 prefer Mr. Romney, 52 to 43. But that's as stark as it gets. The $60,000 to $90,000 group breaks for Mr. Romney, 49 to 46, while the next step up, $90,000 to $120,000, breaks for Mr. Obama by the same margin, 49 to 46.
A June Pew survey found that Americans are more divided along partisan lines than at any point in the last 25 years, but observed "neither growing class differences in fundamental political values, nor increasing class resentment." Class identification is not synonymous with party identification.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In New York, Reverence for Myanmar's Opposition Leader

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
Just after midnight on Saturday, a crowd began descending on a narrow stretch of sidewalk at Queens College. The people came from all over New York and from as far away as Miami and North Carolina, but originally, they and their families were from Myanmar. They stood in line overnight to see the leader of that country's opposition, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who came to New York on Saturday as part of her first visit to the United States in some 40 years.
''As soon as I heard she was coming, I decided I had to be here,'' said Aung Kaung Myat, 25, a Burmese man living in Buffalo. ''I got on line at 1 a.m.'' 
Now a member of the Myanmar Parliament, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 67, spent 15 years under house arrest and has long been an international symbol of personal sacrifice and the struggle for human rights. She languished in Myanmar, formerly Burma, as her two children grew up in a faraway country, largely without her. She remained there as her husband, Michael Aris, became ill with prostate cancer and died in 1999. She watched as a military dictatorship ruled the country that her father, Gen. Aung San, helped guide toward independence from British rule before his assassination in 1947, when she was a child.
And yet, during Saturday's events, not a hint of bitterness was on display in Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's manner as she was lauded by New York politicians, was questioned by students and spoke to Burmese immigrants as if to a room full of old friends.
''Dissidents can't be dissidents forever; we are dissidents because we don't want to be dissidents,'' she said in response to a question from a Queens College student about participating in Myanmar's government after so many years as its most prominent opponent. ''I don't believe in professional dissidents,'' she continued. ''I think it's just a phase, like adolescence.''
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's release, her visit and her participation in Parliament are all steps the government of Myanmar, now under President U Thein Sein, a former general, has taken away from its authoritarian past. In Washington earlier this week, she urged the easing of American sanctions against Myanmar, saying that they had played their political role. But she made clear on Saturday that much work remained.
''While we are started on the path,'' Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said in Queens, ''we are not yet anywhere near our goal of a truly democratic society.''
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's Saturday schedule also included a discussion at Columbia University moderated by the journalist Ann Curry. There, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's spoke of how Myanmar's economic troubles pushed the country toward openness, and how she made the most of her time under house arrest with a strict daily schedule of meditation, reading, listening to the radio and exercising.
''I'm not going to give them the satisfaction of knowing that I've become less disciplined, and that I've dissipated those years under detention,'' she said. ''I think I was the healthiest prisoner of conscience in the world.''
In Queens, she was praised by Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat, and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn. And she was serenaded by Carole King, a Queens College alumna, with a customized version of one of her best-known songs. (''Daw Suu Kyi, you've got a friend!'' Ms. King cooed.) Ms. King asked the crowd to sing along at one point, lending the day the feel of a graduation ceremony, or perhaps a day at summer camp.
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a slight woman in an emerald green outfit, red flowers in her hair, spoke comfortably to the crowds and frequently drew laughs, whether from the Burmese community, which she addressed in its native language -- a rapt group of nearly 2,000 pitched forward in their seats -- or to English speakers at other events.
''I lived in Manhattan for more than three years, and I loved this city at a time when people thought it terrible,'' she said of a period that began in the late '60s.
Yet she also spoke about the role of discipline and duty in her own life; of Myanmar's young people, put at a disadvantage by a crumbling education system; and of the country's movement toward a more open government.
At one point, someone asked her about Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, an Army intelligence analyst accused of passing archives of classified documents to WikiLeaks. Microphone in hand, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said that one must balance rights with responsibilities, and that she had been dismayed to learn that some of the leaks revealed information about dissidents, and that might put them in danger.
From the past hardships and present challenges, she projected optimism about the future: ''We were a country of hope in our part of the world, and we want to become that kind of country again,'' she said. ''A country that proves that there can be such things as happy endings.
''And when that happy ending arrives,'' she continued, ''I hope I will be able to welcome all of you into Burma.''

HEADLINE: The Man Who Would Be Redstone

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
FROM up in the carob trees come the strains of great movie themes: the sad hum of ''Love Story,'' the creepy lull of ''Rosemary's Baby,'' the jazzy screech of ''Chinatown.'' Below, just outside the grand entrance of the building where Adolph Zukor and Cecil B. DeMille once did business, Sumner M. Redstone's retinue sips Champagne in the hot afternoon sun.
Roughly 100 have gathered on this June day on the Hollywood lot of Paramount Pictures to celebrate the studio's centennial. And what a century it's been -- a run stretching from silent greats like ''Wings'' and Billy Wilder noirs like ''Sunset Boulevard'' all the way to ''Forrest Gump'' and ''Braveheart.''
Employees, friends, movie-industry luminaries: all have come to pay homage. Mr. Redstone's daughter, Shari, is here, too. At times, her public feuds with her father, one of the most powerful media moguls of the age, seemed straight out of a movie -- one titled, say, ''Daddy Dearest.'' Absent is Mr. Redstone's son, Brent, who fell out with his father several years ago, contending that he was being cut out of the family business. 
Mr. Redstone, lord of the Viacom empire, enters slowly. He is 89, and on this day so heavy with Hollywood history, it is remarkable to think that when he was born Sumner Rothstein to a modest family in Boston, the first feature talkie, ''The Jazz Singer,'' hadn't been made. He wears a dark suit and flashy tie and looks frail but bursting with accomplishment.
At his side is Philippe P. Dauman, 58, his figurative heir and the dauphin of Viacom -- ''the son Sumner wishes he had,'' as one executive close to the company puts it. This is the man who would be Redstone.
It is an emotional moment for two men not known for displays of emotion, at least not the warm, teary kind. Two decades ago, in an epic struggle for control of Paramount, Mr. Redstone and Mr. Dauman beat back A-listers like Barry Diller and John C. Malone and walked away with their prize.
Mr. Dauman tells the crowd that Mr. Redstone ''transformed my life.'' He goes on: ''We shed a lot of blood, sweat and tears in a very long process.''
Then, he echoes a toast Mr. Redstone gave when the $9.75 billion takeover of Paramount was sealed: ''Here's to us who won.''
By all accounts, Mr. Dauman has won. A polished and slender man who wears Hermès cuff links and looks formal even at his most casual, he has never attracted the adulation or the attention given to some of the company's past creative minds, people like Tom Freston and Judy McGrath, both formerly of MTV. And Mr. Dauman has often been obscured by Mr. Redstone's long shadow. Yet Mr. Dauman's rewards have been extraordinary. In 2010, he was paid $84.5 million in cash and stock, making him the nation's highest-paid corporate executive. Last year, he received $43 million.
Today, working from a 52nd-floor corner office high above Times Square, he sits at the center of one of the world's most powerful media companies, with holdings like the cable channels MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and VH1.
Yet some industry executives call Mr. Dauman ''the last man standing'' -- the one who managed to stay in his master's good graces even as Mr. Redstone drove out executive after executive. Mr. Redstone is famous for his outbursts involving top executives and stars -- including a public falling-out with Tom Cruise in 2006. Through it all, Mr. Dauman has not only survived but prospered -- and, as C.E.O., has improved Mr. Redstone's beloved company.
Viacom's earnings per share have more than doubled since Mr. Dauman became chief in 2006. But now Mr. Dauman, a lawyer and deal maker not known for his creative acumen, faces his biggest test. He must steer a slimmer, reorganized Viacom, which has been depleted of some of the creative talent of its early days and, according to some analysts, has been too reliant on the same old hits.
Ratings and revenue have lagged at Nickelodeon, Viacom's most lucrative cable channel. That led to a 7 percent drop in domestic advertising revenue and a 14 percent decline in overall revenue at the company, to $3.2 billion in the quarter ended June 30. It falls on Mr. Dauman to oversee Viacom as it tries to bring viewers back to Nickelodeon and to find new shows to replace aging franchises like ''Dora the Explorer'' and ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' on Nickelodeon and ''South Park'' on Comedy Central. Last month, MTV said the coming sixth season of ''Jersey Shore'' would be its last.
Of even greater interest is his relationship with Mr. Redstone. Indeed, the question of who will inherit the House of Redstone is foremost on many insiders' minds. Mr. Dauman is an executor of his will and, while it's not often discussed, he is named in that will as Mr. Redstone's successor. Unless Mr. Redstone changes his mind, that means Mr. Dauman could one day oversee an empire that includes Viacom, the CBS Corporation and National Amusements, the movie theater operator and holding company for the Redstone family's shares in Viacom and CBS.
''I can't say what will happen after I'm gone -- which will be never,'' Mr. Redstone said in a phone interview. ''But everyone understands, I think, that Philippe will be my successor.''
Carl Folta, a longtime Redstone family spokesman, later said that ''whoever becomes chairman of both public companies would ultimately, as Mr. Redstone has said many times, be decided by the boards of those companies.''On this sunny June day at Paramount, the Redstone family is all smiles. Then, as Mr. Dauman helps his mentor into a leather chair in the shade, the music from the speakers in the carob trees changes again, raising some eyebrows.
It is the theme from ''The Godfather.''
SHORTLY after Mr. Dauman became C.E.O., he declared that one of the core values of Viacom was ''civility.'' That proclamation didn't sit well with some at the company, which had brought to the world, among other treasures, ''Beavis and Butthead.''
While Viacom has always been seen as Mr. Redstone's, it was built in part on the creative risks of homegrown programmers like Mr. Freston and Ms. McGrath at MTV and Brown Johnson at Nickelodeon. In a creative environment, ''you need a little bit of anarchy flying around,'' one former Viacom executive says. (Like many executives interviewed for this article, this person requested anonymity because of the company's strict nondisclosure agreements.) A Viacom spokesman says Mr. Dauman was referring to a civil work environment, and not the creative process.
The creative brass had to deal with a chief executive who, like Mr. Redstone, Viacom's executive chairman, had a legal background, rather than an executive like Mr. Freston, who rose through the programming ranks.
Cyma Zarghami, president of the Nickelodeon Group, says Mr. Dauman is ''not interested in hearing pitches'' and does not see ideas for shows until they're greenlighted.
But the adjustment has been bumpy at times. In an early meeting with Comedy Central, Mr. Dauman asked why the channel needed both ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' and ''The Colbert Report,'' according to a person briefed on the meeting.
Mr. Dauman declines to comment on specifics but says he generally likes to play devil's advocate. ''I like to have fulsome discussions on every topic,'' he says. ''What happens if you lose this show? What would you do? We have to look at every hypothesis.''
Doug Herzog, president of the Viacom Entertainment Group, which oversees Comedy Central, Spike TV and TV Land, says they've spoken only hypothetically about what would happen if Mr. Colbert or Mr. Stewart decided to depart. ''The truth is we want them both, always.'' Mr. Herzog says. ''Outside Philippe, they're two of the most important guys in the building.''
Whatever the case, creative types haven't always accepted Mr. Dauman as one of their own. In 2007, he said at an investor conference that a distribution deal between Paramount and Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio was ''completely immaterial'' to Viacom's financial success. The comment prompted furor in the industry and drew terse rebukes from Mr. Spielberg's partners, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, who interpreted it as Mr. Dauman saying Mr. Spielberg was immaterial. Paramount's distribution deal with DreamWorks Animation expires later this year. (''I like Jeffrey, but we can do it on our own,'' Mr. Redstone says.)
Still, such gaffes are rare for Mr. Dauman, who is so articulate and cautious that even off-the-cuff conversations seem to flow in the fully formed lingua franca of corporate America. While other chief executives at major media companies demand quotation approval when skittishly speaking to journalists, Mr. Dauman can talk for hours, never missing a beat or losing his cool.
Mr. Redstone has always focused on Viacom's share price, and even creative types in the company say Mr. Dauman should, too. Viacom's stock regularly outperforms that of peers like the News Corporation and Time Warner.
''It's not Philippe's job to have great talent relationships,'' said Brad Grey, the chairman and chief executive of Paramount Pictures and a former talent agent. ''His job is to build the business, and he has. Just look at the stock price.''
That price has risen about 60 percent since September 2006, driven by stock buybacks and Mr. Dauman's push into new areas like digital syndication deals with streaming services like Netflix and his aggressive plan to spread Viacom's offerings globally. ''Geordie Shore,'' the ''Jersey Shore'' of Britain, is a top-rated cable series there. Colors, a Hindi-language entertainment channel, is one of India's top-rated pay-TV channels.
PHILIPPE DAUMAN first encountered Mr. Redstone in 1986, as a young lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in New York. Mr. Redstone was a Boston-based investor in Viacom -- then pronounced VEE-ah-com -- and needed legal help with securities filings. Mr. Dauman ran contracts to his Carlyle Hotel suite. Before long, Mr. Redstone said he wanted to work only with him.
What Mr. Redstone recognized was perhaps a younger version of himself -- a brilliant lawyer who appeared to want to win at all costs. Mr. Redstone took to calling him every morning at 5.
People love to tell the story about how, in his less powerful years, Philippe Dauman (pronounced du-MAWN) went by Phil Dauman (pronounced DOW-man). Critics chuckle that he is faux French.
In reality, his French background is as bona fide as Mr. Redstone's working-class roots. That is, it is both authentic and fundamental to who he is. His first language was French, and he is on the board of Lafarge, the French construction materials giant.
Born to immigrant parents in New York, Philippe Pierre Dauman attended Lycée Français, an academy on the Upper East Side. His father, Henri, was a Life magazine photographer who took photos of Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Kennedy and Brigitte Bardot.
Philippe skipped first and second grades -- a move that, like Mr. Redstone's experience in a tough boyhood neighborhood, made him adept at standing up to bullies.
''I go to third grade and I'm scared to death,'' Mr. Dauman recalls. ''I'm just 6 years old and the kids are so much bigger than me.''
At 13, he scored a 1,600, then a perfect score, on his SATs. He entered Yale at 16, a foot smaller than everyone else. (That's when he started to go by ''Phil,'' since a foreign-sounding name just made it harder to fit in.) He graduated in 1974, the same year as Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the Time Warner C.E.O. But Mr. Bewkes, with his Connecticut charm, ran with the A-list at Yale, whereas Mr. Dauman didn't quite fit in.
After Mr. Dauman graduated from Columbia Law School, he and his wife, Debbie, lived in Paris for a couple of years before they had their sons, Philippe and Alexandre. Philippe Dauman Jr. works in strategy at Google, which is now defending itself against a $1 billion lawsuit from Viacom that contends YouTube used unauthorized clips of ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report.''
''It's the one job on the planet we know he didn't get because of pull,'' the elder Mr. Dauman jokes.
After Mr. Redstone gained control of Viacom in 1987 in a hostile takeover, he rewarded Mr. Dauman with a seat on the board. In 1993, Mr. Dauman, then a partner, quit Shearman & Sterling and became Viacom's general counsel.
Then came other corporate battles, including Mr. Redstone's fight for Paramount and, in 2000, his $39 billion acquisition of CBS. Other acquisitions, like that of Blockbuster in 1994, didn't fare as well.
''He's always motivated himself by fighting the fight,'' Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom's chief operating officer, says of Mr. Redstone. ''It's like 'Apocalypse Now.' He loves the smell of napalm in the morning.''
Mr. Redstone still talks as if he's at war. He praises Mr. Dauman for his handling of a carriage fee dispute with DirecTV in July. After the satellite provider pulled Viacom's channels, Mr. Dauman managed to negotiate a better, more lucrative deal for Viacom.
''I would not want to be at the other end of a debate with him,'' says Frederic V. Salerno, a Viacom director, of Mr. Dauman. ''He has staying power and can outlast mere human beings in sticking to the cogent points of his position.''
Though Mr. Redstone and Mr. Dauman tend to engender fear in opponents, it's hard not to get sentimental about their decades-long bromance. When asked about the other, each gushes with admiration and hyperbole typically reserved for familial relationships or personal publicists.
''I've called Philippe my mentor, and he says 'No, Sumner, you're my mentor,' '' Mr. Redstone says. Mr. Dauman is the first person Mr. Redstone thanked in his autobiography, ''A Passion to Win.''
''I would never think of overruling Philippe,'' Mr. Redstone says.
Mr. Dauman says: ''We pretty much hit it off right away. He's the smartest person I've ever met.''
Mr. Grey at Paramount says, ''It's almost a paternal relationship.''
And yet industry wisdom holds that Sumner Redstone eventually tires of his top managers. He pushed out the chief executives Mel Karmazin, Frank Biondi and Tom Freston.
''None of those were light decisions'' for Mr. Redstone, Mr. Dauman said. He declined to discuss his predecessors but added, ''It's not a popularity contest or whether someone is nice or is not nice in terms of being effective in running the company.''
Mr. Redstone even reluctantly ousted Mr. Dauman as deputy chairman in 1999 to make room for Mr. Karmazin after Viacom's merger with CBS. Mr. Dauman left with $150 million in severance and securities and started a private equity firm.
He stayed on the Viacom board and in frequent contact with Mr. Redstone. In 2006, Mr. Dauman returned to the company to replace Mr. Freston as C.E.O.
The closeness of Mr. Dauman and Mr. Redstone baffles some outsiders. Mr. Karmazin used to turn down Mr. Redstone's dinner invitations. But Philippe and Debbie Dauman often dine with Mr. Redstone at E. Baldi, a restaurant near Mr. Redstone's $14.5 million home in the Beverly Park gated community here.
Redstone lore floats around Viacom's executive offices like mythology associated with a J. J. Abrams Paramount film. At Beverly Hills restaurants, Mr. Redstone has been known to roll up a piece of bread and lob it at the waiter if his food doesn't arrive promptly, according to several dining companions. (But Mr. Dauman says he's a ''very, very generous tipper.'')
Mr. Dooley lets out a belly laugh over breakfast at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel when he recalls a business trip to Europe in the late 1990s. Going to a meeting, Mr. Redstone reached for his cellphone only to find he'd grabbed the TV remote control instead. Mr. Dooley and Mr. Dauman joked with him and told him to try to make a call.
''He went into a rage and threw the remote against the window,'' Mr. Dooley says. ''If you can laugh it off, he's quite hilarious to be around.''Then there was the time Mr. Redstone yelled at Mr. Dauman and Mr. Dooley so loudly that one of his teeth came loose and flew across the room. Mr. Dooley accidentally stepped on it, drawing even more spittle and rage, according to an executive briefed on the meeting.
Mr. Redstone says, ''I'm not a patient person, and neither is Philippe.''
In many ways, Mr. Dauman is the serene superego that keeps Mr. Redstone's unbridled id swimming. ''Philippe is the counterbalance, an intellectual foil, to Sumner,'' says Mr. Dooley.
IT was a famous ousting that cemented Mr. Dauman's place atop Viacom. It was widely reported at the time that Mr. Redstone dismissed Mr. Dauman's predecessor, Mr. Freston, after eight months on the job for losing an acquisition of Myspace to the News Corporation, run by the longtime Redstone rival Rupert Murdoch. In truth, it was more complicated.
Mr. Redstone says he felt as if the company needed a different direction. He and Mr. Freston had clashed on several decisions before the Myspace deal. ''It was a crying session for both of us when I said, 'Tom, look you've been great, but the board and I have decided Philippe would be the best man to lead the company,' '' Mr. Redstone says. Mr. Freston declined to comment.
On the day Mr. Freston left, several hundred employees rushed to the Viacom lobby to say goodbye. Mr. Freston's office décor of dark blinds, hemp chairs and a surround-sound system loaded with Jamaican music and jazz promptly made way for Mr. Dauman's sparse distingué furnishings of white, taupe and heavy wood.
Then, last year, Judy McGrath, the chairwoman and C.E.O. of MTV Networks and a popular personality in the industry, was squeezed out as Mr. Dauman prepared to revamp the division. The revamping was part of a larger effort to tighten control and slim operations. The newly formed unit, Viacom Media Networks, includes the company's cable channels, whose top executives report directly to him. Ms. McGrath was offered a corporate role but turned it down.
Mr. Dauman says the revamping was also meant to lessen Viacom's dependence on a single creative force. ''I want this company to not be dependent on any one individual or group of individuals but have a life of its own,'' he says.
A former Viacom executive says of Ms. McGrath, ''There's not a quantitative or administration bone in her body, but she was the mother hen in a creative sense.''
Mr. Dauman has a picture of himself with Ms. McGrath and Jon Bon Jovi framed in his office. ''She had a great career with us and helped move the company forward,'' he says. Ms. McGrath declined to comment.
The revamping cut costs and helped the company continue to increase investment in original programming even in lean economic years; Viacom has gone from 13,000 to 10,000 employees and from $2 billion to $3 billion spent on original programming since Mr. Dauman took over in 2006. But the revamping also solidified his control and cemented a company culture shift.
Mr. Dauman's biggest test yet as C.E.O. may be Nickelodeon, whose ratings improved slightly in August after a monthslong plunge.
The problems at Nickelodeon have put Viacom's new corporate structure and Mr. Dauman's leadership under a microscope. ''I've been doing this for 17 years and I'm not sure I've ever seen a major network so steady for so long and a leader in a genre for so long and then collapse so suddenly,'' says Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''If the ratings don't come back, I do think people are going to start to question Philippe's ability to execute and create.''
On a recent tour of Nickelodeon's animation studio in Burbank, Mr. Dauman watched animators put the final touches on an episode of the ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' remake that will start on Sept. 29 on Nickelodeon. Mr. Dauman echoed one of the turtles' morals as his own: ''See? Anger is destructive,'' he said.
But a couple months after that tour, Mr. Dauman replaced the studio's president, Brown Johnson, a 20-year Nickelodeon veteran.
Mr. Dauman says Nickelodeon's ratings decline is partly a result of changes at Nielsen and that he expects the situation to turn around. ''We're going to have about 50 percent more original programming than the same quarter last year and a lot of great new shows,'' he says, ''so I think you'll will see improvement in the very short term.''
BUT others say a lack of brand-defining programming at some Viacom channels is a result of a risk-averse culture.
''They're milking existing assets and carefully buying back shares so they won't disappoint Mr. Redstone and short-term investors,'' says Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
He pointed to MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central as relying on still-popular but aging franchises. Other brands like Spike have faltered in ratings, while BET has recently had ratings highs.
Paramount, meanwhile, has increased profitability by homing in on franchises like ''Transformers'' and the much-lower-budget ''Paranormal Activity.'' Coming movies include ''G.I. Joe,'' ''Star Trek'' and ''Top Gun'' sequels. Paramount releases no more than 15 movies a year, significantly less than some competitors.
The investor-focused approach keeps Wall Street bullish on Viacom but raises questions about whether creative executives feel comfortable throwing audacious ideas against the wall.
''You have people who are fearful of their jobs and their livelihood, and the chances of someone taking a chance in that scenario are very small,'' Mr. Juenger, the analyst, says. Or, as a media executive close to Viacom puts it: ''The sense over there is, 'I like the private plane and I don't want to get fired.' ''
Mr. Dauman says he has never ''capriciously'' fired anyone.
GIVEN Mr. Redstone's age, it's little wonder that his health is a source of speculation. The Wall Street Journal read the tea leaves when rumors circulated that Mr. Redstone would not attend Viacom's annual shareholder meeting in New York last March. He attended the meeting.
''I hope you're doing half as well at his age,'' Mr. Dauman joked to an editor from The Journal afterward.
Mr. Redstone is physically weak and often too strong-willed to acknowledge when he needs assistance. But in an interview, his mind and stubbornness were as sharp as ever. He often jokes that he will never die, saying he's prolonged his life by eating ''every antioxidant known to man'' and sunbathing two hours daily to soak up vitamin D.
Mr. Redstone says the terms of his family trust, which would divide his estate among his children, grandchildren and other trustees including Mr. Dauman, are confidential. But he adds that ''Philippe would play an enormous part in the way my estate is run.''
Although the boards of CBS and Viacom would ultimately vote on who assumed Mr. Redstone's role as chairman, Mr. Dauman's ascent means he someday might be senior to both the CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves, and Mr. Redstone's daughter, Shari, president of National Amusements and vice chairman of CBS and Viacom, who clashed with her father several years ago over corporate governance. (Mr. Redstone says his family is harmonious again.)
''It's a weird waiting game, and it's all anyone talks about,'' one prominent entertainment executive says of how things may eventually play out.
One Viacom executive predicts: ''There will be an epic battle, and Philippe will win.''
Mr. Dauman declines to discuss the subject. ''I don't think it will be dramatic, but to spend my time speculating is an exercise in futility,'' he says. ''I've been involved in estate planning but then you live your life. It's like you write your will and then you put it away and forget about it.''
He and Mr. Moonves have lunch occasionally, but by most accounts are not close. (In an e-mail, Mr. Moonves said: ''I like him. And I know that we're both rooting for each other's companies.'')
Mr. Dauman may not have the natural cool of Mr. Freston or Ms. McGrath, but he works hard to be approachable and personable with employees, and to spread his giddy enthusiasm for the stardust the job brings. At a recent town hall meeting outside Viacom's offices in Santa Monica, food trucks provided free In-N-Out burgers and fries. Mr. Dauman danced with employees in a flash mob to the tune of LMFAO's ''Party Rock Anthem.''
Still, the memory of the circumstances under which he landed the job lingers. At the MTV Movie Awards in June, Mr. Dauman, in bluejeans and a black blazer, strolled with Debbie, in a sequined dress and black boots, onto the red carpet, trailing Channing Tatum and Charlize Theron.
''Who's that?'' a photographer asked as a swarm of paparazzi snapped Mr. Dauman's picture. A fellow photographer responded: ''That's the guy who took over when Sumner fired Tom Freston.''

HEADLINE: The Big Myth Of Painful Choices

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
REFERRING to the host of painful economic choices the nation is said to confront, President Obama recently said, ''I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy.'' The Romney-Ryan ticket has also repeatedly stressed that it won't duck the tough issues.
Well and good, except for one thing: The nation doesn't actually face difficult economic choices. Many problems will be expensive to solve, yet we can solve them without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone. 
Disrupting the status quo won't appeal to many lobbyists and some ideologues. But bear with me. These remedies rest on solid evidence and common sense.
Let's begin with unemployment. Millions of Americans remain out of work only because employers can already produce more than enough to meet depressed demand. The obvious remedy is to increase total spending. Although economic stimulus has become a controversial topic in the abstract, a few simple observations should persuade every sensible legislator -- perhaps even a majority! -- to support a specific type of higher spending: accelerated refurbishment of our crumbling infrastructure.
Some in Congress have consistently opposed the president's infrastructure proposals, citing the huge national debt. But that's an incoherent objection. If repairs to the Capitol dome or a tattered stretch of interstate highway are postponed, they will just become more costly. Many job seekers have the skills for this work. If we wait, we'll have to bid them away from other tasks. The required materials are cheaper now than they will ever be. And interest rates are at record lows.
Of course, the debt is an important long-run problem, but deferring infrastructure repairs will only worsen it. Relative to current policy, then, such projects would address multiple pressing problems without distress.
Even after the economy is back at full employment, we can free additional resources by taking steps to curb the waste that plagues our current system. The ripest opportunities are in tax policy, an area distorted by decades of lobbying.
A tax on any activity generates revenue and discourages people from pursuing that activity. Perversely, much of our current revenue comes from taxing useful activities.The payroll tax, for example, discourages job creation, and the income tax discourages saving and investment. By shifting taxes toward activities having harmful side effects, we can raise substantial revenue while expanding the economic pie.
Consider highway congestion. Because drivers can generally enter a congested highway without charge, they often do so -- thus adding to the crowding. But many drivers would willingly pay a fee for using that road if it resulted in fewer delays. A modest congestion fee, administered with E-ZPass-style technology, would raise needed revenue and provide an incentive to use crowded roads only when the benefits outweigh the social costs.
Critics object that such fees would harm low-income households. But because the gains far exceed their price, we can redistribute them so that everyone comes out ahead. Some of the new revenue, for example, could support tax relief for low-income households.
So, here again, we can easily free resources for solving an important problem.
Similar spillover effects pervade the economy. People have little incentive to consider the danger of carbon emissions, for example, or the risks that the heavy vehicles they drive are posing to others. Taxing carbon emissions and taxing vehicles by weight would expand the economic pie by curtailing activities that do more harm than good. And because some of the resulting revenue could help low-income families, these taxes, too, needn't be painful.
BY far our largest source of economic waste, however, is the changing context of our spending. The average American wedding, for instance, now costs almost $28,000, up from just $15,000 in 1990, after adjusting for inflation. But spending on a more lavish wedding doesn't make a couple happier; mainly, it just raises the bar that defines special occasions.
The bad news, then, is that much of our extra consumption in recent decades has been social wheel-spinning. But the good news is that it would be relatively simple to redirect such spending toward more pressing purposes. As I described in an earlier column, this could be accomplished by replacing the current income tax with a more steeply progressive consumption tax, making big-ticket spending much more expensive. It's a step that both liberals and conservatives have advocated.
None of these taxes should be levied, however, while the economy is still struggling. But approving them now and scheduling them for phase-in only after the economy rebounds would serve two objectives. First, anxious credit markets would be reassured about the nation's capacity to pay down government debt. And second, the delayed new taxes would speed the recovery by encouraging immediate increases in private spending.
With a carbon tax on the horizon, businesses would rush to develop technologies for adapting to higher energy prices. And consumers would accelerate major purchases to escape the looming consumption tax. The economy would get just the infusion of spending it needs -- without the government's having to spend a penny.
The endless hand-wringing about painful economic choices is misguided. With a few simple policy changes, we could restore full employment, rebuild crumbling infrastructure and pay down the national debt without requiring real sacrifices from anyone.

HEADLINE: I Was a Welfare Mother

BYLINE: By LARKIN WARREN. 
A writer who was the co-author of Carissa Phelps's ''Runaway Girl: Escaping Life on the Streets, One Helping Hand at a Time,'' and is at work on her own memoir.

 BODY:
Bethel, Conn.
I WAS a welfare mother, ''dependent upon government,'' as Mitt Romney so bluntly put it in a video that has gone viral. ''My job is not to worry about those people,'' he said. ''I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.'' But for me, applying for government benefits was exactly that -- a way of taking responsibility for myself and my son during a difficult time in our lives. Those resources kept us going for four years. Anyone waiting for me to apologize shouldn't hold his breath.
Almost 40 years ago, working two jobs, with an ex-husband who was doing little to help, I came home late one night to my parents' house, where I was living at the time. My mother was sitting at the card table, furiously filling out forms. It was my application for readmission to college, and she'd done nearly everything. She said she'd write the essay, too, if I wouldn't. You have to get back on track, she told me. I sat down with her and began writing. 
And so, eight years after I'd flunked out, gotten pregnant, eloped, had a child, divorced and then fumbled my first few do-overs of jobs and relationships, I was readmitted to the University of New Hampshire as a full-time undergraduate. I received a Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, a work-study grant and the first in a series of college loans. I found an apartment -- subsidized, Section 8 -- about two miles from campus. Within days, I met other single-mom students. We'd each arrived there by a different route, some falling out of the middle class, others fighting to get up into it, but we shared the same goal: to make a better future.
By the end of the first semester, I knew that my savings and work-study earnings wouldn't be enough. My parents could help a little, but at that point they had big life problems of their own. If I dropped to a part-time schedule, I'd lose my work-study job and grants; if I dropped out, I'd be back to zero, with student-loan debt. That's when a friend suggested food stamps and A.F.D.C. -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Me, a welfare mother? I'd been earning paychecks since the seventh grade. My parents were Great Depression children, both ex-Marines. They'd always taught self-reliance. And I had grown up hearing that anyone ''on the dole'' was scum. But my friend pointed out I was below the poverty line and sliding. I had a small child. Tuition was due.
So I went to my dad. He listened, did the calculations with me, and finally said: ''I never used the G.I. Bill. I wish I had. Go ahead, do this.'' My mother had already voted. ''Do not quit. Do. Not.''
My initial allotment (which edged up slightly over the next three years) was a little more than $250 a month. Rent was around $150. We qualified for $75 in food stamps, which couldn't be used for toilet paper, bathroom cleanser, Band-Aids, tampons, soap, shampoo, aspirin, toothpaste or, of course, the phone bill, or gas, insurance or snow tires for the car.
At the end of the day, my son and I came home to my homework, his homework, leftover spaghetti, generic food in dusty white boxes. The mac-and-cheese in particular looked like nuclear waste and tasted like feet. ''Let's have scrambled eggs again!'' chirped my game kid. We always ran out of food and supplies before we ran out of month. There were nights I was so blind from books and deadlines and worry that I put my head on my desk and wept while my boy slept his boy dreams. I hoped he didn't hear me, but of course he did.
The college-loan folks knew about the work-study grants, the welfare office knew about the college loans, and each application form was a sworn form, my signature attesting to the truth of the numbers. Still, I constantly worried that I'd lose our benefits. More than once, the state sent ''inspectors'' -- a knock at the door, someone insisting he had a right to inspect the premises. One inspector, fixating on my closet, fingered a navy blue Brooks Brothers blazer that I wore to work. ''I'd be interested to know how you can afford this,'' she said.
It was from a yard sale. ''Take your hands off my clothing,'' I said. My benefits were promptly suspended pending status clarification. I had to borrow from friends for food and rent, not to mention toilet paper.
That's not to say we didn't have angels: work-study supervisors, academic advisers and a social worker assigned to ''nontraditional'' students, which, in addition to women like me, increasingly included military veterans and older people coming in to retrofit their careers. Faculty members were used to panicked students whose kids had the flu during finals. Every semester, I had at least one incomplete course, with petitions for extensions. One literature professor, seeing my desperation, gave me a copy of ''The Awakening'' by Kate Chopin to read and critique for extra credit. ''But it's not a primer,'' he cautioned. (Spoiler: she walks into the ocean and dies.)
With help, I graduated. That day, over the heads of the crowd, my 11-year-old's voice rang out like an All Clear: ''Yay, Mom!'' Two weeks later, I was off welfare and in an administrative job in the English department. Part of my work included advising other nontraditional students, guiding them through the same maze I'd just completed, one course, one semester, at a time.
In the years since, the programs that helped me have changed. In the '80s, the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant became the Pell Grant (which Paul D. Ryan's budget would cut). In the '90s, A.F.D.C. was replaced by block grants to the states, a program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. States can and do divert that money for other programs, and to plug holes in the state budget. And a single mother applying for aid today would face time limits and eligibility requirements that I did not. Thanks to budget cuts, she would also have a smaller base of the invaluable human resources -- social workers, faculty members, university facilities -- that were so important to me.
Since then, I've remarried, co-written books, worked as a magazine editor and finally paid off my college loans. My husband and I have paid big taxes and raised a hard-working son who pays a chunk of change as well. We pay for sidewalks, streetlights, sanitation trucks, the military (we have three nephews in uniform, two deployed), police and fire departments, open emergency rooms, teachers, bus drivers, museums, libraries and campuses where people's lives are saved, enriched and raised up every day. My country gave me the chance to rebuild my life -- paying my tax tab is the only thing it's asked of me in return.
I was not an exception in that little Section 8 neighborhood. Among those welfare moms were future teachers, nurses, scientists, business owners, health and safety advocates. We never believed we were ''victims'' or felt ''entitled''; if anything, we felt determined. Wouldn't any decent person throw a rope to a drowning person? Wouldn't any drowning person take it?
Judge-and-punish-the-poor is not a demonstration of American values. It is, simply, mean. My parents saved me and then -- on the dole, in the classroom or crying deep in the night, in love with a little boy who needed everything I could give him -- I learned to save myself. I do not apologize. I was not ashamed then; I am not ashamed now. I was, and will always be, profoundly grateful.

HEADLINE: TBR: Inside the List

BYLINE: By GREGORY COWLES

 BODY:
HEAD FOR THE BORDER: The new king of the hardcover nonfiction list is, no surprise, Mark Owen -- or, as he's known to his friends (and the rest of America by now), Matt Bissonnette. A former member of the Navy SEALs, Bissonnette is the author of ''No Easy Day,'' which enters the list at No. 1 and describes, among other things, his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The book (written with Kevin Maurer) has received admiring reviews -- in the daily New York Times, Janet Maslin called it ''an exciting, suspenseful account'' -- but it has also stirred anger among special operations forces, who adhere proudly to a code of silence. Breaking it means Bissonnette is unlikely to be included in future SEAL reunions, one retired Navy officer told The Washington Times: ''The guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back.'' But Bissonnette hasn't let the critics keep him down. He sat for a recent ''60 Minutes'' interview (heavily disguised, inset) and told Scott Pelley the first thing he did upon returning from the mission was visit a Taco Bell drive-through. 
''You were part of the team that killed Osama bin Laden,'' Pelley said, ''and the first thing you do when you get back to the United States is go to Taco Bell?''
''Two tacos and a bean burrito,'' Bissonnette replied. ''It's routine.''
NOT NEUTRAL: Zadie Smith's fourth novel, ''NW,'' hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. Smith isn't a fast writer; it's been seven years since the release of her previous novel, ''On Beauty'' (also a best seller), and in 2009 she declared, ''I don't write unless I really feel I need to.'' So expectations for ''NW'' were running high. But reviews so far have been mixed. On NPR's ''Fresh Air,'' Maureen Corrigan compared the story to ''a stalk of late-summer corn that's blighted at its very tip . . . four-fifths ripe, golden deliciousness, one-fifth barren cob.'' In Bookforum, meanwhile, the Book Review's own Parul Sehgal liked it better: ''Smith's fiction has never been this deadly, direct or economical,'' she said, calling ''NW'' a ''subtle investigation into the intersections of race and class.'' How subtle? Smith told NPR she intentionally avoided race labels for all her characters but the white ones. ''I grew up reading a generation of American and English people like Bellow, Updike or Amis,'' she said. ''Everybody's just neutral unless they're black, then you hear about it: the black man, the black woman, the black person. And, of course, if you happen to be black, the world doesn't look that way. . . . I just wanted to try and create, perhaps, a sense of alienation and otherness in this person, the white reader, to remind them that they are not neutral to other people.''
THE MISTER: ''Publishers print nothing but sex novels now,'' Guy Patin reputedly complained -- in 1657. One wonders what he'd make of the trade paperback list, where E. L. James's ''Fifty Shades'' books still hog the top three spots. We know what E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard, makes of it anyway: Life goes on. ''Commentators can conjure ridiculous royalty figures out of the air,'' Leonard wrote in The Guardian recently, ''and imply that our afternoons are spent in an infinity pool with trained dolphins bringing us goblets of chilled Bolly, but in real life the dog has to be walked and the kids have to be fed.'' Leonard's own novel, ''Crusher,'' has just been released, and he acknowledges that his ties to James help draw interest. ''But, like most novelists, I'm hardly going to refuse publicity,'' he wrote. ''I'm not a masochist. And that's all I'm going to say about our sex life.''

 BODY:
THE SIBLING EFFECT: What the Bonds Among Brothers and Sisters Reveal About Us, by Jeffrey Kluger. (Riverhead, $16.) Kluger, a science writer and senior editor at Time magazine, weaves his own experiences of growing up in a contentious, at times dysfunctional family into a fascinating analysis of scientific research on birth order, twins, blended families and parental divorce.
TRIPLE CROSSING, by Sebastian Rotella. (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Rotella, who has covered Latin America as a journalist, begins this thriller in the borderlands of San Diego and Tijuana before sending the good guys from both sides of the fence to combat drug smugglers and terrorists in the lawless ''triple border'' of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. 
THE LAST CRUSADE: The Epic Voyages of Vasco da Gama, by Nigel Cliff. (Harper Perennial, $17.99.) Originally published as ''Holy War: How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-old Clash of Civilizations,'' this sprawling history of the Age of Discovery reconstructs the Portuguese explorer's expeditions to chart a new route to India, as well as his complex motives: in addition to breaking Muslim maritime dominance, da Gama hoped to find Christians in India and enlist them in an alliance against Islam. Cliff ''brings 16th-century Portugal in all its splendor and squalor pungently to life,'' Eric Ormsby wrote in the Book Review.
A PARTIAL HISTORY OF LOST CAUSES, by Jennifer duBois. (Dial, $16.) Everyone seems to be pushing up against impossible odds in duBois's first novel, which follows the briefly intersecting lives of two intriguing strangers: a Russian chess champion who embarks on a dissident presidential campaign against Vladimir Putin, and a troubled American woman quixotically searching for an answer to a question posed by her dead father.
THE ESCAPE ARTISTS: How Obama's Team Fumbled the Recovery, by Noam Scheiber. (Simon & Schuster, $16.) Scheiber stresses policy over personal drama in this sober account of President Obama's economic team, the 2009 stimulus plan and what he sees as the administration's repeated failures to grapple forcefully with the economy and unemployment.
THE BARBARIAN NURSERIES, by Héctor Tobar. (Picador, $16.) Tobar's big, insightful novel about social and ethnic conflict in contemporary Southern California concerns a mixed-race couple and their Mexican maid, a former art student named Araceli. When a misunderstanding leaves the couple's children in Araceli's care for days, she takes them to central Los Angeles in search of their estranged grandfather. A media frenzy ensues as this earnest quest becomes a colossal misadventure.
THE TABLE COMES FIRST: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food, by Adam Gopnik. (Vintage, $15.95.) An exuberant tour of the morals and manners of our food mania, this book combines essays and profiles with ruminations on everything from how the West Indies sugar plantation gave rise to the pastry chef to the historical interplay of the cafe and the restaurant.
BED, by David Whitehouse. (Scribner, $16.) ''If this is life, then why get out of bed?'' That's what the shy, nameless narrator of Whitehouse's discomfiting first novel concludes as he tries to understand his 1,400-pound brother, Malcolm Ede -- who took to bed on his 25th birthday and remained there for decades.

HEADLINE: Nate Silver Solves the Swing-State Puzzle!

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
When I first considered Barack Obama's re-election chances in this magazine, last November, he was about a 50-50 contender against the Republican field. As I noted then, this was an unusual spot for a sitting president. A year before their own re-election races, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes were all favored. One year out, it seemed as if things could break either way for the president in 2012.
Six weeks before the election, the picture is much clearer. While Obama's postconvention bounce gave him a lead of four to five points over Mitt Romney, most of the polls before the conventions had the vote split by two or three percentage points. If Obama's bounce fades and the two-to-three-point trend holds till Nov. 6, it's conceivable that either candidate could pull a George W. Bush and win the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote. This puts the emphasis on what I call ''tipping point'' states. Obama and Romney can hope for good jobs numbers or terrible ones, and for calm in the Middle East or an eruption that hurts the administration. But one thing they can definitely control is how to allocate their resources for the best chance at 270 electoral votes. 
Using my FiveThirtyEight model, I've determined -- through about 25,000 simulations that I run each day -- which states could put either candidate over the top. Crucially, the model takes into account not only how states poll relative to national trends but also to one another. Demographically similar states can rise and fall together. If Romney makes gains in Wisconsin, for example, he will probably also do so in neighboring Minnesota.
Perhaps more important, the program evaluates the order in which the states might line up. Obama could win North Carolina, where the polls show a competitive race, but he's unlikely to do so without already having won Ohio, Florida and Virginia, where the demographics are slightly more favorable to him. Some combination of those states would probably get him to 270 electoral votes anyway. By that point, North Carolina would be redundant.
Which states, then, are the most strategically important? The answer exists along a spectrum rather than in absolutes. Ten states could play an important role in the electoral calculus. I have listed them below, in four groups, along with the chance that each state will be the one that determines the next president.
The Big Two: Ohio (32 percent chance of determining the Electoral College winner) and Florida (20 percent).
This year, Obama's polling has been stronger than many observers (myself included) expected in each state, both of which typically lean slightly Republican. In Ohio, which Obama won by 5 points in 2008, the president has held the lead in 16 polls conducted since June (Romney led in only 4). In Florida, which Obama won by 3 points in the last election, the numbers have been more even but still slightly favor the president (14 leads for Obama, 9 for Romney).
The reasons behind Obama's strong polling performance differ in each state. The auto industry's recovery has helped drop Ohio's unemployment rate from 8.6 percent when he took office to 7.2 percent now, making it one state where voters really are better off than they were four years ago. While studies show that national economic conditions figure more heavily into voters' decisions, a state's economic climate can matter in cases like this.
Florida's economic recovery has not been as robust, but Obama may be buoyed by long-term demographic factors there. Florida has one of the nation's largest Hispanic populations, a bloc that in most states swings Democratic. The G.O.P. has long been buffered by Cuban-Americans, a historically right-leaning group, who made up a majority of the state's Hispanic electorate. Now not only are non-Cuban Hispanics growing in the electorate, but the Cuban population is increasingly divided along generational lines, with younger voters leaning heavily left. If Democrats get 60 percent or more of the Hispanic vote in Florida, this year could mark a significant turning point.
The New Breed: Virginia (9 percent), Colorado (9 percent) and Nevada (5 percent).
In these states, which Obama carried in 2008 but Kerry and Gore lost, swift demographic changes have become manifest. Obama won Nevada -- which now resembles a West Coast state to some degree -- by an unexpectedly large margin, 12 percentage points, in 2008. And despite a wretched economy there, he has led in every state poll conducted this year.
The polling has been more inconsistent in Colorado and Virginia. If demographic changes favor the president in Colorado, the state's anti-incumbent spirit -- it voted for Bill Clinton as the challenger in 1992 but not as the incumbent in 1996 -- does not. (George W. Bush, however, did win Colorado in 2004.)
Virginia's economy is pretty good, but the state has also been a headache for pollsters. Surveys since July have shown everything from an eight-point Obama lead to a five-point advantage for Romney. In the end, Obama might simply conclude that Florida or Ohio -- and not Colorado and Virginia -- represents his path of least resistance. If the president can win either Florida's 29 electoral votes, or Ohio's 18 plus Nevada's 6, then Romney's shot at 270 will become vanishingly thin, and it won't matter how Virginia and Colorado turn out.
Primary Purple: Iowa (6 percent) and New Hampshire (3 percent).
The voters in Iowa and New Hampshire are almost entirely white and mostly rural -- factors that ordinarily favor Republicans. But they are also highly educated, which gives Democrats a chance. Though they don't pack a lot of electoral muscle (Iowa holds just six electoral votes and New Hampshire just four), it's worth remembering that if Al Gore had won New Hampshire in 2000, he wouldn't have even needed Florida.
Obama's polling has been fairly robust in New Hampshire, a state in which Romney may have hurt himself by disavowing the moderate positions that he took as governor of Massachusetts. The few polls conducted in Iowa show a tossup.
The Blue Wall: Wisconsin (9 percent), Pennsylvania (5 percent), and Michigan (1 percent).
Judging by where the campaigns are allocating their money and time, both are concentrating on slightly Republican-leaning states (Florida) or true bellwethers (Iowa). It's clear that Romney is playing defense while Obama is on offense -- a notion reinforced by the fact that Romney and company have taken an on-again, off-again approach toward slightly Democratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
In Michigan, Romney's opposition to the auto bailout may be too much of an albatross. In Pennsylvania, though, the issue may be that while the polls are close, they are also hard to move; each party has its respective constituencies, and there may be few true undecided voters left. Obama's lead in Pennsylvania has often been narrow, but he has nevertheless led by some margin in the state's last 22 polls.
My calculations suggest that, despite Romney's deficit, the upside of his winning Pennsylvania is so great that he might want to take a chance. It's Obama's closest equivalent to a must-win state, and the combination of losing Pennsylvania and Ohio would essentially ensure his defeat. Unfortunately for Romney, it may be too late to adopt that strategy, as Obama has come close to clinching a majority of the state's electorate in recent surveys.
Wisconsin, however, is the state that Romney must contest. The initial excitement over the Republican victory in the gubernatorial recall election seemed, in the view of the polls, unfounded. (The same polls that indicated support for Scott Walker also suggested that a majority of voters want four more years of Obama.) Local polls have narrowed since Romney named Paul Ryan as his running mate, but they still have Obama ahead by around a percentage point. If Romney can't overtake him in Wisconsin, considering his problems in Ohio and Florida, he'll leave Obama with too many paths to 270, and himself with too few.
If you don't follow the polls every day, just follow the money. For example, as of Sept. 6, according to National Journal, the campaigns and outside groups spent a combined $330 million on advertising in states carried by George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. In states that were carried by Democrats in those elections, like Michigan, they've spent one-tenth as much. This implies that Obama will get a better result than his party did in those years. On the other hand, the lack of appreciable expenditures in Arizona, Missouri or Georgia, which John McCain carried in 2008, indicates that Obama is not actively trying to expand his map, either.
The most plausible range of outcomes runs from Obama losing the election by about two percentage points, slightly better than John Kerry did, to his winning it by perhaps six or seven, slightly worse than his margin from four years ago. Given where the election is being contested, however, the most likely outcome is that Obama wins enough tipping-point states to eke out a victory.

HEADLINE: Aspiring U.S. Diplomats Stiffen Their Resolve After Ambassador's Death

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: What are aspiring U.S. diplomats saying about the murder of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans? The attack might have reasonably led many of them to rethink their career paths. But graduate students now in the Foreign Service pipeline seem to have strengthened their plans to seek diplomatic postings abroad. 

 BODY:
The recent killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, along with three other Americans at the mission in Benghazi, now appears to have been a premeditated assault, not merely collateral damage from yet another anti-American protest. The deadly ambush reinforced the idea that many diplomats - even those guarded by security personnel and working in fortified buildings - can quickly find themselves in harm's way. 
Diplomats, lawmakers and political analysts were quick to express their outrage at the killings, and thousands of everyday Libyans took to the streets of Benghazi to denounce the city's violent and heavily armed militias.
Rendezvous was interested in the thoughts and reactions of future American diplomats, those graduate students now in the Foreign Service pipeline who are preparing for postings at embassies in Cairo, Beijing, Moscow, Tel Aviv. Or, perhaps, a posting to a rebuilt American consulate in Benghazi. 
Are the killings in Benghazi and angry anti-American demonstrations across the Muslim world causing would-be U.S. diplomats to reconsider their career trajectories? Had they ever weighed the dangers of being an American diplomat abroad? Would they now seek safer assignments at home, within the State Department? 
We selected responses (which have been slightly edited and condensed for space) from three likely members of the next generation of U.S. diplomats - an Iraqi who emigrated to the United States after having served as an interpreter for the U.S. military; a recently returned Peace Corps volunteer; and a nuclear engineer, temporarily based in Tokyo, who is a doctoral candidate in international relations. All three are on Foreign Service tracks at their universities.
 Adam Fivenson, 27, from Traverse City, Michigan, is pursuing a master's degree at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He graduated from the University of Michigan, later lived in New Delhi where he sold London-based real estate investments, and most recently served as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic.
The murder of American diplomats in Libya has given me reason to pause and consider the associated risks. Even so, my plans haven't changed.
What impressed me about the Foreign Service officers I met in Delhi was that they were out in the world looking for a challenge. They were representing 300 million Americans before 1 billion Indians, promoting better democracy and human rights, negotiating trade and security treaties, and much, much more. 
Ambassador Stevens was working to improve governance in Libya's young democracy, a hot-button issue in the Middle East, North Africa and around the world. It's my plan to focus on the same issue in my career. Marches through the streets of Benghazi showing support for the ambassador and lamenting his death have been heartening, but they're a mere gust in a tornado of rage that has swept much of the Muslim world this past week. 
The whole episode should force us to stop and ask what this is really all about. While some defend the right to free speech, others defend the honor of the Prophet Muhammad. It's a fundamentally different set of values at work on both ends, and balancing those values is no easy task for policymakers. It's just the sort of challenge I hope to address as a member of the Foreign Service. The reward will be well worth the risk. 
 Fearing reprisals against his family back home, the former interpreter for American forces in Iraq requested that his name and school not be used. Enrolled in graduate study at a leading American university, he is in a program that leads to a posting with the U.S. Foreign Service. He is also seeking U.S. citizenship. 
"We need more doers than thinkers" - I often recall this statement, made by a U.S. Foreign Service officer who has been my mentor, as I proceed along the path to becoming a U.S. diplomat. He impressed upon me that those who work hard to reach others on behalf of America are the ones that make a difference.
I believe that growing anti-American sentiments in the Middle East can be traced, among other factors, to the inability to understand the immense differences that separate these cultures when they come into contact. Muslims will always misinterpret the outcome of failed interaction as "Western blasphemy against Islam." 
Another factor would be the conservative religious establishment, which has become disgruntled to see young mainstream Muslims drifting toward a liberal ideology. The establishment uses its religious pulpit to discredit social moderates and incite violence against Western ideals and those who advocate them. The reality is that this violent speech drives many of their followers away, a fact that will be seen in the long term.
The attacks that targeted innocent diplomats in Benghazi were set up by extremists with pre-established goals. I'm ashamed because honoring your guest is a fundamental Islamic tradition, a cultural norm that they violated. In doing so, they actually defamed the religion. 
Diplomats who work in high-risk posts have to balance personal safety with a difficult mission. The attacks have made me more determined to join the U.S. Foreign Service, and I hope that my unique background will help me to prevent this type of violence in the future.
* James Platte, from Ada, Michigan, has lived in India and South Korea. He is currently based in Tokyo while doing research on Japanese energy policy as a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. He has an M.S. degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Michigan and an M.A. in science, technology and public policy from the Elliott School of International Affairs at The George Washington University. He is a Ph.D. candidate in international relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts. He plans to enter the Foreign Service next year as an economic officer.
The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, spurred in me a greater interest in U.S. foreign policy and helped set me down my current path. Eleven years and one day later, what I heard on the morning of Sept. 12, 2012, made me feel more certain that this is the path that I must take. 
I had never heard of Christopher Stevens before Sept. 12, but what I read and heard about Ambassador Stevens in the following days made me think that he was the type of diplomat that I aspire to be. Enthusiastic to serve the United States and embrace the local community. Intelligent and engaging. Brave and loyal. Diplomacy cannot be conducted exclusively behind sealed doors, and Ambassador Stevens knew that. 
I also did not think of Foreign Service as a dangerous profession before Sept. 12, and I still do not. It is a profession that may require temporarily sacrificing some of the comforts of home and working long hours, but anything worthwhile requires some sacrifice and hard work. 
It would be a mistake for the U.S. government to limit Foreign Service officers by keeping them locked up in fortified compounds. Even in the face of adversity and tragedy, Foreign Service officers make a lasting impact when they work in the field.

HEADLINE: Nebraska G.O.P. Draws a Tougher Map for Obama

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: After President Obama carried Nebraska's Second District in 2008, Republicans redrew the district lines to make it even more Republican-leaning in 2012. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of the peculiarities that drive the politics in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Here is a look at Nebraska, the Cornhusker State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with John R. Hibbing, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and Paul Landow, a professor of political science at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
The most impressive victory of President Obama's 2008 campaign may have also been the most minute: he won a single electoral vote by a single percentage point in Nebraska's Second Congressional District. (Nebraska is one of two states, along with Maine, that awards electoral votes by Congressional district.)
Nebraska's Second District was the reddest electoral vote Mr. Obama carried in 2008. It falls to the right of traditionally Republican states like North Carolina and Virginia on FiveThirtyEight's Presidential Voting Index and was the farthest Mr. Obama was able to penetrate into G.O.P. territory.
But after the election, Nebraska Republicans responded with a fairly simple strategy. They moved the Second District even farther behind the battlements, redrawing the district lines after the 2010 Census to make it more Republican and "avoid what they considered to be the debacle of losing the seat to Obama in 2008," Mr. Landow said.
The Second District's new boundaries make it more likely that all five of Nebraska's electoral votes will go to Mitt Romney this year. As a whole, Nebraska is among the most conservative states. In the last half-century, only Utah has favored G.O.P. presidential candidates by consistently wider margins. 
Nebraska is rural, mostly white and fiscally and socially conservative. It is similar both geographically and ideologically to its southern neighbor, Kansas. Western Nebraska, the Third Congressional District, is almost uniformly Republican. It is sparsely populated, with vast empty expanses broken by the occasional ranch or rail yard.
The eastern fifth of Nebraska, the First and Second districts, are more developed. More consistent rainfall allows for better farming. But the region is still lightly populated and heavily Republican. In presidential elections, Democrats are competitive in just a few areas: Lancaster County, which includes the state capital, Lincoln, and the main campus of the University of Nebraska; Thurston County, which is majority Native American but has only several thousand residents; and the Second District, anchored by Omaha.
Before the latest round of redistricting, the Second District included Omaha's Douglas County and the eastern half of Sarpy County. The western half of Sarpy was part of the First District.
The geography is important. Both Douglas and Sarpy counties are more Democratic-leaning in the east, Mr. Landow said, transitioning from urban and suburban to exurban and rural as you travel from east to west. So when Nebraska Republicans redrew the district lines, they flipped Sarpy County around, moving the western half into the Second District and the eastern half into the First District. The First District is more Republican than the Second District, so it could safely absorb some Democratic voters.
"A lot of working-class Democrats in eastern Sarpy County were taken out of the Second District," Mr. Landow said.
 (To see how the districts changed, go to Govtrack.us, which has a useful map where you can toggle back and forth between the old and new boundaries. See here). 
Omaha's Democratic constituencies are substantial but not overwhelming. Douglas County is 12 percent black and 12 percent Hispanic. One of the main industries in the area is food processing, including meatpacking, which employs blue-collar, Democratic-leaning voters, Mr. Landow said.
But Omaha is also home to white-collar, more Republican-leaning industries; the city is a regional center for financial services, insurance and banking. And overall, the Second District was Republican-leaning in 2008, and is even more so in 2012.
"It's the closest thing we have to a competitive region of the state," Mr. Hibbing said, "but I still wouldn't classify it as quite competitive because it is really hard for Democrats to do well there."
 The Bellwether: Dodge County 
Dodge County, to the northwest of Omaha, has come within a couple percentage points of the statewide vote in the last three presidential elections. It is mostly rural and mostly Republican, like Nebraska as a whole. But Dodge County also includes a decent-sized town, Fremont, which has a small but growing university, Mr. Hibbing said.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Romney is a 100 percent favorite to carry four of Nebraska's five electoral votes, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. He should win the two statewide votes as well as the votes awarded to the winner of the First and Third congressional districts.
Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage in the Cornhusker State for the foreseeable future. Like Kansas, Nebraska has been moving to the ideological right over the last two decades. In addition, the state's economy is in excellent shape, and its population is mostly stable, Mr. Hibbing said. 
The only demographic change with the potential to help Democrats is an influx of Latinos, who have moved to Nebraska for jobs in agriculture and food processing. In 1990, the state's Hispanic population was just 2 percent. Today, it is almost 10 percent. But, as in Kansas, the Latino population in Nebraska has yet to make an impact politically.
Mr. Obama is facing more headwinds in 2012 than he was in 2008 and would likely have had difficulty retaining Nebraska's Second District even if it had not been redrawn. He carried it by just 3,370 votes in 2008. 
In its new, more Republican-leaning shape, the Second District is an even tougher place for Mr. Obama to repeat his 2008 success. Mr. Romney is a 94 percent favorite there, according to the current forecast.

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With Pennsylvania?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: This was supposed to be a swing state, with the Republican presidential candidate threatening to win for the first time since 1988. It hasn't worked out that way. 

 BODY:
Allentown, Pa.
On June 30, 2011, an enthusiastic Mitt Romney arrived here in the heart of the Lehigh Valley determined to make Pennsylvania a presidential battleground state.
Standing before the closed Allentown Metal Works, Romney told reporters: "The president is a nice guy and I know he's trying, but he doesn't understand how the economy works" - a line that Romney later observed had resonated with focus groups.
A key assumption underpinned Romney's appearance in Allentown - that the working class whites who once dominated this great industrial center would back the Republican nominee.
Pennsylvania demographics suggested that the state was fair game for Republicans. Seniors are a key source of support for Romney, and the state has a higher percentage of voters over the age of 65, 15.6 percent, than the country as a whole (13.3 percent). Pennsylvania is substantially whiter, at 79.2 percent, than the rest of the nation (63.4 percent). And unemployment in Pennsylvania matches the national rate at 8.1 percent.
Both the Obama and Romney campaigns made significant investments in advertising in Pennsylvania. The pro-Romney super PAC, Restore Our Future, and two conservative PACs, Crossroads GPS and Americans For Prosperity, have together spent a total of $9.7 million; the Obama campaign and its allied super PAC, Priorities USA Action, have spent $8 million.
By the end of August, however, ad buying stopped. The Romney campaign effectively conceded the state.
In yielding Pennsylvania to President Obama, Romney has raised the stakes in Ohio and Florida, almost certainly making both states must win contests if he is to reach 270 Electoral College votes. Real Clear Politics has Obama ahead by a 1.9 point average in the eight most recent Florida polls and by an average of 4.1 percent in the seven most recent Ohio polls.
Romney's failure to gain traction in Pennsylvania sheds light on his struggles in other states with similar demographics, including Michigan and Ohio. The rapidly changing composition of the electorate here in Lehigh County, 60 miles north of Philadelphia - an area described by the Census as the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area - parallels similar shifts taking place in other regions of the country.
Lehigh Valley is a case study in the rapidly multiplying problems of the Republican Party, its successes in 2010 notwithstanding. From 1968 to 1988, Lehigh County was solidly Republican, voting for Richard Nixon over Hubert Humphrey 50-46 (with 4 percent for the segregationist George C. Wallace); for Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter, 53-36; and for George H. W. Bush over Michael Dukakis, 56-43.
In every presidential election since 1988, however, the Democratic nominee has carried Lehigh County, culminating in Obama's 2008 57-42 victory.
There are conservatives and Romney supporters here, but they are no longer plentiful and they are not optimistic about Romney's presidential chances.
When I met Kevin Balzer, a Romney supporter who is a Mack Truck supervisor, I asked him why his state looks likely to back Obama. "People are stupid," he said.
City and state officials, he went on, 
eliminated civics from our curriculum. The students don't know about civics, they don't know about our history, our government, our constitution. Politicians say they are going to give people things for free to get elected. That is what's happening in Pennsylvania, especially in Lehigh Valley.
Balzer added that "the white guys got pushed out" of Allentown and neighboring communities, in part by a wave of Hispanic immigration. Balzer, who joined the exodus to areas outside of Allentown, said he and others want to "get away from the whole erosion of the country."
From 1998 to 2011, the number of registered Republicans in Lehigh County fell from 75,099 to 73,857, while Democrats shot up from 78,002 to 107,594.
From 2000 to 2010, Lehigh County went from 83.2 percent non-Hispanic white to 70.7; from 3.6 percent African American to 7.7 percent; and, most significantly, from 10.2 percent Hispanic to 19.5 percent. In addition to the Latino immigrants, many relatively affluent whites have moved into the immediate area from New York, New Jersey and the Philadelphia suburbs, bringing with them Democratic voting habits.
Much of the Hispanic growth has been concentrated in Allentown, the county seat. From 2000 to 2010, the white population of Allentown fell, shrinking to 43.2 percent in 2010 from 64.4 percent a decade earlier. During the same period, the Hispanic population nearly doubled, growing from 24.4 percent in 2000 to 42.8 percent in 2010.
The political consequences of recent population trends have been dramatic.
William L. Heydt, a Republican, held the mayor's office in Allentown from 1990 to 2002, when he retired. He decided to run again in 2005. He only got 41 percent of the vote. Allentown voters, he told me, came to the polls "by the busload, pulled the D lever, and had no idea who they were voting for." Many, Heydt said, "were Hispanic, a lot African American."
Julio Guridy, a native of the Dominican Republic who is now chairman of the Allentown City Council, sees a growing, vibrant and, not least of all, Democratic city.
"We have seen an influx from New York and New Jersey, particularly after 9/11. This is a very good place to live," Guridy told me. "America is a wonderful place." He is one of two Latinos on the six-member city council, all of whom are Democrats, as is the mayor, Ed Pawlowski, the man who beat Heydt in 2005.
Even if there were a higher percentage of working class whites in the region, Romney would have faced an uphill struggle. A new survey of 2,501 adults, "Beyond Guns and God: Understanding the Complexities of the White Working Class in America," published on Sept. 20 by the Public Religion Research Institute, reveals clearly that the white working class (broadly defined) cannot, at present, be described as a secure Republican constituency.
The P.R.R.I. study focuses on a group it defines as non-Hispanic whites without a four-year college degrees who are paid by the hour or by the job. That's roughly one-third (36%) of all Americans. The study shows that Romney's nationwide 48-35 advantage among these voters masks crucial regional differences.
The reason Romney has a strong, 13-point edge among all white working class voters, according to the P.R.R.I. findings, is that in the South his margin is huge. In the rest of the country, the white working class is much more closely divided.
Among southern working class whites, Romney leads by 40 points, 62-22, an extraordinary gap.
The story in the rest of the country is different. In the West, where Colorado and Nevada are battleground states, Romney leads by a modest 5 points, 46-41. In the Northeast, which Obama is expected to sweep, except perhaps for New Hampshire, Romney holds a 4-point advantage among working class whites, 42-38. In the Midwest, where Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin are in play, Obama actually leads among working class whites by 8 points (44-36).
There is a noticeable lack of zeal for either Romney or Obama among these voters. Only 66 percent of white working-class Americans said they are certain to vote, compared to 87 percent of college-educated whites and 74 percent of African Americans.
Two Democratic operatives active in non-presidential campaigns in Pennsylvania argue that Romney just does not sell with working class whites. Doc Sweitzer, a political consultant whose clients include Kathleen Kane, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General, told me that cities and towns throughout the state "have all been hit by these corporate raider types" who buy and sell businesses in a manner similar to Romney's former firm, Bain Capital. "He just doesn't hunt here."
Steve Murphy, a media consultant working on congressional campaigns in Pennsylvania, characterized Romney's problem somewhat differently: "I don't think so much the argument is that he is anti-worker. It's just that they just don't like him. He seems like he is completely disconnected from people who have to work for a living."
I interviewed George Taylor, a purchasing agent for Mack Truck, which remains a manufacturing presence in the state, as he shopped at a Wal-Mart near Allentown. He said Romney lives in "la-la-land. He just cares about big business. He doesn't care about the small person. He just wants to give tax breaks to the rich and the heck with everybody else."
Romney's relatively poor showing among working class whites outside the South supports the argument that the Republican nominee is having a hard time connecting with some of the voters he needs to win. His problems reinforce the privately voiced fears of Republican operatives, as well as the openly voiced criticisms of the Romney campaign by primary opponents like Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum.
The hope harbored by Republican political professionals - that Obama was sufficiently unpopular among non-college whites to make up for Romney's shortcomings - has failed to take concrete form. The trouble Romney finds himself in today also suggests that the barrage of early advertising by the Obama campaign and allied groups attacking Bain Capital has proven to be a successful tactic, at least so far.
With the election six weeks away, poll after poll shows Pennsylvania in Obama's column. On Sept. 15, the Philadelphia Inquirer had Obama ahead by an 11-point margin, 50-39. On Sept. 18, the Muhlenberg College/Allentown Morning Call state poll showed Obama up by nine points, 50-41. On Sept. 21, Rasmussen Reports found that Obama led by 12 points, 51-39.
Christopher Borick, a political scientist who is the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, told me that the Romney campaign has clearly "made a calculation that Pennsylvania a might be a bit of fool's gold in terms of time and energy."
"On paper," Borick said, the state's relatively large number of white working class voters has made it an appealing target for the Romney campaign, but 
Romney has a lack of connection with those voters and the Obama campaign's attacks were fairly productive in driving a wedge between working class voters and Romney.
In 2008, when I traveled back and forth across Pennsylvania, Obama and McCain signs dotted lawns throughout the state, clearly signaling the political leanings of different neighborhoods in suburbs and small towns. Now Obama and Romney signs are few and far between.
"Pennsylvania is no longer one of the big battleground states," Borick said. "We had the big-three group of battleground states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. There are only two left. Pennsylvania is gone."
 Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

HEADLINE: America's Inevitable Retreat From the Middle East

BYLINE: By PANKAJ MISHRA. 
Pankaj Mishra is the author of ''From the Ruins of Empire: The Intellectuals Who Remade Asia.''

 BODY:
THE murder of four Americans in Libya and mob assaults on the United States' embassies across the Muslim world this month have reminded many of 1979, when radical Islamists seized the American mission in Tehran. There, too, extremists running wild after the fall of a pro-American tyrant had found a cheap way of empowering themselves.
But the obsession with radical Islam misses a more meaningful analogy for the current state of siege in the Middle East and Afghanistan: the helicopters hovering above the roof of the American Embassy in Saigon in 1975 as North Vietnamese tanks rolled into the city.
That hasty departure ended America's long and costly involvement in Indochina, which, like the Middle East today, the United States had inherited from defunct European empires. Of course, Southeast Asia had no natural resources to tempt the United States and no ally like Israel to defend. But it appeared to be at the front line of the worldwide battle against Communism, and American policy makers had unsuccessfully tried both proxy despots and military firepower to make the locals advance their strategic interests. 
The violent protests provoked by the film ''Innocence of Muslims'' will soon subside, and American embassies will return to normal business. But the symbolic import of the violence, which included a Taliban assault on one of the most highly secured American bases in Afghanistan, is unmistakable. The drama of waning American power is being re-enacted in the Middle East and South Asia after two futile wars and the collapse or weakening of pro-American regimes.
In Afghanistan, local soldiers and policemen have killed their Western trainers, and demonstrations have erupted there and in Pakistan against American drone strikes and reported desecrations of the Koran. Amazingly, this surge in historically rooted hatred and distrust of powerful Western invaders, meddlers and remote controllers has come yet again as a shock to many American policy makers and commentators, who have promptly retreated into a lazy ''they hate our freedoms'' narrative.
It is as though the United States, lulled by such ideological foils as Nazism and Communism into an exalted notion of its moral power and mission, missed the central event of the 20th century: the steady, and often violent, political awakening of peoples who had been exposed for decades to the sharp edges of Western power. This strange oversight explains why American policy makers kept missing their chances for peaceful post-imperial settlements in Asia.
As early as 1919, Ho Chi Minh, dressed in a morning suit and armed with quotations from the Declaration of Independence, had tried to petition President Woodrow Wilson for an end to French rule over Indochina. Ho did not get anywhere with Wilson. Indian, Egyptian, Iranian and Turkish nationalists hoping for the liberal internationalist president to promulgate a new ''morality'' in global affairs were similarly disappointed.
None of these anti-imperialists would have bothered if they had known that Wilson, a Southerner fond of jokes about ''darkies,'' believed in maintaining ''white civilization and its domination over the world.'' Franklin D. Roosevelt was only slightly more conciliatory when, in 1940, he proposed mollifying dispossessed Palestinian Arabs with a ''little baksheesh.''
Roosevelt changed his mind after meeting the Saudi leader Ibn Saud and learning of oil's importance to the postwar American economy. But the cold war, and America's obsession with the chimera of monolithic Communism, again obscured the unstoppable momentum of decolonization, which was fueled by an intense desire among humiliated peoples for equality and dignity in a world controlled by a small minority of white men.
Ho Chi Minh's post-World War II appeals for assistance to another American president -- Harry S. Truman -- again went unanswered; and Ho, who had worked with American intelligence agents during the war, was ostracized as a dangerous Communist. But many people in Asia saw that it was only a matter of time before the Vietnamese ended foreign domination of their country.
For the world had entered a new ''revolutionary age,'' as the American critic Irving Howe wrote in 1954, in which the intense longing for change among millions of politicized people in Asia was the dominant force. ''Whoever gains control of them,'' Howe warned, ''whether in legitimate or distorted forms, will triumph.'' This mass longing for political transformation was repressed longer by cold war despotism in the Arab world; it has now exploded, profoundly damaging America's ability to dictate events there.
Given its long history of complicity with dictators in the region, from the shah of Iran to Saddam Hussein and Hosni Mubarak, the United States faces a huge deficit of trust. The belief that this deep-seated suspicion can be overcome by a few soothing presidential speeches betrays only more condescending ignorance of the so-called Arab mind, which until recently was believed to be receptive only to brute force.
It is not just extremist Salafis who think Americans always have malevolent intentions: the Egyptian anti-Islamist demonstrators who pelted Hillary Rodham Clinton's motorcade in Alexandria with rotten eggs in July were convinced that America was making shady deals with the Muslim Brotherhood. And few people in the Muslim world have missed the Israeli prime minister's blatant manipulation of American politics for the sake of a pre-emptive assault on Iran.
There is little doubt that years of disorder lie ahead in the Middle East as different factions try to gain control. The murder of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Libya, the one American success story of the Arab Spring, is an early sign of the chaos to come; it also points to the unpredictable consequences likely to follow any Western intervention in Syria -- or Iran.
As in Southeast Asia in 1975, the limits of both American firepower and diplomacy have been exposed. Financial leverage, or baksheesh, can work only up to a point with leaders struggling to control the bewilderingly diverse and ferocious energies unleashed by the Arab Spring.
Although it's politically unpalatable to mention it during an election campaign, the case for a strategic American retreat from the Middle East and Afghanistan has rarely been more compelling. It's especially strong as growing energy independence reduces America's burden for policing the region, and its supposed ally, Israel, shows alarming signs of turning into a loose cannon.
All will not be lost if America scales back its politically volatile presence in the Muslim world. It could one day return, as it has with its former enemy, Vietnam, to a relationship of mutually assured dignity. (Although the recent military buildup in the Pacific -- part of the Obama administration's ''pivot to Asia'' -- hints at fresh overestimations of American power in that region.)
Republicans calling for President Obama to ''grow'' a ''big stick'' seem to think they live in the world of Teddy Roosevelt. Liberal internationalists arguing for even deeper American engagement with the Middle East inhabit a similar time warp; and both have an exaggerated idea of America's financial clout after the biggest economic crisis since the 1930s.
It is the world's newly ascendant nations and awakened peoples that will increasingly shape events in the post-Western era. America's retrenchment is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be as protracted and violent as Europe's mid-20th century retreat from a newly assertive Asia and Africa.

HEADLINE: A Festival Of Creativity

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM and DAVID F. GALLAGHER

 BODY:
It's easy to forget, sometimes, that behind all the screens, behind all the slide shows of funny animal photos and GIFs, the Internet is made of people.
These are people who are making things and figuring out new ways to turn their work on the Web into a business - and not necessarily by creating social advertising. Instead, they are coming up with ideas to develop, finance and market projects like films, albums, products and companies that might typically get rejected by movie studios, record labels and venture capitalists.
That was one of the main themes of a four-day conference in Portland, Ore., the XOXO Festival, that brought about 400 people together over the weekend to discuss the many ways that the Internet is helping to "creatively disrupt" traditional businesses and industries.
The weekend was infused with the vibe of creative makery. In addition to a weekend full of talks, the first floor of the arts center that hosted the conference was turned into an artsy fringe festival/marketplace. Attendees could browse custom smartphone cases, play with 3D printers, try indie games, peruse zines and visit a booth of popular Kickstarter projects. Food trucks serving local fare filled the street outside of the event, including a cart selling handmade ice cream. (A truck was there giving free screen printing lessons.) 
All of it was meant to emphasize a new economy that is being reshaped. It defies tradition and prizes creativity, seeks direct contact with customers and an audience, and formalizes that process and scales it, so that instead of asking your relatives to finance your next film, people can make use of the network effect and generate support, social and financial, from a large network of people online.
Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter, which was used to sell tickets for the conference, described in an interview a new economy, one "that is being created by the minute." But what does that new economy look like and how will it work?
Here are impressionistic insights and tidbits from some of the speakers who took the stage at XOXO.
Dan Provost and Tom Gerhardt of Studio Neat have created successful Kickstarter projects including the Glif photo accessory for the iPhone and the Cosmonaut stylus for the iPad. They promoted the benefits of staying local, by having hardware products made in the United States. "This is Joel," Mr. Gerhardt said, showing a photo of an engineer at the factory where Studio Neat products are made. "We have his cellphone number." Mr. Provost said that in their experience, "people love to know where things come from, how they're made and who is making them."
Jamie Wilkinson is one of the founders of VHX.tv, a video site that lets artists sell their work directly to fans, including the latest comedy special from Aziz Ansari. He used his talk to dispel myths that keep creative types and entrepreneurs from releasing professional content through the Web. "Establish a brand on the Web and use that to promote work," he said.
Mr. Wilkinson gave the example of "Indie Game: The Movie," a documentary about game makers, which was promoted and distributed both on iTunes and on VHX.tv. The film attracted the same amount of sales on both sites.
"Self-distribution works, and you can make enough to get by on," he said.
Christopher Poole, the founder of the notorious message board 4chan, and its more legitimate sibling, the venture-backed image-remixing site Canvas, talked about the perks of running a site that isn't necessarily financially viable. He said that 4chan, which gets tens of millions of page views, has been losing money for the last year. Despite that, he said, "I'd take that over a million dollars any day," because he is doing something that he loves.
Ron Carmel of the independent game studio 2D Boy, creator of the hit game World of Goo, said that he and his team initially thought they needed a publisher for the game, then started asking whether they should try to sell it themselves. They sold downloads on the Web and through the Nintendo Wii, then added versions for more platforms, including Apple's mobile devices. When asked how the game had done, Mr. Carmel said, "It's very successful. I'm not fully retired, but I don't need to work for the next 10 or 20 years." That brought a round of applause.
Many speakers talked about the challenges of being a smaller business and having rivals duplicate their efforts.
Bre Pettis, chief executive of MakerBot, which makes 3-D printers, talked about a project his company did with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that involved taking photos of artworks from many angles, then using them to create a digital 3-D blueprint and a printed replica. He said that he had been tempted to do this on the sly: "I was ready to steal it all, and they said, no, no, come on in!"
Mr. Pettis expressed frustration with companies that clone his product - though he acknowledged that MakerBot is in a difficult position because it tries to share as much information as it can about the workings of its printers. "Carbon-copy clones make spending money on product innovation challenging," he said. One company in China called Mbot, is "basically taking Makerbots and selling them for cheaper," he said, adding: "That is one of the things I have to think about - how to keep innovating while still sharing."
Patents are also a worry, because the company's products are competing with more elaborate devices from larger companies, so it has had to navigate around "a couple thousand patents," he said. "I kind of assumed when we started that the patent system would have failed by the time we got big enough to care about that," Mr. Pettis said to laughter from the crowd.
Dan Harmon, the creator of Community, a comedy series on NBC, set the tone of the event with a raucous keynote speech on Saturday night that urged attendees to seek out creativity above all else. In his experience, the entertainment industry was spoiled by the influx of money and metrics, rather than valuing the creation of quality content. He warned those in attendance of worrying too much about generating a profit. "Don't value the connection more than the things it's connected to," he said.
There were few complaints about the otherwise thoughtfully organized festival, which included parties and events at local companies. The Wi-Fi didn't go down once! As the conference wrapped up, Andy Baio and Andy McMillan, the organizers, gave a teary thanks to the audience, and suggested that the conference, a one-off experiment, would return in some form next year.
One lingering critique that pushed its way into conversation a few times over the course of the weekend, especially after a few pints of locally crafted beers, was one of access. Now that a new economy, a new playbook for making interesting content and projects, is beginning to form, how can we ensure that everyone, not just people with the know-how and social ties to help support it, benefit from it?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Ford Workers Approve Pact For Canada

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian autoworkers at Ford have voted to accept the contract that their union leadership negotiated last week, their union said Sunday.
The Canadian Auto Workers union said 82 percent of its Ford members had accepted the new four-year deal. The union did not indicate how many of its 4,500 workers at Ford cast ballots. 
The union leadership reached an agreement with General Motors last week. G.M. workers are set to vote on the tentative agreement on Wednesday and Thursday. Talks are continuing with Chrysler. The union wants Chrysler to match the deals reached with Ford and G.M.
The Ford and G.M. contracts cut wages for new hires and freeze pay for current workers. But they also give workers lump-sum payments to cover inflation and for ratifying the deals.
Under the deals, the companies will pay new workers 60 percent of the current top wage of $33.89 Canadian dollars ($34.74) an hour, according to the union. That would mean new workers would be paid around $20.33 Canadian dollars ($20.84). They can move up the wage scale and reach the top wage in 10 years.
Workers at the Detroit automakers in the United States approved a similar two-tier wage agreement five years ago, but under those agreements, workers do not automatically get the top wage after 10 years.
Ford said significant cost savings would be realized through the wage structure for new employees. Ford also said the deal would create more than 600 jobs in Canada over the contract's life.
The auto companies had said Canada was the most expensive place in the world to make cars and trucks, and indicated they could move production south if the union did not cut costs.
Canada's advantages in the past -- a weak Canadian dollar and government health care -- have all but vanished compared with the United States. In addition, the United Automobile Workers union in the United States has agreed to steeper concessions than the Canadian union, making United States labor costs cheaper.

HEADLINE: Simple Reply to Bankers' Demands

BYLINE: By HUGO DIXON | REUTERS

 BODY:
Shortly after the round of salary bonuses last year, I was having lunch with the boss of an investment firm. He told me of hearing that a handful of employees were grumbling about what, by most people's standards, were still extraordinary sums of money. He called them into his office and told them that since they were unhappy, they should ''just go.''
Most of them packed their things and left the firm. But the next day, one returned and said he had been misunderstood. My interlocutor said he had not misunderstood at all. The employee clearly felt he was worth more than he was paid. He should take his luck and go elsewhere, as he clearly did not have his heart in his current job. He should ''just go.'' And the employee duly did. 
The words ''just go'' stuck in my mind, because bosses in the financial services use them far too rarely. My lunch companion was perhaps an exception, because his family is a big shareholder in his firm. Most other bosses are stewards for the shareholders -- and, normally, not terribly good stewards at that.
Of course, banking and investment bosses do have some equity in their firms, but they do not typically act like owners. They want to get paid a huge amount themselves. They also want to be surrounded by a phalanx of fawning minions who tell them they are masters of the universe. That strokes their egos. The best way of achieving that is to pay their minions millions, even if it costs the shareholders.
During the bubble years, pay in the financial services industry went through the roof. It was not just the stars who hit pay dirt. Fairly ordinary middle-ranking bankers raked it in. Even after the bubble burst, pay has taken a long time to come down. The 2007 bonus round was a record. Although pay was reined in after Lehman Brothers went bust in 2008, it rebounded the following year.
More recently, especially in Europe, bankers have hit relatively hard times. Compensation is being cut, and institutions like Deutsche Bank have said they will do more. But returns to shareholders are still miserable. What is more, as the economic situation in much of the world remains challenging, the general public is resentful toward an industry that played a role in creating the current mess and that has been bailed out repeatedly with public funds.
Quite apart from infusions of capital into specific institutions, the whole market has been buoyed by enormous injections of low-cost central banking money across the world -- whether it is round after round of asset-buying by central banks in Britain, Japan and the United States or the European Central Bank's ingenious support operations.
The endless stream of scandals -- money laundering, shady financial services, rogue trading and attempted manipulation of interest rates -- has further sullied the industry, including institutions like Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.
On a more technical note, high pay reduces the earnings that banks can squirrel away to build up their capital buffers as a protection against future crises. Although regulators are pushing for higher capital ratios, this can be achieved either by increasing the amount of equity in a bank or by cutting its lending. If banks emphasize the latter route too much, the economy will be put under further pressure.
The coming bonus round represents a golden opportunity to reset compensation to a much lower new base. What is needed is not merely to cut pay in line with reduced revenue, but something more radical -- a significant drop in the proportion of the revenue pot devoted to employees. Although the final figures will not be set for several months, now is the time to start planning.
And this is not something that should be left entirely to managers. Given intense shareholder and public interest in curbing pay in financial services, investors and regulators should get involved. They should call in bank chairmen and tell them they expect them to take advantage of the current uniquely favorable climate.
Managers will undoubtedly say that they are already cracking down on compensation and that it is best not to move too rapidly; otherwise, important employees will jump ship. But if shareholders and regulators give the same broad message to all banks -- even if it is not their role to give specific instructions -- there will be less risk of such poaching. With pretty much the whole industry downsizing in response to the weak market, there is not going to be much appetite among rivals for hiring.
It is perhaps too much to hope bank bosses will think about the public interest. But they are mostly smart individuals who can see how the winds of change are blowing and understand that it could be in their personal interest to get ahead of the curve. Some of those who have not been able to adapt to the new zeitgeist -- like the former Barclays chief Robert E. Diamond Jr. -- have been defenestrated.
Bankers will always be tempted to play their own version of the game of Monopoly one more time and see if they can pass Go and collect another $200 (add several zeroes). And, even in the current climate, there will be many who complain if their pay is cut. But the message to them should be the same as that given by my lunch companion: ''Just Go!''

HEADLINE: Uranium Substitute Is No Longer Needed, but Its Disposal May Pose Security Risk

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At the dawn of the civilian nuclear age in the 1950s, one of the pressing questions was how to find enough fuel for reactors and bombs. The government and the private sector seized on a man-made substitute for natural uranium, producing about 3,400 pounds of an exotic and expensive material called uranium 233.
Today, the problem is how to safely get rid of it. 
''We do consider this to be waste,'' said David G. Huizenga, the senior administrator for environmental management at the Energy Department. ''There's no further need for it.''
Uranium 233 looked attractive because it could be made in a reactor from thorium, a cheap and abundant radioactive metal, and, almost magically, the reactor would produce more fuel than it consumed. Utilities manufactured some of it at the Indian Point I reactor in Westchester County, N.Y., which is now retired, and at reactors in Colorado, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
But in the end, ordinary uranium was cheaper, and 233 was not needed.
''Nuclear physicists weren't geologists and didn't understand the supply of uranium,'' said Frank N. Von Hippel, a physicist and public policy specialist at Princeton. ''It turned out there was more uranium than people thought and less nuclear power than people thought there would be.''
Ordinary uranium also proved to be much easier to work with than 233. But the government assembled a few bombs with the 233 version, and a research reactor in Tennessee briefly switched to it as fuel in 1968. But very little was used, so the material sat for decades in government laboratories and weapons plants.
Now, wary of the security risks posed by the stockpiles, the Energy Department is making plans to dispose of them at a cost estimated at $473 million. The department faces other disposal challenges, including how to handle tens of thousands of tons of spent fuel from civilian reactors, but uranium 233 is different, given that in the proper form it could easily be used to make a bomb.
Robert Alvarez, a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies who was an Energy Department adviser during the Clinton administration, estimates that the government spent at least $5.5 billion, accounting for inflation, to produce the uranium 233. He contends that the government is poised to compound its original error in making the material by disposing of it in a way that is not secure.
The department's plan is to take the uranium made at Indian Point, now stored in 403 stainless steel tubes at a plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and bury the containers at a low-level waste dump that consists of trenches that are up to 40 feet deep at the Nevada National Security Site, where nuclear weapons were tested until 1992.
Workers will dig narrow ''slit trenches'' at the bottom of the standard ones, descending another 8 to 10 feet.
The locations would not be disclosed, and anyone bent on retrieving the material would not know where the slits were within the trenches. The uranium 233 is in a ceramic form that binds to the metal of the tubes, which are welded shut, providing an extra level of protection, the department says.
Energy Department officials said that restoring 233 to a form that could be used in weapons was beyond the industrial capacity of most countries and that retrieving it would require heavy equipment. Still, the hardest part of making a uranium bomb has already been accomplished -- separating the isotopes that split, and thus are bomb fuel, from the isotopes that do not.
Because the uranium 233 is mixed in with dangerously radioactive materials, it is ''self-protecting'' to an extent, said Charles D. Ferguson, the president of the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Over time, he said, the radiation will diminish, and some of it has died away because the uranium 233 is 50 to 60 years old.
Yet Mr. Alvarez maintains that the disposal plan is insufficient. Shallow land burial ''sets a bad precedent in terms of international safeguards,'' he said.
In a recent research paper, he also argued that the material should be made useless for making bombs by diluting it with a plentiful form of uranium that will not sustain a nuclear reaction.
It is not clear what that would cost, but the Energy Department has rejected the additional expense as unnecessary.

HEADLINE: More Access to Contraceptives in City Schools

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A New York City pilot program to distribute morning-after pills and other contraceptives to high school students has encountered little resistance from parents since it began early last year, health officials said Sunday.
The officials said the program was an expansion of a similar program run by privately operated school-based health centers around the city for several years. The newer program uses doctors from the health department, who prescribe contraceptives, and school nurses.
About a quarter of high school students have access to privately operated health centers. The city-run program originally extended contraceptive services to 14 more schools, or another 5 percent of students, but one campus has since dropped out. 
The high schools, including Fashion Industries in Manhattan and Susan E. Wagner on Staten Island, were chosen because they had a dearth of health services nearby and they served a student population known to have a higher risk of pregnancy, for a variety of reasons, the department said.
Only 1 percent to 2 percent of parents returned a form to opt out of the program. The form allowed them to select any or all of four types of reproductive services that they did not want their child to receive, including emergency contraception, birth control pills, pregnancy testing or condoms.
''In New York City, over 7,000 young women become pregnant by age 17 -- 90 percent of which are unplanned,'' Alexandra Waldhorn, a health department spokeswoman, said. ''We are committed to trying new approaches, like this pilot program in place since January 2011, to improve a situation that can have lifelong consequences.''
The so-called Catch program -- which stands for Connecting Adolescents to Comprehensive Healthcare -- was first reported on Sunday in The New York Post. The program began with 5 schools in January 2011 and later expanded to 14. It is down to 13 this year, after Seward Park Educational Campus in Manhattan, which comprises five small schools, was removed because it did not have the resources to handle it, health officials said.
In the 2011-12 school year, 567 students received emergency contraception, known as Plan B, and 580 received the birth-control pill Reclipsen through the city program. But health officials said those numbers did not reflect the many students who were referred out for services.
The private programs also offer morning-after pills and do not require parental consent, city officials said. If a parent opted out of the city-run contraception program, his or her child could still go to any community clinic or a school-based health center operated by a private organization and receive the contraception.
Health officials said it was too early to tell if the program was effective in reducing pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.
Under federal rules, Plan B, a pill that cuts the risk of pregnancy in half if taken soon after sex, is available without a prescription to women 17 and older.
New York is among 21 states and the District of Columbia that allow all minors access to contraceptive services, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group in Washington that supports abortion rights. But because of a court decision in the early 1990s, some form of parental notification and the right to opt out is required at school.
Greg Pfundstein, executive director of the Chiaroscuro Foundation, an anti-abortion group in New York, questioned whether parents were really giving informed consent.
He also cited a 2010 British study, published in The Journal of Health Economics, which suggested that the increased availability of emergency contraception caused some teenagers to increase sexually risky behavior.

HEADLINE: A Vanity Fair for France Puts Timing in Question

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- For several years, media executives in Paris have been buzzing about the expected introduction of a French version of Vanity Fair magazine.
Now that the publisher of Vanity Fair, Condé Nast, has announced plans to start the French edition, however, they are asking why the company decided to disclose its intentions now, many months before the magazine is set to arrive and amid a stubborn economic crisis.
''There's a crisis, of course,'' said Xavier Romatet, president of Condé Nast France, who said only that the French Vanity Fair would appear ''before the summer.''
''We have to innovate, we have to do something new, something French,'' he said. ''The French magazine market is not driven by the economy as much as by the offer that is available.'' 
Condé Nast started a British version of Vanity Fair in 1991, an Italian edition in 2003 and a Spanish one in 2008. The Italian magazine, published weekly, was a quick success, and its circulation has grown to about 280,000. In Britain, where Vanity Fair is published monthly, circulation stands at about 107,000; in Spain, where the magazine also appears monthly, the total is 41,000. That compares with about 1.2 million monthly in the United States.
Why did Condé Nast wait so long to introduce Vanity Fair to France, which might seem like a natural market for a title that draws much of its advertising from luxury goods firms, many of them French?
Not all of Vanity Fair's European editions have thrived. A German Vanity Fair, begun in 2007, was shut down two years later. Some analysts said at the time that German readers, used to getting their celebrity news from Bild, a mass-circulation newspaper, were not prepared for a high-end glossy like Vanity Fair, where celebrity tittle-tattle shares space with investigative articles.
Condé Nast has done well with some recent introductions in France, however; a local version of the men's magazine GQ, started in 2008, has become the leader in its category, which has been generally in decline.
Thierry Dussard, a professor in the executive master of journalism program at the Institut d'Études Politiques in Paris, or Sciences Po, said one reason for the delayed introduction of Vanity Fair might have been the challenge of reporting aggressively on public figures in France. Until recently, he said, powerful business magnates often pulled advertising from publications that ran investigative articles on them or on politicians or celebrities to whom they were linked.
That began to change over the past five years, Mr. Dussard said, when the news media pursued stories about private life of Nicolas Sarkozy, president during most of the period, and about the financial dealings of business figures with connections to him, with heretofore unseen zest -- and without being punished by advertisers. The continuing scrutiny by the news media of the private life of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former chief of the International Monetary Fund, who has been questioned by the police in connection with an investigation into an alleged prostitution ring, has provided further evidence of a change in the attitude toward public figures' private lives.
''Everyone has been waiting for a French Vanity Fair for a long time, and now the market is ready,'' Mr. Dussard said.
Nonetheless, it is unusual for a magazine to be introduced many months before it appears, without a fixed date for the first edition. It is especially unusual for that to happen in the midst of an economic crisis, with a soft advertising market.
One French journalist with close ties to the magazine business said the early announcement might have been aimed at stealing the limelight from Carine Roitfeld, former editor of another Condé Nast publication, the French edition of Vogue, who left that magazine two years ago.
After Ms. Roitfeld left Vogue in 2010 -- for reasons that were never explained -- there was speculation in France that she might return to Condé Nast as editor of a French edition of Vanity Fair. But that did not happen. Instead, this month, Ms. Roitfeld introduced her own magazine, CR Fashion Book, which is aimed at a cosmopolitan audience, with articles in several languages. Vogue, she told The Guardian, was ''like a golden cage.''
While fashion is only one part of Vanity Fair's eclectic editorial mix -- alongside politics, business, celebrities and other things -- many luxury advertisers buy space in fashion magazines, as well as in Vanity Fair.
''The French Vanity Fair is not a response to Carine Roitfeld, but her magazine was surely a trigger for the decision to announce it now,'' the French journalist said.
Mr. Romatet dismissed the idea that there was a link between the announcement and the arrival of CR Fashion Book, saying that any animosity toward Ms. Roitfeld belonged ''to the past.''
''Brands are stronger than people,'' he said. ''Carine has her new life, Vogue has its new life and that's it.''
While advertising for luxury goods has held up better than some other areas of the market during the financial crisis, the British fashion house Burberry recently sent alarms through the industry -- and through the media owners that rely on luxury ads -- when it warned of a slowdown in sales.
While newspapers struggle in France, magazines remain popular, and there is a proliferation of titles covering news and fashion. There is no direct competitor to Vanity Fair, which will be published monthly in France, though one French institution, the weekly Paris Match, covers a similarly broad range of topics, including news and celebrities. Paris Match, which is owned by Lagardère, has a circulation of 620,000.
Overall French magazine ad spending rose 0.9 percent from January through July, compared with that of a year earlier, according to Aegis Media, which buys advertising space for marketers. That is a stronger performance than that of newspaper advertising, which fell 4.3 percent.
Analysts said that by adding a French presence, Vanity Fair might increase its international appeal to luxury advertisers at a time when more of them are managing global campaigns.
''It's not a great time to launch a magazine, but will it be better in two years?'' said Sophie Renaud, head of the press department at Aegis in Paris. ''Who knows? There's always the question of whether the market can absorb a new title. At first glance, you'd have to say yes, because Vanity Fair occupies a niche that doesn't really exist now.''
The French Vanity Fair plans to start with a high-profile staff, headed by Michel Denisot, host of a popular French television talk show, ''Le Grand Journal.'' Mr. Denisot is a well-connected figure, with the ability to attract A-list guests to his daily show. For the time being, at least, he will divide his time between ''Le Grand Journal'' and Vanity Fair.
''He is one of the most experienced journalists in France and understands well the mix of news, information and glamour that Vanity Fair represents,'' Mr. Romatet said. ''I think he will bring us the experience of TV, not the usual background of someone coming from the magazine industry. I want to change, I want to do something new, something fresh.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With a Servant's Pregnancy Comes a Man's Chute From High Society

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
Class conflict gets a workout in the Mint Theater Company's lively, penetrating revival of ''Mary Broome,'' the troupe's latest invigoration of a largely forgotten work. The play's author, Allan Monkhouse (1858-1936), also a novelist and critic, was known for his acerbic dissections of the English bourgeoisie. ''Mary Broome'' -- a comedy that first appeared in Manchester in 1911 and was last staged in Manhattan in 1919, at the Neighborhood Playhouse on Grand Street -- cuts right to its heart. 
The mildly unctuous but employed Edgar Timbrell (Rod Brogan), of the prosperous Timbrell clan, is preparing to wed Sheila Ray (Julie Jesneck) when their thunder is stolen by Edgar's brother, Leonard (Roderick Hill), a clever if feckless layabout. A photograph that has surfaced in a servant's quarters prompts the revelation that Leonard, who is paid monthly to stay out of the family business, has had an affair with the housemaid, Mary Broome (Janie Brookshire). Mary, in turn, announces she is pregnant.
Edgar and Sheila, accustomed to -- if still offended by -- Leonard's excesses, are mortified by his transgression, as much for its economic miscegenation as its impiety. Edward Timbrell (Graeme Malcolm), the family's imperious patriarch, is livid. (To his credit he doesn't blame Mary.) He threatens to revoke Leonard's stipend if he doesn't marry her.
Leonard accedes to Edward's wishes but can't stop delivering witty barbs about religion and prudishness, among other subjects. (''He makes fun of all the wrong things,'' Sheila says.) He says that he and Mary are ''rather on show here,'' at a dinner party. ''This is a social experiment.'' His flippancy eventually proves too much for Edward, who cuts the couple off. Leonard has his first taste of poverty and real responsibility. Mary has a glimpse of Leonard's true measure.
Credit Jonathan Bank, the director, for keeping Mr. Hill on track with Leonard's torrential patter, and for sharply etched performances from the supporting players, including Kristin Griffith as Mrs. Timbrell; Katie Fabel as the daughter, Ada; and Patricia Kilgarriff as a gruff but kindly landlady. As the Mancunian Mary, Ms. Brookshire is a sturdy combination of humility, practicality and, ultimately, resolve.
Technical contributions are impeccable. Martha Hally's costumes are right at home amid Roger Hanna's evocative sets (including a reversible fireplace). Nicole Pearce's lighting casts a drawing-room glow, while Zhanna Gurvich's paintings add a wry, droll underpinning.
A hero somewhat in the Shavian and Wildean mold, all observations and wisecracks, the often charming Leonard is more an antihero, possessed of contradictions. His insolence and loquacity obscure his emotions. ''I can't make out how much he cares,'' Mary says. Monkhouse doesn't limit his literary arrows to upper-crust conceits. Leonard is undone by his own restless intellect, confounding even himself.
''Mary Broome'' continues through Oct. 21 at the Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org.

HEADLINE: What Do Teachers Deserve? In Idaho, Referendum May Offer Answer

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
BOISE, Idaho -- In the struggle to fix the nation's public schools, the old red-state, blue-state idea is looking as dated as Dick and Jane. You can hear the change in the voice of Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican here in one of the most deeply conservative corners of the country, when he expresses a brotherhood bond with Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor of Chicago and former Obama administration chief of staff.
''I could empathize with Rahm and what he was going through,'' Mr. Otter, better known as ''Butch,'' said about the recently settled teachers' strike in Chicago during an interview here in the State Capitol. 
''It's not the teachers,'' Mr. Otter said, paraphrasing Mr. Emanuel's tough-guy script from a news conference at the height of the standoff. ''It's the union bosses.''
Chicago's fight may be over, but in Idaho, where a three-part proposition on performance pay, tenure and technology in the classroom is roaring toward Election Day, the debate over schools has morphed into a harsh discussion about whom the voters should trust. And as Mr. Otter's attack line shows, the political and social battle lines are blurred -- neither predictably conservative nor liberal, and often tinged with emotion about what schools can and might be.
South Dakota and Michigan also have questions on their ballots that ask voters to weigh in on collective bargaining. Voters in California and Arizona will decide on new or expanded taxes to support their schools. At least 20 state legislatures addressed teacher tenure this year, most of them shifting power from unions to districts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group.
But Idaho's track through the faculty lounge -- closely watched by labor and education interests around the nation -- is still a case apart in the magnitude of the changes and how they came to be.
In a mostly rural state where the recession was particularly brutal in construction and manufacturing, lawmakers carved some of the deepest cuts in school spending in the nation. Per-pupil outlays fell 19 percent between the 2008 and 2013 fiscal years -- only Arizona, Alabama and Oklahoma cut more -- according to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy research group focused on low- and moderate-income families.
In 2011 the Legislature passed, and Mr. Otter signed, a regulatory overhaul of public education: eliminating tenure and stripping teachers of most collective bargaining rights, yet promising hand-held computers for students.
That created the context that both sides are now fighting over in television ads and political broadsides. The teachers' union and its allies wonder if the state's regulatory changes were sincerely aimed at improving schools, or a cynical move -- with the recession as cover story -- to eliminate one of the last vestiges of union life in a fiercely anti-union state.
The governor and his allies ask if teachers really want the best for students, or if they are fighting to defend cushy rights in setting schedules and curriculums that few other workers enjoy.
The question of whether public employees in general have it too good in a transformed global economy has echoed in other states, of course. Last year in Ohio, residents struck down a package of laws that reduced public employee perks. The recall election in Wisconsin this year was a public-worker debate by proxy, as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who had pushed through a rights-reduction package, was reconfirmed.
Here it is all about what happens in the classroom.
''If you look at polling, union leaders are one of the least respected when it comes to getting information about education, but teachers are always at the top,'' said Tom Luna, Idaho's superintendent of public instruction, who led the overhaul drive as the publicly elected head of the school system.
Firing back, teachers and their union representatives say the overhaul, formulated during Idaho's application for federal funds in the Obama administration's Race to the Top education incentive program, was mostly about austerity.
''He tried to claim there was a need for reform, when in actuality it was a political answer to our economic conditions,'' said Robin Nettinga, the executive director of the Idaho Education Association, referring to Mr. Luna. The association, representing about 13,000 teachers, led a petition drive this year to challenge the overhaul package and put it on the ballot. Its yard signs urge voters to strike down ''the Luna Laws.''
Some district administrators say they fear that in their bloodletting both sides are forgetting the students.
''We just can't keep doing what we're doing,'' said Ryan Kerby, the superintendent of New Plymouth School District, who helped develop a pay-for-performance bonus system in the overhaul package called Students Come First. Mr. Kerby noted that Idaho's high school graduates have among the lowest rates in the nation for going to college and staying there, a challenge for the state whatever happens with the ballot measures.
Teachers working to overturn the package say that curtailed bargaining rights and the elimination of tenure protection are tough, but that morale has been hardest hit by accusations that money and clout across the bargaining table are central motivators.
''Nobody becomes a teacher for the money,'' said Mandy Simpson, the president of the Nampa Education Association, who teaches high school math near Boise. ''I could make twice what I do.''
But money is, in fact, driving at least part of the debate because of how Students Come First was structured. About $38 million in the first round of teachers' bonuses -- an average of about $2,000 per teacher, calculated through test scores and other criteria developed by districts -- is set to be paid later this year, in the first fiscal year that funds become available.
That is if Proposition 2, the one focused on merit pay, survives November's election. If it is struck down, Mr. Luna said in an interview, the state will have no legal authority to pay up.
But if the pay and bargaining system survives the election, some veteran educators said they thought the strife could get even worse by forcing teachers to focus all issues and grievances into pay and benefits, which would be the only things left for the union to negotiate.
''Everything is going to come down to pay, so other dissatisfactions are going to get hooked to that,'' said Michael Steiner, who taught English for four decades in the Idaho public schools before retiring in 2007. ''The fighting might never end.''

HEADLINE: A Manager of Overseas Crises, As Much as the World Permits

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama flies to New York on Monday afternoon for the United Nations General Assembly, he will dispense with the usual battery of one-on-one meetings with world leaders so he can tape an appearance on ''The View'' and return by midweek to the battleground state of Ohio. Left to help smooth over any ruffled feathers will be Tom Donilon.
Gray-suited, meticulous and little known to the public, Mr. Donilon is the president's national security adviser and central figure in American foreign policy, ''the most important person in the mix,'' according to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In this critical campaign season, he has also become the president's geopolitical bodyguard, charged with keeping the world at bay for another 43 days.
Mr. Donilon is the one who wakes the president when an ambassador is killed in Libya, the one who tries to keep Israel from rupturing relations and Egypt from heading off track. Solutions to intractable problems like Iran's nuclear program are for another day. For now, it is Mr. Donilon's mission to manage problems and keep them from blowing up, so Mr. Obama can focus on Mitt Romney rather than Benjamin Netanyahu. 
But the world has not been cooperative with the American political calendar, as the tumult in Muslim countries attests. Afghan troops keep killing American troops. Syria keeps massacring its people. China and Japan keep rattling sabers. Iran keeps defying the West. And the bill will come due in November when Mr. Obama will confront a daunting list of challenges that the final weeks of the presidential campaign have seemingly put on hold.
If anyone can manage it, colleagues say, it is Mr. Donilon. ''Tom can keep 10 important things in his head at once while juggling others in the air, trying to avoid any falling to the ground,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said. Jacob S. Lew, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Donilon ensures that ''we don't end up just with all the grains of sand but we see how all the issues connect.''
Mr. Biden, whose wife, Jill, employs Mr. Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, as her chief of staff, said Mr. Donilon channels Mr. Obama. ''In a sense, he kind of thinks like the president,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Tom knows where the president wants to go. Tom knows when the president wants to go left, straight, up or down.''
A longtime political operative, Mr. Donilon has methodically reinvented himself as a maestro of international affairs, consolidating control of the national security apparatus in a corner West Wing office stacked with classified briefing books as thick as a fist. He oversaw support for the Libya war that toppled Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. He made sure surge troops left Afghanistan as scheduled. He is a champion of Mr. Obama's so-called pivot to Asia.
Yet Mr. Donilon has not escaped controversy. Colleagues talk of clashes with the Pentagon and the State Department and flashes of temper that should have lasted 30 seconds but extended for 10 minutes. Republicans suspect him of orchestrating national security leaks to make Mr. Obama look good, ''which a spokesman calls 'completely false.' '' And some foreign policy specialists consider him a pretender without a real vision.
''He is ferociously protective of the president's priorities,'' which is part of his job, said Kori Schake, who worked on President George W. Bush's national security staff, ''but comes down squarely on the side of the president's political interests when they are at odds with our national interests.'' She cited the timeline imposed on the Afghanistan troop surge, a move that mollified the antiwar left but has been criticized as premature.
Mr. Donilon, 57, who has lately avoided journalists amid leak investigations and declined to be interviewed for this article, is an unlikely foreign policy maven. He grew up in Providence, R.I., studied at Catholic University, then won an internship and later a staff job in Jimmy Carter's White House. In 1980, he wrangled convention delegates to beat Edward M. Kennedy.
After Mr. Carter's defeat, Mr. Donilon studied law at the University of Virginia and worked on campaigns, including Mr. Biden's 1988 presidential bid. When Bill Clinton won in 1992, a Carter-era mentor, Warren M. Christopher, became secretary of state and made Mr. Donilon his chief of staff.
He worked for six years as an executive at Fannie Mae, the housing giant that after his departure was at the center of the 2008 economic crash. Mr. Donilon, who made millions, was not linked to Fannie Mae's problems with accounting irregularities, but he was part of a management that lobbied Congress against tighter regulation.
Mr. Donilon was drawn into Mr. Obama's orbit late in 2008 to help prepare him for his debates in the general election campaign. After the election, Rahm Emanuel, a friend from the Clinton administration who was tapped as Mr. Obama's chief of staff, made sure he became deputy to Gen. James Jones, the new national security adviser.
Mr. Jones focused on high-profile meetings with ambassadors and foreign ministers, leaving Mr. Donilon to brief the president and run the National Security Council. Mr. Emanuel often bypassed Mr. Jones to work with Mr. Donilon. ''Tom and Rahm were making decisions,'' said a former White House official. ''There were times he probably felt left out,'' the official said of Mr. Jones, but Mr. Donilon ''never meant to make the general look bad.''
Mr. Donilon made enemies at the Pentagon during the debate over sending more troops to Afghanistan. He suspected the military of trying to manipulate the new president; the military suspected Mr. Donilon, who never served in uniform or visited Afghanistan, of substituting politics for strategy.
Mr. Donilon clashed with officials like Michèle A. Flournoy, then under secretary of defense. ''She really took a pounding from Donilon,'' one colleague said. Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, warned that making Mr. Donilon national security adviser would be ''a disaster,'' according to a book by Bob Woodward.
Mr. Donilon has since visited Afghanistan, and colleagues said he forged better relations with the military.
''It's not unusual, especially with a new administration coming in, getting a sense that the military might try to box you in on a political position, and I think Tom had what I would call kind of a questioning nature -- are we really getting the real scoop?'' said Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, who succeeded Mr. Gates. ''Over time and with some of the changes that were made with regard to the military leadership, it became much more of a give and take process.''
Mr. Emanuel tried to enlist Mr. Donilon to succeed him as chief of staff, but it was Mr. Jones whom Mr. Donilon hoped to succeed. Mr. Obama, impressed with Mr. Donilon's trains-on-time proficiency, obliged.
''It's not something he had to learn,'' said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who went to high school with Mr. Donilon. ''He's been preparing for a role like this for several decades.''
Mr. Donilon righted an operation seen as dysfunctional. He is an ''evangelist for process,'' one aide said, calling meeting after meeting to ensure every quarter is heard. His preparations and work ethic are legendary. ''The notion of 24/7 -- he gives new meaning to it,'' said Dennis B. Ross, a former special envoy. Once he was so exacting in choosing a basketball jersey for his son, recalled Tommy Vietor, his spokesman, ''it was as if it was a principals' meeting.''
Mr. Obama gave him grief for never taking time off and browbeat him into losing 50 pounds. But he remains a famous worrier -- ''the bed-wetter,'' some at the State Department call him. ''He has a lot to worry about,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''He really cares deeply about getting it right.''
Mr. Donilon has a complicated relationship with Mrs. Clinton. Colleagues said he seemed to fear her and rarely takes her on, yet is insecure about her, asking before a recent trip to China whether his meetings were on par with hers.
Mrs. Clinton played down tension and lavished praise -- ''incredibly intelligent'' and ''extraordinarily efficient,'' she said. ''I have a great relationship with him. We don't always agree, obviously. I bring my own perspective and experience to the table. But he is truly an honest broker.''
For a model Mr. Donilon has James A. Baker III, another convention delegate wrangler turned foreign policy statesman, and he is known to resent the idea that he has not evolved over the course of his career. When an aide said half-jokingly that Washington still viewed Mr. Donilon as a political operative, he replied bitterly, ''Fourteen years in foreign policy and I'm a political guy. O.K. I ran the State Department but O.K. Baker complained about this, too.''
For Mr. Donilon, politics is largely in the past. ''He has devoted an incredible amount of time and energy over two decades in making the shift from being a political person to a policy person,'' said Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy, ''and that's reflected in everything he's been doing.''

HEADLINE: The Missing Cost of Iran

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The last two U.S. presidents have misled voters on the cost of armed conflicts. Amid another election, the drumbeats of war are sounding again. This time, the subject is Iran.
To paraphrase Ronald Reagan: Here we go again.
There is a robust debate on the virtues and risks of trying to take out Iran's nuclear facilities. That discussion is taking place in Israel. 
In the U.S. election, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, parry over who has the smartest strategy for ensuring that Iran doesn't obtain the enriched uranium to develop a nuclear weapon. The two candidates warn about the dangers of Iran becoming a nuclear power.
There is almost no discussion on the costs of a strike to take out that nuclear capacity -- be it by Israel or the U.S -- in lives, money, and regional and global standing.
This follows two unsatisfactory experiences over the past 10 years. In 2003, President George W. Bush said the invasion of Iraq was justified to remove Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. ''It would not be that hard,'' Vice President Dick Cheney assured Americans.
The weapons proved to be nonexistent, but the effort was hard and costly. More than 4,400 Americans were killed, and it cost more than $800 billion, while Iraq remains unstable and the region's more lethal threat, Iran, is empowered.
Four years ago, Mr. Obama declared that instead of Iraq, he would focus on the real problem: Afghanistan. More than 1,500 Americans have died there since, at a cost of least $400 billion. That country seems as corrupt and unstable as ever.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says a pre-emptive strike against Iran is probably necessary, and he resists any pressure from the U.S. government to hold off.
Mr. Obama doesn't believe the need for military action is imminent. Mr. Romney would basically give the Israelis a blank check.
Ten days ago, a high-level group of U.S. national security experts offered some answers to the questions about cost and consequences that the candidates are avoiding. Called the Iran Project, the report was signed by more than 30 experts, including prominent Republicans like former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. Also included were leading Democrats like Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, and Lee Hamilton, a former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as respected diplomats like Frank G. Wisner and Thomas Pickering who served under Republican and Democratic administrations. The signatories also include two retired military leaders, Gen. Anthony Zinni and Adm. William Fallon, both former chiefs of the U.S. Central Command, which covers the Middle East. General Zinni was Mr. Bush's envoy to the region.
The Iran Project authors say flatly that ''extended military strikes by the U.S. alone or in concert with Israel could destroy or severely damage the six most important nuclear facilities in Iran.'' An Israeli attack, they add, would delay the operation by two years, while more sophisticated U.S. capabilities would take it out for up to four years.
To prevent the Iranians from restarting their nuclear facilities, the report states that the United States would need to conduct a ''significantly expanded air and sea war over a prolonged period of time, likely several years.''
If the goal is regime change, that would probably require the use of ground forces to occupy Iran. That would mean a commitment of resources and personnel ''greater than what the U.S. has expended over the last 10 years in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.''
Whatever course is chosen, the experts conclude that an attack on Iran would be met with retaliation. They anticipate efforts to close the Strait of Hormuz for days or weeks, with global economic implications, and asymmetrical attacks using surrogates like Hezbollah on U.S. facilities in the region and beyond. Conceivably, it could set off a regional war.
The reaction on the street in the Middle East, they suggest, would be very negative for U.S. interests, and for countries in the region like Egypt. Moreover, they worry that a strike would strengthen, not weaken, the Iranian leaders' somewhat tenuous hold on their country.
Unlike in the United States, there is a very open debate about this in Israel, where a number of intelligence and military officials have publicly opposed Mr. Netanyahu's eagerness to strike. The most compelling opponent is Meir Dagan, who was the head of intelligence and special operations for the Mossad for more than eight years.
In long interviews with the CBS television program ''60 Minutes'' and The New Yorker magazine, he enumerated the perils of Mr. Netanyahu's course. Mr. Dagan said an Israeli strike would bolster the Iranian regime, which he argues is failing in its push to lead the Muslim world. In the interview with The New Yorker, he said that while Iran resumed its nuclear project about seven years ago, ''the economic and diplomatic and covert pressure, led by America, obviates the need for any attacks now.''
Still, the Iran Project authors acknowledge that for the United States there are risks to any course of action. ''The failure to attack and the decision to attack both could have some negative reputational consequences. The challenge then would be to determine which of those consequences are most probable, important and lasting.''
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama both owe it to the American people to address that question over the next six weeks.

HEADLINE: Rationing Health Care to Control Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner (''Beyond Obamacare,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 17) wants to reduce the one-quarter of Medicare's budget for expenses incurred in the last year of life, while ridiculing ''the ever-popular waste, fraud and abuse.''
Although fraud and abuse account for a small portion of the budget, waste is everywhere. Study after study reveals costly tests, leading to more costly treatments, that harm more patients than they help, and costly treatments that are no more effective than much cheaper ones. 
Mr. Rattner wants rationing, but the key to controlling costs is not to decide which patients should get care, but which care patients should get.
MARTIN B. BRILLIANT Holmdel, N.J., Sept. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
I disagree with Steven Rattner that President Obama's health reform was inattentive to cost control and that rationing care to the elderly is needed to slow the growth of health care spending.
The Affordable Care Act deserves a solid ''A'' for including virtually every cost control idea anyone has come up with -- limits on tax breaks for employer-sponsored health insurance, accountable care organizations, bundled payments, comparative effectiveness analysis, a commission to regulate payments, reforms in insurance design and much more.
Transforming the current chaotic mélange of health care payment and delivery arrangements into a genuine system will take many years, because current arrangements are entrenched and structured to resist effective cost control.
The task for this generation should be to implement the many promising cost-control measures in the health reform legislation. There are better ways to respond to today's budget challenges than to renege on the commitment made nearly half a century ago to assure the elderly, people with disabilities and the poor health care comparable to that enjoyed by the rest of us.
HENRY J. AARON Washington, Sept. 18, 2012
The writer is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner rightly focuses on the need to allocate health care resources more prudently. But it isn't just the last year of life that consumes irrational costs. I'm 85, and this morning I had a six-month checkup that happily reported wonderful test results and no significant problems. Yet my nice doctor wants me back six months from now, even if I am still feeling fine. She says this is ''preventive medicine.''
I call such protocols a waste of Medicare money.
MARJORIE WHITE Chapel Hill, N.C., Sept. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner says that ''unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently -- rationing, by its proper name -- the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.''
The Times's pages have been filled with news articles, editorials, Op-Ed articles and letters showing how we can control health care costs and improve outcomes through care coordination, more primary and preventive care, accountable care organizations and single-payer health coverage.
We already ration care through payment denials, bare-bones policies, high deductibles and co-payments, and unaffordable coverage that deprive working people of access to care. We don't need more rationing.
The well-to-do can easily afford to pay for care to fill the gaps that Mr. Rattner's proposal would leave. For the rest of us, it's a gruesome and unnecessary approach.
RICHARD N. GOTTFRIED New York, Sept. 18, 2012
The writer is chairman of the New York State Assembly Committee on Health.
To the Editor:
Steven Rattner wants to reduce medical costs by not offering ''every treatment, regardless of expenses or efficacy'' in the last year of life. That's reasonable -- if and when we give the elderly (I am one of them) the right to choose their own gentle death, something that many religions would obstruct.
But even before we get to that, let's consider the 76 million baby boomers who are or will be retiring and will drain Medicare. Would they be willing to join me in choosing death with dignity? Or would they prefer heart transplants at 85?
JO PROCTER Baltimore, Sept. 17, 2012
To the Editor:
The large cost for treatment in the last year of life is not a problem unique to the elderly population. Except for those who die suddenly, almost everyone, at every age, consumes the most medical dollars in the year before death, from preemies to centenarians. That's because they are usually sickest just before death.
Keeping impossibly young preemies alive in intensive care units for months before a largely predictable death -- which dramatically affects total health care dollars if not Medicare dollars -- should be just as much a topic for debate.
EDWARD BOUGH Mountain View, Calif., Sept. 17, 2012
The writer is a cardiologist.
To the Editor:
As the cost of Medicare consumes a larger and larger share of the American economy, Steven Rattner states that ''overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical'' is politically toxic.
The toxicity extends beyond politics into the personal. If care were rationed as it is in England and elsewhere, my wife, whose pancreatic cancer was diagnosed exactly one year ago and who has been kept alive with expensive drugs, would have missed our 53rd wedding anniversary in March, her 73rd birthday in August and her grandchildren's amazing accomplishments.
Do we ration care for the elderly? We must.
We can't. LEONARD MALKIN Troy, Mich., Sept. 17, 2012
The writer is a retired associate professor at the Wayne State University School of Medicine.

Health care costs are expected to continue to rise (PDF) in 2013. NASA's chief hangs out with a small-business partner and the agency seeks more small-business proposals for high-tech research and development.

 The Week's Best 
 Erica Douglass writes about why 99 percent of entrepreneurs don't make it: "I often hear teachers, coaches and even bloggers describe this as a 'passion.' 'You have to find what you're passionate about and then do that,' they say. And to that, I say: Hogwash. You don't need to go on a mission and find your passion to start a business. You just have to throw away much of your guilt and self-doubt and own the fact that you were put on this planet to do this very thing that you're doing right now."

HEADLINE: Gensler Calls for Overhaul of Libor

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggested that authorities retool or replace the London interbank offered rate. 

 BODY:
A senior regulator called for an overhaul of a key interest rate on Monday, telling the European Parliament that the integrity of consumer borrowing is at stake. 
Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggested that authorities retool or replace the London interbank offered rate, which affects the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations. Libor, a measure of how much banks charge each other for loans, underpins the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans. 
"It is time for a new or revised benchmark - a healthy benchmark anchored in actual, observable market transactions - to restore the confidence of people around the globe that the rates at which they borrow and lend money and hedge interest rates are set honestly and transparently," Mr. Gensler said in prepared remarks that he delivered via video from Washington. "People around the world saving for the future, using credit cards or borrowing money for tuition, cars and homes have a real stake in the integrity of Libor" and other rates like the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor. 
 (Mr. Gensler cancelled his trip to Brussels after a recent "clumsy" fall caused him to break four ribs and puncture a lung.)
In June, Mr. Gensler's agency leveled a $200 million fine against Barclays, accusing the British bank of attempting to manipulate Libor. The settlement was the first of several cases the C.F.T.C. is building against big banks suspected of lowballing rates to protect their image during the financial crisis. 
"Naturally, people are wondering if the Barclays situation was isolated," Mr. Gensler said.
Citing reams of data, Mr. Gensler argued that the problem persists today. 
With banks no longer lending to one another, he noted, Libor is not rooted in actual transactions. The United States Dollar denominated Libor rate is also significantly different from the comparable Euribor rate. The discrepancy, he said, underscores that the rate remains vulnerable to tampering. 
"When market participants submit for a benchmark rate lacking observable underlying transactions, even if operating in good faith, they may stray from what real transactions would reflect," he said. 
Some regulators have called for alternative benchmarks, including the overnight index swaps rate, that are based on real transactions. Other options include using short-term bank financing, where banks pledge collateral with other financial institutions.
While Mr. Gensler did not insist on ending Libor, he argued that it might be the safest route.
"Despite a long and painful recovery, sometimes replacement is the better choice when a hip or a knee or even a benchmark rate has worn out," he said, a nod to his recent medical mishap.

HEADLINE: Monday Motorsports: Denny Hamlin Dominates Second Race of Sprint Cup Chase

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Hamlin won his fifth race of 2012, dominating the field at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on Sunday. 

 BODY:
On Sunday in Loudon, N.H., Denny Hamlin would not have his raceday success dictated by grid position.
Owing to improper tire inflation, the winningest driver in Sprint Cup this year qualified 32nd for the race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway and would have to dissect the field for any chance at points, let alone a victory. He managed beyond expectations, leading 193 laps of the Sylvania 300 en route to a victory.
It was Hamlin's fifth win of the 2012 season but first of the postseason chase, which is but two races old. As Jimmie Johnson, the five-time Sprint Cup champion, knows, the key to success in the chase is consistency, and Johnson is doing his part, finishing second to Hamlin at Loudon and claiming the overall points lead. He was followed by Jeff Gordon, the pole sitter for Sunday's race. (ESPN)
The chase moves to Dover, Del., for the AAA 400 on Sunday.
Here are other motorsports news items from the weekend:
 On Sunday, Sebastian Vettel reprised his victory in the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix. He received a significant boost when Lewis Hamilton, the driver for McLaren Mercedes who led the night race from the pole for the first 23 laps, retired after his gearbox failed. Jenson Button, Hamilton's teammate, finished second, with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, the leader in the driver's championship, claiming third. (IHT Rendezvous Formula One blog)
 Antron Brown earned his fifth victory of the year in Top Fuel on Sunday at N.H.R.A. Texas Fall Nationals, moving into a tie for the points lead with Spencer Massey, his teammate at Don Schumacher Racing. In the Funny Car final, Bob Tasca defeated Matt Hagan. (Racin' Today)
 The IndyCar race at Edmonton, Alberta, has been pulled, with no plans for its continuation. Its promoters were unable to find a title sponsor in the two years it organized the event, and since its initial running in 2005 under the umbrella of Champ Car, the race has struggled with low attendance and lack of corporate involvement. The IndyCar race at Toronto will be the series' only grand prix in Canada for the foreseeable future. (The Edmonton Journal)

HEADLINE: Low Waters and High Anxiety

BYLINE: CHRIS BENTLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Vessel operators appeal for federal dredging of Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron so ships can carry more cargo. 

 BODY:
This summer's drought has continued to draw down water levels in Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron (hydrologically speaking, Michigan and Huron are the same body of water). New forecasts suggest that water levels in the two lakes may soon hit an all-time low, aggravating an economic quandary: with such low levels, cargo ships have to forgo millions of dollars of freight.
Last month 25 senators signed a letter calling on the federal Office of Management and Budget to devote more money to dredging the nation's harbors. Federal taxes on ship cargo in coastal systems, including the Great Lakes, flow into a Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, from which money is appropriated for operations and maintenance of harbors and ports, they noted. 
Despite a balance of more than $8 billion, recent appropriations have averaged only $800 million, according to the letter.
"You hear the Great Lakes called a blue water highway," said Chuck May, chairman of the Great Lakes Small Harbor Coalition, a dredging advocacy group. "I say to them what good is a superhighway if you don't have any on or off ramps?"
Temporary or even permanent harbor closings could become more common if drought conditions continue. Last December, shipments to two ports in Michigan were canceled because shallow waters forced them to shut down.

When water levels approached record highs in 1997, the largest lake freighters were hauling 71,000 tons of cargo at a time. But all that tonnage weighs a ship down, and cargo loads declined after lake levels began a rapid decline in the late 1990's.
"By the start of the 2000 navigation season, the biggest ships were lucky if they had 60,000 tons on board," said Glen Nekvasil of the Lake Carriers Association, the trade group representing vessel operators in the Great Lakes that are registered under the United States flag. "So that's when things really started to become critical."
Since 1999, annual average water levels have been consistently below the historic averages recorded since 1860 in Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. A major research question for scientists is whether that trend will persist. Levels in Lakes Ontario and Erie have not fallen over the same period, and similar troughs during the 1930's and 1960's could suggest that this is a natural cycle.
But if the data are the beginning of a new normal, climate change could be the culprit, researchers say. Higher temperatures and receding ice cover might increase the rate of evaporation faster than precipitation and runoff can replenish the lakes. 
Temperature-based computer models do suggest an increase in evaporation over the last 30 years, but researchers are only now verifying those results with direct measurements by gauges on remote lighthouses throughout the lakes.
At any rate, Great Lakes harbors are becoming shallower. The Army Corps of Engineers dredges more than two million cubic yards of mud and sand from Great Lakes ports each year, scooping out sediment flushed into the harbors by erosion along riverbanks and lakeshores. But the dredging has not kept up with demand.
Climate change could further complicate those operations by periodically increasing precipitation in the region. Lake Erie saw one of its largest-ever seasonal water level rises between February and June 2011 as result of record rainfall. More than 17 million cubic yards of excess sediment already clog the ports, with that amount expected to grow to 21 million cubic yards by 2015.
The 2012 federal budget calls for dredging on only 16 of the 63 federally maintained ports on the lakes. Even the top-priority harbors, those with about 90 percent of the commercial traffic, are adequately dredged only 35 percent of the time, according to estimates by the Army Corps of Engineers.
To industry representatives and port residents like Mr. May of the Great Lakes Small Harbor Coalition, it is an avoidable crisis. Mr. May started up the organization in 2007 after the sailboat Barracuda sank in his hometown while returning to Chicago after the annual yacht race to Mackinac Island. The ship gashed its keel in four feet of water after seeking refuge from storm conditions on Lake Michigan in a harbor that was supposed to have 18 feet of clearance.
"That's when I got on the phone with other harbor communities," Mr. May said, "and found out we all had the same problem." 
Ships delivering 500,000 tons of coal to a power plant in Dunkirk, N.Y., for example, began to skirt bottom so often that the port stopped receiving coal trade in 2005. The cargo now travels there by rail instead, albeit with a greater carbon footprint.

HEADLINE: As Wall Street Fights Regulation, It Has Backup on the Bench

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: As the financial industry confronts a wave of new government regulations, it has sympathetic ears in a key federal appeals court. 

 BODY:
Deep in enemy territory, Wall Street has found a powerful ally.
An appeals court in Washington has become ground zero for legal challenges to financial reform. Over the years, judges have rejected several major rules, saving financial firms millions of dollars in compliance costs and exposing government regulators to further litigation.
As regulators once again take aim at Wall Street with the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, the financial industry is racing to fill the docket of its favorite court.
 The latest legal attacks are largely aimed at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last year struck down the agency's so-called proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank plan that would have empowered shareholders to oust company directors. The court is also expected to hear lawsuits over the S.E.C.'s new corporate whistle-blower program and the so-called Volcker Rule.
The flurry of litigation will play out on friendly political turf for Wall Street. Noted for its conservative credentials and harmonious culture, the appeals court is stacked with judges who enjoy rock-star status in Republican circles.
But Wall Street's winning streak reflects more than partisan ideology, lawyers say. The rulings, which often hinge on whether a regulator fully studied the costs of a rule, are also rooted in the court's philosophy to keep government watchdogs on a short leash.
"I think it's a court that sees one of its responsibilities as regulating how agencies discharge their duties," said Eugene Scalia, a prominent corporate lawyer who has defeated the S.E.C. four times before the Washington court.
Dodd-Frank is under attack from multiple directions. Congressional Republicans and banking lobbyists are picking apart the overhaul with some success, but the lawsuits present a greater threat.
Lobbyists can create the occasional loophole, but courts can halt new regulations and reshape the financial industry with one swing of the gavel.
Bracing for the worst, the S.E.C. and other regulators are scrambling to safeguard their rules. The cautious approach, which has delayed new regulation, raises questions about the government's ability to rein in banks four years after the financial crisis.
"The court has given tremendous power to business groups, causing the agencies to operate out of fear," said Harvey Goldschmid, a law professor at Columbia and a former S.E.C. commissioner. By virtue of its perch in Washington, the circuit court is seen as the second most important court in the country. It is akin to a farm system for the Supreme Court, producing four current justices, including the chief, John Roberts.
Though corporate groups routinely file lawsuits in the Washington circuit, this court was not always so business friendly. Under a landmark Supreme Court ruling, judges must defer to a government agency when its authority is ambiguous - so long as its approach is reasonable. But the Washington circuit court in recent years reversed nearly 23 percent of the rules it reviewed, up from 14 percent in the early 1980s. This year, the court overturned an air pollution rule and a crackdown on cigarette advertising.
The lawsuits against Wall Street regulation enjoy special advantages. For one, financial regulators are often facing off against Mr. Scalia, a seasoned litigator at Gibson Dunn and the son of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Gibson Dunn often represents the United States Chamber of Commerce, which defeated the S.E.C.'s proxy access plan and twice persuaded the court to knock down a mutual fund rule.
The rulings also coincided with a conservative makeover of the court. Of the court's 13 members, nine are Republican presidential appointees. George W. Bush selected four judges, including Brett Kavanaugh, who advised Mr. Bush on the 2000 election recount in Florida. The court has three vacancies, but none of President Obama's picks have received Congressional approval.
"There's very little true resistance to the conservative power of the court," said Thomas C. Goldstein, a partner at Goldstein & Russell and the founder of Scotusblog, a Web site dedicated to the Supreme Court.
But the court's decisions, Mr. Goldstein said, stem only in part from partisan ideology. The circuit has overturned the S.E.C. six times in seven years, including in the proxy access case. In all but one instance, the court was tossing aside a Bush administration rule. The cases were unanimous decisions, with the court's liberal bloc siding with conservatives each time.
The decisions reflect the collegial dynamic among the judges. The court became deeply polarized in the 1980s, but under Harry T. Edwards, a Democratic appointee who became chief judge in 1994, peace became a priority.
It began with Judge Edwards sending handmade birthday cards to fellow jurists. The good will then spilled into their work. The court rarely reconsiders cases en banc anymore, a somewhat contentious procedure in which the entire court will gather to second-guess a ruling of a three-judge panel.
"I felt we were becoming a broken court, and I wanted to bring us together on a professional and personal level," Judge Edwards, who now sits as a senior judge, said in an interview. "It became a matter of great pride."
The court also regards itself as an expert check on regulatory power. While Washington circuit receives a smaller number of cases than most appeals courts, its complex workload requires judges to review the minutiae of administrative rules.
"You don't want to deny the agency the right to be wrong on occasion," Judge Edwards said. "But when it goes too far, we're supposed to tell them to do it right."
Dodd-Frank is particularly vulnerable. After the success of the proxy case, Wall Street groups twice sued the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in cases likely destined for the appellate court's docket. The industry is now weighing another potential lawsuit against the Volcker Rule, a still-uncompleted plan to stop banks from trading with their own money.
"It's common-sense litigation 101," said Paul Clement, the former solicitor general under President Bush who is now a partner at Bancroft P.L.L.C. "If you keep winning, you keep going back."
Rather than attack a rule on the merits or constitutionality, Wall Street is building lawsuits around the costs a rule will impose on the economy.
The challenges are largely rooted in a 1996 law that requires the S.E.C. to examine the effect of a new rule upon "efficiency, competition and capital formation." The S.E.C. is merely required to "consider" the costs, not write a formal study.
The strategy has worked. In the proxy case, the court ruled that the S.E.C.'s policy "failed adequately to consider" its economic effects, even though the agency drafted a roughly 60-page cost-benefit analysis.
Proponents of regulation fear that the court created an impossible standard. In a 2012 report, the advocacy group Better Markets noted that the S.E.C.'s "pre-eminent duty" is to "protect investors." The group also argued that the S.E.C.'s cost-benefit analyses should account for the cost of government bailouts that might result from lax regulation.
For its part, the S.E.C. has hired additional economists to scrutinize rules and published guidelines for evaluating regulations. "The S.E.C. is finally starting to figure it out," said Michael Livermore, executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University Law School. "The new approach just might save Dodd-Frank."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Scandals Fill Lawyers' Pockets

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The white-collar bar is thriving with cases like the collapse of MF Global and the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate. 

 BODY:
As Wall Street has faced a string of scandals, bank executives, investors and customers have suffered. But one group is thriving: lawyers.
Called upon to navigate crisis after crisis, the white-collar bar is having a banner year with cases like the collapse of the futures brokerage firm MF Global, a multibillion-dollar trading blunder at JPMorgan Chase and suspicions of money laundering at HSBC.
The global investigation into the manipulation of a crucial benchmark interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate has emerged as the most profitable for the legal profession.
 While many of the recent scandals have been relatively isolated, the scope of the rate-rigging scandal has been vast, encompassing 16 banks. More than 10 government authorities around the world are looking into whether the banks conspired to fix the interest rates, potentially affecting trillions of dollars of financial products like mortgages and student loans.
The investigation is still in its early days, but experts say it is likely to drag on for years. Authorities could arrest traders this year, and more cases against big banks are expected. Earlier this year, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had reported false rates.
Every major bank under investigation has hired a major law firm to represent it. An army of white-collar defense lawyers has been assembled to defend individuals. Plaintiffs' lawyers have filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the big banks, claiming damages on behalf of institutions, pensions and municipalities like the City of Baltimore.
"This is looking like a full employment act for the corporate bar," said Samuel W. Buell, a professor at Duke Law School. "It's very hard to see how you draw a tight circle around this issue."
Over the last few decades, white-collar law has transformed from a boutique business into a major focus for the biggest law firms. As firms expand globally and the federal government makes corporate prosecutions a higher priority, the practice has become a profit center.
Companies do not like to scrimp with civil and criminal cases. The stakes are too high.
In the last decade, a number of major cases have engulfed corporate America - and by extension, white-collar lawyers. The stock options backdating scandal, which emerged in 2006, swept up more than 100 companies and many executives. The cases provided much work for lawyers, including internal investigations at major companies and notable criminal defense efforts. A few years earlier, accounting scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom generated similarly handsome legal fees.
Not all white-collar crackdowns are the same. Consider the federal government's insider-trading cases. The charges affect a handful of people and do not require the machinery of an entire legal institution. One former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations had been private said that defense lawyers jokingly complained that the hedge funds and other traders affected by the investigation tended to be low-margin clients.
With the interest-rate-fixing case, law firms started seeing the dividends in 2008. When the investigation got under way, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the American regulator, asked a handful of major banks to conduct internal inquiries. The goal was to figure out the extent of potential manipulation, focusing on a crucial benchmark known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
At the time, the banks hired outside counsel to review the e-mails and documents as well as to conduct interviews. Barclays, the hardest-hit institution to date, hired Sullivan & Cromwell, which is led by H. Rodgin Cohen. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison is representing both Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.
The firms put dozens of top lawyers to work unearthing the worst of what had transpired, then gave their findings to regulators. Those reports form the backbone of the cases against the banks.
In the midst of the internal investigations, banks began identifying individuals who may have improperly tried to influence interest rates. Those employees are entitled to counsel, paid for by the banks. The bank's law firm will usually refer the individuals to other white-collar lawyers, since the interests of the banks and the employees may differ. Despite the effort to reduce conflicts, the referrals can be problematic because the banks are paying the bills.
"Sometimes you may be best served by going with a lawyer who has established relationships with the people who represent the company," said Charles D. Weisselberg, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and co-author of a recent study examining white-collar practices at major law firms. "Or sometimes you may want someone more independent of the company lawyers who may not be looking to them for a referral in the future."
The referral system has been big business in the Libor case.
Dozens of individuals have hired lawyers, according to interviews with lawyers. Andrew J. Levander, the Dechert lawyer who represents former Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey in the MF Global matter, has been retained by Robert E. Diamond Jr., a former Barclays chief executive. Ira Lee Sorkin, who represented the Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard L. Madoff, has been retained by a former trader at Barclays.
The most damaging aspects of the case could be traders' efforts to manipulate the index to squeeze more money from clients. After one exchange, a rate submitter at Barclays told a trader, "Always happy to help. Leave it with me, sir," according to regulatory documents. Another responded, "Done ... for you big boy."
"The tenor of the exchanges reflects a relentless indifference to the rights and interests of their clients," said Michael Hausfeld, a plaintiff's lawyer in the Libor case. He said it could take a long time to sift through the evidence. "There are a lot of nuances here that still have to be studied, but it's clear there was widespread disruption caused in the market."
