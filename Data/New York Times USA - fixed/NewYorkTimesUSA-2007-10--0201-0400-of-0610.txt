HEADLINE: A 6-HOUR STRIKE BY AUTO WORKERS AGAINST CHRYSLER

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Auburn Hills, Mich., and Mary M. Chapman from Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
A new expression is making the rounds here in the nation's automotive capital: ''Hollywood strike,'' as in, ''just for show.''
 That saying is likely to gain currency after the United Automobile Workers reached a tentative agreement Wednesday with Chrysler, only six hours after union leaders sent Chrysler's 45,000 workers to the picket lines. 
 Just last month, the U.A.W. struck General Motors and settled two days later, despite the union's declaring at the outset of the strike that the two sides were far apart on fundamental issues.
 The brief walkouts appear to have emerged as a way for both union leaders and company managers, at a time of deep troubles in their industry, to prove to their constituents that they got the best deal they could under the circumstances, without the damage of an all-out war. 
 Given the industry's financial woes, neither side can afford a drawn-out battle. ''It isn't the time to have a life-or-death struggle,'' said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 In the G.M. settlement, both sides made concessions and claimed victory. The U.A.W. won job guarantees for its members, for example, while G.M. was able to offload its enormous health care liability into a separate trust. 
 Full details of the Chrysler agreement were not immediately available, but it was expected to echo the G.M. contract. 
 The likely duration of the strike at Chrysler was particularly uncertain because of its new owner: Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm that bought the company this year and vowed to make it operate more flexibly. 
 Such short national walkouts are an unusual tactic in the auto industry. Historically, strikes have lasted for months, inflicting deep financial pain on both workers and their companies. Both sides could dig in, when the industry was relatively healthy.
 In 1998, for example, G.M. workers went on strike in Flint, Mich., for seven weeks in a walkout that crippled production nationwide and cost G.M. market share that it never recovered. And in 1950, Chrysler workers were off the job for 104 days in a dispute over pension benefits.
 On Wednesday, by contrast, it was possible for a worker to march in the picket line at lunch and hear about the settlement on the evening news.
 Rod Hartsfield, 46, a union steward at Chrysler's stamping plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., said Wednesday night that he was glad to be headed back to work. ''A long, drawn-out strike doesn't help anybody,'' he said.
 The Chrysler strike did not have the impact it might have had last week, before the company announced layoffs at five factories. As a result, about 12,000 workers, or more than a quarter of Chrysler union members, did not take part in the strike, because their plants were temporarily closed to adjust inventories of unsold cars and trucks. 
 The union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, described the settlement as a victory. ''This agreement was made possible because U.A.W. workers made it clear to Chrysler that we needed an agreement that rewards the contributions they have made to the success of this company,'' he said in a statement.
 But Mr. Gettelfinger had limited options, given the billions of dollars in losses and thousands of jobs cut by Detroit automakers in recent years. 
 ''He has such a weak hand to play,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, author of ''The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit,'' a 1995 biography of Walter Reuther, the union's legendary president. ''Frankly, I'm not sure he could do otherwise, considering the circumstance.''
 From Mr. Gettelfinger's perspective, the strike sent ''a signal to the Cerberus new management that he expects a fair relationship and that he wouldn't be afraid to go out,'' said David L. Gregory, a labor relations expert at the St. John's University School of Law in New York. 
 But some workers questioned whether the two sides were as far apart as a strike suggests. ''I think what he's doing with these strikes is kind of suspicious,'' Paul Wohlfarth, a 30-year Chrysler veteran who works at a Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, said of Mr. Gettelfinger. The short strikes could be meant to make workers ''think that this deal was the best he could get,'' he added.
 G.M. workers approved their agreement Wednesday, the union said in a separate statement. Among production workers, the tally was 66 percent in favor, while 64 percent of the skilled trades workers voted for the contract. 
 With talks complete at Chrysler, the union will next go to Ford Motor, which will be under pressure to match the terms of the other two agreements. But Ford is considered to be the weakest of the three Detroit companies, and it has not finished listing all the plants it plans to shut under a restructuring plan called The Way Forward. While officials support a health care trust, they, like officials at Chrysler, could balk at providing job guarantees.
 Chrysler officials said their agreement included a memorandum of understanding to create a health care trust, similar to the one at G.M. Such a trust would assume Chrysler's $18 billion liability for medical benefits for current and retired workers and their families.
 ''The national agreement is consistent with the economic pattern and balances the needs of our employees and company by providing a framework to improve our long-term manufacturing competitiveness,'' Chrysler's co-president, Thomas W. LaSorda, said in a statement.
 The G.M. contract created a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA, to take over G.M.'s $55 billion liability for health care benefits. G.M. agreed to invest $29.9 billion to start the trust. If Chrysler invests an equivalent amount, based on its relative size, it would total about $10 billion.
 As it did at G.M., the U.A.W. said it was recessing the strike, and it told workers to report for their next shift. Union leaders will get a look at the details later this week, and they must approve it before a ratification vote is scheduled.
 Workers at Chrysler began leaving plants shortly before 11 a.m. Eastern time, a deadline set by the union over the weekend when talks moved slowly.
 The union had told workers to begin walking off the job unless they were instructed otherwise. They would have received strike pay of $200 a week, about one-fourth their normal take-home pay.
 Since the strike was so short, workers are unlikely to tap the fund, which stands well above $800 million and could have financed a walkout at Chrysler for months.
 There had not been a major strike at Chrysler since 1985, when 80,000 North American workers walked off the job for 12 days.
 Cerberus Capital Management, which bought 80.1 percent of Chrysler on Aug. 3 from its former German parent, DaimlerChrysler, for $7.4 billion, appeared willing to withstand a walkout. In particular, Chrysler was reluctant to make a commitment to the number of new products that would be built in American plants and to guarantee how many jobs would remain at the company, which is in the midst of a restructuring program.
 Chrysler officials were said to be seeking flexibility to import vehicles from outside the United States, to take advantage of cheaper labor costs. Chrysler is set to begin selling Chinese-built small cars at the end of the decade, making it the first American company to use China as an export source for the United States.
 Company officials were ''weighing the cost of a strike versus the cost after a strike,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 For some Chrysler workers, the strike was worthwhile, even if it was brief.
 ''A line has to be drawn,'' said Tim Kahanak, 53, who walked a picket line outside Chrysler's metal stamping plant in Warren, Mich. ''The companies are cutting back, and somebody's got to start fighting,''
 Mr. Kahanak, who is pursuing a degree in labor studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, said he supported the U.A.W. but shared some members' concern that union leaders had given too much help to the struggling companies. ''We've cooperated ourselves out of a lot of jobs,'' he said.

HEADLINE: City's Virtues to Be Sold in New Global Ad Campaign

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City has historically relied on its own magnetism to draw visitors from around the country and the world. But now, the home of Madison Avenue is going to try advertising itself in a big, broad way.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled the city's first global advertising campaign yesterday in Times Square. The campaign, which carries the theme ''This is New York City,'' includes a television ad that will be the first to promote the city to potential visitors who live overseas.
 It is the latest weapon aimed at hitting the mayor's target of increasing the number of visitors to 50 million a year by 2015. Last year, the city drew 43.8 million visitors, more than in any previous year, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism promotion agency. 
 To reach that goal, NYC & Company plans to place billboards in cities across America and Europe and to broadcast its new commercial in Britain, Ireland and Spain, on local TV stations in Philadelphia and Boston, and on the History Channel.
 George Fertitta, the chief executive of NYC & Company, said the ad placements would be worth about $30 million, but would cost the agency less than $5 million in cash because many of them were arranged through trades. 
 The city's contract with Cemusa, a provider of bus shelters and other structures, gives it hundreds of billboards that it can swap for advertising space on the streets of several European cities. Much of the money for the campaign is coming from the city budget.
 When he set his tourism target a couple of years ago, Mr. Bloomberg pledged to increase spending on tourism promotion by $15 million a year. Historically, NYC & Company received most of its funds from hotel operators and other companies in the travel and tourism industries. The agency organized promotions but had never created a comprehensive campaign on a par with New York State's long-running ''I Love New York'' ads.
 Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that it was time to recognize how important tourism is to the city's economy and to try to increase it at a time when a weak dollar is making the city more affordable to foreigners.
 ''People are shocked to find that what they thought was a very expensive city isn't all that expensive,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city was competing for tourist dollars against other destinations, like Las Vegas, that spend far more. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has an annual marketing budget of $127 million, about $86 million of which goes toward advertising around the world, according to Vince Alberta, a spokesman for the authority. 
 Las Vegas, which uses the slogan ''What happens here stays here,'' also has a big goal. It hopes to attract 43 million visitors annually by the end of the decade, Mr. Alberta said.
 In contrast to Las Vegas's attractions, what New York has to offer is more difficult to summarize, city officials said. Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, recounted the difficulty that the writer E. B. White had in defining the city in his 1949 essay ''Here is New York.''
 White called it a ''concentrate of art and commerce and sport and religion and entertainment and finance.'' But Mr. Doctoroff said, ''How do you turn that into a marketing campaign?''
 He said the officials decided that in order ''to get at New York's core, you simply have to let New York speak for itself.'' So the theme of the ads is simply ''This is New York City,'' and the ads combine images of the city like the Statue of Liberty, Yankee Stadium and the Brooklyn Bridge with animated symbols meant to spark a viewer's imagination. 
 ''This is targeted to the excitement of New York City,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It's a lot more upbeat than just 'I Love New York.'''
 Mr. Fertitta of NYC & Company said the ads were intended to ''allow people to see the extraordinary abundance'' of the city. ''We don't need to come up with a real slogan that's designed to convince somebody of something.''
 The TV ad is set to a remix of Ella Fitzgerald's rendition of ''Take the A Train.'' The music and the animation were intended to ''have you feel it yourself,'' said Kevin Roddy, the executive creative director of BBH, the agency that made the ads. ''New York is such an active city,'' Mr. Roddy said. ''We wanted to do advertising that did something.''

HEADLINE: Democrats and White House Split Over Mortgage Relief Plans

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
House Democrats squared off against the Bush administration yesterday over measures to help homeowners trapped in a vise of unaffordable subprime mortgages and falling home prices.
 The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill that would require the nation's two government-sponsored mortgage finance companies and the Federal Housing Administration's insurance program to channel up to $900 million a year into a new fund for affordable housing.
 The White House quickly threatened to veto the bill, saying that it would ''increase spending and disrupt the appropriations process.'' The showdown is still hypothetical, because Senate Democrats have not drafted a comparable bill. 
 The Bush administration, meanwhile, announced a new alliance of mortgage companies and nonprofit counseling groups that would try to help homeowners switch out of expensive subprime loans before they fall behind on payments and lose their houses.
 The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said that the group, which includes 11 of the nation's biggest mortgage servicing companies, had developed ''an aggressive plan'' to help borrowers find cheaper fixed-rate mortgages.
 Administration officials and many housing experts contend that a large number of people who took out expensive subprime mortgages, which can carry interest rates above 10 percent, may have credit good enough to qualify for more traditional loans. 
 About two million people bought homes with subprime loans that offered low introductory monthly payments; those payments are set to jump sharply over the next 18 months as the initial teaser rates expire. 
 Administration officials offered no details on what new terms mortgage lenders might be willing to offer borrowers who cannot qualify for conventional loans.
 And some industry experts said the initiative would not untangle the biggest obstacle to renegotiating mortgages -- the fact that most subprime loans have been packaged into complex securities and sold to investors around the world. 
 ''I think this is a good program to the extent that it works,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business School. ''However, there is a certain political/P.R. element to this program and this announcement, in that lenders and borrowers should always be doing this, with or without government involvement.''
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he supported Mr. Paulson's effort. But Mr. Frank would go much further than the White House. He was the primary author of the bill to provide a new affordable housing fund, which the White House opposes. 
 He has also proposed other measures, which the administration opposes even more fiercely, that would change bankruptcy laws to give mortgage borrowers more bargaining power with lenders.
 A survey by Moody's Investors Service last month indicated that mortgage service companies modified only 1 percent of all mortgages with expiring teaser rates last year.
 Delinquency and foreclosure rates on subprime loans have doubled in the last year, and industry analysts say most of those borrowers ran into trouble before the initial teaser rates expired.
 The problems are expected to get much more severe in the months ahead, because housing prices and home sales are falling in most parts of the country.
 Falling home prices mean a growing number of people have mortgages that are bigger than the value of their homes. And plunging home sales mean that homeowners face much greater difficulty selling their homes for enough money to repay their debt.
 Many subprime borrowers had avoided problems in recent years by getting new loans with new teaser rates. But that option all but disappeared this summer after investors began to panic about soaring default rates.
 Alphonso Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, predicted last month that 500,000 homes could end up in foreclosure in the next year or so. But some analysts on Wall Street warned that the number could be much higher.

HEADLINE: Monks And China Rising

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Seldom has a country's rise been as smooth as China's in recent years. Bush-bashing has left the world with scant surplus indignation to devote to Beijing's backing for many of the planet's ugliest regimes, including those in Sudan, Zimbabwe, Iran and Cuba.
 Talk of ''harmony'' -- the buzzword favored by President Hu Jintao -- and ''no strings attached'' assistance has been the camouflage for China's readiness to get in bed with thugs from central casting who can provide the oil, gas and raw materials that fuel the furious growth critical to preserving one-party rule. 
 Hu's harmony is mostly hogwash. But who cares? The global thirst for China's business, and for alternative power centers to Washington, has given the slogan a free ride.
 China is not in the business of exporting war, development models or moral and political blueprints. It wants stability for its upward glide. Democracy comes in a distant second to growth, if at all. The tarnishing of the ''D-word'' in Iraq has suited China fine.
 What suits China less is saffron-robed Buddhist monks in neighboring Myanmar -- the former Burma -- confronting the guns of a military junta that began its rule in 1988 with the massacre of 3,000 protesters and has not wavered in its corrupt brutality since.
 The Burmese troubles are troubling to China for several reasons. They are on its doorstep. They come in a country transformed in recent years into a virtual client state, where the Chinese are building roads, burning forests, backing gas projects and dreaming of long-coveted access to the Indian Ocean.
 Worst of all for Beijing, the unrest presents about as clear a picture of good versus evil as exists outside fairy tales. There's little to debate in young monks being gunned down and everything to deplore. For a Buddhist, killing monks is like killing kin. Nine months from the Beijing Olympics, that's bad.
 So the Chinese have been writhing. Not to the point of supporting United Nations Security Council action against Burmese barbarity -- the official view is that ''pressure would not serve any purpose'' -- but to the point of gestures suggestive of some discomfort.
 These have included facilitating the work of the U.N. special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari. He's been instrumental in opening new avenues between the military and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning opposition leader who has long been under house arrest.
 China has also offered guarded statements about supporting ''stability, reconciliation, democracy and development of Myanmar.''
 Democracy? Well, up to a point. View all this as the minimum China thinks it can get away with on the last pre-Olympic lap. Stability, as ever, is the key word; ''democracy'' is a sop. Still, the Chinese may be ready to hedge their Burmese bets.
 The junta's leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, is 74; nobody's immortal. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is part, is reviewing a new charter that obliges member countries to ''strengthen democracy.''
 The Burmese military is increasingly isolated in a region where the Indonesian transition from military rule has given the lie to generals who say their rule is indivisible from national survival.
 That said, Myanmar is a weak state where the danger of fragmentation is real. Insurgencies and drug warlord militias could easily fill a vacuum. ''The country presents a democracy challenge, but also a failed state challenge,'' says Thant Myint-U, a historian.
 In North Korea, another Asian country that reeks of failure, China and the United States have united to push Pyongyang out the nuclear business. But it was precisely the nukes that concentrated Chinese minds: nobody in Beijing wanted the militarist wing in Japan emboldened by Kim Jong-il's folly.
 Burmese folly lacks such a galvanizing threat. It does, however, present a unique opportunity for a great power, the United States, and two emergent great powers, India and China, to press for a rapid end to the junta's rule.
 Myanmar is a buffer state between India and China; both have major economic interests there and fear turmoil. India has already called for ''political reform.''
 I don't think Olympic boycotts work; nor do I think a breakdown in Chinese-American relations serves anyone. But fierce criticism by Mia Farrow of Chinese complicity in Darfur atrocities through support for Sudan produced modest movement. The nine months to the Olympics present a unique opportunity to shame China into shepherding Burmese reform, beginning with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.
 It's time to call ''harmony'' to task. Monk-murder in a client state is no advertisement for China rising. India and China need political ideas to frame the economic rise of Asia: the sanctity of monk power is not a bad place to start.

HEADLINE: Talks Sought For Airlines To Address Congestion

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Trying to untangle New York's skies, Senator Charles E. Schumer will call on the Transportation Department on Thursday to convene a meeting of airlines to coordinate schedule cuts and renegotiate its agreements with the Pentagon about civilian use of offshore military airspace. 
 Mary E. Peters, the transportation secretary, said on Sept. 27 after a meeting with President Bush that she would hold such a meeting, which airlines have long sought, but no session had yet been announced. A spokesman said Wednesday that the Transportation Department was completing the paperwork needed to hold the meeting. 
 Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said that flight delays, which reached record levels this summer, were more than an annoyance and threatened the New York economy. They will grow worse, he said, as the United States and the European Union put into effect an ''open skies'' agreement that will leave more carriers free to schedule more flights to Kennedy International.
 ''This is low-hanging fruit,'' Mr. Schumer said in a telephone interview, referring to a meeting of airlines on scheduling issues. ''It's a mystery why they're not doing this, given how bad things are.'''
 JetBlue, which is based at Kennedy, sent a letter to the Federal Aviation Adminstration in the spring requesting such a meeting. On Wednesday, Bryan Baldwin, a spokesman for the airline, said, ''What we really need is to have a venue where the airlines can come together and talk about schedules with antitrust immunity.'' Cutting traffic from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. would help, he said. 
 The F.A.A. has convened an advisory committee, including executives of the airlines and officials of airports and consumer groups. The committee, which has 40 to 50 members, has met twice and is supposed to submit recommendations by the end of the year. 
 Schedule reductions, whether achieved by negotiations or by government order, should be concluded by early next year if they are to be effective by the peak summer travel season, said Brian Turmail, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. Otherwise, he said, airlines might risk canceling flights that passengers had already booked. 
 Mr. Turmail said the Transportation Department preferred a negotiated solution rather than the ''blunt instrument'' government order. The problem at Kennedy, he added, ''isn't an anomaly, it's a preview.'' Other airports will face the same situation as air travel increases, he said.
 His department wanted to vary landing fees according to hour of the day, and Mr. Turmail said it already had limited authority to do that as long as the total income from the fees did not change. He said the advisory committee would consider a variety of options, including sharply higher landing fees at peak hours and paying planes to land at off-peak hours. Generally, however, airlines do not like variable landing fees.
 The military-use areas over the Atlantic are open to civilian traffic many hours of the day, but Mr. Schumer said these were mostly used for trans-Atlantic traffic and were not available for north-south domestic traffic. 
 At the Pentagon, Gerald F. Pease Jr., executive director of the Department of Defense Policy Board on Federal Aviation, said that the Pentagon and the F.A.A. already worked together to share the offshore airspace, and that the Pentagon had officers at the F.A.A.'s strategic air traffic command center in Herndon, Va. 
 The Defense Department, he said, will work with the F.A.A. ''to get all the efficiency we can out of this resource.''

HEADLINE: Governor Sets His Sights On Revitalizing Buffalo

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer outlined roughly $850 million of economic development initiatives on Wednesday aimed at revitalizing Buffalo and Niagara Falls, including a plan to redevelop the Buffalo waterfront, which will have a nearly 200,000- square-foot sporting goods store built to resemble an old Erie Canal wharf terminal in the historic inner harbor.
 The plans, many of which have been considered in various forms for years, were announced in the first of a series of speeches the governor plans to deliver in the coming weeks to detail his strategy for reviving cities in various parts of the state. 
 The degree to which the governor can follow through on his agenda will depend on winning financial support in the Legislature, where he is enmeshed in a bitter feud with Senate Republicans that has waylaid much state business. The deals he discussed on Wednesday will use a combination of state, federal and private money -- both cash and debt -- with much of the needed state funds already agreed upon and allocated. 
 Perhaps a more fundamental challenge, beyond politics, is that Buffalo is one of the poorest cities in the country, and its problems reflect a deep decline in manufacturing that will be difficult to overcome. Further, the state will have less money to spend next year: The governor's budget division expects revenue to slump amid weakening profits on Wall Street. 
 The governor outlined three initiatives for Buffalo in his speech, which was delivered here on Wednesday. They included a development deal to turn a vacant building on Delaware Avenue, where more than 2,000 federal employees once worked, into a complex with a hotel, offices and condominium apartments.
 He also unveiled the latest plan to redevelop Buffalo's waterfront. A deal years in the making to bring a large Bass Pro Shop store to the inner harbor, where the Erie Canal once met the Great Lakes, appears certain. The redevelopment also includes a 500,000-square-foot complex of buildings in the inner harbor that will be used for a variety of purposes, also including condominiums and office space.
 The governor also pledged that within two years work should begin on a long delayed expansion of the Peace Bridge, a major thoroughfare for commerce between the United States and Canada. And Mr. Spitzer outlined a plan to redevelop a pedestrian mall in Niagara Falls as part of an effort to make the city more appealing to the millions of tourists who cross the border each year.
 ''Since 1990, upstate's population has grown slower than all but two states,'' the governor said, according to a prepared text of his speech. ''During that time, the population right here in Buffalo has actually declined by 14 percent. For the first time, a generation of upstate New Yorkers has had less economic opportunity than their parents -- and many have been forced to leave for opportunity elsewhere.''
 Mr. Spitzer said his strategy was to create what he called ''regional blueprints'' for different parts of the state rather than a unified strategy. He said that previous strategies had used ''a 'one size fits all' approach'' that ''did not recognize the fact that upstate is not one economy, but many diverse economies.''
 Republicans have long said that the governor has not moved quickly enough to put together a comprehensive plan to boost the sagging upstate economy. At the same time, they have prevented the governor from installing some important aides. His top upstate economic adviser, Daniel Gundersen, is one of scores of nominees that have been held up in the Senate for several months.
 John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called the projects announced by the governor retreads of previously announced deals.
 ''I'm glad to see he is living up to commitments made years ago under previous administrations,'' he said. ''What's new?'' he added. ''Where are the new projects and initiatives that we have been attempting to get done in Buffalo?''
 Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for Mr. Spitzer, said Mr. McArdle was ''absolutely correct'' in saying ''many of these ideas have been around for some time.''
 ''The difference is that this governor is providing the leadership to make them a reality,'' he said. 
 Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist who has studied Buffalo's problems, said politicians, generally speaking, were focused on the wrong priorities by pouring money into infrastructure instead of education.
 ''It's crazy to think you can solve the problems of declining cities by building lots of infrastructure,'' he said. ''While all of the colder, older cities in America looked troubled 30 years ago, the turnaround of some cities has been sharply linked to high levels of human capital, or a higher share of the population having college degrees, and in Buffalo today, one in five of its residents has a college degree as opposed to 27 percent for the U.S. as a whole.''
 He added, ''Think about what you could do for the kids of Buffalo with this money.''

HEADLINE: Zoellick Defends Aid for Nations in 'Middle'

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 

 BODY:
Robert B. Zoellick, the new president of the World Bank, said Wednesday that the bank's help for the poorest countries should be coupled with expanded aid to China and other ''middle income'' nations coping with problems resulting from their fast-growing economies.
 In the first speech outlining his priorities for the bank since he became its president in the summer, Mr. Zoellick sought to rebut critics who say that the bank should stop helping China, India, Brazil and other countries that can tap capital markets and even carry out foreign aid programs on their own. 
 Indeed, in response to that criticism, the bank has lent less money to these countries in recent years.
 But Mr. Zoellick said that 70 percent of the world's poor live in countries that are prospering over all and that aid was needed to help them deal with environmental damage, energy shortages and other internal problems that breed instability. These countries also need more sophisticated capital markets, he said. 
 ''It would be ironic indeed for the Bank Group to withdraw from work with middle-income countries at a time that governments are recognizing the need to integrate these countries more effectively in diplomacy and political-security institutions,'' Mr. Zoellick said, referring to the separate entities of the World Bank.
 ''Why not integrate them as partners in the institutions of the multilateral economy, too?'' Mr. Zoellick asked in his speech to the National Press Club, adding that lending to these countries ''should be growing, not contracting.'' 
 Mr. Zoellick took office in July following the stormy two-year tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary who was ousted from the bank presidency after accusations that he behaved unethically. 
 This month, the world's finance ministers will arrive in Washington for their semiannual meetings under the auspices of the bank and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund -- a debut, of sorts, for Mr. Zoellick, a former top trade envoy and deputy secretary of state.
 Some bank executives and officials from development ministries say the new president has been less than clear in outlining his priorities. Many are reluctant to contribute to the bank's efforts for the poorest countries without knowing more of his thinking.
 Mr. Zoellick, however, has told aides that he does not want to focus too much energy on long documents, regarding them as Soviet-style bureaucratic planning. 
 Instead, his speech on Wednesday listed six priorities. In addition to helping middle-income countries, they include attacking poverty; helping countries torn by war; fostering regional cooperation to combat disease and climate change; aiding the Arab world; and providing technical assistance to guide development.
 Though Mr. Zoellick made the most news in calling for help for middle-income countries, he noted that a big challenge would be to raise money from donor nations over the next three years for the 81 poorest countries, defined as those with per capita income of roughly less than $1,000.
 The bank has set a target of raising close to $40 billion for these countries, but some bank officials say it may have to scale back to something closer to $30 billion because many donor countries, especially in Europe, are circumventing the bank to set up their own funds to aid the poor.
 Mr. Zoellick said he hoped to persuade donor nations to contribute by tapping the bank's own resources for the poor -- namely, by siphoning income from the repayment of loans to middle-income countries like China and India. He recently won approval of the bank board for this strategy.
 As a result, the bank will contribute $3.5 billion from its own income to aid the poorest countries, which generally get loans with little or no interest. This sum is more than double what the bank itself contributed to the last round of aid for the poor.
 The bank, Mr. Zoellick said, was stretching its own resources. ''We urge others to stretch, too,'' he said.

HEADLINE: After Years of Being Out, The Necktie Is In

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
GEORGE McCRACKEN doesn't have to wear a tie. A 25-year-old painter in Manhattan who works in store design and display to pay the bills, Mr. McCracken is a member of that lucky group who can wear just about anything they please to work.
 But George McCracken does wear a tie. ''I don't ever wear a collared shirt without one,'' he said. ''It started when I had a job where I had to wear a jacket and tie, but after I left, I started wearing it anyway, out with friends, as an informal thing. It just felt comfortable.''
 And Mr. McCracken is not alone. Check out any art gallery, advertising agency or downtown bar where the cool kids hang. Look at Justin Timberlake, Adam Brody, Elijah Wood or any other young actor who presumably is not also holding down a desk job. 
 Necktie sales may have foundered in the decade or more since the words ''casual Friday'' entered men's vocabularies, but in the last year or two, stylish men in their 20s and early 30s have embraced the old four-in-hand as a style statement -- that is, as long as it is an optional one. Even with tie sales among older age groups uniformly down, sales to men 18 to 34 were up more than 13 percent, to $343 million from $303 million, between March 2006 and March 2007, according to NPD Group, which tracks clothing sales and trends.
 ''There's no question that there has been a dramatic increase among younger guys, who are age 18 to 34, expressing themselves by dressing up,'' said Marshal Cohen, the chief retail analyst at NPD. ''He's not hesitating, given the option, to grab a tie, and a fancy tie at that.''
 This is a news flash that will either amuse or dismay men in their 40s and 50s, who after years of wearing a tie to work, finally won the right to hang up the old choke chain. 
 But this is no ordinary necktie. A far cry from the storied ''power ties'' in aggressively colored and printed silk twill that defined the power corridors of the 1980s, the defiantly low-key tie of today is destined for dress-up Thursday as well as casual Friday.
 It may be made of wool, cashmere, silk knit or glove leather; cut a pointedly skinny two-and-a-half inches wide; woven in plaid or printed with an unorthodox pattern of skulls with bunny ears. It may boast a trendy label like Alexander Olch or Band of Outsiders. Slightly offbeat in a laid-back way -- the Wes Anderson of the accessory world -- the youthful tie is giving the old dress code a much-needed shot in the neck.
 ''It's a uniform that doesn't look like a uniform,'' said Daniel Pipski, 31, a senior vice president at LivePlanet, the Los Angeles production company whose founders include Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. In Hollywood, where the open-collar dress shirt is king, the necktie is largely held to be a benighted relic of East Coast business style. But that has not deterred Mr. Pipski, who sees the tie as a kind of style passkey, especially the slender wool 1950s-style ties created by the Los Angeles label Band of Outsiders. (He owns about 60 of them.) To him, ties manage to be both a bit of self-expression and a concession to business dress. 
 ''Wearing a tie is a kind of style,'' he said. ''It's a thing you're doing. It's seen as 'creative.' So you can go from meetings with the creative side and then go meet the head of a studio.''
 Labeling these ties creative may seem odd considering how restrained they are compared with the wincingly gimmicky ''creative'' ties of the mid-1990s, which were decked out with cartoon characters, beer logos and the like. Lighthearted as they were, they did little to keep the necktie close to any man's heart. 
 Then the combination of casual Friday and the dot-com explosion appeared to condemn the necktie to the style gallows. The number of ties sold in the United States, which reached a peak of 110 million in the early 1990s, fell to 60 million in 2001, according to Gerald Andersen, the director of the Men's Dress Furnishings Association (which until 2001 was called the Neckwear Association of America). The change of name, and focus, makes some sense: NPD reports that for the year ending March 2007, tie sales were down to 44 million. 
 The tie's renaissance among the hipster set had its roots in fashion, sparked by designers like Thom Browne and Hedi Slimane, who made it a part of their collections. It was not long before bands like the Strokes were casting off that late-1990s frayed indie-rock look for sharp black suits and matching skinny ties. In keeping with the trend, sportswear lines like Theory and Club Monaco now offer ties, a break from the casual ethos on which they were founded.
 Tie sales have definitely edged up at Bloomingdale's, and Kevin Harter, the men's wear director, credits the increase to younger men. ''They're using them as fashion statements, with suits or with jeans,'' he said. He added that he now displays ties with denim and sportswear instead of just in the tie department.
 At Saks Fifth Avenue, sales have increased in the low double digits in the last year, said Michael Macko, the men's fashion director, who similarly attributes the rise to the young men buying ties from the likes of Alexander Olch or Jil Sander.
 Even a few men outside the 18-to-34-year-old demographic have taken a shine to the tie. ''It's been a while since I actually wanted to wear a tie,'' said Trey Laird, 43, the president of Laird + Partners, a New York advertising firm. ''But I've been feeling it myself as well as seeing it on a lot of the younger guys in the office. It wasn't any one thing that did it. You get bored of the same look, and as much as I like jeans and a blazer, it gets boring after a few years.''
 Or as Mr. McCracken, the painter, put it: ''Just like you could point to a time, like when Tom Ford was at Gucci, that it became uncool to wear a tie, now it just feels like wearing a tie is the more punk thing to do.''
 Indeed, with Mr. Ford up to his old chest-hair-baring tricks in the ad campaign for his new cologne, it does seem time for a new look. Would a necktie kill the guy?
 At least Mr. Ford, with his shirt unbuttoned down to the Netherlands, miraculously never suffers from the great blight that affects so many tieless men: collar wilt -- that is, its gradual collapse (or migration underneath the jacket collar) as the day wears on. Any man who derides the necktie as solely a decorative accessory would do well to remember that it serves an important function in holding a look together.
 It's too soon to tell if the tie will come back as a mandatory presence, or if its new allure will be transitory. But while it is a smart and easy way to look both cool and professional, there is at least one rub. 
 Sean Safford, 34, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, has rediscovered the tie's allure and has even mastered the Windsor knot. ''The problem is that all the dress shirts I got over the years to wear without ties don't really work with them,'' he said. ''Buying new shirts to go with the new ties gets expensive.''
 Welcome to the Fashion School of Economics, Mr. Safford.

HEADLINE: Calvin Coolidge Redux

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Fred Thompson did great in that debate! He stayed upright the whole time! And he knew the name of the prime minister of Canada! No question, this man is ready to lead.
 There the Republican presidential candidates were, debating in Michigan, the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. Its government is foundering in a sinkhole of disappearing revenues. Detroit is a shell of a once-great city. The good union jobs keep disappearing. The sense of betrayal, of loss and sadness, is everywhere.
 And there was Fred Thompson, first up to the plate, offering hope to these particularly beleaguered Americans: 
 ''I think there certainly are those in Michigan that are having difficulty. I think you always find that in a vibrant, dynamic economy. I think that not enough has been done to tell what some call the greatest story never told, and that is that we are enjoying a period of growth right now, and we should acknowledge what got us there and continue those same policies on into the future.''
 Thank you so much for coming to Michigan, Senator Thompson. Loved you in ''The Hunt for Red October.'' 
 When you watch a bunch of presidential candidates on a stage, you are almost invariably looking at a bunch of very rich people. Some of them were born into privilege, like Mitt Romney and John McCain. Some had privilege thrust upon them, like Rudy Giuliani, who parlayed his 9/11 moment into an extraordinarily lucrative public speaking career and consulting business. Thompson rose from humble roots thanks to friends and one well-connected ex-wife.
 Voters tend to admire wealth, and they certainly know that nobody gets to be a serious presidential candidate by picking a good mutual fund in a 401(k). They just want to be shown that despite all those chauffeurs, private planes, secretaries, housekeepers, nannies and personal assistants, you still understand what regular folks' lives are like. Fail, and you wind up John Kerry.
 But at least the Democrats who nominated Kerry did not imagine that they were choosing him for his down-home personality. What exactly is the point of Fred Thompson? He once got elected to the Senate by driving around Tennessee in a red truck (which, critics carped, he ditched as soon as he was out of sight of the last voter). 
 He persuaded people that his opponent was wrong when he claimed Thompson was nothing but a ''Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon-spreading millionaire Washington special interest lobbyist.'' Of course, that was some time ago, and things have changed. Thompson is now a Gucci-wearing, Lincoln-driving, Perrier-drinking, Grey Poupon-spreading millionaire Washington special interest lobbyist and actor. 
 This week's debate was Thompson's first, and he had to share the stage with eight other guys, some of whom have barely bothered to drop in on New Hampshire or Iowa and have no support outside their immediate families. The next time you see a nine-way presidential debate, people, tell yourself: This is being broadcast by lily-livered poltroons who are afraid of offending Tom Tancredo and Duncan Hunter. If the networks cut out the people who have no supporters, no campaign donations and who spend less time on the road than the average Mister Softee vendor, they could finish in an hour with far less viewer slippage. 
 The main action in the Republican race is currently the squabbling between Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani. At the debate, Romney tried to brand Giuliani as an enemy of the line-item veto. This is, of course, fatal in a party in which everybody quails in fear of the powerful right-to-veto lobby. It's been a long time since we've had a good line-item veto fight. Not as exciting as the moment when John McCain laced into the Smoot-Hawley tariff, but quite the dust-up.
 Standing next to the towering Thompson and Giuliani, who always looks a little strange and skeletal, Romney resembled the handsome prince in ''Shrek.'' Not exactly the most reliable character in the kingdom, but a truly great head of hair. 
 So there we are. Thanks to two hours of Republicans talking, Americans can now rest assured that Fred Thompson A) has all his marbles and B) is a terrible candidate. All actors, it seems, are not Ronald Reagan. Thompson not only isn't charismatic, he doesn't even seem pleasant. If Fred is a man of the people, I am Jennifer Lopez.
 ''People who play by the rules and work hard can expect to live the American dream,'' he said sternly. ''If they need help in this country, they get help. And those who can help themselves are expected to do so.'' 
 I hope that's clear. All you losers out there have obviously failed to play by the rules and work hard. Everybody who doesn't own a house didn't try hard enough to buy one. Stick to the program and you will have all the Guccis and Grey Poupon you need.
 You've got to say this about Fred Thompson. He's one hell of a tall candidate.

HEADLINE: After Record Day, a Boeing Delay Hinders the Dow

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell yesterday after Boeing said it expected a delay in deliveries of its Dreamliner jet and early corporate results prompted concern about the outlook for profits.
 The Nasdaq was up slightly, with shares of the Costco Wholesale Corporation hitting an all-time high after the retailer reported robust earnings.
But outside the retail sector, several major companies in businesses from paper products to pet supplies suggested a slowing economy was taking its toll on corporate profits, sapping investor sentiment. 
 Boeing, which pushed back deliveries of its highly anticipated 787 Dreamliner, was the top drag on the Dow. Shares of Boeing's suppliers also fell, including Spirit Aerosystems, Honeywell International and Rockwell Collins.
 Boeing shares fell 2.7 percent to $98.68, while shares of Spirit Aerosystems fell 6.4 percent, to $35.92; Honeywell declined 0.9 percent, to $60.71; and Rockwell Collins dropped 2.4 percent, to $74.04.
 ''A lot of it was Boeing. It's an image thing, and the stock ran up a lot in anticipation of the Dreamliner,'' said Victor Pugliese, director for listed equity trading at the First Albany Corporation in San Francisco.
 Also, ''Alcoa was a little disappointing,'' he said.
 On Tuesday Alcoa reported earnings below analysts' estimates. Shares of Alcoa slid 1.8 percent, to $39.
 Mr. Pugliese also said investors were taking profits after Tuesday's big run-up. The Dow and the S.& P. 500 closed at record highs on Tuesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed inflation expectations were contained.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 85.84 points, or 0.61 percent, to end at 14,078.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.68 points, or 0.17 percent, at 1,562.47. But the Nasdaq composite index was up 7.70 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,811.61.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were unchanged at a price of 100 25/32, for a yield of 4.65 percent.
 Crude oil rose $1.04, to $81.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after gaining $1.24 on Tuesday.
 BP said a fire Saturday at the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska would force a production cut of 30,000 barrels a day for two weeks.
 In other earnings news, Chevron joined the companies issuing profit warnings. Its stock fell 0.8 percent, to $92.08, making it among the top losers in the S.& P. 500.
 International Paper, which also warned about its profit outlook, fell 2.4 percent, to $36.18.
 PetSmart, the biggest United States pet supplies retailer, cut its outlook yesterday, blaming weak consumer spending and adverse weather.
 PetSmart fell 4.1 percent, to $31.06. 
 But shares of Costco, the No. 1 United States warehouse club operator, rose 9.2 percent to close on Nasdaq at $69.13. Earlier, Costco climbed to a record intraday high at $69.95.
 Shares of the Web search company Google rose 1.7 percent, to end at $625.39. The shares hit a record intraday high of $625.68 after Merrill Lynch raised its price target on Google to $740.
 Trading was lighter than normal on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.16 billion shares changing hands versus last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Rodents and Pedophiles, Incurring Wrath

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Two hours' worth of character development and carefully paced revelations are nice, but when you get the right author and the right actor, there's nothing like a 15-minute play to slap you to attention. That perfect combination comes along in ''Rats,'' one of five quick works in ''Vengeance,'' a bill of very new works being offered by stageFarm at the Cherry Lane Theater. 
 The playwright is Ron Fitzgerald, whose previous plays include ''Cyclone,'' a title that nicely describes how ''Rats'' hits you. That is largely because of a whirlwind performance by Michael Mosley as a tightly wound man named Tom, who, as the play opens, is holding a visitor to his apartment at gunpoint, making him change the channels on the television (because his remote needs batteries). 
 The visitor (David Ross, nicely complementing Mr. Mosley) has come because of a fund-raising letter that Tom wrote back before he was unemployed. Where Mr. Fitzgerald goes from there involves mood-altering pills, a bullet-dodging rodent and a mortgage foreclosure. As mentioned, these are very new works. 
 Gina Gionfriddo, whose play ''Squalor'' opens the show, slips in a reference to the recent bridge collapse in Minnesota on the way to telling a lively tale about a crusader (Carrie Shaltz) who trolls the Internet looking for pedophiles, accompanied by a reluctant sidekick (David Wilson Barnes). 
 Mr. Mosley gets another energetic workout in Julian Sheppard's ''Skin & Bones,'' an ominous but too oblique body-parts story that also stars Lisa Joyce, who appears in three of the plays and shows off an impressive array of characters. She is one of two warring sisters (with Ms. Shaltz) in Francine Volpe's ''Giftbox,'' the weakest offering on the bill, and in the final play, the daffy ''Specter'' by Neena Beber, she is a blond bimbo, a Jewish mother and assorted others opposite Mr. Barnes, playing a certain aging record producer named Phil. 
 As for the overall theme, vengeance, well, it's more apparent in some of the plays than others. But Alex Kilgore, the group's artistic director (who also directed ''Squalor'' and ''Specter''; Ari Edelson directed the others), has a nice format here, and shows great taste in playwrights.
 ''Vengeance'' continues through Oct. 20 at the Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts Increased Income, but Hardly Equally

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
New data shows that after adjusting for inflation, 95 percent of Americans reported smaller incomes to the tax man in 2005 than in 2000.
 Despite this, all Americans had more in their pockets as a result of the Bush tax cuts, although the increases ranged from barely perceptible for the bottom half of American earners to thousands of dollars a month for those at the top, Internal Revenue Service figures show. 
 For the bottom half of Americans, the average after-tax income in 2005 was $14,526, which was $20 a month more than in 2000. Without the tax cuts, their incomes would have slipped by $234 a year, or around $20 a month. 
 The next higher 25 percent, who made $30,881 to $62,068, had on average $52 a month more after taxes in 2005. For the next 20 percent above that, the increase ranged from $144 to $274 a month. 
 The only group to report higher incomes both before and after taxes was the top 5 percent.
 After-tax income for the 96th through 99th rungs on the income ladder rose $5,656 on average, or $471 a month. For the top 1 percent, whose incomes averaged more than $1.2 million, after-tax income rose by $64,796, or $5,400 a month, even though their average income rose only $18,000 in the same period. More than 75 percent of taxpayers make less than $5,400 a month.
 Analysis of the new income tax data, known as Table 5, also shows that while incomes rose markedly in 2005 from 2004, with all taxpayers' average income up nearly 4 percent in real terms, average pretax income declined slightly for 75 percent of Americans.
 Among the top quarter of American earners -- those whose average incomes did rise in 2005 compared with the year before -- more than half of the gains went to the top 1 percent. 
 The figures on incomes, both before and after taxes, help explain why so many Americans report feeling economic distress, despite overall economic growth since the Internet bubble burst on Wall Street in 2000 and the 9/11 attacks the next year. Other official data shows that median household income in 2006 rose by a fraction of 1 percent over 2005 only because more people were working and they were working longer hours. 
 Chris Edwards, director of tax policy for the Cato Institute, the nation's leading promoter of libertarian thought, said that even the income gains among the top 1 percent might be illusory because this group gets most of the income from business. He pointed to a report this week in Tax Notes magazine, by Peter Merrill of PricewaterhouseCoopers, that said partnerships and limited liability companies reported 51.5 percent of all business income in 2004, up from 47.3 percent in 2000. 
 Mr. Edwards said that income from such businesses shows up on the tax returns of individuals, not their companies, and so the rise in reported income at the top may represent a change in how income is reported.
 Gerald T. Prante of the Tax Foundation, a research group that favors lower taxes, noted that the incomes of those just below the top 1 percent fell by a larger amount before tax than the two groups just below. He said this might have resulted from less in investment gains and income, a lingering effect of the burst Internet bubble.
 Mr. Prante also said that the increase in after-tax income among the bottom half of Americans seemed primarily a result of the increased child credit promoted by Republicans a decade ago and expanded under Mr. Bush. 
 That credit used to be denied to the poorest parents because it had no value to those who paid no income tax. But now, a portion of the credit is available to the poorest parents. 
 A table posted by the Tax Foundation shows the income tax rates paid by each group. Those rates overstate the actual taxes paid by the poor because the earned income tax credit and other credits available to people who do not pay taxes are excluded, said Robert S. McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice, a group that maintains that the tax system favors the rich. 
 The Tax Foundation's table shows that the lowest 50 percent of American earners paid an average federal income tax rate of 2.98 percent. When all tax credits are taken into account, Mr. McIntyre calculated, the rate drops to a negative 2.27 percent.
 Mr. McIntyre said the overall decline in average pretax incomes, and the big gain in after-tax incomes for those at the very top, did not surprise him. He said that was the predictable result ''of a policy geared toward a rather small fraction of the population.''
 Both Mr. Edwards and Mr. McIntyre noted that the tax cuts that left people with more money in their pockets were financed with government borrowing.
 ''Debt is future taxes,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''Deficit spending on the war and other items will make taxpayers worse off in the future.''

GRAPHIC: GRAPH: LIGHTER TAXES, PARTICULARLY FOR THE RICH: By 2005, most Americans had still not regained the same income level, adjusted for inflation, that they had reached in 2000. But after taxes, they generally were better off, with those at the very top enjoying the greatest gains by far. (Source: Citizens for Tax Justice from I.R.S. data)

HEADLINE: A Detroit Bridge's Private Ownership Raises Security Concerns

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
More than a mile of teal-painted steel rises over the Detroit River, just another bridge really, but for the thousands of trucks and millions of dollars in goods that rumble across it each day between the United States and Canada.
 In fact, this ordinary four-lane bridge is the busiest commercial border crossing in North America, carrying one-third of all road trade -- or more than $122 billion in goods a year -- between the two countries. 
 But the span, the Ambassador Bridge, is owned not by either country, not by the cities of Detroit or Windsor, Detroit's Canadian neighbor, and not by some public bridge authority. It is owned by one man and his privately held company.
 In a remarkable arrangement for a crossing so major, Manuel J. Moroun, a reclusive billionaire from Detroit's suburbs who oversees a trucking empire, owns the bridge, one of only two privately owned bridges along the United States' entire northern border and by far the most economically significant privately owned bridge in the nation. 
 Now, with so much commerce depending on a single structure, people have begun to wonder what would happen if a terrorist were to attack it or if the Ambassador Bridge, approaching 80 years old, were to fail.
 And so a race is on to build a new $1 billion crossing here. 
 In a confluence of concerns over national border security, safety of the nation's stock of bridges and an economic crisis in Michigan, the unusual arrangement here has prompted a simple question: Who should own a bridge?
 Opened in 1929, the Ambassador Bridge was privately built by Joseph Bower, a New York financier. Even during its construction, a fight -- led mainly by the mayor of Detroit -- raged over whether the bridge should be run by a private company or a public agency.
 At the time, plenty of bridges were privately owned, though soon the trends moved away from that. Eventually, Mr. Moroun began acquiring stock in the bridge's owner, the Detroit International Bridge Company, and gained control of the company nearly three decades ago.
 Of the 24 vehicular bridges and tunnels between Canada and the United States, only the Ambassador and the bridge connecting International Falls, Minn., and Fort Francis, Ontario, are private.
 Supporters of a publicly owned span here say it is the only wise plan, the only one that offers needed public oversight and regulation. They have deep concerns, they say, about allowing a single man to continue his decades-long reign over such a vital connector of nations. 
 ''This man is making billions of dollars on that bridge.'' said Raymond E. Basham, a Michigan state senator and a Democrat, who said that only a public bridge could ensure the structural inspections and domestic security needed. ''When it comes to dollars and cents, there is every incentive for him not to tell us if something is wrong. We have an obligation for the safety of people.''
 But Mr. Moroun, who is known to most people here by his nickname, Matty, wants to build another bridge himself. Officials from his company say they would open a six-lane span to replace the Ambassador Bridge, which would also be fixed up and could be reopened if the new span ever ran into trouble. Already, the company has bought and boarded up dozens of houses to make way for the Ambassador's privately owned twin.
 In a way, Mr. Moroun's offer seems tempting, particularly on this side of the border. The region's automobile-centric manufacturing economy is in free fall, and lawmakers in Lansing, the capital, barely averted a shutdown of government services on Oct. 1, after a standoff over how to make up for the state's expected $1.75 billion budget shortfall.
 ''It's just lunacy for the taxpayers of Michigan and Canada to pick up the bill for this bridge,'' said Alan Cropsey, a Republican state senator who supports the private bridge. ''Why do they feel they need to put a bridge up and compete with the private sector? Why now?''
 Each plan -- the public and the private -- would cost about $1 billion. Each plan still requires many approvals from government agencies on both sides of the border. And each would ultimately be paid for, advocates for the public bridge say, by tolls from bridge users. 
 Some residents in Detroit and Windsor, particularly those who live near the foot of the Ambassador Bridge, dispute the need for any new crossing. In 2000, more than 12 million cars, trucks and buses crossed the bridge, Michigan transportation officials said. In 2006, vehicles numbered fewer than 10 million, though the number of trucks was nearly the same as before.
 ''Who needs another?'' said Victor Abla, whose window in the Southwest Detroit neighborhood of Hubbard Farms looks out on the Ambassador Bridge. ''With trucks backed up on the bridge that's already here, the pollution is horrible in my neighborhood, and the asthma rates are sky high.''
 But some studies of traffic on the bridge suggest that it will reach its capacity as early as 2015, said Mark Butler, a spokesman for Transport Canada, a government agency. Others say it will take longer. For now, one question remains: Which bridge will be built?
 Advocates for a public bridge complain that Mr. Moroun's plans will receive special attention from leaders here because of his long history of political campaign contributions. Indeed, campaign contribution records reveal years of donations by him and his family to a wide array of politicians and committees from both parties. 
 In a request made through Dan Stamper, the president of the Detroit International Bridge Company, Mr. Moroun declined to be interviewed within the time frame of this article. Mr. Moroun might consider an interview ''in a month or so,'' Mr. Stamper said.
 For his part, Mr. Stamper defended plans for a new private bridge. He dismissed the matter of Mr. Moroun's political allegiances and said security concerns were needless: the bridge company had hired private security guards to watch the bridge in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
 Mr. Stamper also said that the Ambassador Bridge received structural inspections every year from private firms and that the results of those inspections were made available to Michigan and Canadian transportation authorities, though not to the public. Michigan transportation officials said they were for the first time allowed to see a full inspection report in 2005 as part of a road expansion agreement. 
 Mr. Stamper disputed that, saying the bridge company had earlier shared inspection reports with the state, as well as with Canadian officials. 
 ''To the people who say that they're uncomfortable with this being private, I say, 'We are a success story,''' Mr. Stamper said.
 Leaders in the auto industry here, which depends on the bridge for carrying parts between assembly plants on both sides, have supported studying a government bridge.
 Frederick W. Hoffman, the director of state relations for Chrysler, said, ''Our particular concern is that there be multiple owners, and thus more competition in the costs.'' 
 The current bridge charges $3.75 for cars; trucks (about 12,000 of which cross here each day during the busiest part of the week) pay by weight, averaging, Mr. Stamper said, $12.
 In the end, no one is ruling out the possibility that both bridges may be built.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Crackdown Upends A Slaughterhouse's Work Force

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: TAR HEEL, N.C. 

 BODY:
Last November, immigration officials began a crackdown at Smithfield Foods's giant slaughterhouse here, eventually arresting 21 illegal immigrants at the plant and rousting others from their trailers in the middle of the night. 
 Since then, more than 1,100 Hispanic workers have left the 5,200-employee hog-butchering plant, the world's largest, leaving it struggling to find, train and keep replacements. 
 Across the country, the federal effort to flush out illegal immigrants is having major effects on workers and employers alike. Some companies have reluctantly raised wages to attract new workers following raids at their plants. 
 After several hundred immigrant employees at its plant in Stillmore, Ga., were arrested, Crider Poultry began recruiting Hmong workers from Minnesota, hiring men from a nearby homeless mission and providing free van transportation to many workers. 
 So far, Smithfield has largely replaced the Hispanics with American workers, who often leave poorly paid jobs for higher wages at the plant here. But the turnover rate for new workers -- many find the work grueling and the smell awful -- is twice what it was when Hispanics dominated the work force. 
 Making Smithfield's recruiting challenge even harder is the fact that many local residents have worked there before and soured on the experience. As a result, Smithfield often looks far afield for new employees. 
 Fannie Worley, a longtime resident of Dillon, S.C., a largely African-American town of sagging trailers and ramshackle bungalows, quit her $5.25-an-hour, part-time job making beds at a Days Inn motel four months ago to take a $10.75-an-hour job at Smithfield. But Ms. Worley remains ambivalent. 
 ''It pays a lot better,'' she said. ''But the trip is too long.'' 
 Around 1 p.m. each day, C. J. Bailey, a Smithfield worker, picks up Ms. Worley and 10 other employees in his big white van. They arrive at the plant around 2:15, and he drops them back home after 1 a.m. 
 Several of the newly hired workers in the van -- they pay $40 a week for the ride -- said they were thinking of quitting, unhappy about having to commute so far and work so hard. At the plant, where the pay averages around $12 an hour, many spend hour after hour slitting hogs' throats, hacking at shoulders and carving ribs and loins. At the end of their shifts, many workers complain that their muscles are sore and their minds are numb.
 Employee turnover has long been a problem at Smithfield and other meat-processing plants, but the problem has grown worse recently. Dennis Pittman, a Smithfield spokesman, said 60 percent of the new workers quit within 90 days of being hired, compared with 25 percent to 30 percent two years ago when many new employees were illegal immigrants.
 ''I've heard officials from a couple of other meat processors say they've never seen such high turnover with new workers,'' Mr. Pittman said. 
 Several Southern companies have raised wages to attract new workers after immigration raids. ''But that's not the first thing that employers are going to do,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ''They're going to try to cast their net wider before they do something that will raise costs.''
 Smithfield, for example, has run a flood of television advertisements boasting that the company is a good, safe place to work. The advertisements aim to persuade Carolinians to apply for jobs and to counter arguments made by a union trying to organize the plant that Smithfield jobs are high stress and unsafe, with stingy benefits.
 One of the toughest challenges, Mr. Pittman said, has been training new employees to handle the highest-skilled jobs at a plant that processes 30,000 hogs a day. 
 ''The big problem is we lost a lot of people who were there a long time,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''We have been facing difficulties in hiring for a number of years, because as the economy got better, the labor market became much tighter.''
 When the plant opened in 1992, the area's jobless rate was high because tobacco was in retreat and textile mills were closing. Early on, most employees were black. That changed with an influx of Hispanic immigrants, most of them Mexicans, in the mid-1990s.
 Chris Kromm, executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies, said the Hispanics should not be viewed as shoving blacks aside, because the plant had such high turnover.
 ''It's not as if these jobs were stable sources of employment for creating a black middle class,'' Mr. Kromm said.
 The way Hector David, a longtime worker from Mexico who quit in February, sees it, Smithfield had been eager to hire Hispanics because they worked so hard. ''The Americans just don't work as well,'' Mr. David said. ''In Mexico, we work from the age of 5 in the corn fields. We're used to working hard.''
 The New York Times wrote about the sometimes uneasy relations between blacks and Hispanics at the Smithfield plant as part of a 2000 series that examined race relations in the United States.
 Mr. Pittman said Smithfield did its best to ensure that immigrant employees had legitimate documentation. But many workers said Smithfield did not look too hard at the paperwork.
 Last November, the company notified 640 employees that their identity information did not match government records. In January, federal agents arrested 21 workers at the plant, and in August, helped by information the company provided, agents arrested 28 more, many at home.
 Mr. Pittman said cooperating with immigration officials ''serves our goal of 100 percent compliance 100 percent of the time.'' But for many families, the cooperation has come at a price. 
 Tears came to Maritza Cruz's eyes as she described the scene when immigration agents banged on her trailer door at 3 a.m. and arrested her husband, Alejandro, who faces deportation. ''Everyone is very scared, especially after they arrested people at their homes,'' said Mrs. Cruz, who has four children and is on maternity leave from the plant.
 The company and its employees are not the only ones affected by the crackdown.
 Since the enforcement actions began, said Jazmin Gastelum, owner of a local Christian bookstore, La Tierra Prometida, business from Hispanic customers has plunged 40 percent at her store and two nearby Hispanic groceries. ''A lot of people are going back to Mexico,'' Ms. Gastelum said. ''And a lot who haven't moved are scared to go outside.''
 As for the workers who remain at the plant, many wonder why so many new employees come from South Carolina. Gene Bruskin, the director of the unionization campaign, sees a simple explanation.
 ''Thousands and thousands of workers from North Carolina have come through the plant, and they left, saying, 'No way,' because they were injured or didn't want to work in such an oppressive atmosphere,'' Mr. Bruskin said. ''This plant burned up a large number of people, and the word got around about their bad experiences.'' 
 Mr. Pittman said Smithfield had hired many workers from South Carolina because the counties close to the plant had a low unemployment rate.
 The immigration arrests have also created problems for the union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which has spent 15 years seeking to organize the plant.
 ''A lot of the people who left or were detained were strong union supporters,'' said Gabriel Lopez Rivera, a Smithfield worker.
 Mr. Bruskin, the union official, added, ''It's extremely difficult for workers to stand up for their rights when they're threatened with arrest or deportation.''
 The Tar Heel workers voted against unionizing in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Smithfield had broken the law by intimidating and firing union supporters.
 The company has called for a new election, but the union instead wants Smithfield to accept unionization through a majority sign-up, a process that would give management less opportunity to pressure workers. 
 In recent months, union organizers have adopted a new role, rushing to the trailers of immigrant workers facing arrest to ensure that someone can care for their children.
 Union officials recently organized educational forums at a Roman Catholic church in Red Springs, where immigrant workers were advised, among other things, to sign power of attorney forms designating someone to take care of their children, finances and homes if they were arrested.
 ''I think all this turmoil is helping unionization,'' said the Rev. Carlos Arce, the priest there, ''because people feel alone and unprotected, and they see that the union, along with the Catholic Church, is the only organization that is trying to help them.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Examines Pension Fund Of New York

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an inquiry into oversight of the New York State pension fund, which is drawing increasing scrutiny over claims that investment firms paid friends and relatives of former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi in exchange for business.
 The S.E.C. began its examination several weeks ago, people with knowledge of it said, and is looking into potential civil violations of federal securities laws. 
 The move follows an investigation of the same issue begun by the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, in January, along with an inquiry by P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney.
 The S.E.C staff is conducting an informal inquiry; a formal investigation, which would give the investigators subpoena power, requires the approval of the commissioners. The staff review involves transactions between investment firms and the $154 billion state pension fund during Mr. Hevesi's tenure and the role of intermediaries known as placement agents that helped facilitate the deals. The staff recommends to the commission whether to launch a formal investigation.
 Asked about the S.E.C. inquiry yesterday, Mr. Hevesi's lawyer, Bradley Simon, said that Mr. Hevesi ''did absolutely nothing wrong in his oversight of the pension fund'' and has previously touted the fund's strong returns during Mr. Hevesi's tenure.
 The case is becoming one of the most extensive public-integrity investigations in the state in decades, with federal, state and local investigators now involved. It has also brought new attention to the almost unchecked authority that New York state gives the comptroller in investment decisions for the fund.
 The issue is whether friends and relatives of Mr. Hevesi's received improper financial benefits by virtue of their closeness to Mr. Hevesi, who served as the fund's sole trustee. 
 Investment firms crave access to the $154 billion fund, one of the largest pools of investment capital in the world, and can reap lucrative fees by managing even a small fraction of its assets. 
 Mr. Hevesi pleaded guilty to an unrelated felony, over charges that he had state workers chauffeur his ailing wife, and resigned in December. 
 Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment, as did the attorney general's office and the district attorney. 
 It is unusual for the S.E.C. to launch an inquiry into a public pension fund. The agency spends the vast amount of its time and resources policing corporations, not governments, although its chairman, Christopher Cox, has expressed concerns lately about inadequate oversight of public finances, including public pension funds, and asked key members of Congress for more power.
 The claims leveled in the inquiries involve people with extremely close ties to Mr. Hevesi.
 Records show that Mr. Hevesi's former top political adviser, Hank Morris, ran or worked for six businesses known as placement agents, which facilitated deals between investment firms and the fund during Mr. Hevesi's tenure, from 2003 to 2006. 
 Those companies tied to Mr. Morris received at least $25 million in fees from the deals, people with knowledge of the investigations have said. One of the firms that paid fees to Mr. Morris was the Carlyle Group, a politically connected private equity firm based in Washington.
 In addition, a business run by Mr. Hevesi's son, Daniel Hevesi, has been subpoenaed by investigators from the attorney general's office. The firm, Praetorian Securities, was a placement agent, but a lawyer for Daniel Hevesi, a former State Senator, has denied that he did any business with the state pension fund, or did anything improper. 
 Jack Chartier, Mr. Hevesi's former chief of staff, is said to have arranged for an investment firm that managed pension fund money to make loans to a friend, the former ''Mod Squad'' actress Peggy Lipton. His lawyer has not commented on the matter. 
 And, in one of the more mysterious elements of the case, a number of files that detailed the fees paid to placement agents disappeared from the comptroller's office shortly after the fund's chief investment officer, David Loglisci, resigned earlier this year, according to the current comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. 
 It remains unclear whether any laws were violated. State laws could be applied to public officials' breaches of ethical conduct, including the broad anticorruption statute included in the Public Officers Law, which prohibits state officials from improperly soliciting or receiving financial benefits as a result of their official positions. 
 Another state law, the Martin Act, which Mr. Cuomo invoked last month as part of his inquiry, can be applied to a range of securities fraud charges, and was used aggressively by Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, to bring cases against Merrill Lynch and other Wall Street analysts. The attorney general has both civil and criminal jurisdiction under the Martin Act, while the S.E.C has only civil jurisdiction, but can mete out daunting enforcement actions that can cripple businesses.
 John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University and an expert on securities law, said that in this case placement agents registered as broker-dealers might be especially vulnerable in an S.E.C. inquiry, because they are tightly regulated by the agency. Several of the placement firms involved in the case are broker-dealers. 
 ''If they can find money was being exchanged for contracts by a broker-dealer, if it looks like there were kickbacks, the first thing they'll say is that the books and records of the broker-dealer have been falsified,'' Professor Coffee said. 
 One broker-dealer that employed Mr. Morris, Searle & Company, has twice restated its annual income, once earlier this month, adding millions of dollars in placement fees that were previously undisclosed.
 The S.E.C.'s inquiry suggested a growing level of concern at the federal level about the integrity of the retirement funds for public workers. The laws governing private-sector pension funds were substantially amended last year. 
 In May, the S.E.C. began an inquiry into the handling of the pension fund for public workers in New Jersey, following reports about accounting maneuvers that made it look as if the state was making larger contributions than it really did. 
 The issues in New Jersey -- including accounting practices that obscured the economic condition of both the pension fund and the state itself -- are different from those in New York, however. In New York, the investigators have primarily focused on whether improper payments were made in the selection of money managers for the fund. 
 New Jersey has hired a law firm to do its own investigation of the pension problems and is cooperating with the S.E.C.'s inquiry, an official of the state treasury said.

BHOOL BHULAIYA
 Opens today in the New York metropolitan area. 
 Directed by Priyadarshan
 In Hindi, with English subtitles 
 150 minutes; not rated
 Even by the extravagant standards of Bollywood movies, ''Bhool Bhulaiya,'' a lavish comic epic about psychiatry, mythology and spiritualism, has a lot of plot. Its star, Akshay Kumar, doesn't appear until about a third of the way into the film. The moment he does, ''Bhool Bhulaiya'' morphs from an opulent romantic ghost story into a slapstick farce as Mr. Kumar's character, Aditya, a psychiatrist summoned to a haunted palace to examine one character's suspicious behavior, mugs and clowns and acts crazier than anyone else. From there the movie becomes a sumptuous quasihorror film about demonic possession and exorcism. 
 The trouble begins when Siddharth (Shiney Ahuja), a scientist trained in the United States, returns to India with his beautiful, American-reared Indian wife, Avni (Vidya Balan). Thoroughly Westernized, Siddharth disdains his relatives' belief that the family's ancestral palace is too dangerous to inhabit because angry spirits still dwell there, and he pressures the whole clan to move in. Once they do, the place erupts with strange happenings. 
 Midway through the movie, spectacle gives way to talky comedy as debate rages about the existence of ghosts, which Siddharth insists are collective fantasies of a culture drenched in religious mythology. The movie, written and directed by Priyadarshan, initially agrees. But as the troubles worsen, it changes sides and culminates with a spectacular Indian exorcism involving fire, swords and hypnosis.
 The vengeful female spirit put to rest is angrier than Linda Blair's Regan MacNeil, but not foul-mouthed; there's not a drop of pea soup in sight. STEPHEN HOLDEN KHADAK
 Opens today in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Peter Brosens and Jessica Woodworth
 In Mongolian, with English subtitles
 104 minutes; not rated
 Eerie, muddled and gorgeous, ''Khadak'' tells the story of an epileptic Mongolian sheepherder named Bagi (Batzul Khayankhyarvaa) who embraces his destiny as a shaman when his village is threatened. Shot on arid steppes, in rural villages and amid the remains of monolithic Soviet-era buildings, it has ecological and religious dimensions and a hero who undergoes several transformations. 
 Bagi's village suffers from a livestock plague that's treated as a pretext for troops to evict everyone in the name of public safety. After that ''Khadak'' becomes an account of Mongolia's shift from a rural to an industrial economy; a rebellion narrative in which Bagi joins vagabond musicians opposing their oppressive government; and a metaphysical adventure in which the hero is projected into a bleak future.
 Directed and written by Peter Brosens, an anthropologist and documentarian, and Jessica Woodworth, a former journalist, ''Khadak'' is a trippy spectacle. It boldly tries to find visuals to describe complex metaphysical and political concepts. But the results often suggest aestheticized eye candy, along the lines of Ken Russell's ''Altered States'' or Godfrey Reggio's ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and its sequels. 
 The influence of Mr. Reggio's film is acknowledged in the cinematographer Rimvydas Leipus's strikingly composed landscapes and in a pulsing score that conjures a feeling of existential dread that has long been Philip Glass's stock in trade. MATT ZOLLER SEITZ KING CORN
 Opens today in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Aaron Woolf
 88 minutes; not rated
 Can a documentary about corn be entertaining? 
 The director, Aaron Woolf, and his co-producers and subjects, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, have tried to make it so with ''King Corn,'' a cultural and scientific history of the crop. Their film is a gentle, meandering entry in the Truth-Seeking Comic Hero genre, as practiced by Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock. 
 Mr. Cheney and Mr. Ellis are best friends and ecological activists who met at Yale and learned that their great-grandfathers once worked in the same small town, Greene, Iowa. After moving there with Mr. Woolf, Mr. Ellis's cousin, the partners cultivated an acre of corn, applied for government subsidies, chose seed and herbicide, rented equipment and followed their crop through harvest and into the marketplace. 
 They also consulted experts, including professors and nutritionists who believe that the corn industry enables America's obesity epidemic by means of its high-fructose corn syrup, and Earl Butz, the former secretary of agriculture, whom the film credits with creating the modern subsidy system, which guarantees huge crop surpluses. 
 But Mr. Cheney and Mr. Ellis are so pleasantly nondescript that they make no particular impression. As a result, all the time spent on autobiographical detail and personal banter hampers the film's urgency, and plays like an awkward attempt to justify a format that the filmmakers are too self-effacing to exploit. MATT ZOLLER SEITZ
 NAKED BOYS SINGING!
 Opens today in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Troy Christian and Robert Schrock
 95 minutes; not rated
 In ''Naked Boys Singing!'' 10 grown men (including one natural redhead) go full monty while belting out show tunes and high-kicking like muscular Rockettes. The show's injury log must make for very colorful reading. 
 Save for an occasional arty flourish, the film simply restages the popular revue that since its 1998 Los Angeles premiere has taken bouncing genitalia to raunch-deprived audiences worldwide. Alternately campy and coy, smirky and serious, the 16 original songs (newly arranged by Troy Christian) celebrate the male anatomy -- and the gay lifestyle -- with playful wit and unabashed explicitness. Sound quality is excellent; whether extolling the delights of a bris or the anxiety of a high-school locker room, every penile synonym rings clear.
 Quiet moments are few; the heartfelt emotion in ''Kris Look What You Missed'' -- and in the lovely voice of Jaymes Hodges -- is a welcome oasis between bouts of antic phallocentrism. Yet ''Naked Boys Singing!,'' with its complete lack of sleaze, is more likely to have you pondering the cast members' skin care routines than their vital statistics. And though stage shows are always best experienced in their natural habitat, few will benefit as much as this one from the eventual consolations of ''pause'' and ''zoom.'' JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

HEADLINE: Technology and Retail Worries Halt Rally

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after a JPMorgan report on Baidu.com spurred a sell-off in technology companies on concern that prices for computer-related shares have outpaced their profit outlook.
 Google fell for the first time in five days, while Apple dropped the most in a month.
 The department stores Nordstrom and J. C. Penney led retailers to their steepest fall since Sept. 25 after last month's sales trailed analysts' estimates. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose as much as 0.9 percent to a record earlier in the day, lost 8.06 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,554.41. The Dow Jones industrial average, which also hit an intraday record, dropped 63.57 points, or 0.5 percent, to 14,015.12. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 39.41 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,772.20.
 The Russell 2000 index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $687 million, dropped 1.2 percent, to 834.98.
 American depositary receipts of Baidu.com, the owner of the most popular Internet search engine in China, fell $34.39, or 10 percent, to $308.78. JPMorgan reduced its third-quarter sales estimate for the company.
 ''It was all triggered with that JPMorgan call,'' said Clarence Woods Jr., chief equity trader with the Baltimore-based MTB Investment Advisors. ''You've had such a straight-up run here in the last two weeks in the tech area. Everyone was waiting for someone to blink, and when they did people decided to sell and take their profits.''
 Google, which climbed above $600 for the first time this week, fell $3.39, to $622. Apple declined $4.56, to $162.23.
 J. C. Penney dropped $4.73, or 7 percent, to $63.27. Nordstrom fell $3.64, to $44.97.
 SanDisk fell $2.98, or 5.8 percent, to $48.70. Oppenheimer & Company downgraded SanDisk, the world's largest maker of cards that store pictures in digital cameras, to neutral from buy.
 Stocks rallied for most of the day after Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, raised its profit forecast, as reduced costs allowed it to be more profitable. Wal-Mart gained $1.31, or 2.9 percent, to $46.90.
 Early gains were also spurred by a government trade report that suggested economic growth was accelerating. The trade deficit shrank 2.4 percent in August, to $57.6 billion, the Commerce Department said. Exports rose 0.4 percent, to $138.3 billion, while imports fell 0.4 percent, to $195.9 billion.
 General Motors climbed above $40 for the first time since 2005, and Ford Motor also rose on prospects for improved earnings. Ford may be able to reach a United States labor contract without a costly strike after the United Automobile Workers granted Chrysler retiree health care relief and did not require extensive job guarantees.
 G.M. added $1.86, or 4.9 percent, to $39.99 for the steepest gain in the Dow. Ford jumped 53 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $8.76 for the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 0.02 percentage point, to 4.63 percent. The 10-year note's price rose 4/32, to 100 29/32.
 Crude oil was up $1.78, or 2.2 percent, to $83.08 a barrel in New York, after a government report showed an unexpected decline in inventories.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities:

ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 SHERRIE LEVINE As the Richard Prince exhibition plays at the Guggenheim, spare a thought for Sherrie Levine, another 1980s appropriation artist, who has a survey show at Nyehaus Gallery in Gramercy Park. On view are several examples of her reworking of sculptures, drawings, paintings and photographs as part of a wider questioning of the authenticity of art and its status as a commodity. 
 What we all know now is that she was just making more commodities, cleverly repackaged as critique. But it is still fun and instructive to return to a moment when artists were -- back then, boldly -- taking the works of other artists and reproducing them, sometimes almost exactly, and claiming them as their own. It is extraordinary now to think that there weren't a flood of lawsuits surrounding this process. For example, a 1981 photograph here of a photograph by Walker Evans looks exactly like, well, a photograph by Walker Evans. The same goes for a photograph after Alexander Rodchenko, and replicas of sculpture by Brancusi and Duchamp. 
 The list goes on, with Ms. Levine pilfering source material from everywhere. But in her defense, these sorts of artworks explored the nature of representation, truth and originality, while transforming the art world into the radically open, shockingly permissive cultural soup that it is today. (Through Oct. 27, Nyehaus Gallery, National Arts Club, 15 Gramercy Park South, Suite 8D, Manhattan, 212-995-1785, nyehaus.com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO 
 Museums
 ASIA SOCIETY: 'ZHANG HUAN: ALTERED STATES,' through Jan. 20. The Chinese artist Zhang Huan, the subject of this small, midcareer survey, is best known for the early, often poetic, sometimes sensationally masochistic performance work he did in the 1990s, which can only be seen in videos and photographs now. The objects in this show, which include giant fragments of Buddhist sculptures made from copper sheets and incense ash, are products of his new workshop-style studio in Shanghai. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'INFINITE ISLAND: CONTEMPORARY CARIBBEAN ART,' through Jan. 27. This large show, with 45 artists and a collective of designers, photographers and architects from the Dominican Republic adding to the count, fills two floors of temporary exhibition space, and care has been given to the selection. Several of the most substantial pieces were commissioned for the occasion. Organized by Tumelo Moshaka, associate curator of exhibitions at Brooklyn, it's an in-house job, a labor of love, though an uneven one. Too much work treads ground already covered by other art over the years. But what's good is really good, and the very existence of a show about identity politics, out of mainstream fashion in 2007, is cause for serious reflection. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'GERDA TARO' AND 'THIS IS WAR! ROBERT CAPA AT WORK,' through Jan. 6. There are a number of narratives running through these shows, from the story of two young people who fled Nazi Germany to the rediscovery of Taro's career and the development of Capa as ''the greatest war photographer in the world'' (in the view of Picture Post magazine). Accompanied by a book written by Richard Whelan, the show delves into questions about Capa's famous photograph ''Death of a Loyalist Militiaman'' and the tricky relationship between truth and fiction in war photography. The show also examines how technological developments in warfare, photography and magazine printing led to a new era of photojournalism during the 1930s and '40s. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CAMILLE PISSARRO: IMPRESSIONS OF CITY AND COUNTRY,' through Feb. 3. This exhibition contains few out-and-out masterpieces, but it does give us a rare look at the radical philosophies behind paintings that to a modern eye appear harmlessly bourgeois. For Pissarro, an anarchist and a Jew (albeit a secular one) in 19th-century France, Impressionism was about much more than the fleeting effects of light. It was about labor, the elimination of hierarchies and an idealized balance between urban and rural life. Pissarro emerges from this exhibition as an artist who never quite resolved the conflict between labor and sensation, but whose subtly anti-authoritarian stance propelled painting into the next century. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM AND OTHER MODERN WORKS: THE MURIEL KALLIS STEINBERG NEWMAN COLLECTION,' through Feb. 3. One of the Met's most significant gifts of midcentury art, promised in 1980 and finalized last year, is taut and rich, reflective of a passionately discerning eye. Nearly everything is a standout, not just the rare de Kooning and the substantial Pollock, or works by Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Claes Oldenburg and Jules Olitski. Max Ernst's portrait of Gala Eluard; sculptures by Giacometti and Jacques Lipchitz; paintings by Alfred Leslie and Mark Tobey; and a collage by Anne Ryan radiate an almost brazen self-sufficiency. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 THE MET: 'THE AGE OF REMBRANDT: DUTCH PAINTING IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 6. The Met has long advertised itself as a grand art multiplex, a cluster of several separate world-class museums under a single roof. And we get a demonstration in this display of its entire 17th-century Dutch painting collection: 228 pictures, of which roughly a third are usually on view at any time, and some never. In addition to the Rembrandts, there are five Vermeers, nearly a dozen Frans Halses, and the list goes on in an inventory of breathtaking scope and depth. How to package it? The Met has come up with a theme, and a perfect one for our time: money. The work has been sorted not by artists' names or dates, but by the names and dates of the collectors who bought and gave the paintings to the museum. This is the history of the Dutch Golden Age according to the American Gilded Age. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'BRIDGING EAST AND WEST: THE CHINESE DIASPORA AND LIN YUTANG,' through Feb. 10. Focused on a single modern family art collection, this show weaves like a DNA strand through the Met's Chinese painting galleries. The 40 examples of painting and calligraphy belonged to the writer and scholar Lin Yutang (1895-1976) and his descendants, who have divided their time between China and the West. Accumulated over years, the collection has the casual logic of a household photo album, with evidence of shared habits, tastes and temperaments, and of personal interchange between generations. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'DEPTH OF FIELD,' through March 23. The Met's recently acquired large-scale photographs finally have some room to breathe in the new Joyce and Robert Menschel Hall for Modern Photography, a high-ceilinged, gray-carpeted sanctuary on the second floor. Curators at MoMA need not worry: The inaugural installation (a sampler rather than a thematic slice) is dominated by white, mostly male Europeans and heavily weighted with references to history and landscape painting. Despite its limitations, ''Depth of Field'' is not a bad debut. We can also expect more from future installations, which will explore themes like ''photography about photography.'' (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'ETERNAL ANCESTORS: THE ART OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN RELIQUARY,' through March 2. Sure to be one of the sleepers of the fall art season, this beautiful show has a universal theme: life as a cosmic journey homeward, with parental spirits, embodied in charismatic materials and images, counseling and chiding us every step of the way. European, Asian and African reliquaries sit side by side in the first gallery; then some of the world's greatest Fang and Kota sculptures take over and sweep through to the end. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'EXCELLENCE AND ELEGANCE: DECORATIVE ARTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY QING COURT,' through Nov. 25. The consummate ambition that Chinese artists brought to diminutive scale is a striking feature of this small show of art from the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial line. The Qing were both conservatively antiquarian and expansively cosmopolitan, and those trends can be seen in the European-inflected versions of ancient Chinese forms in this show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAINTED WITH WORDS: VINCENT VAN GOGH'S LETTERS TO EMILE BERNARD,' through Jan. 6. Words, ideas, sensations and images are packed into this exhibition, a manuscript display that is also something more than that. Although 20 handwritten letters from van Gogh to Bernard, a French artist and writer 15 years his junior, are at its center, they are surrounded by nearly two dozen van Gogh painting and drawings, among them a splendid self-portrait. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.morganlibrary.org. (Cotter)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'EL MUSEO'S BIENAL: THE (S) FILES,' through Jan. 6. You feel the growing pains and attempts to stretch out in the fifth edition of ''The (S) Files'' (short for ''The Selected Files).'' The show provides a survey of 51 emerging artists based in New York and from this year's invited guest country, Ecuador. Some of the works distinctly consider location, displacement and identity. Others are less concerned with issues that make for good biennial panel discussions and more interested in mining older art -- Surrealism, Minimalism and Postminimalism -- and employing craft techniques. Many of the artists in ''The (S) Files'' have appeared in other local survey shows, which raises the criticism often leveled at biennials: that in trying to cover the waterfront of contemporary art, they end up making the waterfront look, from every angle, increasingly the same. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'REPICTURING THE PAST/PICTURING THE PRESENT,' through Nov. 5. Modern and contemporary artists reconsider both the picture book and standard narrative in works that use mythology, history and current events as their source material. Several pieces, like those by Max Beckmann, Christian Boltanski and William Kentridge, mine the 20th century's major conflicts. Religion enters in a variety of guises, as in James Ensor's ''Entrance of Christ Into Brussels.'' The legacy of slavery is addressed in Glenn Ligon's lithographs and Kara Walker's ''Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated).'' (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'THE ABSTRACT IMPULSE: FIFTY YEARS OF ABSTRACTION AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY, 1956-2006,' through Jan. 6. This exhibition illuminates the troubled history of abstraction at the academy over the last half-century, with a selection of 47 paintings, sculptures and works on paper by its members, many only recently elected, who took part in movements like Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Kinetic and Op Art. Drawn almost entirely from the museum's collection, it may not be an outstanding group of artworks, but it helps to explain how this once-celebrated museum and school lost much of its prestige. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through March 16. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 32-37 Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'GENERATION 1.5,' through Dec 2. Generation 1.5 refers to people who emigrate during their adolescent years, whose identity is shaped by both their old and new cultures. Some of the works in this exhibition address this process; elsewhere the show floats into general meditations on globalization and cultural dislocation. Lee Mingwei's ''Quartet Project,'' a sound and video installation, uses monitors playing a performance of Dvorak's ''American Quartet.'' Seher Shah's drawings combine lotus patterns, Mecca cubes and Western architectural motifs, and works by Rirkrit Tiravanija and Emily Jacir explore the successful contemporary artist as a globalized citizen. The show is emblematic of the museum's program, which is increasingly devoted to reflecting the borough's extreme diversity, but risks turning the immigrant experience into a platitude. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'MIDNIGHT'S DAYDREAM,' through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener) 
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 Galleries: Uptown
 HUMA BHABHA A large installation dominated by two regal, life-size figures cobbled together in the artist's distinct bricolage process -- it deploys chunks of scorched Styrofoam, among much else -- suggests the charred remains of an ancient temple, as well as a bombed-out house and war-torn terrain viewed from above. It is effective, but it's also a bit too close to the forced humanism of postwar figurative sculpture. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, salon94.com, through Oct. 26. (Smith)
 'GUILLERMO KUITCA: STAGE FRIGHT' The Argentine-born Guillermo Kuitca makes art for and about opera, but he could never be accused of upstaging the singers: he peers out from their side of the curtain, taking in the intimidating arc of the audience. Just in time for the opening of the fall season, the tiny, year-old Gallery Met at Lincoln Center (just off the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera) places Mr. Kuitca's meditations on the architecture of opera houses in intimate proximity to the real thing. ''Stage Fright'' collapses Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk into two dimensions, with a Surrealist-inspired hybrid of painting, printmaking and digital photography. Gallery Met at Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org, through Nov. 1. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than for aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal; ''The Guard,'' who protects the soul from evil spirits; ''The Caregiver'' (generally women); and ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late-18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'BETWEEN THOUGHT AND SOUND: GRAPHIC NOTATION IN CONTEMPORARY MUSIC' The sight, not the sound, of music is the theme of this engrossing group show of pieces by more than two dozen composers who create graphic scores in the form of drawings and videos coded with numbers, colors, texts and invented symbols. The close reading required by the show will be fleshed out by a program of live performances. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org, through Oct. 20. (Cotter)
 RAYMOND PETTIBON: 'HERE'S YOUR IRONY BACK (THE BIG PICTURE)' I love Raymond Pettibon all the time, but especially when he's mad, and he's mad as hell in this floor-to-ceiling display of splenetic and coruscating drawings about Middle East politics, Iraq and a world fueled by war culture. It's a great, brutal, hilarious show, a controlled explosion. David Zwirner, 519 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, www.davidzwirner.com, through Oct. 20. (Cotter)
 COLLIER SCHORR: 'THERE I WAS' Collier Schorr's work is full of young men, including wrestlers or boys dressed in military uniforms. Here she focuses on a 19-year-old drag car racer, Charlie (Astoria Chas) Snyder, who was killed in Vietnam. In creating what amounts to a neo-conceptual memorial, Ms. Schorr drills down into the culture of war and the making of images, showing how no one form -- photography or drawing, artistic or amateur -- can claim precedence over another, and that, while images can shape historical narratives, they sadly can't halt history in an era where one war is barely finished before another has begun. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Oct. 27. (Schwendener)
 MITHU SEN With video, painting, sculpture, photography and collage, there's a lot going on in this young Indian-born artist's crowded solo. The most interesting and polished pieces are collage-drawings in which Ms. Sen blends her own features with those of various animals. Big and surreal, these pictures would look good on their own. Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, 11th floor, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074, bosepacia.com, through Nov. 3. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Other
 HUMA BHABHA An appreciation of ancient sculpture, a sensitivity to everyday materials and empathy for some of the world's most troubled spots come together in a trio of rough and inventive assemblage sculptures. Their resemblance to things like a ransacked mummy and a ravaged portrait suggest the march of time, struggles for power and the failure of belief. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, near Rivington Street and the Bowery, Lower East Side, (646) 672-9212, salon94.com, through Oct. 26. (Smith)
 MERLIN CARPENTER: 'THE OPENING' For the opening of Merlin Carpenter's show, the gallery was tricked out as if for a cocktail party, with flowers, drinks and blank white canvases lining the walls. After a couple of hours Mr. Carpenter appeared with a bucket of black paint and scrawled some text on the canvases, like ''I hate you the art world'' and ''Die Collector Scum.'' In the past Mr. Carpenter has circled around issues of art production and consumerism without really landing. The same is true here. Despite its flippant punk posturing, probably the most important thing about this show isn't the opening or the paintings, but the photographs taken for posterity. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 165 East Broadway, at Rutgers Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, reenaspaulings.com, through Oct. 28. (Schwendener)
 PETER DUDEK AND ELANA HERZOG Absurdist Modernism is one way to think of Peter Dudek's abstract geometric arrangements. The forms are clean, but they're also in constant motion as the artist adds and subtracts throughout the run of the show. Elana Herzog's work adds a complementary impression of instability: swatches of plaid fabric stapled to the wall, then apparently ripped away, leaving shreds behind. (Ms. Herzog also has a show at LMAK projects in Chelsea.) Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, smackmellon.org, through Nov. 11. (Cotter)
 'THE GEOMETRY OF HOPE: LATIN AMERICAN ABSTRACT ART FROM THE PATRICIA PHELPS DE CISNEROS COLLECTION' A must-see for anyone interested in modern art, this quietly groundbreaking show tells the story of postwar abstraction from a radically different angle: that of the Latin American artists who, starting in the 1940s, extended their possibilities without resorting to Surrealism. They delved into new materials before the Minimalists, gave Op art a helpfully physical twist, pushed form toward function (and performance) and generally opted for a dancing, off-kilter, open-ended geometry greatly at odds with the four-square machismo reductivism of many of their North American counterparts. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 988-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 8. (Smith) 
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. THE TITLE USES THE ABBREVIATIONS, AND SO WE FOLLOW THAT./LG ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Genocchio) 
 Last Chance
 HUMA BHABHA In four large, haunting yet unassuming photographs, sculptures of feet crudely made from Styrofoam, wire and clay sit on a clayey shore facing a setting sun, like the remnants of some ancient colossus. Very timely. ATM Gallery, 619B West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) 
 JULES DE BALINCOURT: 'UNKNOWING MAN'S NATURE' In his first New York solo appearance since decamping to Berlin, Jules de Balincourt continues to send up the enlightened global conscience on an increasingly varied scale. The 16 paintings and a sculpture in this latest show, all from this year, veer from notebook- to carpet-size, and from hedonism to grim survivalism. Two immense landscapes dominate: a sprawling coastal nightscape (possibly Los Angeles) and a melting glacier awash in neon pink. Mr. de Balincourt's stenciled slogans exhort us to ''think globally and act locally,'' even as the tiny figures that populate his compositions seem to have given up the fight. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24 Street, (212) 989-7720, lflgallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Rosenberg)
 GARDAR EIDE EINARSSON In this elegant if rather thin show, black-and-white works in several mediums and styles conjure up the grim world of Judge Dredd, a well-known cartoon character and full-service justice system (from arrest to execution). With the exception of a weirdly fearsome abstract grimness the subtext seems to outweigh the visual byproduct. Team Gallery, 83 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 279-9219, teamgal.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 NATALIE FRANK: 'WHERE SHE STOPS' There is a heavy dose of Lucien Freud in Natalie Frank's paintings. She also borrows from Paula Rego, Jenny Saville and Cecily Brown. From American painters she adopts Delia Brown's interest in the decorative and decadent, and Eric Fischl's psychosexual narratives. The hybrid British-American lineage makes sense since Ms. Frank studied at the Slade in London and earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia in New York. The real friction comes from seeing a painter in her 20s exhibiting works in Chelsea that look like something you'd see in traditionalist strongholds on 57th Street. The implication seems to be that there's something radical in Ms. Frank's approach to figurative painting, when really there's not. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)
 KARL HAENDEL: 'I NEED WORK' In his first New York solo this young Los Angeles artist gives free rein to his keen understanding of graphic power, visual scale, the contrast between mechanical reproduction and the manual kind, and the play of language and image. An imposing surround of robust and exacting pencil renderings of everything from family snapshots to bumper stickers of by-gone presidential campaigns implies that the social, the historical and the political are also personal. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 JAN HENLE Jan Henle has spent much of the past several years creating the equivalent of a giant earthwork near a small town in Puerto Rico. But rather than digging or piling, he has been shaping the environment of plant growth on three acres of an abandoned coffee plantation, with the help of local farmers using handheld tools. Photographs in the show give an idea of the expanse of the terrain; the show's centerpiece film, with its sense of infinite duration and Buddhist calm, catches the work's spirit. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)
 WOLFGANG LAIB: 'WITHOUT TIME -- WITHOUT BODY -- WITHOUT PLACE' It may be comforting that the mystical German artist Wolfgang Laib remains mostly on message, making ritualistic Process Art from rice, pollen, beeswax and other relatively unmanipulated materials. His 10th solo show in New York is well served by the serene proportions of his new representative, especially in the largest room, where hundreds of tiny mounds of rice and five central mounds of bright yellow hazelnut pollen cover the entire floor, invoking infinity in ways both modest and monumental. Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-1181; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 'MAKERS AND MODELERS: WORKS IN CERAMIC' This show of ceramic sculptures by 30 artists is beyond timely, even if the choices are at times too Gladstone-centric and cautiously mainstream. There are several outstanding efforts, among them Rosemarie Trockel's wryly beautiful day bed, Anne Chu's toasty ''Hellish Spirits'' (life size) and Andrew Lord's ambitious experiment in ceramic outreach. Kai Althoff, Anish Kapoor, Liz Larner, Rebecca Warren and, of course, the great Ken Price reward attention, as do newcomers like Gert and Uwe Tobias, Klara Kristalova and, the show's biggest splash, William O'Brien. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA'The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 PETER SCHUYFF In his best show in some time, this former 1980s art star, currently based in Amsterdam, twists the high-low, art-craft, flat-spatial dualities of his earlier abstractions. In a manner reminiscent of the Situationist Asger Jorn, he adds fleshed-out Shuyffian motifs to found paintings of all varieties, and amends respectable old drawings with black and white de Stijlish designs. The results are amusing, disturbing and repellent. Nicole Klagsbrun, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3335, nicoleklagsbrun.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 RYAN TRECARTIN: 'I-BE AREA' Ryan Trecartin's 100-minute-long video, ''I-Be Area,'' has it all: four or five dynamic male-ish and female-ish characters, several complicated plots, constantly shifting locations and a fictional but real language of murderously barbed non sequiturs disguised in teenage prattle, as well as sculpture (the sets) and painting (mostly on faces). Mr. Trecartin himself acts the major roles, and he also directed, designed and edited the piece. The result is a new-feeling energy, jumpy and queer, with the unreal reality of YouTube. Elizabeth Dee Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-7545, elizabethdeegallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL' The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 * HANNAH WILKE: INTRA-VENUS TAPES, 1990-1993 This show features 16 two-hour videotapes that Ms. Wilke and her companion, Donald Goddard, made during the last 30 months of her life, charting her spirited battle with lymphoma. The tapes could seem primarily like raw material for a documentary, but don't. Running simultaneously on a grid of 16 wall monitors, they immerse the viewer in the myriad details of another person's experience, a rare and astounding thing, especially under the circumstances. Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, 31 Mercer Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232; closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 ANDREA ZITTEL: 'SMOCKSHOP' This well-known, design-inclined artist has recast the art gallery as a small dress shop (with mirror and dressing room), out of which the art has been literally flying. Available for purchase are jumperlike double aprons based on garments that Ms. Zittel has worn for years -- usually one per season. Having been made by several different artist-smockers, the versions here vary tremendously, from plain to fancy, fluid to bulky, from wearable collage to wearable sculpture. Personal uniform, it turns out, is not at all an oxymoron. Susan Inglett Gallery, 534 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 647-9111, inglettgallery.com; closes tomorrow . (Smith)

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Shrinks 2.4%; Weak Dollar Is Wild Card

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Export sales in August rose to a record and the monthly trade deficit fell to its lowest level since January, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The report suggested a rosier outlook for third-quarter growth, but analysts warned that a weakening dollar could drag down domestic demand in the months ahead. 
 The gap between what Americans import and export shrank 2.4 percent in August, to nearly $57.6 billion, an improvement over analysts' expectations. The July deficit was revised lower, to $59 billion, a drop of about $250 million, the department said. 
 A weakening dollar, which reduces the monetary value of exports, had the counterbalancing effect of contributing to the increase in exports -- good news for American producers. Export sales rose 0.4 percent, to $138.3 billion, in August, led by strong business in food and industrial supplies. Total export sales have risen 12.8 percent since August 2006.
 Imports fell 0.4 percent, to $195.9 billion, as pharmaceutical and automotive imports dropped. But Americans purchased more foreign clothing and technology products, like semiconductors. 
 ''Short term, it's good news,'' said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks. ''We have an improving trade deficit, and exports continue to provide underlying strength for economic growth.''
 But in the long term, Mr. Miller said, strong export sales could suggest that producers are selling products overseas because domestic sales are weakening. ''Our underlying domestic growth is weakening relative to overseas growth,'' he said.
 Still, some economists said the report had positive signs for the domestic economy. ''Goods produced for export are just as good from the point of view of production rates and employment as goods produced for domestic consumption and investment,'' said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist with Bank of America.
 He noted that domestic consumer spending had not slowed, suggesting that Americans were opting for more domestic products at the expense of imported goods and services -- which, in some cases, were becoming slightly more expensive.
 A separate report from the Labor Department, also released yesterday, showed that import prices rose 1 percent in September, led by a 5.4 percent jump in petroleum costs and modest gains in industrial supplies and food imports. Import prices are up 5.2 percent from a year earlier.
 But the price of agricultural and other food exports rose, and demand for exports appeared strong as foreign buyers took advantage of the weakened dollar. Export prices ticked up 0.3 percent in September, keeping pace with a 4.5 percent rise over the last 12 months.
 Over all, though, nonenergy import prices fell in September, surprising at least one specialist.
 ''That to me is amazing,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''If you look at the lower U.S. currency, that would tend to put upward pressure on import prices.'' 
 But the promising trade report ''doesn't diminish the fact that the domestic economy is fairly weak over all,'' Mr. Bethune said. ''I don't think necessarily that we're out of the woods.''
 American food exports are up 29 percent from a year earlier. Automotive exports fell 8.4 percent last month, though they remain up 11.3 percent since August 2006.
 A report yesterday from the Labor Department said that the number of Americans who filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell 12,000, or 3.8 percent, in the week ended Saturday. Continuing-claim levels fell by 15,000, or 0.6 percent, for the week ended Sept. 29.

HEADLINE: Gaza Banks Out of Cash as Israeli Banks Halt Business

BYLINE: By TAGHREED EL-KHODARY and ISABEL KERSHNER; Taghreed El-Khodary reported from Gaza City, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: GAZA CITY, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Gaza's banks have run out of cash, an economic adviser to Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, said Thursday. The cash shortage followed a decision by Israeli commercial banks to halt all business transactions with Palestinian bank branches in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
 ''People responded by withdrawing their deposits,'' said Ala al-Araj, the adviser to Mr. Haniya. The spate of withdrawals brought about the cash shortage. 
 Later on Thursday, Israel allowed some cash into the strip to alleviate the crisis, according to a Gaza bank manager who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Israel has declared Gaza under Hamas ''hostile territory,'' and the legal risks of doing business with banks in an area controlled by a group listed as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union have prompted Israeli banks to cut their ties. Hamas seized Gaza in June, routing the forces of the rival Fatah faction there. Since the takeover, Israel has closed the main crossings in and out of Gaza to ordinary traffic. 
 The decision of the Israeli banks has added to the pressure exerted on Hamas by both Israel and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah.
 In a statement late on Wednesday, Israel's Discount Bank said it had ''decided to end all activities with banks associated with Gaza and with all branches of other banks located there.'' It said its decision was made in light of the Israeli government decision last month to declare Gaza ''hostile territory.'' 
 Bank Hapoalim, the only other Israeli lending bank that did business with Gaza bank branches, made a similar statement on Sept. 25, although bank officials in Gaza and an Israeli official spokesman said that the new policy had not been implemented. 
 Thousands of Gaza's public sector employees and workers were paid at the beginning of October, meaning that they are able to buy food for Id al-Fitr, the three-day festival that starts on Friday and marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But those payments contributed to a shortage of currency in the Gaza banks, and residents who came to draw cash this week were turned away. 
 The Israeli shekel is the official currency in the Palestinian territories, in keeping with agreements under the Oslo peace accords in the mid-1990s. The shekels must be supplied from Israel.
 Usually, Gaza's bank branches send vans to the Erez crossing, on the Gaza-Israel border, to fill up with currency. Shlomo Dror, a spokesman for the Israeli government agency that deals with the Palestinians, said that Israel supplied currency to the Palestinian banks in the West Bank, and that the Palestinian Authority then transferred cash to Gaza via Israeli territory, in coordination with the Israeli authorities. The Erez crossing has frequently been closed because of mortar and rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, Mr. Dror noted.
 The cash that arrived Thursday afternoon was the first to get through in three weeks, according to officials in Gaza. Still, there are 500 million shekels in circulation in Gaza, according to Muhammad Kirresh, a Palestinian economic analyst -- enough, he said, to meet current needs. The bank shortages, he said, were caused by the ''uncertainty and fear of the future'' after the Bank Hapoalim announcement, which led people to withdraw large sums of cash. 
 In the longer term, said Mr. Araj, the Gaza government adviser, the Bank of Israel, an Israeli state institution, could supply currency to Gaza. Alternatively, he said, the main Bank of Palestine could carry out transactions with Israeli commercial banks through its branches in the West Bank, which would, in turn, deal with Gaza. As a last resort, he suggested, Gaza could look into bringing out its own currency or, he said sardonically, go back to bartering.
 Four months after the Hamas takeover, though, the economic pressure on Hamas appears to be having some effect. Speaking in a mosque after prayers late on Wednesday, Mr. Haniya said that the Hamas rule of Gaza was ''temporary,'' and that Hamas had agreed to enter into dialogue with Fatah in one of the Arab capitals after Id al-Fitr. 
 Nabil Amr, a media adviser to Mr. Abbas, told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, ''There are no arrangements to hold any dialogue with Hamas in any Arab countries after the Muslim holiday.''
 In Jerusalem on Thursday, police officers questioned Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, for a second time as part of a criminal investigation into whether he tried, as acting finance minister, to help steer the sale of an Israeli bank to a friend in 2005.

HEADLINE: A Crackdown on Hold

 BODY:
A federal judge has halted a reckless plan by the Bush administration to use Social Security records for immigration enforcement. This is good news, not just for the American economy, which would have been crippled by the attempt to force millions of undocumented workers off the books, but also for the untold numbers of innocent citizens and legal residents who also would have been victims of the purge. 
 The judge, Charles R. Breyer of the Northern District of California, ruled that the Department of Homeland Security could not enforce a new rule requiring employers to fire workers if their Social Security numbers could not be verified within 90 days. The assumption behind the rule was that workers whose numbers did not match the Social Security Administration's database were illegal immigrants using fake or stolen identities.
 Judge Breyer recognized that assumption as deeply flawed and the new rule as an unlawfully crude enforcement tool. The Social Security database is riddled with errors not related to immigration status. Many of the ''no-match'' letters -- which call attention to database discrepancies -- involve legal residents. 
 ''There is a strong likelihood that employers may simply fire employees who are unable to resolve the discrepancy within 90 days,'' the judge wrote, even if the problem was caused by data-entry mistakes, misspellings or name changes. He warned that the rule would cause ''irreparable harm to innocent workers and employers.'' The A.F.L.-C.I.O, a party to the lawsuit that led to the ruling, had estimated that about 600,000 of its members could receive the letters and be vulnerable to firing.
 Judge Breyer also scolded the administration for imposing a policy change with ''massive ramifications'' for employers without a legal explanation or a required survey of the costs and impact to small businesses. 
 It is not the case -- though infuriated hard-liners will insist otherwise -- that millions of undocumented workers are now being let off the hook by a soft-headed judge. If the no-match crackdown had proceeded, many workers without papers would still have found jobs in the underground economy, perhaps worse ones or with better-forged papers. Identity theft would have risen.
 The shadow economy would have adapted, as always. The world of on-the-books employment would have suffered greatly. 
 The federal government has embarked on a disastrously one-sided immigration strategy -- pulling out one harsh enforcement tool after another without having repaired the broken system. We have already seen the results of runaway enforcement on the agricultural industry -- a shortage of workers leading to rotting crops and farmers relocating south of the border. The trouble with crackdowns, like the foolish one involving ''no-match'' letters, is that they cause oceans of pain and havoc -- not just for undocumented immigrants, but also for legal residents and the economy -- without actually solving anything.

HEADLINE: On the Trail Of Brooklyn's Underground Railroad

BYLINE: By JOHN STRAUSBAUGH

 BODY:
LAST month the City of New York gave Duffield Street in downtown Brooklyn an alternate name: Abolitionist Place. It's an acknowledgment that long before Brooklyn was veined with subway lines, it was a hub of the Underground Railroad: the network of sympathizers and safe houses throughout the North that helped as many as 100,000 slaves flee the South before the Civil War.
 With its extensive waterfront, its relatively large population of African-American freemen -- slavery ended in New York in 1827 -- and its many antislavery churches and activists, Brooklyn was an important nexus on the ''freedom trail.'' Some runaways stayed and risked being captured and returned to their owners, but most traveled on to the greater safety of Canada.
 Because aiding fugitives from the South remained illegal even after New York abolished slavery -- and because there was plenty of pro-slavery sentiment among Brooklyn merchants who did business with the South -- Underground Railroad activities were clandestine and frequently recorded only in stories passed down within families. Corroborating documentation is scarce. 
 Still, it's possible to follow some likely freedom routes through Brooklyn. You begin in Brooklyn Heights, where the Promenade offers sweeping views of the East River waterfront. In the decades before the Civil War, this waterfront bristled with the masts of sailing ships. Many were cargo vessels bringing cotton and other goods from the South. Sometimes they brought secret passengers: slaves fleeing to freedom. The fugitives slipped ashore and filtered into Brooklyn, where they were hidden and helped along on their journeys. Acquiring its railroad imagery by the 1830s, this antislavery network had its own ''stationmasters'' and ''conductors,'' who helped organize runaways' passages north, and its own ''stations'' and ''depots,'' where they hid. Several Brooklyn churches participated. Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, a few blocks from the Promenade on Orange Street, between Hicks and Henry Streets, was called its ''Grand Central Depot.'' 
 Strolling up the tree-lined street to this simple, New England-style brick church (constructed in 1849, succeeding the smaller structure that still stands behind it on Cranberry Street), it's hard to imagine that this serene spot became a lightning rod of national debate when the Congregationalist founders invited Henry Ward Beecher to be their first preacher in 1847.
 Beecher, a brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the 1852 best-selling, controversial antislavery novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' was both celebrated and reviled for his abolitionist stance. The archives of the Brooklyn Historical Society (nearby, at Clinton and Pierrepont Streets) contain some of the hate mail he received. One letter bears a drawing of a lynching and the note:
 ''Henry Ward Beecher, here is the fate of all traitors. We are making a rope for you.''
 Beecher's Sunday services packed Plymouth Church to the rafters, not just with locals but also with Manhattanites, who crossed the East River in such numbers that the ferries docking at Fulton Landing were nicknamed ''Beecher Boats.'' In 1860 a long-shot presidential candidate named Abraham Lincoln paid the two-cent fare to ride a Beecher Boat to hear Beecher preach; a plaque at the end of a pew marks the spot where he sat. Walt Whitman, who was fired from his newspaper job at The Brooklyn Eagle for his abolitionist views, and who set the type for his self-published ''Leaves of Grass'' in a nearby print shop, was a great fan of Beecher's sermons.
 Beecher also invited antislavery giants like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass and Wendell Phillips to address his congregation. Other guest speakers over the years have included Booker T. Washington, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens -- who read ''A Christmas Carol'' to capacity crowds for three nights running in 1868 -- and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., delivering an early version of his ''I Have a Dream'' speech.
 ''A lot happened in this church,'' Lois Rosebrooks, the church's director of history ministry services, said when I visited recently. ''We know that this was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Charles B. Ray, an Underground Railroad conductor in Manhattan, brought people over and dropped them here. They were hidden in the church -- we assume in the basement, as that would be the safest place for them.''
 Beecher's most successful tactic for arousing what he called ''a panic of sympathy'' for slaves was to stage mock slave auctions in the church, with the congregation bidding furiously to buy the captives' freedom. The 1914 bronze statues of Beecher and two girls in the church's courtyard by Gutzon Borglum, who later sculptured Mount Rushmore, depicts the first such auction, in 1848.
 The most famous auction occurred in 1860, when Beecher urged his congregation to buy the freedom of a pretty 9-year-old from Washington, Sally Maria Diggs, called Pinky for her light complexion.
 ''After the service he called her to the platform and told the congregation her story,'' Ms. Rosebrooks said. ''He said, 'No child should be in slavery, let alone a child like this.' I'm sure he played on this. She could be your niece. She could be your sister. Your next door neighbor. So they passed the collection plate and raised $900, which is about $10,000 in today's dollars.''
 Congregants gave jewelry as well as cash. In a theatrical flourish Beecher fetched a ring from the collection plate, slipped it onto Pinky's finger and declared, ''With this ring, I thee wed to freedom.''
 In 1927 when Plymouth Church celebrated the 80th anniversary of Beecher's first sermon there, one who attended was Mrs. James Hunt, a stately woman of 76. She was Pinky and had grown up to marry a lawyer in Washington. According to Plymouth Church lore, she brought the ring with her; Ms. Rosebrooks showed me a simple gold band set with a small amethyst. (A Brooklyn Eagle article from 1927, however, quotes Mrs. Hunt as saying the ring had been lost.)
 From Plymouth Church, it's a 10-minute walk to the corner of Fulton and Duffield Streets, where the new Abolitionist Place sign hangs. The abolitionists Thomas and Harriet Truesdell lived at 227 Duffield Street in the 1850s, and William Harned, an Underground Railroad conductor, lived near Duffield and Willoughby Streets. 
 Even as the city unveiled the new sign, however, it was considering plans to demolish the small houses on Duffield Street as part of an economic development plan for downtown Brooklyn. New hotels, underground parking and a public square would replace much of what now stands on the block.
 Joy Chatel, a cosmetologist who lives at 227 Duffield Street, and Lewis Greenstein, a retired city employee who owns 233, have fought that plan since it was announced in 2004. They believe their houses, both probably dating to the 1840s, were stops on the Underground Railroad and should be preserved.
 In his sub-basement, Mr. Greenstein showed me what appeared to be a capped well and an exit shaft to the surface. Former tenants told him of finding old stoves and iron cauldrons there, since removed. It all led him to believe his house was ''a feeding station'' for escaped slaves passing through Brooklyn.
 Ms. Chatel said that years ago she looked through an opening in a neighbor's sub-basement to see what she thought was an abandoned subway tunnel under Duffield Street. There's a low arch in her own subbasement, sealed with a large stone, that might lead to this tunnel.
 No subway ever ran below Duffield Street. Ms. Chatel and Mr. Greenstein speculate that the tunnel was used by the Underground Railroad, and might have led toward the former Bridge Street African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African-American church in Brooklyn and a known depot, just two blocks away. (It's now Wunsch Hall of the Polytechnic University, on the Metrotech Center commons.)
 Mr. Greenstein acknowledged that they have only circumstantial evidence. A planning and environmental firm commissioned by the city found no conclusive proof of their claims. The consultants made no attempt to excavate that mysterious tunnel, noting in their report that ''assuming that a tunnel was discovered, there would be no way of knowing if it served as a passageway for freedom seekers without corroborating artifacts.''
 Still, Mr. Greenstein said, ''I think there's enough evidence here to say, 'Let's do an archaeological dig.''' 
 From downtown Brooklyn I rode the A/C line to Utica Avenue in Crown Heights, then walked four long blocks to another cluster of small 19th-century houses enjoying a happier fate. Like a sliver of the rural past, a row of freshly painted wooden homes stands on green grass near the corner of Bergen Street and Buffalo Avenue, surrounded by modern red-brick monotony.
 They're all that remains of the African-American community of Weeksville, which thrived from the 1840s through the 1930s, then was swallowed up by Brooklyn sprawl and all but forgotten. In 1968 the last dilapidated houses were scheduled to be demolished to make way for public housing when preservationists identified and saved them. They were restored and opened for public tours as the Weeksville Heritage Center. Each house is furnished to represent a specific decade, from the 1840s -- simple wooden furniture and no indoor plumbing -- to the electric lights and washing machine of the 1930s.
 ''Weeksville was founded in 1838, 11 years after the end of slavery in New York state,'' Kaitlyn Greenidge, a research assistant, told me. ''It was a community founded on land purchased by James Weeks, a free African-American, along with two other investors, buying land in central Brooklyn and cutting it up into plots to sell to other African-Americans.''
 By 1855, Weeksville was home to more than 800 residents. They included doctors, craftsmen and businessmen. Weeksville had its own elementary school, orphanage, old-age home and churches, and its own abolitionist newspaper, The Freedman's Torchlight.
 Ms. Greenidge said that although Weeksville was widely known as a safe haven for African-Americans, and many blacks from Manhattan relocated there after the vicious draft riots of 1863, there was no documentation to confirm that it was a stop on the Underground Railroad.
 ''But we do know from census records that up to 30 percent of the black people who were living in Weeksville in the 1850s had been born in the South,'' she said, which suggests that at least some were escapees.
 Pamela Green, Weeksville's executive director, said its mission today is to have an impact on young people. ''We want them to see that here were a group of people who were active post-enslavement, who were able to create institutions, to persevere, to create communities,'' she said. ''What is it about their lives that enabled them to do that in arguably one of the worst periods in history? What can you learn from what they did that will help you in facing the challenges of the 21st century?''
 On Abolitionist Place, Ms. Chatel said she would like to see her house put to similar use.
 ''There's no black museum in Brooklyn to celebrate the Underground Railroad,'' she said. ''This is the house to do it in. It's important that the children and all of the people can see what people had to go through to be free.''

HEADLINE: In India, a $2,500 Pace Car

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Saher Mahmood contributed reporting from New Delhi.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
A revolution is taking place in India that could change what most of the world drives.
 Next fall, the Indian automaker Tata Motors is scheduled to introduce its long-awaited People's Car, with a sticker price of about $2,500. Hot on its tail may be as many as half a dozen new ultra-affordable vehicles -- some from the world's leading carmakers, including Toyota and Renault-Nissan. 
 With a median age of just under 25 and a rapidly expanding middle class, India will overtake China next year as the fastest-growing car market, according to estimates by CSM Worldwide, an auto industry forecasting service. 
 To tap that emerging market, automakers are starting to respond to Indians' desire for small and cheap cars. As a result, car companies are coming up with new ways to develop and build automobiles worldwide. 
 ''Ask one billion people, and 99 percent of them are going to say they want a car,'' said Jagdish Khattar, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India, the country's largest car manufacturer. ''The problem is, How many can afford it?''
 For a long time, only a few carmakers in India concerned themselves with that question. The small-car market in this country is dominated by Hyundai Motors India, Tata and Maruti Suzuki, which is a joint venture between Maruti of India and Suzuki of Japan. Maruti Suzuki has more than 50 percent of the car market, thanks to models already as low as 195,000 rupees (about $5,000). 
 Now, foreign carmakers are entering the competition, increasing pressure to make cheaper yet appealing cars. From June to September alone, Skoda, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, said it would start making and selling the Fabia, its small car, in India; Toyota's chairman, Fujio Cho, said his company might introduce a new small car to India; Ford Motor executives said they were studying the situation; and Renault-Nissan announced it would set up an engineering and design center, adding to previous plans to build a plant in India. 
 Renault-Nissan -- a car-building alliance between Renault of France and Nissan of Japan -- has been talking with local scooter maker Bajaj Auto about building a cheap car that analysts say could cost as little as $3,000. Hyundai is adding a new small car model to its existing line and doubling its local production, and Honda is planning a small car tailored to the Indian market. On Thursday, Fiat stepped up a partnership with Tata, announcing a 50-50 joint venture to make cars, engines and transmissions in India for the domestic and overseas markets.
 India differs from giant slow-growth and no-growth auto markets like the United States and Western Europe, and even from fast-growing markets like China, in that the emphasis is on small, low-cost cars -- but with four doors, not two, and room for the extended family. 
 While the Indian upper classes are snapping up roomier models and even imports like Mercedes-Benz, first-time buyers will provide a big chunk of growth for years to come.
 By 2013, CSM predicts, India's market will expand an average of 14.5 percent a year, compared with just over 8 percent for China. CSM estimates that in 2013, the Chinese will buy 10.8 million cars, compared with 3.8 million in India, but says there is already a glut of local and foreign manufacturers in China, making India a more attractive long-term market. 
 If global manufacturers can figure out how to make small, cheap cars in India, they are expected to start exporting them to other fast-growing markets where the proportion of car ownership remains small -- places like Southeast Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
 But first they have to conquer this market. A. T. Kearney, an international management consulting firm, estimates that a car with a $3,000 list price could attract 300 million buyers in India by 2020. Of course, forecasters were bullish on China for decades before its growth finally took off. And economic upheaval or political change could stall India's expected growth, too.
 But the millions of Indians who will buy cars are likely to agree with Shuchita Bagga, who bought her first auto in July. ''Budget was the most important thing,'' said Ms. Bagga, 26, a trainee in human resources who earns about 375,000 rupees a year (about $9,500) and paid a little more than 235,000 rupees ($6,000) for it. ''I'm not in a position to buy a big or an expensive car.'' 
 In addition to new economy types like Ms. Bagga, car manufacturers are looking at India's approximately 65 million scooter owners, mostly men. Currently, entire families commute on scooters, with the man of the house driving, his wife sitting side-saddle on the rear, and as many as three children wedged in between. 
 The People's Car will create a situation where ''someone who never even dreamed of a car finds it within reach,'' said Ravi Kant, the managing director of Tata Motors. ''Imagine what excitement there is.'' 
 Environmentalists and safety advocates are less enthusiastic. 
 Anumita Roychowdhury, the associate director for the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi, said the ultra-affordable vehicles would worsen India's pollution and traffic congestion. Already, nearly 60 percent of India's cities have pollution levels that are considered critical, she said. 
 On the safety front, auto executives insist the cars will comply with the safety standards of the markets they are sold in. But in India those standards do not currently include full-body crash testing, airbags or antilock braking systems. 
 Critics worry that thousands more cars on the roads will increase an already high accident and fatality rate in India, and those traveling in cheap cars are most likely to be injured or killed. 
 Given their need for speed and bulk, the car demands of North America are ''almost diametrically opposite'' those of India, said Craig Cather, the president and chief executive of CSM. That might limit the expansion of the ultra-cheap cars into mature markets like the United States and Western Europe. 
 But that does not mean much. The automotive supplier Robert Bosch estimates that vehicles priced under 7,000 euros (about $9,870) will make up 13 percent of the world's market by 2010, or 10 million cars a year. And by then, sales of low-price cars will grow twice as fast as the rest of the market, according to Bosch. 
 To satisfy that market, manufacturers and suppliers will need ''exceptional creativity and inventiveness,'' Wolf-Henning Scheider, president of Robert Bosch's gasoline services division, said in a speech in June. ''Slimmed down versions of existing components and systems are not sufficient.'' 
 Daryl T. Rolley, general manager for international operations at Ariba, a sourcing and procurement company working closely with Tata, agreed. ''There are so many legacy costs built into a design, and trying to engineer those out is difficult,'' he said. ''It's better to start with a clean sheet of paper and engineer low costs in.'' 
 The competition to make cars less expensive could finally help make India an automotive research and development hotspot -- after years of false starts and complications from bureaucracy, poor infrastructure and labor unrest. 
 Maruti's factory in Gurgaon, south of New Delhi, for instance, is reached by a potholed road filled with cows and fringed with stands selling juices and snacks amid crumbling concrete storefronts. On a recent visit, parts of the garbage-strewn road were washed out in a sudden shower. Blaring traffic backed up in the early afternoon. 
 But inside Maruti's gates, the company has created a self-sufficient, streamlined island: 4,700 Maruti employees work inside the gray buildings, as do at least as many employees of suppliers, whose warehouses and production plants ring Maruti's main factories.
 The site generates its own electricity and recycles its own water. Inside the main factory are all the materials the company needs for two hours of production at the current rate of one car built every 21 seconds. The nearby suppliers' warehouses stock materials for hours more.
 Maruti, which is still majority owned by Suzuki, has plans to increase its already highly automated process, with the goal of cutting its production time in half and trimming costs. Already, giant swiveling robots do much of the welding. Manpower is employed mostly to check for errors. 
 ''We have made the entry for our competitors smoother,'' Mr. Khattar of Maruti said. 
 While he acknowledged that India would never be a global manufacturing hub for all automobiles, Mr. Khattar said the country did have a major role to play in the manufacture of compacts. What India can offer, he said, is ''frugal engineering.''

HEADLINE: The Hamiltonian Ground

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Alexander Hamilton was an ambitious young striver and created an economy where people like him could rise and succeed. He used government to rouse the energies of the merchant class, to widen the circle of property owners and to dissolve the constraints on commerce and mobility.
 Abraham Lincoln was another ambitious young striver. As a young politician, he championed roads, canals and banks so enterprising farm boys like himself could ascend and prosper. While he was president, the Republican Party passed the Homestead Act, which gave people access to property they could enrich and develop. It passed the Land Grant College Act, so the ambitious would have access to knowledge. It passed railroad legislation to open vistas for the young and aspiring. 
 Margaret Thatcher was another young striver. When she became prime minister, she gave the British working class access to homes and property so that they would become more industrious and independent.
 You'd think that in this and every election, the Republicans would want to continue this tradition. You'd think that they'd start every election by putting themselves at the kitchen tables of middle-class families with ambitious kids. Their first questions would be: What are the barriers to their mobility? What concrete help do these people need to realize their dreams?
 Yet at the Republican economic debate in Michigan this week, there was no talk of that. The candidates declared their fealty to general principles: free trade, lower taxes and reduced spending. They talked a lot about the line-item veto and the Chinese currency. But there was almost nothing that touched concretely on the lives of the ambitious working-class parents who are the backbone of the G.O.P. 
 Sometimes the candidates seemed more concerned with massaging the pleasure buttons of the Club for Growth than addressing the real concerns of the middle class. They talked far more about cutting corporate taxes, for example, than about a child tax credit for struggling families.
 At other times, they sounded as if they were running for a ceremonial post. The person who is elected president will need concrete proposals, but the G.O.P. contenders scarcely have them. Mike Huckabee has some sketchy plans. John McCain answered one element of middle-class anxiety yesterday with his new health care plan. Others seem to have decided concrete proposals are for geeks. 
 In this way, the Republican Party has abandoned the Hamiltonian ground. It has lost intimate contact with the working-class dreamer who longs to make good. 
 Instead this ground is being seized by a Democrat. Over the past few months, Hillary Clinton has issued a string of specific policy programs aimed directly at members of the aspiring middle class. 
 Yesterday, it was a tax credit for college. Earlier in the week, Clinton offered a plan to give families down the income scale access to 401(k)-style plans. Right now, 75 million workers have no employee-sponsored pension accounts. The way our tax code is structured, people up the income ladder get big tax incentives to save, while working people, who have the most trouble saving, get the smallest incentives. 
 Under the Clinton plan, if a family making up to $60,000 a year put $1,000 into a new 401(k) account, they would get a $1,000 matching tax credit. The plan would create millions of new investors. Struggling families could choose mutual fund options and participate in the capital markets. They'd be encouraged to move away from a month-to-month mentality to a saving-for-the-future mentality.
 Clinton's plan poaches on economic values that used to be associated with the Republican Party. Moreover, it undermines the populist worldview that is building on the left of her party. Instead of railing against globalization and the economic royalists, Clinton gives working people access to Wall Street and a way to profit from the global economy. 
 No Republican would design asset-building plans the way Clinton does. No Republican would pay for them the way she does. But at least she has a middle-class agenda. Right now, the general election campaign looks like it's going to be a replay of the S-chip debate. The Democrats propose something, and the Republicans have no alternative. 
 When Hamilton was alive, big landowners stifled competition and economic dynamism. Hamilton created national capital markets to smash local oligarchies. When Lincoln was rising, vast distances retarded trade. The Whigs, and later Republicans, championed internal improvements to build national markets. Today, the global information economy makes it hard for people without human capital to prosper and participate.
 There are potential Republican responses to this. But right now the message is: Proposals? We don't need no stinkin' proposals!

HEADLINE: Ford Hires Head of Lexus, Aiming for Toyota Magic

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 11 

 BODY:
For decades, Detroit automakers watched many of the rising stars in their executive ranks flee to foreign-based rivals that promised brighter futures. Suddenly, that brain drain is being reversed, with three high-ranking officials from Toyota Motor of Japan deciding in recent months to leave for Detroit.
 On Thursday, the Ford Motor Company said it had hired the head of Toyota's upscale Lexus division, James D. Farley, as its new marketing chief. The appointment generated a wave of optimism inside Ford, which is grappling with sharply lower sales and a loss last year of $12.6 billion. 
 Mr. Farley, 45, is the first major hire made by Alan R. Mulally, who became Ford's chief executive last year. Mr. Mulally, an admirer of Toyota, praised Mr. Farley's ''track record for success and passion for the customer.''
 Ford can use Mr. Farley's help. Its sales are down 14 percent this year, and it has lost its perennial grip on second place in the American car market to Toyota. It will not have a significant new product introduction for another year, until it introduces the next version of its F-series pickup, and it does not expect to earn money in North America until 2009.
 Mr. Farley, who joined Toyota in 1990, has held several key roles in Europe and the United States. He directed the marketing campaign for the redesigned Tundra full-size pickup, an important introduction last winter, and oversaw the 2003 introduction of the youth-oriented Scion brand.
 ''Scion is nothing if not a marketing success story,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, editor in chief of Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers. ''He's probably exactly what Ford needs right now.''
 Even before Mr. Farley arrives at Ford in November, his decision to leave Toyota, which is on pace to become the world's largest automaker, is said to have given hope to workers at Ford. Some at the company were hoping Mr. Farley's move would bring better times in Detroit and troubles down the road for Toyota.
 Over the summer, Toyota also lost its highest-ranking American executive, James E. Press, who is now Chrysler's co-president and vice chairman, and the head of marketing at Lexus, Deborah Wahl Meyer, who became Chrysler's chief marketing officer.
 But experts say Toyota, which later Thursday named a Scion executive, Mark Templin, to succeed Mr. Farley at Lexus, will not be derailed by the executive defections.
 ''Toyota is very deep,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 Mr. Cole said the implications were much greater for Detroit, where all three automakers are struggling to reverse years of plummeting market share and overcome billions of dollars in losses. Historically, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors have groomed their leaders from within, but the crises they are facing have forced them to look outside for help.
 Ford hired Mr. Mulally from Boeing; Chrysler, after being bought by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, hired the former Home Depot chief Robert L. Nardelli as its top executive.
 ''The symbolism of this becomes very important,'' Mr. Cole said. ''It's a different world -- one becoming much more expedient, and much more focused on nontraditional thinking.''
 Mr. Farley, currently a Toyota vice president and general manager of Lexus, will be Ford's group vice president for marketing and communications. He takes over many of the duties previously handled by Francisco Codina, Ford's vice president for North American marketing and sales, who is retiring next month.
 Mr. Mulally said Ford had greatly improved its products but needed Mr. Farley to get that message to car shoppers more than the company had managed so far. ''Improving the consideration and awareness of the new Ford vehicles is a really high priority,'' Mr. Mulally said.
 Lombardo Perez, president of Metro Ford in Miami, said marketing had been a weakness of Ford, but that he saw great potential in Mr. Farley's hiring.
 ''Bringing someone from the inside of a progressive and very successful company like Toyota is going to be a big plus,'' Mr. Perez said. ''We're proud of the product; we just need to make sure people know what we know, and market share will start coming back.''
 Mr. Farley, a cousin of the comedian Chris Farley, has many ties to Ford. At age 15 he bought and restored a 1966 Mustang. He drove the car -- without a license or his parents' knowledge -- from California, where he had a summer job at a Ford remanufacturing plant, to Michigan, where his family lived.
 His grandfather, Emmet Tracy, was a longtime Ford worker who eventually ran a Lincoln-Mercury dealership near Detroit. Many of his relatives still live in the Detroit area, where he plans to move.

HEADLINE: Party's Liberal Base Proves Trying to Democrats Back in Power

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
Of the three most recognizable Barneys in America, one is a singing purple dinosaur, another is a prehistoric cartoon character and the third is a gay congressman from Massachusetts. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, is as closely tied to the issue of gay rights as Barney Rubble is to Fred Flintstone. But recently, Mr. Frank has been under siege by gay rights groups. 
 They are angry because Mr. Frank has removed specific language about ''gender identity'' from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, a bill that would protect gay men and lesbians in the workplace and that gay rights advocates say would now leave transsexuals and transgender individuals vulnerable. 
 There is almost no chance that President Bush would ever sign the bill. But the bitter tug of war between gay groups and one of their best friends on Capitol Hill is the latest example of how Democrats in Congress, since regaining majority control this year, have been torn between making compromises needed to pass legislation and satisfying the unrelenting demands of the party's liberal base. 
 Mr. Frank, in an hourlong news conference on Thursday, defended himself and said he would press ahead with the bill knowing that by not including the transgender language he could attract enough votes to get it approved. But he also expressed frustration that the Democrats were hampering themselves. 
 ''There is a tendency in American politics for the people who feel most passionately about an issue, particularly ones that focus on a single issue, to be unrealistic in what a democratic political system can deliver,'' Mr. Frank said, ''and that can be self-defeating.''
 ''This is a moment of truth for responsible liberals in the Democratic Party,'' he added. 
 The tension between Democratic lawmakers and their base has been most visible on the Iraq war, where the insistence by some of the most outspoken antiwar groups on setting hard deadlines for the withdrawal of American troops has often handcuffed Senate Democrats trying to reach a bipartisan deal on legislation to change the war strategy. 
 To the delight of Republicans, it has also played a role in a host of other issues, including a fight over increased fuel economy standards in the energy bill, and demands for more spending on environmental programs in the farm bill. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi disappointed Democrats seeking major changes to the federal farm subsidy program -- changes that Ms. Pelosi had supported in the past. Instead she adopted a more moderate approach that made some changes but left most of the subsidies intact and that she called ''a good first step.'' 
 On the energy bill, the Democrats struggled to navigate the demands of two powerful factions in their base: organized labor groups tied to the auto industry and environmental groups. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, thwarted Ms. Pelosi's efforts to increase fuel efficiency standards. 
 The liberal group MoveOn.org started a campaign that included radio advertising branding Mr. Dingell, who is 81, ''Dingellsaurus'' for opposing the energy standards that the group said would combat global warming. 
 Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said Democrats were struggling with tensions between the party's liberal wing, which provided money and support for the 2006 elections, and the views of many freshmen Democrats who won office in moderate or conservative districts. 
 ''The freshmen who actually won seats in districts that had voted for Bush, in conservative-moderate districts, having nothing in common with Code Pink or MoveOn,'' Mr. Putnam said, referring to the antiwar groups. 
 ''The base turns on them in every single case,'' he added. ''So at some point they have to stop falling into the trap of constantly playing to the base and try to solve problems.'' 
 Democrats point to a series of legislative achievements this year, including an increase in the minimum wage, new lobbying and ethics rules, and an overhaul of student-aid programs, and a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Brendan Daly, said she was providing responsible leadership.
 ''One of the things she says is that an activist -- that's their role to be persistent and unsatisfied and try to push the envelope,'' Mr. Daly said. ''But when you are in a position of leading, in Congress, you have to be realistic at some point.'' 
 Sometimes, though, the in-fighting can seem unreal, as with the recent fury directed by gay groups at Mr. Frank. 
 ''Barney Frank is not gay enough?'' asked Representative Thaddeus McCotter, Republican of Michigan, one of the most conservative members of the House . 
 Even Mr. Frank acknowledged the weirdness. ''The likelihood that somebody is going to run against me in my district on the grounds that I have been insufficiently pro-gay is not very high on my list of concerns,'' he said. 
 He has put gender identity protections in a separate bill that is not expected to be acted upon this year. 
 But many gay rights groups said they were truly angry and bewildered, especially because the compromise involves a bill unlikely to be signed by Mr. Bush. A coalition of some 280 groups sent Mr. Frank a letter urging him to include gender identity in the bill to be voted on soon. ''What we are talking about is stripping out a part of our community for a symbolic vote, which in our opinion does not advance the struggle for civil rights for our people,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. 
 ''If the goal here is for the new majority to demonstrate that it is responding to a core constituency,'' Mr. Foreman said, ''passing a non-inclusive bill is not going to accomplish that.'' 
 Some Republicans in the House have said they wished Mr. Frank had included the language on transgender and transsexual people because it would have made it easier for them to vote against the bill. 
 Mr. Frank, at his news conference, said that including gender identity would kill the bill while approving a compromise measure would be a momentous step. ''It is an important sign to the rest of the country that we are making progress,'' he said. 
 ''On the other hand,'' he continued, ''an announcement that this new Democratic Congress led by a woman who has been as committed to full rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in every aspect of her career, that she had to kill a gay rights bill and couldn't do anything at all would, I think, be the most negative message we could send.''

HEADLINE: Still Waiting in Florida

 BODY:
Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida was right when he called for tearing down the barriers that prevent as many as 950,000 ex-offenders from voting in his state. But the new rules that were put in place to help former inmates reclaim their rights have fallen far short of what's needed to bring democracy back to Florida. 
 The number of petitioners seeking to restore their rights has increased, but the process is excruciatingly slow and strewn with unnecessary hurdles. Unless the rules are further refined and the process speeded up, many ex-offenders will go to their graves without being permitted to vote. And until their voting rights are restored, many of these people will remain locked out of scores of state-regulated occupations for which restoration is listed as a condition of employment.
 As a first step, the state needs to sever that connection, as was recommended by the ex-offender task force appointed by Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. No reasonable person would want to see a sex offender working in a school or a career embezzler employed in a bank. But the practice of barring convicted felons from a whole range of jobs that have nothing to do with their offenses shuts them out of the economy and makes it more likely that they will return to jail. 
 The state should also end the practice of generally denying restoration to people who owe restitution to their victims. Restitution is, of course, important and should be paid. But it's illogical to limit these ex-offenders' employment opportunities and their ability to pay the compensation they owe. 
 Governor Crist served an important public service when he raised this issue. To ensure that ex-offenders get back their rights, the Legislature and he will have to do a lot more. What's needed is for Florida to bring its policies into line with those of 39 other states that automatically restore voting rights once former inmates are released from prison or when they finish probation or parole. Only then will democracy return to Florida.

HEADLINE: McCain Health Care Plan Puts Focus on Spending

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
With its emphasis on containing costs rather than covering the uninsured, the health care plan that Senator John McCain released Thursday differs not only from those being offered by the Democratic presidential candidates but also by his rivals within the Republican Party. 
 The Democrats have focused their proposals on providing coverage to the 40 million Americans without health insurance, while the Republicans have all expressed belief in the power of the free market to improve the system and opposition to mandating coverage. 
 Beyond that, the three Republican candidates who have announced health care plans -- Mr. McCain, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney -- part ways. Mr. Giuliani emphasizes free-market competition, Mr. Romney promotes state ingenuity and Mr. McCain links the treatment of chronic diseases to costs spiraling upward.
 At the heart of Mr. Giuliani's proposal, which he outlined in New Hampshire in July, is an effort to reshape how people get health care. He proposes moving from an employer-based system to one where individuals buy their own insurance, with the help of tax incentives.
 Mr. Giuliani argues that this will create a new and more vibrant market, where competition among health insurers will drive down prices. Critics say it could result in insurance companies cherry-picking the less risky patients and leaving the sick and vulnerable without affordable care.
 Mr. Romney gained national attention when he was governor of Massachusetts for his plan to bring universal coverage to residents of that state. His national approach, which he announced in a speech in Florida in August, is aimed at empowering other states to come up with solutions to rising health costs and the uninsured by allowing them to use federal assistance with greater flexibility.
 On Thursday, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who announced his plan in a speech before the Rotary Club here, said that any health care proposal must first focus on containing spending. To accomplish that, he said, the emphasis should be on better treating chronic diseases, like diabetes and heart disease, which account for 75 percent of all health care costs.
 ''Has any candidate insisted that genuine and effective health care reform requires accountability from everyone: drug companies, insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, the government and patients?'' Mr. McCain asked. ''Yet that is the truth upon which any so-called solution must be based.''
 To that end, he called for hospital and doctor compensation to be linked to performance, starting with making Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements dependent on the results that they achieve.
 He also singled out pharmaceutical companies, insisting that they reveal the price of their drugs to consumers, and called for ''greater competition to our drug markets by safe re-importation of drugs, by faster introduction of generic drugs'' or by other means.
 Mr. McCain also proposed that reimbursement for the treatment of chronic diseases should be drastically altered. 
 ''We should pay a single bill for high-quality health care, not an endless series of bills for presurgical tests and visits, hospitalization and surgery, and follow-up tests, drugs and office visits,'' Mr. McCain said. 
 But people also have a duty to live a more healthy lifestyle to help prevent diseases, Mr. McCain said. 
 ''Has any candidate warned that we have a personal responsibility to take better care of ourselves and our children?'' he said. ''Yet that is the only way to prevent many chronic diseases.''
 Dan Crippen, a senior domestic policy adviser for the McCain campaign, said the needs of people without insurance, especially children, would also be addressed in a McCain administration. The campaign proposes a tax credit of $2,500 to low-income individuals and $5,000 to low-income families who obtain their own insurance.
 But the first step is to contain costs, the campaign says. Health care accounts for 16 percent of the gross domestic product, or $2.2 trillion, Mr. McCain noted in his speech.
 ''You worry about the uninsured, but they are a symptom of a larger problem,'' Mr. Crippen said. ''Unless you do something about cost, you are chasing your proverbial tail.'' 
 Mr. McCain's plan could drive up spending, for instance to add clinics or pay more to doctors who are deemed effective in treating their patients. But the campaign said it had not done a full analysis.
 Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney have not assessed the costs of their plans, either.
 Mr. Giuliani used the announcement of his health proposal to criticize Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who wants to make health insurance mandatory but calls for new options for buying private or public insurance at affordable rates. Mr. Giuliani called her plan ''socialist'' and accused the Democrats of advocating a ''nanny state.''
 Mr. McCain also criticized the Democratic plans, but his comments were more in passing and were far less barbed.
 But when asked about Mrs. Clinton his speech, he said her proposal was ''eerily'' similar to the plan she came up with in 1993, when she headed a health care reorganization effort during her husband's administration. ''I think they put some lipstick on a pig,'' he said, ''but it's still a pig.''

HEADLINE: To the Candidates: Don't Forget Cities And Their Voters

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Between them, the Republicans and Democrats have held something like 17 presidential debates. That's a lot of yakking, and we still have three months to go before anyone votes in this endless campaign.
 Many debates have had specific themes. Candidates have appealed to union members, to Latinos, to African-Americans, to older people, to bloggers, to ''values voters'' (whatever that means). One thing they have managed not to do is focus on a bunch of issues that intimately affect the single largest group of Americans.
 We're talking about people who live in cities and their suburbs. We're talking about more than 80 percent of the population. 
 Oh, sure, the two parties have hardly ignored issues that matter to urban and suburban America, like the economy and education.
 They've discussed the elderly, and cities have plenty of them. They've talked about minorities. Cities are loaded with them, too. Taxes? No one pays more than city people. Health care? City types get sick. Terror and security? Cities are more likely targets than farms are.
 All these topics have popped up in the debates -- but not issues that speak directly to everyday life in big cities and surrounding towns. Those have been shunted aside.
 What are the candidates' thoughts on mass transit, pollution, homelessness, poverty, the fast-growing Medicaid burden, the future of public hospitals, housing that a working stiff can afford, not to mention roads and bridges that are falling apart?
 Don't feel bad if you haven't a clue what they think. They have not been asked to debate these questions, and for the most part they have not strayed from the script to offer an idea or two of their own. 
 Republicans or Democrats, ''they're in a bubble of avoidance'' on issues that ''apply to 95 percent of people's lives day to day,'' said Liz J. Abzug, a New York political consultant.
 This is, for sure, a lament that also arose in past elections. But there is added poignancy to it this time, given who is running.
 In both parties, the front-runners are New Yorkers: former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Who better than they to raise the banner of urban America? The same might be said about Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, a former mayor of Cleveland.
 While we're at it, the Republicans will hold their 2008 national convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul. After the horrific bridge collapse in Minneapolis in August, who better than they to discuss the federal role in repairing urban America's worn infrastructure? There's been not a peep about it in the debates.
 Well, some experts say, what else can you expect?
 ''We don't pay attention to cities unless there's a riot,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. ''It's a terrible thing to say, but that's the truth. It takes a riot to put cities on the national agenda.''
 The calendar is also an inescapable reality, said John H. Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. Despite the rush of big states to hold primaries on Super-Duper Tuesday, Feb. 5, attention for now is fixed, as ever, on the nonurban early birds of Iowa and New Hampshire.
 ONE result, Professor Mollenkopf said, is that candidates ''hit the themes that are highest on sort of a generic public opinion poll of what the top issues are: terrorism, security, health care.''
 Fred Siegel, a historian at Cooper Union, describes himself as a fan of both Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton. Neither, he says, has much to gain by concentrating on big-city issues. ''Hillary's more worried about Methodists in Ohio,'' Professor Siegel said. And while ''Rudy is playing up his achievements in New York,'' he also ''wants to cast himself as a national, not a local, figure.''
 But to Bruce Katz, the director of metropolitan policy at the Brookings Institution, ''the political class at the national level is about 20 years out of date as to how the country has changed because of population growth, demographic diversity and economic restructuring.''
 ''We're a metro nation,'' Mr. Katz said. ''It's time to start acting like one.'' For him, that means discussing, preferably sooner than later, issues like climate change, housing, infrastructure and transportation.
 ''If you're not talking about cities and suburbs, you might as well not be having the conversation,'' he said, ''because these are the places where all this really comes together.''

HEADLINE: What, Me Worry?

 BODY:
If anybody had a doubt about Republicans' detachment from the economic reality of most Americans, Fred Thompson, the former United States senator, set them straight as he opened Tuesday's Republican presidential debate: the economy, he declared, ''is rosy.'' 
 He wasn't the only one in rose-colored denial or out of touch. Despite entreaties from their hosts, all the leading Republican candidates neatly overlooked Americans' fear of recession and the fallout from the meltdown in the housing market. 
 Watching the debate, it felt as if these candidates, or at least the front-runners, were living in an alternate universe. It's one where nothing but taxes can stop the ever upward growth of the American economy and where a problem hasn't been invented -- millions of uninsured, America's dependency on Middle Eastern oil -- that can't be dealt with through tax cuts, slashing government spending and regular, stiff doses of deregulation. 
 Forget a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade regime for carbon emissions -- not that anybody mentioned global warming as a big problem. Forget expensive incentives to develop alternative energy sources. With everybody calling for lower taxes, Republicans were left with no way to address any problem except exhorting the private industry to show its resourcefulness.
 The best brawl was over who had done more harm to his constituents: Rudolph Giuliani, who according to Mitt Romney increased spending by 2.8 percent a year when he was mayor of New York City, or Mr. Romney, who according to Mr. Giuliani raised taxes by 11 percent per capita when he was governor of Massachusetts.
 All this bowing before the tax-slashing idol could be understood as a matter of political survival. But the economic arguments are nonsense, none more so than the claim -- trumpeted by Mr. Giuliani and a revered tenet of his party -- that lower tax rates will inevitably generate more tax revenues. That theory has been tested and failed, leading to enormous deficits during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. 
 Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office published an analysis of the effect of a tax cut on economic growth and tax revenues. It found that even under the rosiest of assumptions, cutting taxes led, inevitably, to lower revenues and a bigger deficit. But perhaps those assumptions were not rosy enough for the Republican presidential candidates.

HEADLINE: Study Gives Alternatives To City Plan For Traffic

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Raising parking meter rates in Manhattan, creating more taxi stands and putting in place a series of other measures could achieve the same level of traffic reduction as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion pricing plan, according to a report by a group opposed to the mayor's proposal.
 ''We've said all the way through that there are better ways to deal with traffic congestion,'' said Walter McCaffrey, a former city councilman from Queens who is the spokesman for the group, Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free. 
 Mr. McCaffrey said the report was sent this week to the 17 members of a commission created by the State Legislature to study the mayor's plan for an $8 charge on cars entering or leaving the area of Manhattan below 86th Street. 
 The commission is also required to consider alternatives to the mayor's plan that could achieve similar results. The Bloomberg administration has estimated that its proposal would reduce the miles traveled by vehicles in the Manhattan charging zone by 6.3 percent. 
 The commission must make a recommendation to the Legislature by Jan. 31 on a plan to ease traffic congestion. 
 The report by Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free identifies 13 measures that, when taken together, it predicts would reduce traffic more than the mayor's plan.
 Chief among the measures is a proposal to increase greatly the number of metered parking spaces in Manhattan by putting meters on many blocks where parking is now free. The study also proposes raising the rate for on-street parking, doubling it in many areas and increasing it even more in the busiest parts of Manhattan. 
 The goal would be to create a higher turnover in parking spaces, in order to lessen the time drivers spend circling the block looking for parking. The report says that is a major contributor to congestion in parts of Manhattan. 
 Mr. McCaffrey said his group included several companies that own parking garages in Manhattan, and he acknowledged that increased street parking costs could make the garages more attractive to motorists. But he pointed out that even many groups that support congestion pricing have proposed higher on-street parking rates as an additional curb on traffic. 
 John Gallagher, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, would not comment on specific aspects of the report. 
 ''We look forward to having the commission review various proposals before they issue their recommendations,'' he said in an e-mail message.
 Hugh O'Neill, the president of Appleseed, an economics consulting firm, which wrote the report, said that the goal of the study was to find measures that focused on specific causes of congestion. The report also includes proposals that the city could carry out on its own, without the Legislature's approval, which is needed for congestion pricing.
 The report calls for the city to eliminate many of the thousands of parking placards that city employees use to get free parking. 
 To discourage cabs from cruising the streets for fares, the study suggests creating 50 new taxi stands in Midtown and in Lower Manhattan. It also proposes a $3 surcharge on taxi trips that begin or end in the central business district of Manhattan, in part as an incentive for people to use mass transit for shorter trips. 
 Other measures include increasing existing bridge and tunnel tolls and charging higher tolls during the morning and evening rush periods.
 Altogether, the study says, such measures could reduce traffic volume by 7 to 11 percent. Mr. O'Neill said, however, that the estimate was very rough. 
 ''I would fully acknowledge that those numbers are speculative and would need to be subject to further analysis,'' he said. ''I think what the numbers legitimately show is that there are real options, real world alternatives, many of which are much simpler to implement than what the city has proposed.''
 The report does not include an overall estimate for the cost of putting its proposals in place, but it says it would cost far less than the mayor's congestion pricing plan. 
 The mayor's office has estimated it would cost $223 million to put in place the system of E-ZPass readers and cameras and the data processing center that would be needed to enforce congestion pricing.

HEADLINE: French Report Says Government Had No Early Warning of Airbus Problems

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK and KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 11 

 BODY:
The French government was not aware of serious production delays for the Airbus A380 when a state-owned bank bought a stake in the plane maker's parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, a report by the finance ministry concluded Thursday. 
 The report could shift the spotlight in France's most prominent insider-trading scandal back to individual managers and the industrial shareholders of EADS, as the parent company is known.
 The French stock market regulator is investigating share sales by 21 senior managers and the two main EADS shareholders -- Lagardere of France and Daimler of Germany -- and has raised the alarm about possible insider trading on a broad scale.
 The accusations have increased the controversy around government plans to tax stock options and revived a debate about how the government invests tax revenue.
 Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, presenting the findings of the independent French inspector general to a Senate committee on Thursday, said that ''at least until the end of May 2006, the state was no more informed than the public or the markets of the delays'' in the A380 program.
 News of the problems sent EADS shares down 26 percent on June 14, 2006, and resulted in a management crisis at Airbus and EADS.
 The 12-page inspector general's report, commissioned last Friday, would seem to support testimony given that day by Thierry Breton, Ms. Lagarde's predecessor as finance minister, who said he had not been informed of the A380's production problems until shortly before Airbus announced them.
 According to a preliminary report to French prosecutors by the regulator, the Financial Market Authority, Mr. Breton was warned in a December 2005 memorandum that EADS would soon enter a ''zone of turbulence'' and was advised to pare the government's 15 percent stake.
 Mr. Breton told the senators that the advice to sell, which he ultimately disregarded, was based on broader expectations about the aircraft business cycle, which many financial analysts had predicted would reach its high point in 2005, a record year for aircraft orders at both Airbus and its American rival, Boeing.
 Ms. Lagarde said Thursday that the report supported Mr. Breton's assertion that the ministry was not aware of the problems with the A380, a superjumbo jet, in April 2006, when the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations bought 2.5 percent of EADS from Lagardere.
 ''Since the state didn't have the information that was going to prompt the drop in shares,'' Ms. Lagarde said, ''it wasn't in a position to make, encourage or purposely disclose any embezzlement linked to the drop in shares.''
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has been quick to capitalize on popular outrage over the EADS insider-trading scandal to press ahead with proposals to tax stock options. The administration wants to finance expensive presidential programs, and slower economic growth may squeeze revenue elsewhere.
 Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, rallied behind the president, telling Le Monde on Wednesday that he would propose abolishing stock options at the company, a practice he described as ''a lottery.''

HEADLINE: The Revolt of the Childless

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
IF the boss allows an employee to leave early to take his children trick-or-treating (or to the doctor, or so the employee can watch a school play, etc.) is the boss being fair to everyone else who still has to work a full day? 
 Is it fair to offer a working mother a flexible schedule but not provide the same option to a woman without children? 
 A growing number of childless workers are answering ''no'' to questions like these, prompting HR magazine to ask employers in a cover story ''Are You Too Family Friendly?''
 It's an issue because of the changing nature of the population in the United States.
 ''Slightly more than one in four households, 26 percent, consisted of a person living alone in 2006, up from 17 percent in 1970,'' Susan J. Wells writes. ''Unmarried and single U.S. residents numbered 92 million in 2006, making up 42 percent of all people 18 and older.'' That's up from 89 million in 2005.
 As a result, ''family friendly'' benefits are starting to generate a backlash among those people who do not have children.
 ''Childless singles feel put upon, taken for granted and exploited -- whether because of fewer benefits, less compensation, longer hours, mandatory overtime or less flexible schedules or leaves -- by married and child-rearing co-workers,'' Ms. Wells writes.
 She says one solution that has worked well for some companies is offering a cafeteria-style list of benefits that employees can choose from. 
 WHERE'S EVERYBODY? Of course, Edwin D. Hill has an agenda. He is, after all, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, a union that represents 725,000 workers including 220,000 employed by utilities in the United States and Canada.
 Still, he makes a valid point. 
 ''Deregulation and restructuring of the industry created downward pressure on recruitment,'' he writes in EnergyBiz, a trade publication. ''And the bill is now coming due.''
 Mr. Hill writes that about half of the industry's workers are eligible to retire within the next 10 years.
 One effort to deal with that is already under way. The union ''has partnered with local, state and provincial leaders to create pre-apprenticeship programs to attract students and young workers to the trade.''
 DOING GOOD BETTER Foundations typically try to solve society's problems by making grants to nonprofits.
 ''Yet the lack of grant money did not cause these social problems,'' write Mark R. Kramer and Sarah E. Cooch in The Stanford Social Innovation Review. ''Instead, they are often attributable to market failures, where a misalignment between social goals and economic incentives has created or perpetuates social ills.''
 Since that is the case, argue the authors who work for FSG Social Impact Advisors, a nonprofit group that seeks to advance philanthropy and corporate social responsibility, foundations may be better off directing some of their funds to market-based solutions, an approach the authors refer to as ''mission investing.''
 Foundations are beginning to take tentative steps in this direction, the authors write. For example a survey of 92 foundations that they conducted showed a 16 percent increase in spending on mission investing in the last five years. Still, the total amount devoted to it represented just 2.4 percent of the assets of the foundations surveyed.
 FINAL TAKE Higher prices for metals are being blamed for an increase in the theft of sculptures worldwide, Art & Antiques Magazine reports. More than 300 bronze, aluminum and copper sculptures have been registered with the Art Loss Register, an industry database, since January 2005.

HEADLINE: Heavy-Equipment Sales Lift Earnings at G.E.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, benefiting from spending sprees by governments in emerging nations, is getting robust orders for aircraft engines, power generators and other pieces of heavy equipment.
 A result, G.E. said yesterday, is that net earnings from continuing operations rose 7.1 percent in the third quarter, despite depressed margins in some equipment businesses and continuing problems in health care and some areas of finance. 
 ''The technology we provide, the services we offer, all of it is driving unprecedented demand in our global infrastructure business,'' said Keith S. Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer. 
 G.E.'s revenue was $42.5 billion in the quarter, up 12 percent from last year. Its income from continuing operations was $5.1 billion, or 50 cents a share. G.E.'s net income for the quarter, which includes results from discontinued operations like its consumer lending business in Japan, was $5.5 billion, up 14 percent. 
 ''They're exiting businesses when they don't see growth, they're investing in technology when they do,'' said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who frequently writes about G.E. ''That strategy is finally paying off.''
 Investors are not so sure. G.E.'s results were in line with analysts' expectations, and 14 of the 17 analysts that report their recommendations to Thomson Financial kept their buy or strong buy recommendations on the company.
 But shareholders seemed disappointed nonetheless. G.E. shares, which have been steadily rising since August, tumbled 57 cents yesterday, closing at $41.03.
 Analysts disagreed on whether G.E. was truly thriving, or just masking problems in many areas with strength in a few. 
 ''One real surprise was how well they navigated through credit markets in such turmoil,'' said Deane M. Dray, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.
 David Bleustein, who follows G.E. for UBS Investment Research, was far less heartened. ''They could have knocked the ball out of the park this quarter, given the strength in wind turbines, in energy, in oil and gas and aircraft engines,'' he said. ''But issues cropped up that just sapped the upside.''
 Indeed, many analysts noted that while the numbers came out as expected, the path to them was tortuous and confusing.
 G.E. reported $100 million in unexpected product development costs in aviation and took another $100 million hit in its domestic consumer credit businesses -- both numbers that may have been offset by lower taxes. It reported that its Triple A credit rating was giving it a leg up in the tumultuous credit market, but that GE Money was still tackling delinquencies in the United States. It said infrastructure orders were up but infrastructure margins were down. 
 It announced that as part of its cooperation with an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it had rethought its practice of booking some equipment revenue when a product was shipped, even though it reimburses customers when a product is damaged in transit. 
 ''The tax rate was confusing, there were write-offs and charges, it just wasn't the clean G.E. quarter that the investment community was looking for,'' said Daniel J. Rosenblatt, an analyst with Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, which owns G.E. shares. 
 Mr. Sherin of G.E. readily conceded that the company gave investors a lot to digest. ''We had a lot of moving parts this quarter, and people have to absorb it all,'' he said.
 Some analysts even questioned some of G.E.'s premises for future growth. 
 For example, commercial finance has been one of G.E.'s fast-growing businesses, and Mr. Sherin predicted that as the credit markets grow ever more risk-averse, G.E.'s Triple A rating will lead to even more robust growth. 
 Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Research, doubts that. He downgraded G.E. to buy from strong buy yesterday. 
 ''I think one impact of the subprime credit crisis will be reduced demand in the global credit market,'' he said. ''Yes, I'm expecting good growth, maybe 12 to 13 percent a year, but not the fabulous 17 percent to 22 percent annual growth we'd been seeing.'' 
 Still, G.E. did have a fair amount of good news to report. Jeffrey R. Immelt, its chief executive, has long promised to deliver 8 percent organic sales growth -- and he did just that this quarter. And he said G.E. was on track to post earnings per share of $2.19 to $2.22 for the year. Moreover, while G.E.'s margins on engines and turbines are meager, each unit it sells brings the prospect of sales of high-margin parts and maintenance contracts.
 NBC Universal continued its turnaround, with profits up 9 percent. Health care remained troubled, with profits down on slightly increased sales. G.E. did not predict it would bounce back next year, ''but it won't get worse,'' Mr. Immelt promised analysts. 
 But perhaps most important, G.E. expects infrastructure orders to keep rising, as emerging nations continue to build highways and railways and fleets of jets. ''We are still in the early innings of the big infrastructure build,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''It's going to be a real boomer.''

IF you want to know what's in your food, finding out is easy enough -- just look at the label. Federal law mandates that food producers list ingredients. Not so with makers of cosmetics, and millions of Americans have no idea what they are putting on their skin each day.
 That is not the case in Europe, where the European Union has imposed strict limits on the chemicals that manufacturers can use in products ranging from body spray to bug spray. 
 A result, Mark Schapiro, an investigative journalist, says in his book, ''Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power,'' is not only that American consumers are more at risk than their European counterparts. Besides that, he says, the European Union is also gaining the upper hand in regulating the behavior of multinational corporations, and is thus amassing more economic power.
 American consumers assume ''that somebody out there is assessing what it is they put on their bodies,'' he said this week on San Francisco's public radio station KQED (kqed.org/forum). That, he said, is an ''illusion.''
 The book offers various examples of the kinds of chemicals that are allowed by the United States government, but restricted by the European Union. Much of the book is devoted to cosmetics, since, in that business, the regulatory gulf between Europe and the United States is especially wide. 
 But there are examples in nearly every manufacturing industry. For example, Europe has restricted the use of phthalates -- compounds, often used in toys, that make plastic softer. But the United States has not, even though there is an ''enormous body of evidence'' that phthalates cause decreased production of testosterone in young boys, Mr. Schapiro said. 
 Europe ''operates according to the precautionary principle,'' Mr. Schapiro said in an interview with the Center for Investigative Reporting, (centerforinvestigativereporting.org) where he is the editorial director. In the United States, ''regulators wait for final scientific 'proof,' an elusive goal that creates what critics call 'paralysis by analysis.''' 
 The Economist, in an article citing ''Exposed,'' said last month (economist.com) that in Europe, unlike the United States, ''corporate innocence is not assumed.''
 TANGLED IN WIRELESS Free government-run wireless Internet services have run into big trouble from Chicago to San Francisco. The problem, writes Tim Wu at Slate (slate.com), is that cities ''have labored under the illusion that, somehow, everything could be built easily and for free by private parties.'' 
 Free Internet service is ''telecom's Bay of Pigs,'' he wrote, ''a project the government wanted to happen but left to underqualified private parties to deliver.''
 WORD GAMES London 2012, the organizers of London's coming Olympic Games, had a problem with Robert Ronsson's science-fiction novel for children, ''Donovan Twins: Olympic Mind Games.'' They sent the author e-mail warning him not to use Olympic in his title, saying it was a breach of trademark rights (bbc.co.uk).
 Undaunted, the publisher Pen Press printed 300 copies of the book, which has to do with aliens, not sports. The organizers relented somewhat. Given the small press run, a spokesman told BBC News, it would be ''disproportionate to take a heavy-handed approach.'' But he said London 2012 still found the title ''disappointing'' and that it hoped to reach an ''amicable solution.''
 Mr. Ronsson said he found the group's actions to be ''extraordinarily strange.''

HEADLINE: The Great Chase for the Highest Rate

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
They're a latter-day version of day traders. Rate chasers, they call themselves: savers who hunt for the best interest rates at banks and credit unions and quickly move their cash from one account to another. 
 Their forebears took the risky path of rapidly buying and selling stocks in the hope of locking in quick profits, but often suffered deep losses instead. The rate chasers, by contrast, consider themselves safety-conscious -- even the most extreme among them who are playing with money borrowed from credit cards -- because they are keeping their money in accounts that are federally insured.
 ''The millionaires have stocks and bonds, and they're chasing with their safety money,'' said Nick Ferris, a 24-year-old software engineer from Rockville, Md., who readily acknowledges that he is one of the more aggressive rate chasers, having borrowed money at 0 percent introductory rates from six credit cards. ''We poorer people who don't want to go bankrupt if the stock market crashes are more inclined to go rate chasing with all of our money because all of it is our safety money.'' 
 Rate chasers used to be retirees on fixed incomes who scoured the newspaper to find tiny bumps in rates. ''It meant the difference between eating out or not,'' according to Jim Bruene, editor of an industry newsletter, Online Banking Report. 
 The current rate chasers are of all ages and means, although no one tracks their numbers and demographics. The stock market volatility this summer along with offers of 6 percent interest on liquid insured savings only served to underscore the rate chasers' conviction. 
 Like their day-trading predecessors, rate chasers are all online. ''Rate chasing has never been easier than in the last two years, because of the Internet and personal finance sites like Bankrate.com that have aggregated listings of providers chomping at the bit to get your business with the highest rates,'' said Edward Woods, a senior analyst at Celent, a financial services research and consulting firm based in Boston. 
 Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said, ''There's a big disparity between letting money languish in a low-yielding account at your typical brick-and-mortar bank where the average passbook savings account is less than 1 percent and the high-yield accounts, where they top 5 percent. '' 
 But, he added, ''whether it makes sense to chase every little change in rates depends on how much money you have to play with.''
 The roots of online rate chasing go back to 1996, when NetBank, the first significant Internet-only operation, offered savings rates that were higher than any on a brick-and-mortar passbook account, so long as savers were willing to open an account at a bank with no physical branches. (The bank was shut last month by federal regulators after it ran aground with lending problems.) 
 Then, in September 2000, ING Direct, an online division of the Dutch banking giant ING Group, offered a 6.5 percent savings rate at a time when passbook accounts in the United States were averaging 1.66 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Although there were smaller online banks offering the same rate or a little more, ING Direct had the resources to pay for a huge national advertising campaign featuring a distinctive orange ball. And while ING Direct lacked the physical branches owned by its Dutch parent in Europe and India, it soon opened a Manhattan cafe where customers could sip coffee and log on to their accounts.
 Today, the bank still has roughly half the $150 billion in online deposits in the United States, according to Mr. Bruene, even though it has not offered the highest rates in recent years. 
 Rate chasing really began to take off in January 2005, when the online bank Emigrant Direct came on the scene with a 3 percent savings rate, topping ING Direct, which was offering 2.35 percent at the time. 
 Emigrant Direct was helped by its affiliation with a brick-and-mortar institution in the United States, the Emigrant Savings Bank of New York. But it got a big boost when the personal finance guru Suze Orman endorsed the Emigrant Direct offer on her television show. 
 In March 2006, Citibank introduced its online brand, Citibank Direct, with a 4.5 percent savings interest rate. ''Citibank was the first nationally known brand name in the market,'' Mr. Bruene said. ''When it's Citibank, that gets the attention of every large bank. If they hadn't been thinking of starting an online brand before, they were then.''
 Today, there are some two dozen major online-only banking brands in the United States, most of them divisions of regional, national and global banks, Mr. Bruene said. All use high rates to attract new customers to whom they can peddle more profitable products like checking accounts and loans. 
 ''When banks choose to lower those high rates to improve their bottom lines, they do it knowing some customers -- namely, the rate chasers -- will move on,'' Mr. Bruene said. 
 FNBO Direct, the new online unit of First National Bank of Omaha, made a splash on May 1 when it introduced a five-month 6 percent promotional rate. The offer was timed to start just as the 6 percent rate at an online competitor, HSBC Direct, was expiring, the president of First National Bank of Omaha, Rajive Johri, said in an interview. 
 ''This is not a rate game we are playing, it's a long-term plan,'' he said. ''Like other regional banks, we are on the defense against giant banks coming into our American plains and buying up branches. The Internet has allowed us to go national without opening branches, and this is our effort to position our bank in an industry that will be totally online in 10 to 20 years.'' 
 Through September, FNBO Direct attracted 36,000 new accounts with total deposits of $1.5 billion, Mr. Johri estimated. Eighty percent of those new FNBO Direct account holders came from brick-and-mortar banks, and the average deposit was around $35,000, he said. Several thousand deposits from individuals were $400,000 or more. 
 Three weeks into its 6 percent rate, FNBO Direct imposed a $1 million limit on new deposits. ''We did not want a handful of people using our bank for a short period of time,'' Mr. Johri said. 
 Elizabeth Warren, a consumer finance specialist and Harvard Law School professor, said many savers were swinging $500,000 or more from one online account to another, some of them undoubtedly over Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. 
 Those over their limits probably believe the federal government will protect them, Ms. Warren said. ''People remember that during the 1980s savings and loan crisis, it didn't let depositors who'd exceeded their limits go down.''
 Ms. Warren added: ''Although many savers are sophisticated enough to understand the stock market is the place to be long term, they believe its fundamentals are crazy now and they cannot tolerate the risk. I'm one -- my husband and I got out this summer and put our money into C.D.'s.'' 
 Even investors with no plans to exit the market are sedately chasing online. Warren Wagner, 66, a retired government bond dealer and seasoned individual investor from Tahoe City, Calif., currently has 40 percent of his holdings in cash as he waits to resume active trading later this year. For the cash in his portfolio, he bids online for C.D.'s at Zions Direct, a division of Zions Bank of Salt Lake City. ''I am getting the highest safe yield I can right now,'' he said. 
 At the other end of the spectrum are chasers using borrowed credit card money, which Ms. Warren called ''odd risk-taking behavior.'' But it makes sense to Mr. Ferris, the software engineer who depends on his money management software to be ''the biggest rate chaser out there.'' He said he had gains of $9,000 before taxes since he started chasing rates two years ago.
 Mr. Ferris had nearly $100,000 at FNBO Direct for the entire time the 6 percent rate was offered, a little over half borrowed on his credit cards. Knowing the bank would cut its rate when the promotion ended Sept. 28, Mr. Ferris said he joined other rate chasers at online destinations like fatwallet.com and bankdealsblog.com, to discuss options. 
 Many were considering C.D.'s, previously heresy for pure chasers accustomed to being able to take advantage of competing banks' rates. Mr. Ferris said he hesitated at first when he read an online tip about a seven-month C.D. offered by the State Employees Credit Union of Maryland, the state's largest credit union, which was paying what he calculated as an effective 9.36 percent annual percentage yield. 
 Then, considering the possibility of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the end of October and its effect on online bank rates, he said he raced to join the credit union, known as SECU, because he feared other rate chasers would exhaust the deal. He was eligible as a University of Maryland graduate, and he transferred his entire FNBO Direct principal to SECU. 
 Online, Mr. Ferris said, he read comments from chasers nationwide who tried every trick to get into the credit union and the deal. The credit union, which began offering the deal on Saturday, Sept. 29, and closed it the following Tuesday, declined to comment. 
 ''Why put your money in the market when you can have a 9.36 percent sure thing?'' Mr. Ferris asked. ''In seven months, it'll be time to chase rates again, and who knows where they'll be by then.''

HEADLINE: Big Recalls Don't Slow Exports From China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Despite a wave of high-profile recalls, and growing scrutiny of the quality and safety of Chinese goods, China's export boom continues, according to newly released statistics from both independent analysts and the government in Beijing. 
 China said Friday that it exported $878 billion worth of goods in the first nine months of 2007, up 27 percent from the period last year, when Chinese exports posted record volume.
 Global worries about contaminated pet food, tainted seafood and toxic toys and toothpaste have not been significant enough to slow China's export engine, analysts say. 
 ''Forty million toys may be bad for dozens of toy makers in Dongguan,'' said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse, referring to one of southern China's toy-making centers. ''But that's small potatoes for China's over $1 trillion a year of exports.''
 China's trade surplus with the rest of the world has already ballooned to $187 billion through September of this year, up from about $177.5 billion for all of 2006, and much of the gains have come in trade with the United States and the European Union. 
 Even in categories hit by high-profile recalls this year, like food and toys, exports rose sharply, according to data compiled by Global Trade Information Services, based in Columbia, S.C. 
 Through August, China's food and agriculture exports to the United States were up 27 percent over last year, to about $2.5 billion. And global exports of Chinese-made toys jumped 18 percent, to about $16 billion, during the period, despite a series of recalls of lead-tainted toys by Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy company.
 An exception is Germany, where imports of toys from China fell 42 percent in the first eight months of the year, compared with the period in 2006. 
 But over all, China's pricing advantage over Western manufacturers -- including lower costs for labor, land and energy -- continues to draw new businesses.
 The trade data, however, did offer some evidence that importers were responding to safety concerns, particularly in some smaller food categories. China's exports of eel to the United States, for instance, fell 94 percent after the Food and Drug Administration moved last summer to block the imports of certain types of seafood, including eel and shrimp, because of concerns about the presence of excess antibiotics.
 Japan, a huge importer of Chinese seafood, followed suit, canceling large orders of Chinese eel. Japan's eel imports through August of this year dropped to about $59 million from $101 million during the 2006 period.
 But most companies that import from China today do not seem to be canceling orders. 
 On the other hand, over 60 percent of Chinese companies that responded to a recent survey said they were investing heavily in new quality-control systems, according to Global Sources, a Hong Kong company that helps businesses find export markets.
 ''As more and more companies in the U.S. are understanding their liability, they are investing or requiring their suppliers to invest in quality control,'' said Merle A. Hinrichs, chairman of Global Sources.
 Analysts say China is, to some extent, immunized against a loss of confidence in any one area by its increasing diversification. 
 ''A growing share of China's trade is IT and electronics,'' said Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS who is based in Hong Kong. 
 Some of China's biggest gains are coming from the European Union, where imports of Chinese goods have jumped more than 30 percent this year, in part because of an undervalued Chinese currency. European officials are now pressing China to allow its currency to appreciate.
 ''There is substantial resentment building up in Europe, and I think the Chinese don't recognize that,'' said Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. 
 ''The renminbi has gone south, and if you have a currency that depreciates you get more competitive in your selling propositions.''
 But even with a weak dollar, American imports of Chinese goods are also up 17 percent this year.
 Through the first eight months of the year, American imports of Chinese toys rose 16 percent from a year ago. Imports of Chinese seafood also jumped over 16 percent.
 Mr. Tao, the Credit Suisse economist, said that the real threat to China was not product recalls, but economic changes taking place in the United States and in China itself.
 ''It's the U.S. slowdown that worries me, and rapidly rising production costs in China,'' he said. 
 ''Wages are going up, food prices are going up and environmental measures are being launched.'' 
 Those changes would make it more expensive to manufacture in China, and that might slow the juggernaut, Mr. Tao said. 
 Safety Agreement With China
 WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (AP) -- Bush administration officials and their Chinese counterparts sought Friday to nail down a plan to ensure the safety of products that the Chinese export to the United States.
 Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, declined to discuss specific steps that China agreed to take to improve safety. 
 He did say, however, that Chinese health officials would come to Washington this month to complete details of a memorandum of agreement between the countries.
 On Thursday, investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee reported that the food supply chain in China failed to meet international safety standards and that a lack of internal regulation there required a much more vigorous program of inspections and testing than the F.D.A. had been willing to pursue to date.

HEADLINE: After News Article on Test, Michigan Orders Retesting

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Michigan's Department of Education is making thousands of fifth- and sixth-graders retake a part of the state's standardized writing test because a newspaper published a brief article about the test that revealed the topics of two questions. 
 The retesting is expected to cost ''hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' a spokesman for the department, Martin Ackley, said Friday, at a time when Michigan is entangled in its worst-ever financial crisis. State lawmakers this month narrowly avoided a government shutdown by voting to raise taxes to help close a $1.75 billion budget deficit.
 State officials say the article, published Tuesday in The Jackson Citizen-Patriot newspaper, could give an unfair advantage to students who had not yet taken the test. Not all schools administer the examination on the same day. The test, which determines compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind law, has to be identical for all students.
 The decision to retest has outraged parents and school district officials across the state, who say it wastes time and could lead to lower scores. The state is considering penalties against the Jackson Public Schools, which apologized for allowing a reporter inside a classroom during testing.
 The situation has embarrassed The Citizen-Patriot, which has a circulation of 32,000 in south-central Michigan. The paper's editor, Eileen Lehnert, said that the reporter, Chad Livengood, ''did everything right'' and that there was no intention to disclose sensitive information.
 Ms. Lehnert also questioned the logic of schools' not testing simultaneously in an era of text messaging and online social networking. ''I feel awful,'' she said. ''But I can't see, knowing what we knew then, what we possibly could have done differently.''
 The three-week window during which schools can administer the test, known as the Michigan Educational Assessment Program, began Monday. Officials are unsure how many of the state's 260,000 fifth- and sixth-grade students have already taken the section being recalled.
 In past years, schools that violated testing protocol gave their students an emergency replacement version, Mr. Ackley said. But because people anywhere in Michigan could have read the article on the newspaper's Web site, officials decided to give all schools a new writing test.

HEADLINE: Strong Gains in U.S., Except by Comparison

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
FIVE years after the American stock market hit bottom after the bursting of the technology stock bubble and the 2001 recession, share prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 have doubled.
 That growth amounts to a compound annual increase of 15 percent a year and is the fastest doubling off a market bottom since the 1980s. But in the current world environment, it does not look impressive. Nearly every other stock market in the world has done better.
 Of the 83 countries for which records of a major stock index were available, the American share price increase in the five years after Oct. 9, 2002, was better than those of only four. All four are small countries, either in the Caribbean or Latin America. 
 But South America also produced three of the six best-performing markets during the period, in Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Peru's annual gain of 87.5 percent was the best in the world.
 That all 83 markets around the world had an increase is emblematic of the strength of the global economy and the willingness of international investors to pour money into markets that many had never heard of -- or that did not exist -- 20 years ago.
 The figures show the change in dollars, which makes returns in many countries appear more impressive than they would if local currencies were used because the dollar has generally been weak. Markets in Britain and Italy, for example, doubled in terms of dollars, but not in pounds or euros.
 It was just a decade ago that international investors lost huge sums in some emerging markets, as the Asian currency crisis devastated investors. In 1997, the South Korean stock market fell by more than two-thirds and the Thai market fell by more than three-quarters.
 But those days are forgotten, and the lure of big returns has attracted investors from around the world to markets on every continent, save for Antarctica. With commodities prices rising, markets in some countries have benefited from their natural resources, while others have benefited from the expansion of local manufacturing of products for export.
 Of the traditional industrial powers, known as the Group of 7, only Germany made it into the top half of markets, ranking 39th with a 34.3 percent annual gain. Japan and Britain joined the United States in the bottom 10.
 The extent to which stock market capitalism has been embraced around the world is indicated by the fact that the market that came in 24th -- between Norway and Austria -- is Vietnam, where the Ho Chi Minh index rose at an annual rate of 42.6 percent over the five-year period. 
 That performance fell a bit short of the 43.8 percent annual gain for the Russian RTS Index but was a full 10 percentage points better than the 32.6 percent return shown by the Shanghai composite index in China. It paled next to the gains of 83.7 percent shown by Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union, and 77.1 percent in Bulgaria, once a Soviet satellite.
 Many of the national stock markets are very small -- the Ho Chi Minh index has 118 companies, many of them worth less than $1 million -- and even a little foreign capital can drive them up rapidly. Still, the expansion of stock markets around the world is not complete. There are, as yet, no indexes named after Fidel Castro or Kim Il-sung.

HEADLINE: Causes of Homelessness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The problem of denying shelter to families seeking a warm place to stay, particularly as we move into the colder months, is not a question of bureaucratic eligibility but a larger, more tragic issue: families living at or close to the poverty level increasingly finding themselves inching closer to the door of a homeless shelter (''Homeless Families in New York Lose a Loophole,'' news article, Oct. 11). 
 Exorbitant housing costs, coupled with the rise in food, fuel and other everyday living expenses, have made it increasingly difficult for many New Yorkers to live with a modicum of dignity, most especially those who already reside at the lowest end of the economic spectrum. 
 Advocates, social service agencies and the city would do well to focus on services to ameliorate the underlying causes of homelessness, including job training, access to health care and lack of affordable housing. By failing to do so, we risk perpetuating the tragic cycle of poverty and homelessness.

HEADLINE: Virgin Group Plans Bid for Venerable British Bank, Now Troubled

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
The Virgin Group said Friday that it planned to bid with a consortium for Northern Rock, the troubled British bank that sought emergency funding from the Bank of England last month, and would combine it with its own financial services business. 
 Virgin, which is headed by Richard Branson, teamed up with a group that includes the insurer American International Group; Toscafund Asset Management, a fund focusing on investments in the financial services industry; the First Eastern Investment Group, a Hong Kong-based investment group; and WL Ross & Company, founded by the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr.
 The group plans to keep Northern Rock intact and expand it rather than break it up. It also would inject ''a substantial cash sum'' to issue new equity ''at a discount to the current share price,'' it said in a statement.
 Virgin and its partners would rebrand Northern Rock under the Virgin Money brand, which offers credit cards, savings accounts and insurance and wants to expand into mortgages.
 ''Branson has been quite opportunistic in his business moves in the past and arguably the authorities would welcome his plan vis-a-vis a faceless private equity firm,'' said Gerry Rawcliffe, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in London. ''It may be more politically acceptable.''
 Northern Rock, whose origins date to 1850, began seeking a buyer after it ran into trouble during the turmoil in global credit markets this summer.
 The bank relies on capital markets rather than deposits for new home loans and was one of the hardest hit by rising credit costs, forcing it to seek emergency credit from the Bank of England.
 That caused a panic among many of its customers, who formed long lines outside the bank's branches to withdraw their savings, leading the government to step in and guarantee customer deposits.
 Potential bidders include J. C. Flowers, the private equity company, and Cerberus Capital Management, a buyout firm based in New York with experience in acquiring troubled lenders. The Blackstone Group and Apollo Management have also expressed an interest.
 Spokesmen at Apollo, Blackstone and Cerberus would not comment on Northern Rock, and a spokesman for J. C. Flowers had no comment.
 James Hutson, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a note to investors on Friday that while the Virgin-led group failed to address the ''pressing funding/liquidity issues,'' the proposal should serve to draw out other proposals from entities currently sitting on the sidelines, including J. C. Flowers.
 The group said that Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, would manage the combined business. Ms. Gadhia is the former chief executive of Virgin One, a mortgage joint venture that Virgin had with Royal Bank of Scotland in the 1990s before the British bank bought Virgin's part of the unit.
 Shares of Northern Rock rose 5.9 pence to $:2.7 in London, giving the bank a market value of about $:1.35 billion ($2.7 billion). The stock had declined more than 50 percent since the bank announced on Sept. 14 that it was seeking emergency financing.
 Northern Rock is one of Britain's largest lenders by gross mortgages, with loans worth $:17.4 billion as of June 30.

HEADLINE: The Risks To Google's Rise

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR. 
Miguel Helft contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Can anything stop the ascent of Google's stock? 
 When the company's shares pierced $600 for the first time last Monday, Wall Street analysts scrambled to jack up their price targets, most to about $700. Jim Cramer, the high-decibel CNBC talk-show host, told his audience on Wednesday night ''never to take financial advice from anyone who doesn't recommend Google.''
 Google closed the week at $637.39, more than 50 times its earnings, giving it a market capitalization that nearly equals the total value of the three largest traditional media companies: Time Warner, Walt Disney and the News Corporation. Even at Google's current stock price, 34 of the 38 analysts following the company have buy recommendations, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter in Nashua, N.H., is one of the few willing to call Google's stock surge ''insanity.'' But even he isn't predicting when it might end. He has placed a tiny bet against Google, but no more. ''You cannot short a mania,'' he said. 
 What could reset expectations about Google? What are the risk factors -- short term and longer range -- that could dim the aura of inevitable success that surrounds the company? What could slow the Google juggernaut? 
 The potential threats, according to industry analysts, fall into three broad categories: those from inside the company, those from rivals, and public policy challenges that could bring regulatory controls and tarnish Google's reputation and brand.
 Any big, fast-growing company confronts the ''law of large numbers'' -- that is, growth rates naturally tend to slow as a company gets bigger. That should not be a real issue for Google, analysts say, until it gets to be about twice its current size. 
 In 2007, the company's revenue is projected to reach $11.5 billion, a 58 percent annual increase. Google, they say, is riding a tidal shift in advertising onto the Web that is just getting under way. Today, only 5 to 10 percent of advertising budgets are spent online, even though most Americans now spend as much time on the Web as watching television.
 But in the short term, the number to really watch is Google's spending. Last quarter, expenses that came in higher than anticipated surprised Wall Street and temporarily hit Google's stock price. ''The biggest challenge to Google's stock is going to be if it gets the rap of being an overspender and not rewarding shareholders fully,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Precursor Group.
 Google is hiring at a torrid pace. The company keeps doubling the number of engineers it hires each year, adding 4,000 last year. ''You simply can't maintain the quality at 4,000 hires that you had at 250 or 500 or 1,000,'' said Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington.
 Larry Page, a Google co-founder, said at a conference last week that hiring was a big concern. ''We never have enough people to do what we want,'' he said. ''We always need to hire. But there are limitations to how fast you can recruit people.'' 
 Google is hiring so aggressively to support its ambitious strategy, which now extends well beyond its core business in search and online ads. 
 It has begun offering Web-based software like word processing and spreadsheets -- areas where Microsoft is the dominant supplier. Its coming mobile phone software will put Google in competition with telecommunications companies. With YouTube, which it bought for $1.65 billion last year, Google has become a major distributor of entertainment, which could put it in conflict with cable TV companies. 
 These moves are assaults on huge businesses that have entrenched competitors. Google's management style, geared to nurture individual innovation, may not be suited to the task, analysts say. 
 ''Google needs to make sure that its management culture is in sync with the strategy,'' said Thomas R. Eisenmann, an associate professor at the Harvard Business School. ''I'm not sure the bottom-up approach will do it.''
 Competitors
 ''The great risk to Google is that someday it will face real competition in search,'' said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
 Google looks so strong today in part because of the stumbles of its principal rivals, Yahoo and Microsoft. Both have invested heavily to catch up in search and online ad auctions, but without success so far. In September, Google's share of Web searches in the United States was 67 percent, up from 54 percent a year earlier, reports Compete.com, a Web analytics firm. The Yahoo share was 19 percent, compared with 29 percent a year earlier. And Microsoft had 9 percent, up slightly from a year ago.
 The company's market lead is so large that advertisers tailor their technology to work best on Google ad networks, and Web publishers design their sites to best pull in more Google users.
 Jim Lanzone, chief executive of Ask.com, the fourth-largest search engine with about 4 percent share, sees no ''silver bullet'' that could greatly shift market share. Ask.com is acknowledged as an innovator in using graphics, audio and video in its results. The search market, he said, is so large that Ask.com can thrive by gradually inching forward.
 But Silicon Valley start-ups and venture capitalists are betting that there is room for major innovation in search. Powerset and Haika are two well-financed start-ups working on natural-language search, where a user types a question instead of keywords.
 Google, too, is apparently pursuing disruptive new search technologies. Narayanan Shivakumar, a computer scientist who heads Google's Seattle office, is being given 100 engineers over the next three years to try to come up with search technology that beats its current offering, according to an industry consultant told of the project.
 Google's rising market power could also slow it. George F. Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, was visiting corporate clients across Europe this week. ''Nearly every company I meet here, as in the U.S., sees Google as an enemy or a potential enemy,'' he said from Paris. ''That could close doors for Google and make it harder to do deals with potential partners.''
 Regulation
 Not only Google's market power, but also its reach and influence on how millions of people navigate their digital lives invite scrutiny. Privacy advocates say Google's dominance and practice of keeping search histories of users raise many dangers. Google's vast databases and search tracking, they say, raise the prospect of a corporate Big Brother.
 Google's motto is ''Don't be evil.'' But Privacy International, a London-based organization, ranked Google last among Internet companies and called it ''an endemic threat to privacy.''
 Search engines like Google identify the searches done using a particular computer, rather than actually knowing who is at the keyboard. Yet privacy advocates say that unless rules are in place to limit what kinds of personal data can be collected and how long it can be stored, Google can effectively know who you are without knowing your name.
 The privacy issue, they say, will only increase as Google grows and extends into new markets. ''Google underestimates how strongly people care about privacy and underestimates governments' willingness to take action,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group.
 That group and others have urged the Federal Trade Commission and European authorities to block Google's planned $3.1 billion purchase of the online advertising company DoubleClick, or to make privacy protections a condition of the deal.
 History's Pull
 In technology, dominant companies look invincible for years until they are unseated by the next wave of previously unforeseen innovation. I.B.M. ruled the mainframe era and Microsoft the personal computer boom. Google has emerged as a power of the Internet economy. Huge profits and market power are the rewards for being a keystone company in each era. It is no surprise, then, that I.B.M. and Microsoft were the targets of landmark federal antitrust suits.
 What the next technology wave might be is anyone's guess. But what Wall Street will be looking for is a turn, a shift in momentum. One such shift, analysts suggest, could be a combination of slowing growth and declining profit margins. Google's ad revenue comes mainly from two sources: text ads from its own search results and ads it places on the Web sites of other companies. On the latter, it pays 80 cents or so of each dollar to the Web site and keeps the rest. Increased competition in ad networks, especially from Microsoft, will drive the payouts higher, nibbling away at Google's profits.

HEADLINE: What If C.E.O. Pay Is Fair?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
''I really don't want to answer that question,'' said Ira T. Kay, flashing me some combination of half-grin and half-grimace. ''I have clients.''
 Does he ever. Mr. Kay, 57, heads the executive compensation practice at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, which is one of the country's leading compensation consulting firms. He is a funny, gregarious man, quick with a clever retort, and utterly without guilt about what he does for a living -- not only enabling big-time chief executives to make oodles of money, but defending most of the practices that allow corporate chieftains to reap their millions.
 For years, Mr. Kay has overseen an annual Wyatt Watson executive compensation survey, which the firm describes as an effort to provide ''perspective on the executive pay model in general, pay for performance, stock ownership and share usage.'' The Ira Kay perspective, not surprisingly, is that while there may be a few problems here and there (about which more later), the model is a darn good one. 
 A few months ago, Mr. Kay wrote a book entitled ''Myths and Realities of Executive Pay'' (Cambridge University Press), with Steven Van Putten, a Watson Wyatt colleague, that goes even further. ''It is not a coincidence that the Dow Jones industrial average, which stood at 5,000 in 1996, is now well above 13,000,'' the authors write. ''While U.S. executive pay practices do not entirely explain this rise, there is little doubt that it would not have occurred without them.'' I've heard Mr. Kay make this point before -- and even debated him on it. He really does seem to believe that all of the great economic benefits we've enjoyed in this country during the past two decades or so can be traced back, in no small part, to the way we pay our chief executives. I, on the other hand, believe he's got the cause and effect exactly backward: that it was the rising market that made the lucky fellas running America's corporations look like geniuses -- and made them richer than they'd ever imagined, thanks to the shift to stock options as the primary way to reward executives.
 When I went to see him this week to talk about his book, Mr. Kay made the point in a more specific, Gordon Gekko kind of way. ''There is no question,'' he told me, ''that these programs motivate superior performance. They cause C.E.O.'s to make difficult decisions that are otherwise unpleasant. They sell off businesses. They move offshore. The desire for personal gain causes them to do the hard stuff.'' In other words, greed is good.
 But then I asked him the question that caught him up short. I wanted to know whether he believed that the many critics of executive compensation -- all of us who think there is something fundamentally wrong with a system that allows the C.E.O. to make 400 times what the average worker makes -- were practicing a form of class warfare? In other words, is there a moral element to the debate over C.E.O. pay? Those were the questions the normally loquacious Mr. Kay didn't want to answer. They are also questions, I realized, that I've been avoiding as well.
 Here's a thought exercise. Suppose we lived in an ideal world, where the pay-for-performance system of executive compensation was a reality, instead of the mirage it is today. Suppose that boards of directors actually conducted tough arms-length negotiations with chief executives. And chief executives had deals that brought them mega-wealth only if the company's profits rose sharply and the stock price went up. And that if they failed to increase profits and the stock price, and got fired, they didn't get to line their pockets on their way out the door. If that were the case, would you still be outraged at the staggering sums chief executives make? 
 Interesting question, isn't it? Among institutional investors and in the media, the argument against multimillion-dollar C.E.O. pay packages is almost always phrased as a problem with the pay-for-performance model that Mr. Kay so stoutly defends. For instance, the furor that arose last year over the compensation of Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot, was not simply that he made an outrageous amount of money -- but that Home Depot's stock price hadn't done a thing in the five years he'd run the company. His pay didn't justify his performance. 
 But it's hard to believe that those leading the charge against his pay package, starting with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, weren't upset mainly by the fact that Mr. Nardelli had a $200 million pay package in the first place -- no matter how he had performed. Indeed, if you go to the Web site of many of the big unions -- not to mention the many religious organizations that have taken to shareholder activism -- you'll see manifestoes decrying the enormous C.E.O. pay packages that are par for the course today. Many of them are especially mournful of the growing gap between the pay of the chief executive and that of the average employees. When the big unions target underperforming C.E.O.'s each year, they are doing so mainly because it is the easiest way to generate outrage over the fact that all chief executives are paid so much.
 I've long been a member of the ''chief executives make too much'' school. I think executive compensation is a socially corrosive issue, especially when the middle class is struggling. I think it creates morale problems when the C.E.O. makes so much more than even other top executives. But what offends me most is a somewhat different issue: that the market for executive compensation is so clearly rigged. Chief executives sit on one another's boards, so they have an incentive to take care of one another. Directors are predisposed to want to make the chief executive happy since, after all, he or she is the one who picked them for the board. Far too often, a chief executive's pay isn't a result of an arms-length negotiation, but a result of a kind of a corporate buddy system.
 Mr. Kay, of course, insists that there is a real market for C.E.O. pay -- rather than the rigged market I just described -- though he does grant that ''C.E.O.'s have relative power compared to their boards.'' He can cite statistic after statistic, using such measures as ''realizable long-term incentive pay,'' showing that high-performing chief executives put more money in their pockets than those whose companies do poorly. 
 But what struck me in speaking to him was the way in which he himself seemed to acknowledge that, at long last, the game itself was becoming at least a little less rigged. The constant clamor by institutional investors has had an effect on boards, he said. What's more, ''boards are starting to play hardball on severance, pensions and perquisites.'' He added, ''It is a strategic shift in the labor market, because these goodies used to come with the package.''
 Indeed, he told me he had begun recommending to boards that the severance packages for chief executives, which have been such a source of controversy, be pared back, especially for chief executives who have been on the job for a while and have reaped considerable compensation rewards. Two companies, he added, had agreed to do so -- though he declined to identify them. (They're clients after all.) A few days after he spoke to me, Mr. Kay spoke at a conference run by Jesse M. Brill, one of the loudest executive compensation critics and publisher of CompensationStandards.com. When I spoke to Mr. Brill the day before the conference, he was practically beside himself with excitement -- Mr. Kay, he told me, was going to publicly denounce outsize, and unnecessary, severance packages. ''It's a very big deal,'' he said.
 And it could be -- if it leads other compensation consultants to follow his lead, and boards to begin rethinking big severance packages for C.E.O.'s who have either failed to perform or have been in the job so long they have already reaped tremendous rewards. But it's also just a start. What we really need is confidence that boards are finally treating the shareholders' money as if it were their own -- and negotiating as fiercely as, say, Theo Epstein of the Boston Red Sox negotiates with Scott Boras, the famous player's agent. Which leads to one last thought exercise. Baseball players also make outsize salaries, as do actors and rock stars. You could easily make the argument that their pay is also socially corrosive -- part of the growing gap between rich and poor -- and even unfair given how little teachers make by comparison. But even many of the same people who think C.E.O.'s are paid too much don't take the same position about these other highly paid professions. 
 Why not? The reason, I'm convinced, is that we feel confident that they are being paid what the market says they're worth. Their compensation has been set by a real market, not a rigged one. And markets, in the end, aren't moral or immoral. They just are. We accept their judgment.
 I asked Lucian Bebchuk, the big compensation critic at Harvard, what would happen if C.E.O. pay was finally subjected to real market forces. My worry is that it has risen so high in the rigged market that it would never come down, even in a real one. Professor Bebchuk disagreed. ''We cannot predict the true market level because we have not had a well functioning market,'' he said. ''But markets do adjust. If the true market level were significantly below the current level, then compensation would go down. It wouldn't happen overnight, but it would happen.''
 And if it didn't come down? If it turned out that in a real market for C.E.O. pay, their compensation remained in the stratosphere? I might not like it, but I could live with it.
 Could you?

HEADLINE: The All-Too-Easy Route to Stardom

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Kim Kardashian came upon her career -- as a person famous simply by dint of her aspiration to be -- in the estimable way of the quattrocento masters: she apprenticed. 
 As a child of Beverly Hills, she has had access to the best possible tutelage. Her friend Paris Hilton has seemed to guide her in the ways of dressing and appearing and responding to the supposedly unauthorized release of sex tapes. Like her friend, Ms. Kardashian has been involved in filmed acts of sexual rambunctiousness, which inexplicably became public. Isn't it always the way; just when you think the Internet is going to produce some raunchy footage of Christopher Hitchens, it is another tape of a nubile young woman angling to join the ranks of the dubiously recognized that shows up.
 The surfacing of this tape -- in which Ms. Kardashian appears, not debating economic sanctions against Iran, with a former boyfriend, the hip-hop artist Ray J -- was a mixed bag for her mother, we learn in ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians,'' a reality series that begins on E! tomorrow night. As a parent, Ms. Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, was concerned for her daughter, she explains. But as her manager, she thought, well, hot-diggity. 
 ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians,'' is, as the title suggests, a window into a family -- a family that seems to understand itself only in terms of its collective opportunism. Ms. Kardashian, her sisters and younger brother are the children of Robert Kardashian, the Los Angeles marketing executive, now dead, who renewed his legal license to come to the defense of his close friend O. J. Simpson in his murder trial. Acting as patriarch of the family now is Bruce Jenner, the 1976 Olympic gold medalist whose emasculation would seem to begin with the absence of his name from the show's title, even though he is the only person in his household to have actually accomplished anything. 
 Mr. Jenner seems to function now more or less as a domestic and weak-willed disciplinarian, performing tasks like preventing his own youngest daughters from performing acrobatics on a stripper's pole erected in one of the Kardashian-Jenner bedrooms. His wife is preoccupied with a clothing boutique she runs and ministering to Kim's ascent. Kim, in turn, feels as if her mother overworks her. There is only so much self-objectifying she can handle in any given day.
 I would like to say that ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians'' is as good as the gold standard in its genre: ''Gene Simmons Family Jewels,'' the reality series about Mr. Simmons, the Kiss star; his companion, Shannon Tweed; and their children. But the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier.
 And yet the E! venture still does not deliver the willies inflicted by ''A Shot at Love With Tila Tequila,'' the new reality dating series that made its debut on MTV this week, drawing nearly two million viewers. In one sense, we must celebrate Tila Tequila, who has made it to the levels of quarter-fame assisted not by lineage or connection. No, she gained a following by posing provocatively enough to become one of the most popular curiosities on MySpace. She boldly decided to approach the world as a meritocracy, and she made good.
 As a face and a body, Tila Tequila looks essentially like a very well-toned squirrel. But men love her, and so do women -- hence the premise of her show, which has 16 straight men and 16 lesbians competing for her affections. As one young woman contending for her partnership put it: ''You have to be blind and a little retarded not to find her hot.''
 But if you happen to be among the visually and mentally impaired who do not find Tila Tequila, in all of her sauced-up arrogance, to possess a modicum of charm, wit, sensuality or attractiveness -- if you would rather, as I would, watch a dating show starring Danny DeVito -- then you will wonder why men are courting her with jewelry and perfect abs and bowls of spaghetti, and why the women are dressing up as sexy cabdrivers and hard hats.

HEADLINE: First Woman Takes Reins at Harvard

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard University's first female president, was inaugurated Friday and offered a spirited defense of American higher education against demands that it quantify what it is teaching and focus primarily on training a global work force.
 ''The essence of a university is that it is uniquely accountable to the past and to the future -- not simply or even primarily to the present,'' said Dr. Faust, 60, a Civil War historian and the former head of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at the university. 
 ''A university is not about results in the next quarter,'' Dr. Faust said. ''It is not even about who a student has become by graduation. It is about learning that molds a lifetime, learning that transmits the heritage of millennia; learning that shapes the future.''
 In clear opposition to pressure from the federal government for universities to prove they are accountable by quantifying how well they teach, she called on higher education institutions themselves ''to seize the initiative in defining what we are accountable for.''
 In an interview before the inauguration ceremony, Dr. Faust faulted a federal Commission on the future of Higher Education empanelled by the Bush administration for its focus on training a competitive work force for the global economy. While higher education makes ''a fundamental contribution to training a work force,'' she said, it should strive to be far more than that.
 She paraphrased W. E. B. DuBois: ''Education is not to make men carpenters so much as to make carpenters men.''
 The commission, which was put in place by Margaret Spellings, the education secretary, in its final report last year called for public universities to measure learning with standardized tests, for federal monitoring of college quality and for sweeping changes in financial aid. 
 Dr. Faust's speech offered a ringing defense of the traditional role of universities as ''stewards of living tradition,'' as places for ''philosophers as well as scientists,'' where learning and knowledge are pursued in part ''because they define what has over centuries made us human, not because they can enhance our global competitiveness.''
 Dr. Faust's ascension to the presidency of the nation's oldest university came more than a year after Lawrence H. Summers, a former treasury secretary, stepped down after a five-year tenure that drew widespread faculty discontent. He set off a storm by suggesting that a lack of intrinsic aptitude could help explain why fewer women than men reach the top ranks of science and math in universities. Derek Bok, a former Harvard president, served as an interim replacement. 
 Dr. Faust had Dr. Summers, Dr. Bok and another former Harvard president, Neil Rudenstine, sitting nearby on stage on Friday, and at one point she and Dr. Summers embraced. In the interview she said that the University of California had erred by withdrawing a speaking invitation to him after a faculty petition.
 With her two-day inauguration festivities that included African dancers; a reading by Toni Morrison; and speeches by the historian John Hope Franklin and Deval Patrick, a Harvard graduate who is the first black governor of Massachusetts, Dr. Faust also signaled that universities like Harvard had to diversify their ranks. 
 ''Those who long for a lost golden age of higher education should think about the very limited population that alleged utopia actually served,'' she said. ''College used to be a restricted to a tiny elite; now it serves the many, not just the few.''
 She noted that American colleges had served as ''both the emblem and the engine of the expansion of citizenship, equality and opportunity -- to blacks, women, Jews, immigrants, and others who would have been subjected to quotas or excluded altogether in an earlier era.''
 She added: ''My presence here today -- and indeed that of many others on this platform -- would have been unimaginable even a few short years ago.''
 She did not use the speech to lay out specific plans about what she hopes to accomplish in the months ahead, but instead set out the values and themes that she said she hoped would define her tenure. She did however affirm Harvard's commitment to making its education ''available and affordable.'' Dr. Summers made it possible for students from families with incomes of less than $60,000 a year to attend Harvard without incurring debt.
 She talked about the importance of Harvard being at the forefront of scientific research, and of providing the resources for a new science complex that will include stem cell research. At the same time, she also emphasized the traditional humanistic values of the university.
 ''It is urgent,'' she said, ''that we pose the questions of ethics and meaning that will enable us to confront the human, the social and the moral significance of our changing relationship with the natural world.''

HEADLINE: Energy Crunch Threatens South American Nations

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile 

 BODY:
For Chile and Argentina, it was the frostiest of winters, and not just the reading on the thermometer.
 During one of the coldest South American winters here in decades, neighboring Argentina cut at least 90 percent of the natural gas it sends to Chile 79 times along pipelines that connect the two countries.
 Power plants and factories in this smoggy capital were forced to switch to diesel and fuel oil, which belch more air pollution and have nearly quadrupled the cost of producing electricity. Santiago reported its highest number of dangerous smog days in the past seven years. 
 Argentina's actions have chilled relations between the two countries. But the impact of South America's energy crisis is far broader. Across the region, concerns about energy are roiling national politics, generating tensions between neighbors and emerging as one of the biggest brakes to growth and integration. 
 Energy is the Achilles' heel of the governments in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, which are struggling to maintain sufficient natural gas supplies after several years of strong economic growth. 
 ''Bottlenecks in energy supply will be a critical policy concern in Latin America over the next two to five years,'' said Christopher Garman, the Latin America director at Eurasia Group, a New York-based consulting firm. 
 Energy concerns are at the top of the agenda for the region's incumbent leaders, most of whom have high popularity ratings, thanks mostly to buoyant economies riding a wave of higher commodity prices.
 But the steady economic growth has only increased energy demand, while governments have failed for a decade to invest enough in natural gas exploration and new power plants to expand their energy supplies. 
 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is particularly preoccupied with the risk of power shortages that could occur as early as 2009, according to analysts. In an interview in September, he said the region's gas woes were reason to support new hydroelectric power plants and projects to produce electricity from sugar cane. ''I do not want to make Brazil dependent on gas,'' he said.
 The other alternative is to raise consumer prices or impose austerity measures, something politicians have been reluctant to do. History shows they can help sink a president.
 When Brazil suffered an energy crunch in 2000, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso implored consumers to conserve, imposing penalties on those who did not. In the end, a major crisis was averted, but the government's approval rating dropped by a third, and Mr. da Silva -- not Mr. Cardoso's chosen successor -- was elected in 2002.
 Nestor Kirchner, Argentina's president, has steadfastly refused to raise his country's gas and electricity prices, which are among the lowest in the world, ahead of the Oct. 28 election. Mr. Kirchner's wife, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, is the leading candidate to succeed him. 
 Instead, his government placed winter energy-use restrictions on industries and cut off its neighbor to the west, Chile.
 Mr. Kirchner's strategy has satisfied voters and kept Argentina's economy humming, for now. But the low gas and power prices have scared away needed foreign investment in energy development and raised fears of runaway inflation.
 Argentina could be digging itself a bigger hole to crawl out of. While the government refuses to impose on residential consumers to cut back, Argentina's energy demands are rising faster than supply. 
 Power plants have little or no spare capacity and are suffering from a lack of maintenance, increasing the chances of brownouts or blackouts, said Sylvie D'Apote, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
 Argentina's energy troubles began with the crushing economic crisis of 2001, when its currency, the peso, was devalued almost overnight by some 300 percent. In a panic, the government moved energy rates from dollars to pesos. 
 Suddenly Argentine natural gas was the cheapest in Latin America, and residential electricity rates were among the lowest in the world. 
 For Mrs. Kirchner, if she is elected, changing course would be risky. Raising energy prices would only worsen inflation and raise the ire of Argentine voters, potentially spoiling the Kirchners' plans to tag-team the presidency for the next 12 years. 
 Argentina's economy, which is expected to grow this year by about 8 percent for a fifth straight year, is struggling with rising inflation pegged by private economists at nearly 20 percent, more than double official government claims.
 Mr. Kirchner has denied there is even an energy crisis, noting that residential consumers have yet to feel a pinch. 
 Instead, it is Chile that is being squeezed. With few energy resources of its own, Chile had come to rely on Argentina for natural gas. The neighbors signed contracts in 1994, giving Chile a cheap source of fuel and a way to help clean Santiago's notoriously smoggy air.
 Argentine officials say that the Argentine Congress never approved the energy accords, making them nonbinding. The Chileans call that claim ludicrous.
 The energy crunch is already contributing to inflation in Chile. Chile's inflation is expected to be 6.4 percent this year, nearly a third of which is attributable to the cost of energy and food, said Pablo Goldberg, chief economist for Latin America at Merrill Lynch. 
 Political problems have limited Chile's energy options. Bolivia, which has the largest gas reserves in the region, has forbidden Argentina from re-exporting Bolivian gas to Chile because of a decades-old dispute over maritime access rights. 
 Analysts have doubts in any case about just how much natural gas Bolivia, which nationalized its gas sector last year, can extract without foreign investment. 
 With few options, Chile's government, led by President Michelle Bachelet, is moving on several fronts to diversify its energy supplies. 
 Two liquefied natural gas terminals should be completed by the middle of 2009. Chile is also opening up some land for oil and gas exploration, though it historically has found little. 
 Ms. Bachelet received a government-financed study last week exploring the prospects for building nuclear power plants, which is likely to be a controversial decision for the next government.
 ''We can't just wait with our arms crossed and hope for a miracle to happen,'' said Antonio Baciagalupo, the chief executive of GNL Quintero, the consortium building the liquefied natural gas plant near Santiago.

HEADLINE: 2 Winners, and 2 Approaches to Spreading the Word on Climate

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The dual winners of the Nobel Peace Prize may be united in concern about global warming, but they differ starkly in style and, at times, in scientific substance. 
 One winner, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, speaks in the measured voice of peer-reviewed research and government negotiations. In four reports since 1990, the panel, led by Rajendra K. Pachauri, has always focused on the most noncontroversial findings. In 2001, it concluded, ''There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.''
 The other winner, former Vice President Al Gore, delivers brimstone-laden warnings of an unfolding ''planetary emergency.'' Mr. Gore has not shied from emphasizing the most emotionally potent though less certain consequences of warming like its link to hurricane intensity and rising sea levels. 
 Like many of the panel members interviewed, Gary Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan and a lead author of some of the climate panel's chapters in 2001 and this year, said he was thrilled that the prize elevated the issue. But Mr. Yohe said the focus on Mr. Gore as a personality and politician might distract from researchers' strong consensus on the risks posed by unfettered emissions of heat-trapping gases. ''If the spectacular nature of his presentations and the personalities involved become the story instead of the science,'' Mr. Yohe said, ''then it becomes counterproductive.''
 He and other panel members were queasy about some of Mr. Gore's points that exceeded the panel's assessments. In ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the documentary on Mr. Gore's climate work, a fast-motion flood spills into ground zero, implying seas could rise many feet in the near term from melting Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In the panel's latest study, losing the Greenland sheet was projected to take 1,000 years or more.
 Some scientists, historians and policy experts said both messages, with all the imperfections attending each, seemed necessary to put attention on a looming planet-scale problem. 
 The Nobel ''is honoring the science and the publicity, and they're necessarily different,'' said Spencer A. Weart, a science historian at the American Institute of Physics and the author of ''The Discovery of Global Warming,'' a book charting 100 years of climate research. 
 Dr. Weart added that both were essential because the science alone, laden with complexity and unavoidable uncertainty, would never jog average citizens or most elected officials. 
 ''The I.P.C.C. was set up to be the lowest common denominator, to weed out anything anyone could disagree with,'' he said. ''It was deliberately created, largely under the influence of the Reagan administration, because governments didn't want a bunch of self-appointed scientists from academies and so on out there. 
 ''Even the Saudi government has to agree,'' he said. ''That means that when the I.P.C.C. says you're in trouble, you're really in trouble.''
 If the profile of the issue had not been raised with ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the panel's reports this year would not have had nearly as much impact, experts said. 
 Among those crediting Mr. Gore for elevating the issue -- if differing from him sharply on solutions -- is former Speaker Newt Gingrich. Mr. Gingrich is a co-author of a new book, ''A Contract With the Earth,'' that accepts the notion that human-caused warming poses serious risks and urges the United States to, among other efforts, aggressively develop nonpolluting energy technologies.
 ''In a way, Vice President Gore, by raising the intensity of the issue, by talking about it, raised the challenge for those of us who think there's an alternative to say, 'O.K., right emotions, wrong answer,''' Mr. Gingrich said in an interview this week. ''But then we have an obligation to provide an answer.'' 
 He said he preferred incentives to step up energy research over Mr. Gore's preference for mandatory national and global limits on gases. 
 An expert who was a panel author was more doubtful of the prize-worthy caliber of Mr. Gore and the panel's work. 
 ''The bottom line is that energy demand (and CO2 emissions) continue to rise,'' John R. Christy, a climate expert at the University of Huntsville, Ala., wrote in an e-mail message. 
 Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton who has worked on the climate assessments, said the award correctly recognized the ''long slog'' to accepting that people are pushing on the planet's thermostat.
 ''The award reminds us that expert advice can influence people and policy, that sometimes governments do listen to reason and that the idea that reason can guide human action is very much alive, if not yet fully realized,'' Dr. Oppenheimer said.
 It is time, he added, to break the deadlock over lowering emissions. ''Public attention,'' he said, ''is now engaged at the highest level it will probably ever be.''

HEADLINE: Russian Reservations

 BODY:
Vladimir Putin is a master at bluster and hyperbole, but his latest comments on Iran were especially counterproductive. This week, Mr. Putin asserted that ''we have no real data to claim that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, which makes us believe the country has no such plans.'' In fact, there isno concrete proof of weapons development. But there is enough credible circumstantial evidence to be seriously worried. 
 There's also no excuse for Iran's continued defiance of a Security Council order to halt production of enriched uranium, usable for nuclear fuel or a weapon. Mr. Putin's comments -- and his opposition to tougher sanctions -- will only feed that defiance and lessen the chances for the diplomatic settlement that Mr. Putin says he wants. 
 The Bush administration and Britain -- their credibility after Iraq is shaky to say the least -- aren't the only ones who believe that Tehran wants to do a lot more than generate electricity. France, which strongly opposed the Iraq war, is also raising alarms. The United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is the source of much of the data -- and the questions -- about Iran's program.
 Russia, meanwhile, has been all over the lot -- one day siding with Washington and Europe on the need to contain Tehran's nuclear ambitions and the next one denying the threat. Russia's geographical proximity to Iran makes at least some Kremlin aides nervous, but most of the time they seem more interested in Iran's oil riches and its willingness to spend a chunk of that cash on Russian made weapons and other technology. 
 Such deals will likely be high on Mr. Putin's agenda when he visits Tehran next week. But he should not let them blind him to the very real threat that would be posed by a nuclear-armed Iran. He could do a lot more good for Russia -- and his own credibility -- if he told the Iranians that they must halt enrichment and accept Europe's and Washington's offers of economic and diplomatic payoffs if they do.

HEADLINE: As Logging Fades, Rich Carve Up Open Land

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: WHITEFISH, Mont. 

 BODY:
William P. Foley II pointed to the mountain. Owns it, mostly. A timber company began logging in view of his front yard a few years back. He thought they were cutting too much, so he bought the land. 
 Mr. Foley belongs to a new wave of investors and landowners across the West who are snapping up open spaces as private playgrounds on the borders of national parks and national forests. 
 In style and temperament, this new money differs greatly from the Western land barons of old -- the timber magnates, copper kings and cattlemen who created the extraction-based economy that dominated the region for a century.
 Mr. Foley, 62, standing by his private pond, his horses grazing in the distance, proudly calls himself a conservationist who wants Montana to stay as wild as possible. That does not mean no development and no profit. Mr. Foley, the chairman of a major title insurance company, Fidelity National Financial, based in Florida, also owns a chain of Montana restaurants, a ski resort and a huge cattle ranch on which he is building homes. 
 But arriving here already rich and in love with the landscape, he said, also means his profit motive is different.
 ''A lot of it is more for fun than for making money,'' said Mr. Foley, who estimates he has invested about $125 million in Montana in the past few years, mostly in real estate.
 The rise of a new landed gentry in the West is partly another expression of gilded age economics in America; the super-wealthy elite wades ashore where it will.
 With the timber industry in steep decline, recreation is pushing aside logging as the biggest undertaking in the national forests and grasslands, making nearby private tracts more desirable -- and valuable, in a sort of ratchet effect -- to people who enjoy outdoor activities and ample elbow room and who have the means to take title to what they want. 
 Some old-line logging companies, including Plum Creek Timber, the country's largest private landowner, are cashing in, putting tens of thousands of wooded acres on the market from Montana to Oregon. Plum Creek, which owns about 1.2 million acres here in Montana alone, is getting up to $29,000 an acre for land that was worth perhaps $500 an acre for timber cutting.
 ''Everybody wants to buy a 640-acre section of forest that's next to the U.S. Forest Service or one of the wilderness areas,'' said Plum Creek's president and chief executive, Rick Holley.
 As a result, population is surging in areas surrounding national forests and national parks, with open spaces being carved up into sprawling wooded plots, enough for a house and no nosy neighbors.
 Here in Flathead County, on the western edge of Glacier National Park, the number of real estate transactions, mostly for open land, rose by 30 percent from 2003 to 2006, according to state figures. The county's population is up 44 percent since 1990.
 The United States Forest Service projects that over the next 25 years, an area the size of Maine -- all of it bordering the national forests and grasslands -- will face development pressure and increased housing density.
 But the equally important force is the change in ownership. According to a Forest Service study, not yet published, more than 1.1 million new families became owners of an acre or more of private forest from 1993 to 2006 in the lower 48 states, a 12 percent increase. And almost all the net growth, about seven million acres, was in the Rocky Mountain region. 
 Institutions, pension funds and real estate investment trusts have been particularly aggressive buyers. Over the last 10 years, at least 40 million acres of private forest land have changed hands nationwide, said Bob Izlar, the director of the Center for Forest Business at the University of Georgia. It is a turnover that Mr. Izlar said was unmatched at least since the Great Depression.
 Here in the West, questions of clout and class have been raised by the new arrivals.
 This year, the conservation group Trout Unlimited, which had been considering ending its involvement in disputes between private landowners and fishermen over public access to fishing streams, backtracked after its members rose up in protest. Some members accused the group of siding with the landowners by not fighting for fishermen's access rights.
 In parts of Colorado where communities have committed tax money to preserve open space, conflicts have erupted on the borders of the public lands over whether the programs -- which in many cases buy out an owner's right to develop property, but not the property itself -- are simply enriching landowners who keep the land and the public off, too.
 ''When you're there, you're on four million acres,'' said Michael Carricarte, who bought an 800-acre property in Glenwood Springs, Colo., in 2005, and now has the place, bordered on three sides by federal land, up for sale, asking $23.5 million.
 ''To get to where our property touched public land would take three hours by public road, but from our house it was 10 minutes by four-wheeler or Jeep,'' he said. 
 Mr. Carricarte, 39, said he was now in the process of selling a conservation easement to the Aspen Valley Land Trust that would lock 600 acres, all bordering public land, into permanent preservation.
 Longtime residents tied to the old timber economy are finding it difficult to keep up. In parts of New Mexico and Colorado, the timber industry has all but collapsed; log harvests in the national forests have fallen to about one-fourth of what they were 20 years ago in the Rocky Mountain region, and less than a tenth what they were in the Pacific Northwest.
 Some privately owned timberlands have increased production, but in the West, where more than two-thirds of all forest land is publicly owned (compared with about one-sixth in the eastern United States) private owners, even if they want to allow logging, cannot make up the difference.
 Ronald H. Buentemeier, a second-generation forester, said he struggled every day to get enough wood to stoke the family-owned mill he runs in Montana, the F. H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company. 
 ''There's not enough private land out there,'' said Mr. Buentemeier, a blunt-talking 66-year-old with a flat-top crew cut. ''We've been pulling rabbits out of the hat to keep going.''
 In ways that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, environmentalists and representatives of the timber industry are reaching across the table, drafting plans that would get loggers back into the national forests in exchange for agreements that would set aside certain areas for protection. 
 Both groups are feeling under siege: timber executives because of the decline in logging, and environmentalists because of the explosion of growth on the margins of the public lands.
 One of the most ambitious proposals is here in Montana. It would allow some logging in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge National Forests in the state's southwest corner in exchange for the designation of new areas within the forests as permanent wilderness. 
 Some timber companies say that gaining conservationists as allies may be the only way to get back into the national forests, and so stay in business. But both sides say that success will require a turn of the historical momentum against logging in the West that began in the early '90s.
 A court decision in 1991 involving the northern spotted owl required the Forest Service to manage for more than just timber production. The national forests in the northern Rockies constricted logging, fostering expansion in other forest areas like the South.
 ''If there's anything the industry should have learned over the years, it's that we can't do this by ourselves,'' said Gordy Sanders, the resource manager at Pyramid Mountain Lumber, one of the mill operators involved in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge negotiations. 
 Many environmentalists say they have come to realize that cutting down trees, if done responsibly, is not the worst thing that can happen to a forest, when the alternative is selling the land to people who want to build houses. 
 Stoltze Land and Lumber, for example, which owns about 36,000 acres near the border of Glacier National Park, has said that the failure of the logging industry would leave the company no option but to sell land into the booming development market.
 That prospect chills the blood of people like Anne Dahl, the director of the Swan Valley Ecosystem Center, a conservation and education group.
 ''I'm a former tree hugger who was opposed to everything, every timber sale,'' Ms. Dahl said, ''but now I see that the worst thing you can do is lose it all to development.'' 
 Other new partnerships are emerging. Last year, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Indian tribes, which have a reservation south of Whitefish, joined with conservationists to buy a square mile of land from Plum Creek that was deemed crucial to the endangered bull trout. 
 The tribes chipped in $4.8 million, half the purchase price, and the Trust for Public Lands put together the other half. The two parties recently completed a plan to manage the property jointly, said the Salish and Kootenai tribal chairman, James Steele Jr. 
 Plum Creek, based in Seattle, changed its corporate structure in 1999 to become a real estate investment trust. Some Plum Creek property has been bought by conservation groups, including about 68,000 acres in the Blackfoot Valley northwest of Helena. Negotiations continue for more conservation sales, with money surging into funds organized by groups like the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Lands. 
 Mr. Holley, the Plum Creek executive, said that his company was committed to both the timber and real estate businesses, but that only a small percentage of its land, perhaps 30,000 acres or so, had the combination of attractions -- proximity to public lands but also to other amenities, like shopping and restaurants -- to make sale for development feasible.
 The Forest Service, meanwhile, is struggling to find its own balance. A spokesman for the agency said that the national forests across the West were increasingly tilting toward recreation and away from logging. But the growth in population on the forests' edge also means more need than ever to thin the trees, through some logging, if only for wildfire protection.
 Tom Tidwell, the regional forester for 25 million acres of national forest that includes Montana, northern Idaho, North Dakota and part of South Dakota, said the Forest Service was eager to keep timber companies in business to help with the thinning.
 ''We're more in the need of the industry,'' Mr. Tidwell said. ''It's essential that we have someone to do that work so that taxpayers don't have to pay for it.''
 One broiling and unresolved issue is who gets to use the land as it changes hands.
 Most private timber tracts in the West, including those owned by Plum Creek, have traditionally been open to recreational use, treated as public entry ways into the vast national forests, grasslands and wilderness areas that in Montana alone add up to nearly 46,000 square miles, about the size of New York State. But in many places, the new owners are throwing up no trespassing signs and fences, blocking what generations of residents across the West have taken for granted -- open and beckoning access into the woods to fish, hunt and camp.
 ''Part of our character is that we have so much big sky and open country,'' said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a Democrat who has publicly sparred with Plum Creek about its land sales. ''We're going to have to be creative. There's no textbook written on how to do this.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS With Modest Good News, Modest Gains

BYLINE: BY MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Retail sales jumped and inflation appeared tame in September, the government reported yesterday, adding to the string of brighter news for the economy and cementing the consensus among analysts and investors that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady when it meets at the end of the month.
 The unexpected uptick in consumer spending suggests that economic growth may be stronger than economists previously thought. Retail sales rose 0.6 percent, more than forecast, and core wholesale prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.1 percent, slowing slightly from August. 
With an improving employment outlook and a narrowing trade deficit, the Fed now faces a more resilient economy that appears to have so far avoided serious damage from the housing turmoil and market swings of recent weeks.
 ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said David Kelly, an economist at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company in Boston. ''The American economy is basically strong enough right now to weather the housing downtrend. The Federal Reserve doesn't need to do anything else.''
 Markets responded with modest gains, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 7.39 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 1,561.80. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 14,093.08, up 77.96 points. Technology stocks led the increases, buoyed by news of Oracle's takeover bid for BEA Systems and hopes that acquisitions would pick up again after a slow summer.
 A consumer sentiment survey released yesterday suggested some uncertainty about whether the spending increase would hold up. Consumer confidence was flat in September, holding steady at the lowest level in a year, according to the University of Michigan, which conducted the survey.
 But the sentiment measure is not considered a reliable predictor of the economy. With the Fed convening for a two-day meeting on Oct. 30, analysts said the current economic data would delay any additional rate cuts.
 ''I think the Fed, at this stage, has really no choice but to hold off another cut,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, a research firm in Princeton, N.J. 
 ''If there's any uncertainty on the part of the Fed as to whether there are inflation pressures picking up,'' Mr. Baumohl said in response to signs of higher energy prices, ''they're going to err on the safe side and not lower rates.''
 Investors betting on the Fed's actions yesterday increased the probability that the target interest rate would stay unchanged at the October meeting. The market now expects a rate cut to come early next year, though some analysts predict a cut sooner.
 Indeed, some economists cautioned against drawing larger conclusions from yesterday's data.
 ''The trend in sales has been down for over a year now, and this is a temporary blitz,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ''It means nothing in terms of the underlying trend.'' 
 Mr. Shepherdson attributed much of September's sales increase to automobiles, reflecting the seasonal discount used by dealers to prepare for the next model year. Retail sales excluding gasoline and automobile purchases rose 0.2 percent in September, compared with a 0.1 percent decrease in August.
 ''To me, this is not exactly evidence of a strong consumer,'' Mr. Shepherdson said.
 Over all, the 0.6 percent increase in September retail sales was twice the August rate of 0.3 percent. Gasoline sales rose 2 percent, their largest increase since May. Department store business continued to dwindle, dipping 0.5 percent in August. And spending in restaurants remained unchanged since July.
 On the inflation front, energy costs at the producer level spiked in September, as wholesale gasoline prices jumped 8.4 percent. Prices for passenger cars and computers fell.

HEADLINE: A Little Mexican Cafe, Built on Persistence

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
E-mail: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN Gladys and Jose Remache arrived in the United States from the Mexican state of Puebla 16 years ago, they did what many poor immigrants have traditionally done: obtained jobs on the bottom rungs of the economy.
 Ms. Remache, who had not gone beyond the first grade and had worked in a factory in Mexico, obtained a factory job in New York City. Mr. Remache, whose formal education had stopped with his graduation from elementary school, and who had done construction work in Mexico, landed a job washing dishes in a fast-food restaurant.
 During the next decade, Ms. Remache moved on to another factory, cleaned people's homes and held cooking and serving jobs in Mexican restaurants in Queens. Her husband became a cook at a diner in Manhattan and later a cook and a manager at another Manhattan restaurant. 
 Then, in 2002, they made a big move: With $50,000 -- most of their savings -- they bought a small Greek diner in East Harlem in Manhattan, their first attempt at business ownership. The start was rocky, and a lack of customers caused them to consider closing after six months, Ms. Remache said. 
 But then they changed to a predominantly Mexican menu and found success, despite competing with a plethora of other Latino restaurants in the neighborhood. The business gradually grew to the point that ''we can pay the bills and live,'' Ms. Remache said. 
 The 40-seat restaurant, called Kahlua's Cafe and Restaurant, on Third Avenue near 116th Street, is a cheerful spot with bright yellow walls and yellow tablecloths. Entrees include shrimp a la Mexicana, priced at $11.50, and grilled steak with rice, beans and guacamole, at $9.50
 The story of the Remaches sheds a personal light on statistics that the Census Bureau recently circulated as part of National Hispanic Heritage Month, a Congressionally designated period from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 each year.
 From 1997 to 2002, there was a 31 percent increase in the number of businesses in the 50 states and the District of Columbia owned by people of Hispanic origin. That was triple the 10 percent gain in the number of all businesses in the country during that period, the most recent for which the Census Bureau has issued such data. In 2002, nearly 200,000 of the 1.6 million Hispanic-owned businesses had at least one paid worker other than the owner.
 Hispanic-owned businesses accounted for 7 percent of the 23 million businesses in the country in 2002 -- a percentage likely to have risen since then, given population shifts. The Census Bureau has estimated that as of last year, the Hispanic population was 44.3 million, or 15 percent of the nation's total, making it the country's largest ethnic or racial minority.
 New York led the states in growth of Hispanic-owned businesses in the 1997-2002 period, with a 57 percent increase. It had a total of 164,000 such businesses in 2002 -- not as high as California, with 428,000; Texas, with 319,000; and Florida, with 267,000, the Census Bureau reported.
 Financial help can be crucial to the success and growth of these businesses. Last year, while Kahlua's fortunes were on the upswing, Ms. Remache sought a $20,000 loan for an expansion at the back of the restaurant. Three banks rejected her request, she said, telling her that she lacked a credit history.
 MS. REMACHE later obtained two loans totaling $20,000 from Accion New York, a nonprofit organization that focuses on immigrants and provides business loans of $500 to $50,000 to people whose credit histories, or lack thereof, prompt rejections by banks. 
 ''We saw her dedication to improving her credit history,'' said Laura Kozien, a spokeswoman for Accion New York.
 Since the founding of Accion New York in 1991, it has had a repayment rate of nearly 95 percent on the 10,500 loans it has made totaling $73 million, Ms. Kozien said.
 Meanwhile, at Kahlua's, the Remaches -- who are both 41 and are raising a 13-year-old daughter -- put in long workweeks. Both are at the restaurant seven days a week; they employ six full-time workers and one part-timer.
 Despite the long hours, Ms. Remache said she felt fulfilled. ''I accomplished a dream I had with my husband,'' she said.

HEADLINE: HUD Tightens the Rules

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS Congress debates legislation that would help borrowers in high-cost areas find more affordable mortgages, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is no longer insuring mortgages for borrowers who receive down-payment help from sellers. 
 A cottage industry has emerged around these so-called ''down-payment assistance programs'' in recent years. When borrowers are considered good risks to be able to handle the monthly payments but lack enough money for a down payment, companies like the Nehemiah Corporation and AmeriDream advance the down-payment money to the buyers. Once the sale closes, the sellers reimburse the companies that amount, plus a fee. 
 HUD says sellers simply increase the sales price by the amount of the ''gift'' -- a contention that Nehemiah, which pioneered this practice, says is not always the case.
 In the past, such arrangements have helped hundreds of thousands of middle- and low-income borrowers qualify for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a HUD agency.
 These loans have lower interest rates and more generous underwriting requirements intended to help such borrowers afford homes. HUD now contends that these down-payment assistance programs are ''schemes'' that encourage borrowers to take on mortgages they ultimately cannot afford.
 HUD says the default rate among borrowers with these loans is twice the rate for borrowers who get down payments through other methods. It adds that reimbursement claims made by lenders in the wake of these bad loans have threatened to destabilize the government's mortgage insurance program.
 In announcing the new policy, effective Oct. 1, Brian Montgomery, the Federal Housing Administration commissioner, said that seller-financed down-payment assistance ''often causes the most vulnerable of home buyers to go into default and, in many cases, lose their home.''
 Despite the statistics, some mortgage industry leaders and members of Congress have questioned HUD's moratorium.
 HUD sought comment before making its ruling permanent, and the Mortgage Bankers Association made its opposition clear. ''While there appears to be much evidence that the seller-funded down-payment assistance has been abused, it is unnecessary to fully eliminate the program in order to address concerns of abuse,'' said John M. Robbins, the association's chairman.
 The group urged HUD instead to establish more comprehensive lending guidelines for borrowers, to set up controls so that borrowers do not end up paying more for homes when they receive this type of down-payment assistance, and to track such loans to conclusively determine the cause of defaults.
 After the ruling, both Nehemiah, based in Sacramento, Calif., and AmeriDream, based in Gaithersburg, Md., filed suit in federal court seeking to have the ruling overturned, calling it ''arbitrary and capricious.'' 
 The outcome of the dispute will have limited effect on borrowers in the New York area, since relatively few meet the income and price limits for F.H.A.-insured loans. But with Congress considering changes to HUD mortgage insurance programs, such loans could become more commonplace in New York. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 21, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The Mortgages column last Sunday, about a decision by the federal government to stop insuring mortgages for borrowers who receive down-payment help from sellers, misstated the effective date of the new policy. It is Oct. 31; it did not begin on Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: A New Home for a Fanciful Collection to Play In

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER HANN

 BODY:
MORRIS TOWNSHIP
 VISITORS entering the Morris Museum's new permanent exhibition of mechanical musical instruments will first come face to face with the Rex Orchestrion, a mammoth contraption designed to replicate an entire orchestra. Built by Popper & Company of Leipzig, Germany, about 1915, it stands nearly 10 feet high and 6 feet wide. Behind its ornate oak facade, the Rex contains a piano, bass and snare drums, organ pipes, orchestra bells, a xylophone and a glockenspiel -- all powered by compressed air. It is an imposing example of Old World craftsmanship kicking off an ambitious exhibition. 
 Next month, the museum will open a $10 million, 4,300-square-foot wing constructed principally to display the Rex Orchestrion and nearly 700 other pieces in the collection of Murtogh D. Guinness. The exhibition opens to the public on Nov. 6. The collection includes dozens of so-called automata, mechanical figures designed to mimic a human or animal in motion, often with musical accompaniment. Clowns, minstrels, snake charmers, prancing peacocks -- the Guinness automata take on many forms. A barrel organ shows Napoleon and Josephine dancing at a court ball; a nearly life-size flautist blinks his eyes and turns his head as he lifts the flute to his mouth and fingers the instrument. 
 The museum will present 150 objects at a time, with the rest on view behind glass walls in a basement storage area. In order to preserve the pieces, museum officials will allow only a 30-minute daily demonstration of a half-dozen objects to be played on a rotating basis. 
 Mr. Guinness, an heir to the Anglo-Irish beer fortune, acquired his beloved musical pieces over more than 60 years preceding his death in January 2002 at 89. His will stipulated that the collection be donated to a museum with enough space to display it. The Morris Museum so coveted the collection, said Steven H. Miller, the executive director, that it issued a $10 million bond through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to build the new wing in time to meet a deadline imposed by the Guinness estate. 
 Built atop what had been a terrace at the center of the building, the wing is part of an 18-month renovation that includes new main entrances to the museum and to the adjoining Bickford Theater. RMJM Hillier of Princeton designed the project, and Lee H. Skolnick Architecture and Design Partnership of New York City arranged the display of the collection. 
 The estate will contribute a seven-figure endowment -- the precise amount has not been determined, Mr. Miller said -- for the care of the collection. Meanwhile, the museum has begun a $15 million fund-raising campaign to repay the bond and supplement its own endowment. 
 The collection represents the most important acquisition in the museum's 94-year history, Mr. Miller said. 
 ''The quality of the collection that Mr. Guinness put together is by all accounts superb,'' Mr. Miller said. ''He had the time, the wherewithal, the means and the ability.'' 
 The collection spans four centuries of European ingenuity but also includes meticulously crafted pieces made at the Regina Music Box Company in Rahway. The smallest item is an 18-karat gold ring made in Geneva circa 1802-1811. Depicting an animated scene of a musical session, the ring contains a quarter-inch-thick mechanism that plays Le Ranz des Vaches -- roughly translated, Song of the Cows -- an ancient herders' ode to the Swiss motherland.
 The largest piece is the Rex Orchestrion, which would have been used in cafes and dance halls, said Ellen Snyder-Grenier, the collection's curator, who called it ''the original jukebox.''
 The Morris Museum will house its Guinness Exhibition in a suite of displays designed to interpret the technological, social and cultural significance of mechanical instruments. A display titled ''Music Revolution'' explores how the growing popularity of music boxes in the late 19th century heralded what Mr. Miller called ''the democratization of music.'' Other displays focus on the manufacturing of automata in Paris in the 19th and early 20th centuries and the science and technology of the instruments. The ''Workshop'' display features hands-on activities for children.
 ''We're in the show-and-tell business,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 First made exclusively for the wealthy, mechanical instruments had become common in middle-class households by the close of the 19th century. The museum's exhibition includes a sepia-tone photograph of a dour-looking Nebraska farm clan, circa 1888, posing for a family portrait with their organette, a small, square music box, placed before them on the dusty ground.
 The story of how the collection found its home has a distinct New Jersey flavor. Mr. Guinness was a close friend of Hughes and Frances Ryder of Summit, local restaurateurs and fellow members of Music Box Society International. He was also a mentor to their sons, Steve and Jeremie Ryder, who later became authorities on mechanical instruments. 
 When Mr. Guinness died, Steve Ryder notified the Morris Museum that his collection would be available, and he has been advising the museum on its presentation; Jeremie Ryder was later named its conservator. 
 Mr. Guinness kept his collection at his two Manhattan town houses, where he entertained visitors whose enthusiasm for it matched his own. His nephew, Desmond Guinness, in a telephone interview from his home near Dublin, recalled many ''jolly evenings together.'' 
 Desmond Guinness inherited one instrument from the collection and lent the piece, a 1907 German player piano with three violins known as a Phonoliszt-Violina, to the museum. ''I love the idea that people will be able to enjoy it,'' he said. ''It was always my favorite.''

HEADLINE: As Angola Rebuilds, Most Find Their Poverty Persists

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola 

 BODY:
Two years ago, only the brave or desperate would attempt the 186-mile drive from this garbage-strewn capital to the northern provincial capital, Uige. It was a 12-hour, teeth-clenching, hair-raising ordeal of dodging tire-blowing potholes and edges of roadway that crumbled into precipices. 
 Now, thanks to Angola's surging oil production, the journey takes half the time. And that is not all that is being transformed: All over Angola, hundreds of workers are rebuilding roads, airports, bridges and railways that were shattered during nearly three decades of civil war. 
 For most Angolans, the drone of road graders and steam shovels is the first tangible evidence of a dividend from their country's oil and diamond wealth, mined in earnest now after five years of peace. Many call it long past due. 
 Angola is gushing oil, pumping 1.5 million barrels a day, more than any other African country except Nigeria. The International Monetary Fund projects a 24 percent economic growth this year -- one of the fastest rates in the world. The government is taking in two and a half times as much money as it did three years ago. 
 But Angolans, by many indications, remain as poor as ever. The poverty rate is a matter of debate: the government claims a 12 percent drop in the past five years; analysts for the Catholic University of Angola's research center say two in three Angolans still live on $2 or less a day, the same percentage as in 2002. Still, no one disputes that most Angolans face appalling living conditions, sky-high infant mortality rates, dirty water, illiteracy and a host of other ills. 
 The United Nations ranked Angola last year as the world's 17th least developed country. In a December poll by a pro-democracy group and the United States Agency for International Development, 6 in 10 Angolans said their economic situation was no better now than five years ago. 
 With elections approaching, the government's huge effort to rebuild the county's infrastructure is intended to help change that. Aguinaldo Jaime, the nation's deputy prime minister, said Angola had taken out between $8 billion and $9 billion in loans from China since 2004, exchanging guarantees of oil supply for reconstruction work. Others, like the World Bank, estimate the Chinese loans at $12 billion. 
 Reconnecting roads and railways, Mr. Jaime said, will help jump-start agriculture and commercial sectors and spread the wealth beyond a small elite. 
 ''The question many people have is that if the economy is growing so fast, when will the population start feeling the benefits?'' he said at a recent lecture here. He answered his own question: ''I have to say it takes time.'' 
 The government's critics argue that progress would be quicker if public officials were not so busy enriching themselves. In 2003, the weekly newspaper Angolese Samanario published a list of the wealthiest people in Angola. Twelve of the top 20 were government officials; five were former government officials.
 Since then, the government has opened some of its financial records. Mr. Jaime said in an interview that some officials had prospered not by stealing public funds, but by exploiting business prospects and Angola's antiquated conflict of interest law. 
 Still, Transparency International, the anticorruption organization, continues to rank Angola as the world's 10th most corrupt nation. Many Angolans take it as a given that those who shop at Luanda's new upscale mall or tool about in Land Cruisers are state officials or their friends. One car dealership manager, who caters to government officials, said he ordered only the costliest luxury cars. ''They want to be first with the latest model,'' he said, speaking anonymously so as not to lose customers. 
 ''Everyone around the president has big business here and abroad,'' said Landu Kama, coordinator of the Coalition for Reconciliation, Transparency and Citizenship, a pro-democracy group. ''These are special Angolans. The rest of Angolans are just part of the landscape.''
 But even critics like Mr. Kama acknowledge that the scenery is changing. Since 2002, the government says, it has rebuilt 2,400 miles of crumbled roads -- more than half of the nation's system -- and renovated airports in Luanda and three other cities. More than 430 miles of new rail track have been laid, officials said. 
 Even once forgotten provincial capitals like Uige are bustling with work crews in royal blue work outfits. One Chinese engineer who identified himself as Tom said his Beijing-based company had sent 100 workers to live in a compound surrounded by half-ruined buildings pockmarked with bullet holes. 
 ''These roads here are terrible, very bad,'' he said as he supervised the widening of a red-dirt road. He said his crew worked 15 hours a day, seven days a week, with only five days off a year. ''There is no rest,'' he said. 
 The pace of the work has picked up as elections have drawn nearer. Angola last held multiparty elections in 1992, after nearly two decades of civil war that followed independence from Portugal. The rebel Union for the Total Independence of Angola accused the governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, of rigging the vote, and war broke out again in 1998 and lasted six more years. Since then, the MPLA-led government has repeatedly promised and put off a new election. 
 Angolans patiently tolerate the delays, analysts say, because their memories of bloodshed are fresh. ''People fear we will have another fight, so we have to keep all these things in low tension,'' said Manuel Alves da Rocha, academic director of Catholic University's research center here. 
 Increasingly, parliamentary elections look likely, with presidential elections tentatively scheduled for 2008. About 7.5 million voters have been registered in the past year, of a total population of 16 million. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has been in power for 28 years, is expected to run, even though he said in 2001 that he would not. 
 That his party would win seems a given. The opposition is weak and co-opted. Nine in 10 Angolans polled in the December survey said the government was doing a good job. But after decades of conflict, self-censorship is a rule of thumb, and true gauges of public sentiment are rare. Analysts predict Angolans who do not like the governing party will stay home rather than vote. 
 Even executives of American oil companies here keep far out of the public eye, saying they do not want to risk offending the government by commenting to the news media. 
 Western diplomats and representatives of financial institutions like the World Bank try to keep up the pressure for elections and good governance measures. But as oil revenues have ballooned, their influence has diminished. This year, Angola joined the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but limited its cooperation with the International Monetary Fund.
 Todd Moss, the American deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said, ''Angola has traditionally been very, very closed'' and ''has not made as much progress as we would like.'' Still, he said, ''We don't want to back them into a corner where they think their only option is to withdraw further.''
 Some Western diplomats say the West missed a major chance to help shape Angola when the United States and other nations turned down the government's request in 2002 to hold a donor conference. Mr. Jaime said that rejection was a major reason that Angola turned to China to finance its reconstruction. 
 ''We are following our own model,'' Mr. Jaime said. ''It is probably not orthodox. But when you have all the basic infrastructure destroyed, there is no other way.''

HEADLINE: A Loser on E-Day, but a Winner Today

BYLINE: By DAVE KINNEY

 BODY:
AMERICA'S most famous automotive flop, the Edsel, just turned 50. And while there were all sorts of grass-roots celebrations, Edsel's parent, the Ford Motor Company, didn't make a fuss. There was no homecoming at headquarters and no big cake shaped like the puckered-mouth grille. Perhaps the five-decade-old memory is still raw, or perhaps Ford is too busy with its own problems.
 But the Edsel rolls on, perhaps causing a bigger stir now than when it was new. It remains a punch line, a symbol of 1950s excess and a cautionary tale of how the best-laid plans can collide with reality. Yet even in ignominy, the car has its fans and fanatics; the Edsel is more desirable today than some contemporaries that were in greater demand when new. 
 Still, these are not valuable collectibles, but cultural curiosities, which is why the Edsel has an appeal that extends beyond the community of car collectors. ''Not unlike animal or sports art, people love it even though it's mostly outside of the realm of critical acclaim or curatorial validation,'' said Edith Yeomans, a fine arts appraiser in Toronto, Ontario.
 The Edsel's buildup was huge. Hints of the car's wonders dribbled out for months before the introduction on Sept. 4, 1957 -- E-Day, it was called. For many consumers, the car fell short of their inflated expectations. In the end, even a giveaway of 1,000 ponies -- intended to get children to bring parents to showrooms -- was a failure.
 Despite several features that were not necessarily innovations -- a vertical grille, self-adjusting brakes, Teletouch transmission buttons on the steering wheel and a floating speedometer that glowed when a preset speed was reached -- the Edsel was panned by the public. Among other things, it was derided for having a grille that looked like a toilet seat. Time magazine popularized the wisecrack that it looked like an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon.
 Ford initially organized Edsel as a stand-alone division, and 1,300 independent dealers were established throughout the country. But in January 1958, sensing a disaster in the making, Ford moved to integrate Edsel with Lincoln and Mercury, creating a division known as M-E-L.
 The Edsel originally came in four series: the Pacer and Ranger were based on the standard Ford body; the fancier Citation and Corsair were built on the bigger Mercury body. For the introductory year of 1958 there were 18 models. For 1959, the Edsel got a single body shared with the '59 Ford, and by 1960 there was little attempt to hide the underlying Ford that peeked out all over.
 The spectacular sales debacle has been attributed to many reasons. Certainly the quality of early Edsels was poor. The cars were built alongside Fords and Mercurys by workers unaccustomed to the different parts and processes. Compounding the problem, some parts ran out; incomplete cars went to dealerships with repair instructions, forcing dealers to cannibalize brand new cars.
 The car came out as a recession was starting, and perhaps worse, a month after E-Day the Soviets launched the first sputnik. The Edsel, trumpeted as a new idea, suddenly seemed a vestige of the past. In ''Sputnik: The Shock of the Century'' (Walker Publishing, 2001), Paul Dickson wrote: ''Sputnik affected national attitudes toward conspicuous consumption, symbolically killing off the market for the Edsel automobile and the decadent automotive tailfin. It was argued that the engineering talents of the nation were being wasted on frivolities.''
 With polarizing looks and haphazard quality, the Edsel languished in a marketplace fearful of an atomic attack. 
 For 1958, prices ranged from the two-door Ranger sedan at $2,484 to the Citation convertible at $3,766. Output plunged from an unremarkable 63,110 for 1958 to 44,891 for 1959 and just 2,846 for the brief 1960 model year, according to The Standard Catalogue of American Cars.
 Edsels sell infrequently at auction, said Jim Cox, owner of Branson Collector Car Auction in Branson, Mo. Mr. Cox has had five Edsels at his auctions in the last five years. ''I get a lot of owners with unreasonable expectations about what their car is worth,'' he said.
 Even so, in the last two years he has sold a '59 Corsair convertible for $23,000 and a '60 Ranger sedan for $8,650. One of the rarest Edsels, a '60 Ranger convertible, got a high bid of $110,000 but did not sell at the recent Kruse Fall Auburn Sale in Auburn, Ind. 
 Phil Skinner, collector car market editor for Kelley Blue Book and past president of the Edsel Owners Club, takes a different view. ''The Edsel is one of the most economical collector cars you can get into,'' he said. But he is a realist as well. Edsel is an acronym, he said, for ''every day someone else laughs.''

HEADLINE: The Sy Empire

BYLINE: By ZEV CHAFETS. 
Zev Chafets is a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of ''A Match Made in Heaven: American Jews, Christian Zionists and One Man's Exploration of the Weird and Wonderful Judeo-Evangelical Alliance.''

 BODY:
Geographically speaking, the Syrian Jewish community of Brooklyn -- 75,000 strong and growing fast -- inhabits an enclave running from Avenue I in the north to Avenue V in the south and stretching eastward to Nostrand Avenue from West 6th Street. But the community's true boundaries are at once more expansive and more constricted.
 The SY's, as the community members call themselves (pronounced ''ess-why'' -- it's a shorthand for ''Syrian''), live in a self-created entrepreneurial and mercantile empire whose current sources of wealth are found everywhere from Coney Island to Shanghai. They are rich beyond the dreams of their immigrant forebears. Many live in multimillion-dollar mansions in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn, summer in fabulous seafront homes on the Jersey shore and repair to winter enclaves in Florida. They have their own synagogue in China. Businessmen from the community spend so much time on the road that a small shop called Seuda's in the Brooklyn enclave prepares packages of kosher Syrian delicacies that can be picked up on the way to the airport. 
 Yet no matter how far they roam or how worldly and successful they become, the SY's of Brooklyn are bound by an invisible fence known as the Edict -- a rabbinical threat of excommunication so dire and so powerful that it has fixed the true parameters of the community for generations.
 The Edict was issued in Brooklyn by five Syrian rabbis in 1935. They had a simple goal: to preserve the age-old Syrian Jewish community in the New World.
 This was not a unique challenge. Every immigrant group in the United States has faced something like it. Most struggle for a generation or two to maintain some sense of identity and solidarity and then make their peace with the assimilative power of America. 
 The Syrian Jews might have done the same. They arrived in New York at the start of the last century and settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. But the Eastern European Jews who dominated the Lower East Side at the time disdained them as Arabische Yidden -- Arab Jews. Some of the Ashkenazim openly doubted that these foreigners from farther east were Jews at all. The Syrian Jews were deeply insulted. They are a proud people; community legend boasts that King David built the first synagogue in Aleppo, in what is now Syria. The SY's came to derisively refer to the Ashkenazim as ''J-Dubs,'' a play on the first and third letters of the English word ''Jew.'' As soon as they could, the Syrians moved, en masse, to Brooklyn. 
 This independence was, in a way, natural. Back in the Ottoman Empire, religious communities that paid their taxes and kept out of trouble were generally allowed to live with a fair degree of autonomy. Why should the New World be different? But the Syrian Jews soon learned that in America, self-sufficiency alone did not ensure their survival. They hadn't reckoned on the additional risk posed by the allure of the open society.
 In the old country, the Syrians had been merchants for generations, and they started off in America as peddlers. As they prospered, they began opening stores in Manhattan. Conducting business outside the enclave meant meeting and dealing with non-Syrians, speaking proper English and demonstrating at least a rudimentary understanding of the customs and practices of the new land. These were skills worth learning. SY kids were sent to public schools to assimilate -- though only up to a point. The goal was to produce children who, in the words of a community maxim, were ''100 percent American in Manhattan and 100 percent Syrian in Brooklyn.''
 In school, though, the SY kids mixed with other children, not only J-Dubs but also gentiles. The gentiles posed the gravest concern. Friendships with them developed, love affairs sprouted. There were intermarriages. Some Christian partners even volunteered to convert to Judaism.
 Enter the rabbis with their Edict, in 1935. They wanted to build an iron wall of self-separation around the community. They couldn't do this the Hassidic way, dressing the men in costumes of ancient design, physically segregating women and making sure that children received nothing in the way of useful secular education. After all, the Syrian men couldn't be expected to make money if they looked like figures from 18th-century Poland.
 And so the rabbis turned to the heart of the matter: matrimony. Most American Jewish communities in those days (and many today) viewed intermarriage as a taboo. Conversion, however, was a loophole. The Edict intended to close that loophole. It proclaimed, ''No male or female member of our community has the right to intermarry with non-Jews; this law covers conversion, which we consider to be fictitious and valueless.''
 A 1946 clarification added specifics: ''The rabbi will not perform Religious Ceremonies'' for such unkosher couples. ''The Congregation's premises will be banned to them for use of any religious or social nature. . . . After death of said person, he or she is not to be buried on the Cemetery of our community . . . regardless of financial considerations.''
 With these words, Chief Rabbi Jacob Kassin effectively excommunicated any member of his flock who married a partner with gentile blood. (There have been exceptions for converts judged to be ''sincere'' -- that is, those who converted without the intention to marry -- but these have been extremely rare and always controversial.)
 The Edict was a bold move. No Jewish community in the world (other than two small Syrian congregations in Mexico and Argentina) has ever had such an extreme rule.
 Of course, enforcing it is something else. The rabbis had no means of coercion. If the Edict was going to work, it would be up to the tightly-knit clans of the enclave to enforce it on their own children.
 At the end of this past August, Jakie Kassin, a community leader, grandson of the author of the Edict and son of the current chief rabbi, received a laminated wooden plaque measuring 4 feet by 2 feet for his inspection. It was the most recent incarnation of the Edict. The original Edict was a document signed by five dignitaries. Since then, it has been reaffirmed in each generation by a progressively larger number of signatories. The newest version, issued last year, was signed by 225 rabbis and lay leaders, testimony to the growth of the community and the enduring power of the Edict.
 ''Never accept a convert or a child born of a convert,'' Kassin told me by phone, summarizing the message. ''Push them away with strong hands from our community. Why? Because we don't want gentile characteristics.''
 Rabbi Elie Abadie is a medical doctor, a university professor and the spiritual leader of the elegant Safra synagogue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Born in Beirut and raised in Mexico City, Abadie is a leader of the younger generation of SY's, some of whom now split their time between the relative freedom of Manhattan and the demands of the Brooklyn enclave.
 Abadie is a cerebral fellow with a gentle manner, married to a J-Dub he met at Yeshiva University. But when it comes to the Edict, he is as unbending as Kassin, if a little more diplomatic. ''It's really a matter of statistics,'' he explained to me. ''Except for the Orthodox, the American Jewish community is shrinking, disappearing. In two generations, most of their grandchildren won't even be Jews. But our community is growing. We have large families, five or six children. And only a tiny fraction of our kids leave. The Edict is what makes that true.''
 Abadie and Kassin agree that the vast majority of SY youth abide by the strictures of the Edict. ''Ninety-nine percent accept it,'' Kassin said. ''When someone doesn't, it's painful, but it's better to lose a kid here and there and save the community. Families get sick over it, sure, but that's how it is.''
 Kassin knows this from personal experience. His sister Anna ran off with a gentile. Naturally it was a great scandal in the community, but the chief rabbi didn't bend the rules for his daughter. ''We cut her off,'' Jakie Kassin told me. ''We didn't see her for 25 years. But we never stopped hoping she'd come back. Finally, after all these years, she made contact. We told her she was welcome to come back, but not with her husband or kids. She's not here yet, but we do talk on the telephone.''
 In addition to the strictures imposed by the Edict in instances of proposed intermarriage, any outsider who wants to marry into a Syrian family -- even a fellow Jew -- is subject to thorough genealogical investigation. That means producing proof, going back at least three generations and attested to by an Orthodox rabbi, of the candidates' kosher bona fides. This disqualifies the vast majority of American Jews, who have no such proof. ''We won't take them -- not even if we go back three or four generations -- if someone in their line was married by a Reform or Conservative rabbi, because they don't perform marriages according to Orthodox law,'' Kassin said. Even Orthodox candidates are screened, to make sure there are no gentiles or converts lurking in the family tree. In addition, all prospective brides and grooms must take marital purity classes and pass a test for HIV.
 The force of the Edict is lasting: the children of people who have been excluded under the terms of the Edict are themselves declared ineligible to marry into the community. A local rabbi in the community told me the remarkable story of a woman who confronted this fact. The woman, he explained, is the daughter of a Syrian Jewish man and a gentile who converted to Judaism. The woman was raised as a Jew, but the community regarded this as meaningless and had no contact with the family. Years later, the woman met and fell in love with a young SY. She moved to Israel and underwent a long and exacting Orthodox conversion. When she returned to the enclave, she was told that her conversion meant nothing -- her father's sin still made her ineligible for marriage. (Speaking publicly about such matters is strongly discouraged among SY's; the rabbi spoke only on condition of anonymity and declined to name the woman.)
 According to the rabbi, the community's refusal to recognize the woman's conversion drew the ire of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, at the time the chief Sephardic rabbi of Israel. Rabbi Yosef, a man of volcanic temperament, came all the way from Jerusalem to Brooklyn and informed the local rabbis that he, himself, vouched for the girl's Jewish authenticity. ''There he was, in person, in Shaare Zion'' -- the largest SY synagogue -- ''dressed in his robes and vestments,'' the rabbi, who was there, told me. ''He gave an oath that he had personally affixed his name to the girl's conversion document. She was as Jewish as he was, and he wanted her recognized as a member of our community.''
 ''And the answer was?'' I asked the rabbi.
 ''No.'' 
 ''No? You turned down the chief rabbi of Israel?''
 ''We felt it was necessary,'' the rabbi explained. ''If we let our kids marry gentiles, they'll try to slip their kids back into the community via conversion. And then the Edict will lack teeth.''
 This affair nearly caused a schism in the Syrian community, which officially regards Rabbi Yosef as the world's most authoritative Talmudic scholar. A group of dissident rabbis later met at the summer enclave in Deal, N.J., and accepted the conversion as valid: she could marry. They reasoned that it was wrong to humiliate Ovadia Yosef. They also reasoned that accepting this case as precedent would actually have a deterrent effect: how many other converts could expect the chief rabbi of Israel to go to bat for them?
 Every Syrian rabbi is supposed to discuss the Edict from the pulpit at least once a year. When Lance Suede was 15, he heard his rabbi explain the rule. ''It struck me as racist,'' he recalls. ''I was so upset by it that I went home and banged on the kitchen table in anger and frustration.'' Today, he says he thinks it may have been a premonition.
 By SY standards, Suede had an unconventional upbringing. When he was 7, his parents moved from the enclave to Long Island -- Ashkenazi territory. There he met J-Dubs. The experience left him both admiring and unsettled. ''They made me see the Syrian community in a different way,'' told me recently. We were sitting in the starkly beautiful conference room of the Midtown law firm where he is a partner specializing in white-collar criminal defense. ''In Brooklyn,'' he went on, ''the materialism was so far over the top it's hard to even explain. I found Ashkenazi Jews more intellectual. They valued scholarship and education. They could be materialistic, too -- this is America, after all -- but it was tempered by their love of learning.''
 Syrian Jews have always regarded advanced secular education with something like suspicion. Not only does it promote outside values, it also distracts a boy from his proper role as an apprentice in the family business. ''To understand us, you have to know that we are profoundly Middle Eastern,'' Suede said. ''Education is never the most important thing. People in the community thought we were weird because my older brothers and I became professionals.''
 Suede's parents grew homesick for the enclave and returned when he was 15. But he had already been bitten by the bug of secular education and liberalism. He attended Brandeis University and Harvard Law School. Then he willingly returned to the community. ''It's a magical place,'' he told me. ''You come home from school and there are 10 women in the kitchen, your mother and aunts and cousins, cooking special Syrian delicacies. Every celebration is large, full of relatives. The etiquette is what they call fadal -- just come over, don't be formal. Very Middle Eastern. Very seductive and sensual.''
 Suede began breaking the rules when he attended a convention in Manhattan for the National Organization for Women, where he met a gentile woman from Idaho named Kim Croffoot. Just attending a feminist gathering was an odd thing for a Syrian man to do; SY females are expected to stay home, rear children, socialize and, if possible, dazzle. To be assessed bijan, or gorgeous, is a high compliment. 
 Suede and Croffoot fell in love. She received a Reconstructionist conversion to Judaism and they made plans to marry. Suede expected resistance, but he underestimated its force. ''Of course I knew my parents would be upset,'' he said. ''But I thought time would heal the rift. What son wouldn't think that?''
 He was wrong. ''To this day, my wife and I and our children aren't welcome in the family,'' he told me. ''I knew that generally you weren't supposed to marry a convert. But when I heard the rabbi say that in shul, I thought that was just, you know, a strongly held opinion.'' This is not as implausible as it seems. In Long Island, nobody knew anything about Edicts. And Suede's parents never said a word: ''When they saw how strongly I felt about racism, how I had banged on the table when I was 15, well, maybe they just didn't want to get into a fight over it.''
 Suede, who now uses the surname Croffoot-Suede, had another reason to suppose his family would eventually relent. Back in the 1920s, he told me, his grandmother's sister married a gentile. ''There was a scandal, but it eventually blew over,'' he said. ''I thought that's how it would be for us.'' But the Edict applies only to events after 1935. Croffoot-Suede's grandmother's sister had been effectively grandfathered into the community. He had no such luck.
 Croffoot-Suede expressed his feelings by writing a play, ''Syria, America,'' which was performed in 2000 at the Greenwich Street Theater. Its subject was love and betrayal among four SY young men.
 Last year, Croffoot-Suede's grandmother died. He attended the funeral, although he didn't sit with the rest of the family. Sensing a thaw, he brought his wife to the house of mourning in Brooklyn. It turned out to be a serious mistake. ''My sister simply refused to meet my wife and she left to avoid it. She stormed out and we left, too. Next morning, my father called at 6 and told me not to come back to the shiva. He said he'd call later, and we could meet in the city for a meal and discuss it. That felt a little better. But he never called about it. My parents have sacrificed their relationship with me for the sake of the community.'' 
 Despite his being ostracized, Croffoot-Suede says he still feels the emotional power of the enclave and affords the community a kind of grudging respect. ''There are thousands of people who grew up in the community and are raising kids there who would say that it's a fulfilling life,'' he told me. ''It can be very warm and loving -- if you follow the rules.''
 One of the rules of the community forbids indulging in promiscuous chit-chat with outsiders. This is a practice the Syrians brought with them from the old country, where a nosy stranger might be a business rival or a representative of the tax collector. Reporters, an American inconvenience, are equally unpopular. The community is still stewing about an article published in The New York Times last year that revealed the astronomical cost of real estate in the enclave -- one house sold in 2003 for $11 million, which may have made it the most expensive house in Brooklyn.
 My first trip to the enclave was conducted by a guide who insisted on being granted anonymity. He emphasized the need for discretion by recounting the cautionary tale of a man I later learned was named Sam Toussie. Some years ago, a reporter had come from some unremembered publication to write an ''inside'' story on the enclave. At the time, Toussie was a member of the community in good standing, but he made the colossal error of talking about SY affairs, on the record, to the journalist. When this was discovered, he was ostracized. But that did not go far enough for some of the hardliners, who, I was told, actually prayed for his death. When he did die, at a relatively young age, his passing was taken as a sign. ''Somebody put the evil eye on him,'' my guide told me darkly.
 But the solidarity of the SY community is based on more than fear of excommunication and the evil eye. There are positive inducements as well. Chief among these are the support and charity that the community shows to its members. It is an intensely social place; weddings of 1,000 guests or more are common (there are volunteer societies that loan out dishes, silverware and even tables and chairs to enable everyone to entertain in a respectable fashion). Grown children often live within walking distance of the parents, and family Sabbath dinners of 30 or 40 are the norm. Being an SY means never having to say you are hungry. The community is charitable to a fault: at Sunday-morning house parties and festive holiday cruises, grandees compete by making donations to one another's pet charities.
 The result is the most generous cradle-to-grave mutual-welfare society this side of the Saudi royal family. The community's annual spending on charity and other civic services, including education, is around $100 million. ''The services here are preconception to postmortem,'' David Greenfield, executive director of the recently formed Sephardic Community Federation, told me.
 An SY in good standing can expect free K-12 parochial education and summer camps for the kids, access to a palatial communal ritual bath, use of grand recreational facilities in a community center now being doubled in size, high-level care for the aged and attention to whatever material problems life may present. ''If there are poor people among us, we try to help,'' Jakie Kassin told me. ''If a person falters in business, other men step in. I've even seen people in the same business, direct competitors, raise money to put the man back on his feet.'' 
 In the early 1990s, President Hafez Assad of Syria allowed his country's remaining Jews, numbering 6,000 or so, to emigrate on condition that they didn't go to Israel. Naturally, they went to Brooklyn instead. The new SY's, as they are called, provided the enclave with fresh faces and some old-country authenticity. In return they were given housing, free schooling and whatever assistance they needed to establish themselves. ''They even got us lawyers to take care of the citizenship process,'' a recent immigrant told me. ''It's not just the money. We came to the U.S. with some money. It was the way they took care of us as brothers.''
 Nonetheless, the SY's say they do not want to be portrayed as enormously rich. ''That's a misperception,'' Greenfield said. ''There are about 50 very successful SY families. Another 20 to 30 percent are what you could call upper-middle class. But maybe a third of the community lives at twice the poverty level.''
 These statistics are based on broad interpretation of what counts as the community. Many of those on the bottom rungs of the income ladder are non-Syrian Sephardic Jews, an inclusive term of art the community uses for Jews from Muslim countries. You can find Egyptians, Moroccans and Iraqis in the Syrian community. Even so, they are considered second-class citizens. ''Let's just say that the real SY's are dominant,'' my guide told me. ''We set the tone. They join us, not the other way around.''
 The non-Syrian Sephardim, many of whom are Israeli citizens, do a lot of the labor and neighborhood shopkeeping. ''Israelis own the local grocery stores,'' my guide informed me in a dismissive tone as we cruised down the enclave's commercial strip on Kings Highway. ''How much can a grocery store bring in, enough to take care of one or two families?'' The community's major institutions tend to be administered by J-Dubs like David Greenfield -- experienced professionals willing, unlike most SY's, to do white-collar work for hire.
 Greenfield, who once was a staff member for Senator Joe Lieberman, is currently running a voter-registration drive in the enclave. Traditionally, the SY's haven't voted much, largely because of an aversion to showing up on government registries. That has changed, though, mostly because of the realization that voting can result in money for faith-based enterprises. The community is 2-to-1 Democratic, but they are ardent free-traders and hawkish on Israel and security; it is generally assumed that Bush took a majority of the community's votes in 2004.
 In 1995, Rabbi Abraham Hecht of Shaare Zion synagogue made one of the community's first international political headlines. Hecht is a J-Dub, a Chabadnik preacher widely admired in the community for his polemical skills in English. During the days of the Oslo Peace Accords, Hecht displayed his eloquence by instructing an assembly that Israeli leaders who hand over territory in the Holy Land may, according to Jewish law, be killed. Five months later, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in Tel Aviv by a Sephardic Israeli yeshiva student with a similar point of view. The Israeli government banned Hecht as a security threat, and he was suspended from his pulpit, but he still has supporters in the enclave. So does Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who, despite his softness on converts, has found financial backers for his theocratic Shas Party. Jakie Kassin claims, in fact, that the party's seed money was raised in his living room in Deal, N.J., in the early '80s.
 There aren't many famous SY's. The actor Dan Hedaya, who played Carla's sleazy ex-husband, Nick, on the TV comedy ''Cheers,'' grew up in the community. So did the designer Isaac Mizrahi, although his open homosexuality has made him persona non grata. Jerry Seinfeld's mother, Betty, is an SY, but she married a J-Dub (not that there's anything wrong with that, as Jerry might say) and brought up her family in Long Island, far from the enclave. Still, according to one Seinfeld biographer, Jerry Oppenheimer, she retained enough of her early training to warn her son never to marry a convert.
 For many years, the most famous SY in the world was Eddie Antar, known professionally as Crazy Eddie. In the '70s, he revolutionized the home electronics business and created an empire.
 Nobody did retail theater better than Crazy Eddie. His souk-smart salesmen -- many of them relatives and friends from the enclave -- choreographed the shopping experience, waltzing the zboon (SY slang for ''customer'') in well-rehearsed steps toward the be'aah, the sale. His ads (''His prices are insane!'') were commercial performance art. And when he was caught defrauding his investors for almost $100 million dollars and subsequently fled to Israel, Eddie provided an international drama that ended in extradition and prison.
 The Crazy Eddie case became a cause celebre, shattering longstanding community rules of silence and decorum. Eddie's J-Dub wife, Diane, caught him in flagrante delicto with his mistress, who also happened to be a J-Dub named Diane, on the last day of December 1983 -- a confrontation remembered among old-timers as the New Year's Eve massacre. The massacre was a real bean-spiller, and it was followed by the testimony of Eddie's first cousin (and partner and C.F.O.) Sam E. Antar on how the illegal schemes had been carried out. This gave the United States Attorney prosecuting the case, Michael Chertoff (now the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security), more than enough to work with. Eddie went away for six years.
 Unlike the late Toussie, however, Eddie Antar was not expelled from the community. In fact, both Sam and Eddie live in the enclave today. Sam has a simple explanation. ''They don't usually take back rats,'' he told me. ''But everybody in our community knew that Eddie was setting me up to take the fall, especially after he skipped out to Israel leaving me holding the bag. I had worked for the Antar family my whole life. But because of the betrayal factor, I haven't been ostracized. There was no edict against me.'' As for Eddie, he is still considered mi'shelanu, ''one of us.'' ''He did his time,'' Sam said. ''He paid the price. That's the way people see it.''
 Since the demise of Crazy Eddie and Nobody Beats the Wiz (another SY-owned business, sold on the verge of bankruptcy by the Jemal family to Cablevision for a reported $101 million in 1998), the shmatte trade has supplanted electronics as the signature Syrian business. Various V.I.P.'s own national companies like Century 21 department stores, the Rainbow shops, Conway stores, and Jordache and Bonjour jeans. Most of the merchandise these days is imported from the Far East, much of it through Wal-Mart and other chains. Sam Walton was a mentor to many young SY businessmen, who, now grown old and rich, still speak of him with a veneration usually reserved for high-class cantorial singers and first-class kosher chefs.
 The Cayre brothers, from one of the world's richest families, according to Forbes magazine, got rich in the '70s producing Latin music on the Salsoul label and then got much richer distributing videocassettes via Wal-Mart. Joseph Cayre was also among the major financiers behind the World Trade Center's Larry Silverstein.
 Joe Sitt is another Sam Walton disciple, who has fondly recalled playing at the old man's knee on his father's sales trips to Arkansas. Sitt made his own money with Ashley Stewart, a line of upscale clothing marketed to plus-size African-American women. Since then, he has branched out. His company, Thor Equities, is currently engaged in a controversial effort to buy up most of Coney Island and recreate it as a modern entertainment district.
 SY moguls tend to prefer the family-business model. Of course, they tend to be related to everyone else in the community. Including, it turns out, Solomon Dwek. Dwek, universally known as ''the rabbi's son,'' is indeed the scion of a prestigious clan. His father is a highly regarded spiritual leader in the SY summer enclave in Deal, N.J. Solomon, still in his early 30s, made a name for himself as a high-stakes real estate developer in Monmouth County, N.J. Then, one memorable day in April 2006, according to an F.B.I. statement filed in federal court, he rolled up to the window of a PNC Bank branch in Eatontown, N.J., deposited a personal check for $25.2 million and later wired out by telephone $22.8 million against it. After the check bounced, Dwek was arrested by the F.B.I. for bank fraud.
 In the wake of the bust, Dwek's investors naturally began wondering what happened to their money. Solomon Dwek's uncle Joseph Dwek claimed to be owed upward of $60 million. A close associate, Isaac Franco, demanded $30 million. Criminal and civil trials are pending in New Jersey. In all, the names of the allegedly defrauded investors reads like the guest list of an enclave bar mitzvah. It remains to be seen whether, under the circumstances, the SY community can once more display the unity, forgiveness and sangfroid it mustered for Crazy Eddie and Rabbi Hecht.
 It's a good bet they will. In March of this year, Chief Rabbi Saul Kassin wrote this in an open letter to his followers: ''There is nothing more important than our unity.'' Every ethnic leader in America talks about unity, but there are precious few willing and able to sacrifice their own children for its sake. 
 Seventy years after the promulgation of the Edict, it seems fair to say that, taken on its own terms, it has been an almost uniquely successful tool of social engineering. The enclave grows and thrives beyond the dreams of its founders. It offers a secure economic future and a sweet family life to those who remain within its confines. As for those who could not or would not fit in, well, every fight for survival has its collateral damage.
 ''People have to make a choice,'' Jakie Kassin told me. ''Sure, it's rough sometimes. But I'll tell you something -- we should be an example to others. We're building the No. 1 Jewish community on planet Earth, right here in Brooklyn.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 14 about the Syrian Jews of Gravesend, Brooklyn, misstated the given names of the first wife and mistress (and later second wife) of one of the community's famous members, Eddie Antar, known as Crazy Eddie on television commercials in the 1970s and '80s. They are each Debbie, not Diane.

A Consumption Tax
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Why Not Shift the Burden to Big Spenders?'' (Economic View, Oct. 7), in which Robert H. Frank offered a ''steeply progressive consumption tax'' as a ''simple remedy'' for what ails the current system: 
 His tax would apply to the difference between a family's annual income and its annual savings, after a standard deduction, perhaps $30,000 for a family of four. But some people might exploit ambiguities in assessing the amount of ''savings,'' particularly if they borrow money, unless complicated rules were imposed.
 On a deeper level, the described benefits -- stimulating savings, investment and growth -- might be heavily blocked by our propensity to put idle cash into short-term buying and selling of assets for the sake of capital gains, not real investment and real growth.

 New Employees' Priorities
 To the Editor:
 Re ''How Wise Newcomers Find Their Way,'' (Career Couch, Oct. 7), which offered advisers' suggestions for new employees at a company:
 One recommendation was to find out ''the kinds of philanthropic activities the company supports and consider joining in.'' 
 But maybe new employees should ask themselves these questions: Why should the company's priorities, rather than my own, determine my philanthropic activities? Shouldn't excellent performance on the job be enough to make me a success at this company? If not, can I get a job at a company whose corporate culture is less intrusive?

Acorn's Opposition to the Hempstead Plan
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Loud 'No' in Hempstead'' (editorial, Oct. 7), about the demise of a plan by UrbanAmerica to redevelop Hempstead Village: 
 We take issue with your characterization of the opposition by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now to the project. Since the project was first announced, Acorn has been prepared to support it. 
 Acorn has long believed that Hempstead Village is sorely in need of a revitalization project that would expand the local tax base, provide a range of housing options and support the creation of living-wage jobs. 
 Throughout New York, Acorn has long been a voice for progressive development and has worked cooperatively with private developers and government to win support of large-scale urban renewal plans that adhere to a set of reasonable principles regarding sustainability and community benefit.
 Acorn's position -- stated dozens of times -- was that the project should go forward if the developer modified it to reflect community concerns.
 You depict Acorn as inflexible, but it was actually UrbanAmerica that refused to meet with us or any community residents and refused to make anything beyond unilateral and cosmetic modifications to the project.
 You note that hundreds of Hempstead residents turned out more than half a dozen times to express their concerns about the project. Yet you do not place any responsibility on the developer for refusing to meet with residents and listen to or address any of those concerns.
 Are you suggesting that low-income communities should hold their tongues and never insist that any conditions be imposed on economic development?
 Acorn believes that low-income communities deserve a voice in local economic development decisions. We are confident that had UrbanAmerica shared that belief, we would now be putting the finishing touches on a revitalization plan that we could all support that actually met the needs of Hempstead Village families.

 To Preserve Old Houses, We Must Find Them First
 To the Editor:
 In ''That Old House'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 30), Richard Moe notes that some communities are imposing moratoriums on the demolition of old houses until they figure out what to do. In many cases, the towns don't know where their historic structures are. 
 The students in my geographic information system, or G.I.S., class at Pace University worked with one town to define which structures existed before 1900 so those properties could be flagged for special consideration if a demolition permit were requested. What made the project easier was the availability of old maps of the town that showed the location of houses and businesses. Most towns have such maps in their historical collections. 
 State archives and the Library of Congress have digitized maps in their collections. By electronically lining up the current property maps and the old maps, the locations of the old structures can be determined. This use of G.I.S. in the service of historic preservation can be done by volunteers with a little training. The maps that are developed can give town officials knowledge of where their old houses are.

HEADLINE: When Borrowers Face Foreclosure

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE interest rates on some two million adjustable-rate mortgages will be reset over the next two years, according to an estimate from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and of them, about 500,000 are expected to go into default. FHASecure, the plan announced by President Bush in September, is expected to help about 240,000 of those borrowers, but the rest may well find themselves on their own. 
 For anyone about to default on a mortgage, the first and most crucial step is calling or visiting the lender immediately.
 ''A HUD study found that half of all homeowners facing foreclosure are afraid to contact their lender for help,'' said Adam Glantz, a HUD spokesman in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Glantz said that under FHASecure, borrowers who went into default when the interest rates on their loans increased may qualify for refinanced mortgages from the Federal Housing Administration. 
 To be eligible, they must have a sustained history of employment, sufficient income to make the refinanced mortgage payments and a history of on-time mortgage payments before the rates reset. The reset must occur between June 2005 and December 2008, the borrowers must have at least 3 percent equity in their houses, and they must pay for mortgage insurance. 
 Those who do not qualify for FHASecure may have other options. ''The first thing you have to do is open your mail,'' said Lisa Breier Urban, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''People tend to ignore the notices they receive because they believe there is nothing they can do about their situation. But a lender will often make accommodations to keep you out of foreclosure.''
 David Petrovich, the executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Continued Homeownership, a nonprofit loan-counseling organization in Oakhurst, N.J., said the lender might be willing to accept partial payments for a few months if the borrower's financial problems are temporary and will improve. 
 Borrowers may also be able to persuade the lender to lower the interest rate or extend the loan's term. ''Lenders want to avoid foreclosure as much as borrowers,'' Mr. Petrovich said.
 Bruce Bergman, a Garden City, N.Y., lawyer who specializes in mortgages, said that there were other ways to avoid foreclosure but that they would require the borrower to give up the house.
 One is what is called a ''short sale.'' ''Suppose you have a house that is worth $300,000 but the balance on the mortgage is now $320,000,'' he said. ''The lender might be willing to allow you to sell the home, accept the $300,000, and forgive the rest.''
 It is also possible, Mr. Bergman said, that a lender might accept what is known as ''deed in lieu of foreclosure.'' With such an arrangement, the borrower voluntarily deeds the property to the lender, who then waives the right to sue for the amount still owed. Another possibility is to persuade the lender to allow the sale to a qualified buyer who will assume the balance of the mortgage. 
 For additional assistance and information, those facing foreclosure can visit the housing administration's Web site at fha.gov/foreclosure.

HEADLINE: Montclair's Hidden History

BYLINE: By STACEY PATTON. 
Stacey Patton, who teaches history at Montclair State University, is the author of ''That Mean Old Yesterday.''

 BODY:
THE 220-year-old home of a freed Montclair slave named James Howe is in danger of being uprooted, dragged through town and perched next to the house of his old master. The current owner of the small, two-story Howe House has agreed to donate it to the Montclair Historical Society so it can be preserved as a showcase for the black experience in that town. But the Howe House may be physically damaged by a move, and there is no guarantee that the historical society will manage the house properly when it reaches its new site. 
 The historical society has always been a strong advocate for local history, but it has an unfortunate tradition of operating more like a collector of antiquities than a museum. A case in point is the Crane House, the home of James Howe's former master, which the historical society saved from demolition more than 40 years ago. 
 The original owner of this house was Israel Crane, known as King Crane for his ownership and operation of the Newark-Pompton Turnpike in the mid-18th century. He was also a prominent merchant with ties to the cotton industry and an owner of slaves. His Federal-style mansion was built 20 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence when Montclair was still known as Cranetown. 
 In the early 20th century, Crane's old house, on Glenridge Avenue, in the black section of town, became the Trinity Presbyterian Mission for blacks who left Virginia and North Carolina in search of better lives in this northern suburb. By 1920, it was turned into an African-American Y.W.C.A. and used for various social and civic functions. Middle-class clubwomen like Hortense Ridley Tate held classes there to teach women and girls etiquette and reading and writing. W. E. B. DuBois, Langston Hughes and Booker T. Washington all spoke there. For a while in the early 1920s, the upper attic of the building was a dormitory for black female students who could not live on Montclair State University's campus because of their race. 
 It's a colorful past, but you won't learn any of these details if you visit the Crane House now. Along with the story of Crane's slaves, they are elements of African-American history that the historical society seems to have lost when it moved the house in 1965 to a high section of Orange Road, and filled it with antiques and art work that offer a textbook version of the Revolutionary era and selected elements of the town's history. 
 Less than a mile away, at 369 Claremont Avenue, on the foothills of Upper Montclair, stands the house of Crane's former slave. In 1813, Crane purchased young James Howe for $50. In his will dated 1831, Crane left Howe his freedom along with the house, $600 and some of his ''best land.'' Some scholars have interpreted this as a rare and benevolent gesture on behalf of a white slave owner. Others have speculated that Howe might have been more than just Crane's slave -- perhaps he was also his son. 
 The house itself is an uncomfortable remnant of history for a town that has regarded itself as the epitome of a progressive suburban racial utopia. Not only did slavery exist in Montclair, so too did unwritten rules of discrimination against black and Italian residents. During my research over the past two years for an oral history project, black residents told me about racism in the public school system, discriminatory housing covenants and heated boycotts of segregated restaurants in the 1950s and 1960s by blacks. They have told me of breaking off from white churches that made black parishioners sit behind black curtains and in basements during services. 
 Montclair was never a Jim Crow town. But it has always been, and still is, largely segregated. Issues of race and class continue to be brought to the fore as black residents grapple with the discriminatory practice of tracking students in the public schools and the economic forces of gentrification that are pushing black homeowners out of town. 
 Brenda Hebert, the executive director of the historical society (who is not a historian), says if the house is not moved, it will remain inaccessible and anonymous. In its new location, it can be used as a place to educate the public about local black history. But the historical society has demonstrated an inability to interpret for the public Montclair's diverse past. And it has failed to establish a genuine relationship with the black community in Montclair. 
 If the Howe House is moved next door to the Crane House, I heard one resident joke, it is in danger of being relegated to ''chicken coop'' status, and just another place where society members play dress up, teach hearth cooking and knitting and hold herb sales, as they've done in the Crane House for the past 40 years. 
 Instead, the township of Montclair should buy the land the Howe House already occupies and leave it there. Then, working with a professional historian and architect, it should turn it into a museum dedicated to African-American history in Montclair. The house should become a symbol of civic pride not only for blacks in Montclair but for the entire community.

HEADLINE: For Emerging Markets, A Move Toward Maturity

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN the midsummer credit crisis unfolded and global stock markets sank, emerging markets were praised for their resilience. Their comparative strength was taken as a sign that economies in the developing world could make it on their own and were no longer dependent on exports to the West.
 Then, in September, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by more than investors had anticipated, emerging markets continued to outperform. Traders acted as if anything that helps the American economy helps the developing world, too, but that an enfeebled economy here does no harm there.
 That apparent Wall Street consensus suggests just how far emerging markets have matured and broadened -- or, at least it does for those who are bullish on those markets. For bears, however, it is evidence that current expectations are unrealistic and that these economies and markets are more susceptible to adverse conditions elsewhere than is widely thought. 
 Simon Hallett, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets fund, is one of the bulls, though he acknowledges a discomfiting historical connection between developing and developed economies. A global slowdown tends to lower demand for consumer goods and commodities, two classes of products whose exports underpin emerging-market economies. 
 ''The cliche has been that when America sneezes, emerging markets catch cold,'' Mr. Hallett said.
 But the prognosis may be different this time, in his view, because of the vigorous expansion of domestic consumption in many emerging-market economies. The huge piles of cash that their governments have in reserve could also smooth over fallow periods by being put to use to build infrastructure or for other expensive public works projects.
 ''I'm not going to tell you they'll be absolutely insensitive to a slowdown in the United States, but they will be less sensitive to them,'' he said. ''You'll see a slowdown, but not the catastrophic decline that has led to financial crises in the past.'' 
 Also using history as a guide -- and just as a rough one, too -- Michael Hartnett, global emerging-market equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, cautioned that a Fed rate cut could be a negative sign for emerging markets. Mr. Hartnett said in a note to clients that when the federal funds rate is adjusted, share price indexes in the developing world tend to move in the same direction, as both the Fed and emerging-market investors react to changes in the economic cycle.
 But he is inclined to minimize the significance of the correlation this time around. The global boom has produced especially big benefits to emerging-market economies, so it would take an especially big slowdown in the United States to derail the bull market, he reasoned.
 Such a downturn is not out of the question, Mark W. Headley, president of Matthews International Capital Management, a specialist in Asian markets, said in explaining his cautious stance.
 He calls the American housing market ''a bottomless pit at this point,'' and he does not have high hopes that the rate cut last month will reverse, or even significantly limit, the damage.
 ''A consumer-led slowdown in the United States is going to have an impact on global growth and on a lot of Asian economies,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone's going to be impervious to it.''
 The investment choices that fund managers make in emerging markets tend to conform to how upbeat they are about the global economy and just how resistant they expect companies in those markets would be to any pervasive slump.
 Jerry Zhang, manager of the Evergreen Emerging Markets Growth fund, is optimistic, if not brimming with confidence. ''The U.S. represents the biggest cyclical risk within a structurally O.K. story,'' he said, offering a thumbnail sketch of the economic backdrop. He thinks that shares of commodity producers will continue to excel in such conditions.
 Among his favorites are two companies in Brazil: the iron ore miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, known as C.V.R.D., and the energy company Petroleo Brasileiro. In Eastern Europe, he likes the Russian energy producer Lukoil and KazMunaiGaz, which is a rough equivalent in Kazakhstan, the former Soviet state.
 Mr. Zhang also has a high and far-flung regard for banks, including Sberbank, the big Russian savings bank; ICICI Bank in India and China Merchants Bank.
 Mr. Hallett also likes commodities producers, but he prefers his commodities to be comestible instead of industrial. His thesis is that China and India will devote enormous resources to keeping citizens in the countryside instead of streaming into already overcrowded cities, and that this will require expanding the supply of food and water.
 ''There is a wonderful arbitrage where China is very short of water and faces the possibility of being short of food, while Brazil is the Saudi Arabia of water,'' Mr. Hallett explained. ''There is a very interesting increase in trade in soybeans from Brazil to China.''
 Potential beneficiaries of this trend include America Latina Logistica, a provider of transportation services for Brazilian railroads; Israel Chemicals, which produces potash for fertilizer; and the IOI Group, a Malaysian purveyor of palm oil.
 Thomas A. Mengel, manager of the Ivy International Growth fund, is extremely bullish on emerging markets. He goes so far as to suggest that a slowdown in the United States would be a boon to China by cooling off an economy growing at an otherwise unsustainable annual rate above 10 percent.
 ''In a soft-landing scenario, China should do well, even if exports to the U.S. slow,'' he reasoned. ''Domestic demand is going up strongly, so the economy can continue to grow at a fast pace as long as the U.S. doesn't go into recession. Maybe 9 percent to 10 percent growth wouldn't be a bad thing.''
 MR. MENGEL'S portfolio is heavily invested in Asia, and he mentioned a number of companies based in and around China as particular favorites, including the phone company China Mobile; the Hong Kong clothing maker Esprit; Agile Property, which does business in mainland China but is listed in Hong Kong, and the Internet portal operator Sina.
 Selections elsewhere include the mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, and he casts another vote for ICICI Bank.
 Mr. Headley of Matthews International prefers stocks and markets that are comparatively shunned by investors. He likes DBS Bank in Singapore, Korean banks generally and ''Hong Kong companies that are not crazily overvalued and are participating in the China story,'' like the conglomerate Swire Pacific, which has interests in Cathay Pacific Airways and Hong Kong real estate.
 He is cautious about Chinese-listed stocks and others in the developing world that he considers to be trading on very high valuations.
 ''Aren't these stocks priced to perfection?'' Mr. Headley said. ''I don't think it would cause much of a hiccup from any direction to pull many of these things down.''

HEADLINE: A Pause to Recall The 1987 Crash

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
''GREED is good'' was a telling catchphrase of the 1980s; ''green is good'' may be more appropriate today. Back then, Japan was often described as the chief threat to American economic pre-eminence; now it often ranks far behind another Asian powerhouse, China. 
 With a light economic calendar, a financial panic just out of the way and an important Federal Reserve meeting just ahead, some investors may choose this week to ponder how much has changed, or not, since that awful day on Wall Street, Oct. 19, 1987, when the stock market fell more than 20 percent.
 Henry J. Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed, finds more similarities between then and now than many investors would like to acknowledge, along with some differences that may be even more uncomfortable.
 ''In the grand scheme of things, there was a financial crisis in '87 and a financial crisis now, and the magnitude of the crisis now is pretty large by comparison,'' he said.
 The 1987 crash had no appreciable impact on economic growth. The damage was concentrated in the stock market and it occurred all at once. Recent troubles have been less acute but more diffuse, including the worst housing slump in decades, severe disruption to credit markets, slowing economic growth and an unpleasant but less sharp decline in share prices.
 One similarity Mr. Herrmann observes is ''a parallel in terms of the behavior of investment managers,'' who tended, in each period, to bet on essentially the same trades, exaggerating price movements. In 1987, the use of derivative contracts as so-called portfolio insurance compelled investors to intensify their selling of stocks the more the market declined.
 The modern equivalent involved using easy credit to push up values on real estate and high-risk debt, with the gains in each pushing the other ever higher. Once prices on both began to fall, assets had to be liquidated. ''I'd like to say that recent events show that we're much more sophisticated and capable and that this makes a crash less likely,'' he said. ''I'd like to say it, but I don't think it's true.''
 DATA WATCH Signs that Fed rate cuts have helped the housing market are expected to remain elusive. In a report due Wednesday, housing starts and building permits are forecast in a Bloomberg News poll to have continued falling in September. The same day, consumer prices, excluding food and energy items, are predicted to have risen 0.2 percent in September. A decline is foreseen Thursday in the survey of October economic conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. A reading of 7.0 is predicted, after 10.9 for September.

HEADLINE: Where Everyone Knows Your Portfolio

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN. 
Gary Rivlin is a reporter for The New York Times. He is the author, most recently, of ''The Godfather of Silicon Valley.''

 BODY:
At first Tommy Gallagher kept busy by answering phones for a suicide hot line. He taught personal finance and current events for a local center for the elderly; he enrolled in continuing-ed classes at the New School. ''One day you're on top,'' Gallagher says. ''The next you're just the third guy on line at the Korean deli.'' On 9/11, Gallagher was still a reigning prince on Wall Street, the vice chairman of CIBC World Markets, a major investment-banking firm. One month later, its offices (and business) having been damaged in the attack on the World Trade Center, he was fired. He was a millionaire many times over but also, at age 56, unemployed for the first time since he was a teenager.
 ''You lose everything when you lose your job,'' Gallagher says. ''Your whole social network disappears.'' He read the newspaper front to back. He began training for the New York City marathon. Yet he remained stuck largely in a dizzying, disoriented state of existential confusion.
 ''I'd tell myself, O.K., I just ran eight miles,'' he says. ''And then I'd think, O.K., now what do I do with the other 22 hours in the day?'' 
 Salvation came improbably in the form of a support group for multimillionaires called Tiger 21. Proving that he had at least $10 million in the bank, the minimum needed to join, was easy enough: he had that and then some, as well as the equity he had built up in a place on the Upper East Side and a second home in the Hamptons. And he passed muster with existing members, who, like Gallagher, the Brooklyn-born son of a tollbooth operator, tend to be self-made. So in the spring of 2002 Gallagher wrote his first check for $20,000 to cover the annual cost of belonging to a group that now operates 14 support circles for the superwealthy. ''I was dying for some place I could go and share my angst and fears with other people,'' Gallagher says.
 That kind of sharing was not what Jake Jacobson sought when he joined Tiger 21 in 2004. Like Gallagher, Jacobson, a former partner at the consulting firm Bain & Company, had no problem proving he was rich enough to belong. Nor was he troubled by the annual dues, which had risen to $25,000. These were business expenses, really, for someone who figured he was joining a kind of Beardstown Ladies investment club -- only its membership wasn't grandmothers from Middle America but entrepreneurs with tens of millions of dollars in the bank and a nose for deals.
 ''I was willing to join in the hopes that at the very least I would meet people who would become useful resources,'' Jacobson says. ''I was also hoping I would get a chance to look at some interesting money-making opportunities I might not otherwise have seen.''
 He would not be disappointed. But with time, Jacobson, who was feeling isolated working out of his home in Cambridge, Mass., has come to appreciate some of the other benefits of sitting around Tiger 21's conference table 11 times a year for eight hours at a time under the guidance of a professional facilitator. ''When one is successful,'' he says, ''most people look at you and say, 'You don't have problems.' In the grand scheme of things, I suppose that might be true, but it's unhelpful. Because I still have to live my life, and I have problems.''
 Certainly his fellow Tiger 21 members were there for him during a regular monthly session earlier this year, when Jacobson was beating himself up over a few bad investments. A dozen or so men sat around the table on the top floor of a handsome six-story brownstone steps from Fifth Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side. One by one, they told him how happy and centered he seemed and how well he was doing financially, even though he had lost a few hundred thousand dollars playing the stock market during the previous 12 months.
 Then, after the last member of the circle had his say, one said, ''We love you, man.''
 That caused Jacobson, a stocky man with a round face, to redden. He pursed his lips and, in a little boy's voice, said, ''I love you too, smoochy.''
 Tiger 21 was founded in 1999 by Michael Sonnenfeldt, a blue-eyed, Buddha-loving real estate developer from New Jersey. Then 43 years old, Sonnenfeldt had recently sold his real estate holding company for tens of millions of dollars. What was he supposed to do with all that money, especially in an overheated stock market? He might know plenty about putting together the financing on a big commercial development, but he didn't feel he had the skills or knowledge, he says, ''to take this large corpus of capital and redeploy it into a diverse portfolio.'' Sonnenfeldt knew half a dozen men sitting on new-made fortunes. When all of them expressed an interest in meeting regularly, Tiger 21 was born.
 Sonnenfeldt's initial goals for the group are captured by its name, an acronym for the Investment Group for Enhanced Results in the 21st Century, and also by its raison d'A<$>tre, which has not changed much since its founding, even if its core demographic now includes, to his delight, retired chief executives and some folks who are still active on Wall Street. Sonnenfeldt, a large man with closely shorn white hair and the paunch of someone who has done an enviable job of enjoying his wealth, had come into a small fortune years earlier when he cashed out a large real estate project while still in his early 30s, yet he had lost money on poor investments. He was determined not to make the same mistake again.
 ''We have a lot of people here who have been fantastically successful entrepreneurs,'' he says, ''but basically mediocre investors.'' 
 New York, of course, is full of men and women who would happily -- some might say greedily -- help anyone rich enough to join a group like Tiger 21. The large investment banks, like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, have entire divisions dedicated to helping the wealthy manage their money. But advice tends to be expensive and also antithetical to the typical Tiger 21 member, a self-made entrepreneur whose net worth is between $50 million and $70 million and for whom jobbing out so essential a task seems to be almost an admission of defeat. By banding together, the 145 members of Tiger 21, who collectively have a net worth of around $10 billion, according to the organization's promotional materials, have ensured direct access to big-shot hedge-fund managers and their compatriots in the private equity world.
 Yet shortly into the life of Tiger 21, Sonnenfeldt realized that the group needed to be about more than wisely tending to one's stash of acorns. A man who has just sold his business for $20 million is worried about preserving his wealth but also struggling with the prospects for living off less than $1 million a year when, before the sale, he was spending $3 million annually. Ne'er-do-well kids, nasty divorces, grasping relatives -- Sonnenfeldt, a self-described seeker who has practiced meditation on and off throughout his adult life, quickly realized he had to broaden the group's scope. He had given an equity stake in Tiger 21 to Richard Lavin, an entrepreneur who had spent most of the previous decade running support groups for working chief executives. It fell on Lavin, who led the earliest groups, to create a format that allowed members to explore these more personal issues. The demand for this kind of thing has been so great that there are now nine circles or groups of 12 members each based in New York, and there is one each in Palm Beach, Miami, Los Angeles, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area. Additional groups are being formed in New York, San Francisco, Palm Beach and Dallas.
 Tiger 21 meetings begin with what those inside the organization call the World Update. Though the label suggests a high-level discussion of international affairs -- even if through the prism of each member's global investments -- the discussion, at least on the day I visited, focused mainly on each member's travels since the last meeting. Myles, a financial adviser with great waves of gray and white hair, leaned back in his chair and, with arms crossed, started things off with the details about his recent trips, first to CancAXn, then to India. Ziel Feldman, a real estate investor in his 40s, used most of his time to chronicle his week at a Four Seasons in Mexico. A former executive at a consulting firm read from a note card and described lounging around a resort in Jamaica, which prompted jokes about smoking spliffs on the beach. Others shared with the group tales of trips to the Virgin Islands, the GalApagos and Antarctica, among other far-flung destinations.
 Investments made or investments being pondered was another big topic that morning, as were first, second and third homes. One member, who declined to be identified, told the group he had disappointing news: the new house wouldn't be ready for at least another eight months. The generally prosperous-looking, all-male group around the table -- 10 of Tiger 21's 14 support circles have no women in them -- nodded in sympathy while the rumpled speaker sadly accepted their support. Another member, a retired software executive who was calling in via speakerphone from Palm Springs, said he and his wife were trying to decide whether it made sense to purchase vacation property there, given how much they enjoyed the place. Apparently, several members were wondering the same thing, because suddenly the group was debating the merits of owning versus renting second homes in an uncertain real estate market.
 It was approaching the lunch hour when a nebbishy-looking man wearing an off-the-rack gray suit was ushered into the room. This was the first of two presenters invited that day to pitch investments to the group. (The morning offering was open to those willing to invest at least $500,000; the afternoon one required a minimum commitment of $2 million.) The first presenter would not have to sell his fund very hard; over the previous decade he had earned annual returns of 21.4 percent from gas and oil pipeline partnerships.
 ''Hurry up and leave,'' said Barry Kaye, a heavy-set insurance salesman who wore a bulky gold watch. ''We want to talk about you.''
 Tommy Gallagher was among those who expressed his appreciation for the presentation of the pipeline partnerships. That prompted groans around the table. ''Oh, no, the kiss of death!'' one member cried out, eliciting a roar of laughter from the group. Earlier in the day, Gallagher mentioned that two of the investments he made in 2006 had been losers, though stocks generally performed exceedingly well that year. So all day his mates razzed him about his rotten luck -- and, if anything, Gallagher only encouraged them, despite the impressive returns he has earned since losing his job in 2001.
 ''Sometimes a group needs a punching bag,'' Gallagher told me later. ''And for some reason, I was it that day.''
 Technically, Gallagher belongs to Group 2, not Group 4. But in recent years he has been helping Michael Sonnenfeldt run Tiger 21 in exchange for an equity stake in an organization that imagines it might one day sell gold-plated medical plans and similar niche products to its members. So Gallagher, who attends four to six group meetings per month, vets new members and, more important, serves as a kind of role model for each support circle as it is forming. One critical component of every Tiger 21 meeting is the Portfolio Defense, which is when members hand out copies of their financial holdings to everyone around the table and brace for an hour or so of feedback. ''A transformative experience that creates unparalleled bonds among members'' is how Sonnenfeldt describes the Portfolio Defense on Tiger 21's Web site. ''After achieving a level of trust where they can talk freely about financial matters, members find personal matters easy to share by comparison.'' Gallagher is the first member in each new support circle to submit to a Portfolio Defense.
 ''I'm the DNA carrier,'' he says. ''Everyone in the joint knows how much I'm worth.''
 Yet intimacy tends to come easier to Gallagher than to most of his peers. When the man whose new house wasn't going to be ready for months wistfully spoke of selling his business, Gallagher interjected, ''It's great -- for three months.'' But his fellow member was having none of it; as it is, he said, he devotes a large portion of his workday to his investments, and as a result, he feels he is shortchanging both his work and his portfolio. Gallagher pressed his view that there is more to life than playing with your money. It's difficult finding meaning and structure in life without work. But rather than taking up the point, Jake Jacobson instead suggested that Gallagher might be better off devoting more time to his investments, given his recent track record. Again the group burst into laughter and the moment passed. 
 Perhaps Jacobson should have considered warning his cohort away from his investments. When it was his turn to submit to a Portfolio Defense, he only wished he had better news to share with the group. The year 2005 had been what he described as an ''exceptionally good -- and lucky -- year''; his net worth had swelled 60 percent. But in 2006 his investments fell by 2 percent, largely because of a trio of stocks and a decline in the value of one of his real estate properties.
 ''My winners couldn't offset my pukers,'' he said.
 The details of Jacobson's holdings were spelled out in a dense handout that had been placed in front of every member. His net worth (he asked me not to reveal the exact amount) was in the tens of millions, yet his spending had been equally prodigious. The living expenses for him and his wife alone exceeded $1 million in 2005. Last year the couple spent $687,000, not including the $400,000 they gave to charity and $2.6 million in taxes. He patted the belly straining his shirt and said he had been overindulging in good food and wines, neither of which, he offered, were doing his health or his bottom line any good. He had enjoyed himself in 2006, but he worried that he was not ''smart enough to pick'' the right investments.
 ''I had a really crummy year,'' he confessed glumly.
 But his fellow multimillionaires were unswayed. They went around the room, member by member, just as they had done after hearing from the visiting money managers and a lunchtime speaker, an economist. There was talk about bulking up his international holdings but more typical were the comments of Ziel Feldman, who told Jacobson: ''I've been listening to you for three years. There's a certain comfort level that I perceive that I haven't heard before.''
 Another member, Amnon Bar-Tur, whose exotic accent, Van Dyke beard and crinkly eyes give him the air of a count, said: ''It's very nice how you talk about where you are. We all want to be where you are.''
 The exchange was sweet, even loving, but later I mentioned to Bar-Tur that the session with Jacobson had hardly been what you might overhear as a fly on the wall, say, at a group therapy session in a psychologist's office on the Upper East Side. Jacobson mentioned that he was still buying and selling real estate, yet wondering if he should, as his wife has suggested, try disconnecting completely from the work world to see how it feels. ''I'm starting to scratch that itch,'' he told the group.
 But the group summarily dismissed this idea. His comrades might have asked if a compulsion was driving him to continue to acquire properties. Or they might have engaged him in a conversation of what is enough. He had told the group that more than anything else, he wanted to enjoy life to its fullest, and sometimes he resented the constant intrusion of business on his daily life. Perhaps he was channeling his wife's wishes rather than voicing his own -- another subject ripe for discussion. But instead of raising this or other issues, his fellow Tiger 21 members offered Oprah-like affirmations that made him feel good but did not get to what seemed core issues.
 Bar-Tur did not challenge this characterization. Men as creatures, he said, tend not to talk as easily about personal matters as women. A man can be a lonely character who hides behind his strength.
 Yet don't underestimate the value of what Tiger 21 offers, he said. For several years now, he has watched and listened as his fellow group members have struggled to share their lives with the group. The very act of giving a narrative shape to one's life story, he said, not only helps the rest of the group better understand that person and his issues and priorities; it also helps the presenter focus on the rationale for decisions he has made and decisions he is considering. That level of depth means the group is uniquely qualified to challenge someone when he is veering off track or dreaming of something that from the perspective of one or more members of the group could prove disastrous.
 ''A place where you can share your personal challenges and have a really
 wise group of people who really know you give you their views is a very rare thing in life,'' he said. ''And it's worth a lot. I've seen it where the advice we're giving someone is literally worth millions of dollars.''

HEADLINE: The American Dream Foreclosed

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
A SURGE in subprime lending across the region in recent years is now helping to fuel a boom in foreclosures, with the number of filings rising 55 percent in suburban counties in the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period last year, an analysis of real estate data shows.
 On Long Island, the number of foreclosure actions increased sharply during the summer. Nearly 1,000 foreclosure notices were filed in July, and 728 foreclosures were scheduled in the third quarter. Both numbers represent an increase of more than 60 percent over the same period in 2006, according to Long Island Profiles, a real estate information service. 
 The growth is similar to that across the 19 counties of suburban New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, where more than 41,000 foreclosure notices or repossessions were filed through the third quarter of 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a national real estate information service. 
 The recent foreclosures represent a fraction of the total number of mortgages in the region, but experts say that loans are going bad far more quickly than they did just three years ago. For example, on Long Island, the average age of a loan in foreclosure last month was a little more than two years, according to Long Island Profiles. In January 2004, the average length of time it took borrowers struggling with loans was five years before losing their property through foreclosure.
 Jacqueline Cila, divorced with a 7-year-old son, who lives in a three-bedroom house in East Moriches, sent her usual payment of $2,000 off to her mortgage company in July. But in August, her mortgage company told her she was delinquent: Her payment had risen to $2,798. 
 ''I started crying, I didn't know what I was going to do,'' she said. ''I'm just barely making the $2,000 payments.''
 Ms. Cila bought the house with her husband in 1997, and he had continued to help with payments after their divorce in 1998, she said. But in 2005, her ex-husband, a soldier, was wounded in a roadside attack in Iraq and unable to help for months as he recovered from the loss of an arm. She took an extra job to make the payments, but then decided to refinance to get a lower interest rate and reduce her mortgage payment.
 ''I went through a friend of a friend, and I didn't bring a lawyer with me,'' she said. ''I said, 'Is this a fixed loan?' And they said, 'Yes.' What I didn't understand was it was fixed for two years.''
 Counselors at housing agencies have begun to see a stampede of new clients with payments they can't afford and who are desperate to keep their homes. 
 ''We're running at three times the calls we got last year,'' said Lynn Law, director of education and counseling at the Long Island Housing Partnership. ''It started in May and June, and continued through the summer.''
 In 2005 and 2006, more than 250,000 people across the region refinanced or bought property with subprime mortgages -- loans that bear higher costs than mainstream, or prime, loans -- according to a New York Times analysis of federal mortgage data. 
 Even as prime lending declined with a softening real estate market in 2006, subprime lending increased in the region, and one in four mortgages in the suburbs in 2006 bore an interest rate at least three points above the prime rate. 
 High-cost loans were especially popular on Long Island, where about one in three mortgages were subprime.
 The high-interest-rate loans are especially prevalent in low-income neighborhoods in the suburban region, the Times analysis shows, and economists say development plans in places like Hempstead, Mount Vernon, N.Y., Bridgeport, Conn., and Newark will be threatened if foreclosures continue to mount. In some neighborhoods in those communities, three-quarters of the loans made in 2006 were subprime.
 ''This is a real mess, not only from the point of view of its impact on the housing market, but on communities,'' said Elizabeth Rodriguez, vice president and community affairs officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Manhattan. ''You've got a lot of good money that has gone into rebuilding these communities that now is compromised seriously by what could be this wave of foreclosures.''
 The rising toll of subprime-lending excess is not confined to low-income areas: Thousands of high-interest-rate loans were made in middle-class and affluent areas as well. One in 10 mortgages made to people making more than $300,000 was a high-cost loan. The subprime loans in affluent areas were more likely to be for refinancing than for buying homes.
 The numbers are based on reports banks must file with the federal government under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and include all loans made for purchase or refinancing of one- to four-family homes.
 ''We're starting to see suburban New Jersey people who are white collar,'' said Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, the executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, which operates counseling and mortgage service offices in 10 New Jersey municipalities. ''They bought homes with huge jumbo mortgages and thought they were going to be able to sell them because of their increasing value, and now they're in trouble.''
 Subprime mortgages include a number of different products, often intended for borrowers with flawed credit. Loan costs, including fees and interest over the life of the loan, are higher, and many are of the exploding type, with low initial rates that adjust after two or three years, adding hundreds of dollars to the monthly payment.
 In Westchester, Jacqueline Borrero said the mortgage payment on the two-family home her brother bought for $299,000 in 1998 rose to $4,800 from $4,000 last May. The loan will cost $5,100 a month starting in November, when the interest rate increases to 11 percent. She said that she and her brother refinanced, using an adjustable rate mortgage two years ago, because they were advised that it would give them time to repair their credit and buy a mortgage on better terms. But they have been unable to get a new loan with better terms. 
 ''We're really scared,'' said Ms. Borrero, 42, an administrative assistant at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. She and her mother and brother are working extra part-time jobs to meet the mortgage bill, but their combined income won't be enough to cover the payment, she said. ''We got some bad advice on this loan,'' she said, ''Now we don't know where to turn. We don't want to become one of the statistics.''
 Governments have been slow to step in, but legislatures in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have all held hearings or convened task forces on subprime and predatory lending. Laws to regulate subprime lending more closely have been introduced.
 Housing counselors say there are some potential sources of help for people facing foreclosure. But they are limited, and it is inevitable that foreclosures will increase, they say.
 ''A lot of it was predatory lending,'' said Susan Lagville, executive director of Housing Help in Greenlawn. ''It was people who were not the most financially savvy, who were told, 'I can let you buy a $350,000 home on $35,000 income,' and they believed them.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 21, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A map with an article last Sunday about the increase in subprime mortgages in the region, and the subsequent increase in foreclosures, mislabeled a census tract in which subprime mortgages accounted for more than 50 percent of all mortgages in 2006. The tract is in Lakeview, not Malverne.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: RISING PAYMENTS: Above, Jacqueline Cila, with her son, Sam, in her East Moriches home, found that what she thought was a fixed-rate loan was fixed for only two years. Her payment rose to $2,798 a month from $2,000. ''I started crying, I didn't know what I was going to do,'' she said. Right, in Yonkers, Jacqueline Borrero says the payment on her family's home is $4,800 a month, up from $4,000 last May. The loan will rise to $5,100, starting in November. ''We're really scared,'' she said. (PHOTOGRAPH BY GEORGE M. GUTIERREZ FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)(PHOTOGRAPH BY PHIL MARINO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: 'Are You Talkin' to Me?'

BYLINE: By SHALOM AUSLANDER. 
Shalom Auslander is the author of ''Foreskin's Lament'' and ''Beware of God.''

 BODY:
I live in a world of elderly children, of infantile adults, of Peter Pans with two mortgages and carpal tunnel syndrome. I live in a world of 45-year-olds in baggy shorts, baseball caps and garishly colored sneakers, of 50-year-olds in track suits and oversize white-framed sunglasses. In the mall near my home there is a store called Forever 21, where women long since 21 fill their desperate arms with clothing that would make an actual 21-year-old cringe. 
 This is my world, and of this world I am a faithful citizen.
 I wear ripped jeans and T-shirts. I wear hoodies and Crocs. I wear Chuck Taylors. 
 ''Look, Dad,'' says my 3-year-old son, pointing to a classmate as we walk across the schoolyard. ''Zachary is wearing the same thing as you!''
 I wonder what Suit Me is doing right now. Perhaps he is at the opera, understanding Italian and shouting Bravo! as the curtain falls. Perhaps he is at dinner with other Suit People, swirling red wine around a glass as he discusses the past week's lead article in The Economist. ''They fundamentally misunderstand China's relationship to the something something something,'' he says. He mentions Turkey, and they all nod. Perhaps he is, if nothing else, feeling ever-so-slightly less lousy about himself than Jeans Me does in his Zachary knockoff. So when the phone rings later that afternoon and I am offered an assignment to dress like a Suit Person for a day -- a rich Suit Person -- I quickly agree. 
 ''I'll see you Monday,'' I say.
 Suit Me leans back in his Aeron chair, puts his feet up on his oak desk and, pressing his fingertips together, says, ''Excellent.''
 t's only 9:30 in the morning, and I'm already having a bad day. There's a good reason for that, and the reason for that is this: my socks are yellow. Not yellowed, not old, not worn -- intentionally, garishly, brightly yellow, with a small pink argyle pattern stitched on the side. To make matters worse, my suit pants have been hemmed so short that they come to a lonely, abrupt end three inches above my shoes, as, I am told, is the style of the times. 
 ''This can't be right,'' I say, looking at myself in the mirror. 
 I am standing in Bergdorf Goodman the Men's Store, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 58th Street. I have lived in New York my entire life and have never been in this store before. I haven't worn a suit since my days in an Orthodox yeshiva.
 ''It's right,'' says the man standing behind me. His name is Tommy, and he is the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman the Men's Store. Tommy tightens my tie and talks suit as I stare at my ankles. Tommy talks about the Italians who made the suit. He talks about the cut. He talks about the ''silky hand of the wool.'' Then it's the suit's turn to talk. This suit, Tommy explains, says, ''I am young,'' but it also says, ''I have arrived.'' It says, ''I have money,'' but it also says, ''I still have a personal sense of style.'' It is quite a talkative suit. My feeling has always been that if you need your clothing to speak for you, it might be best for everyone if you said nothing at all. Unfortunately, you can't tell a suit to shut the hell up, which is what I want to tell the suit I am wearing.
 It's not Tommy's fault. Let's not get angry with Tommy. If you've seen certain young men walking around of late looking as if they tried to launder their suits at home and accidentally left them in the dryer for a few cycles too many -- cuffs ending midforearm, pants ending midshin -- then the person you want to blame is named Thom Browne. Not only did he start this trend, but on his label he also puts a period at the end of his name, so that even if I hadn't put the name Thom Browne. at the end of the previous sentence, I would have had to use a period because that is the way Thom Browne. likes it, with a period after Thom Browne. It seems fitting -- a sentence-fragment name for a man with too-short pants.
 Tommy throws a coat over my shoulders, a black three-quarter-length rabbinical-looking coat with a wide mink collar. I look in the mirror. I look like an Orthodox Hamburglar. I look as if I need a slap.
 ''You look good,'' says the man from Bergdorf's.
 ''You look good,'' says the assistant to the man from Bergdorf's.
 ''You look really good,'' says the tailor standing behind me.
 This leaves me in a difficult spot, because if everyone here thinks I look good, then I'm going to have to kick my own butt. Suit Me tells me to relax. Jeans Me tells me to run. 
 ''I'm not going out with yellow socks,'' I say.
 Twenty minutes later, I stroll out the door, gray socks on my feet, pants flapping around my shins. 
 ''Do you want a handbag?'' calls the man from Bergdorf's, hurrying after me.
 ''Do I want a what?''
 ''Do you want a handbag?''
 ''No,'' I say. ''I do not want a handbag.''
 My suit costs $2,295. My shirt costs $230. My shoes cost $680. I am the Three Thousand, Two Hundred and Five Dollar Man, and I'm no longer certain I want rebuilding.
 ''I am a man who commands respect,'' says my suit.
 ''I demand a certain refinement,'' says my shirt.
 ''I have an appreciation for the finer things,'' say my shoes.
 I have agreed to spend the day in this suit, and every minute feels like an eternity. I turn right toward Madison Avenue, step in urine and smile.
 ''Hey!'' say my shoes.
 Things are looking up.
 Madison Avenue between 57th and 71st Streets is home to some of the finest clothing shops in the city. Suit Me calls it Luxury Row. Jeans Me calls it Poseur Parkway.
 ''I could walk around here all day,'' says Gene.
 Gene Pressman is a former C.E.O. of Barneys and co-author of the recent marketing book ''Chasing Cool.'' A book on marketing -- is there a subtitle encapsulating the theme of the book? Yes, there is: ''Standing Out in Today's Cluttered Marketplace.'' My editor has arranged for him to give me a crash course on the ''cultural signifiers of luxury men's wear.''
 Gene takes me to Hermes.
 ''It's not pronounced HER-meez,'' says Gene. ''It's pronounced er-MEZ.''
 I write that down.
 From Er-MEZ we go to Tom Ford; from Tom Ford we go to Loro Piana.
 ''This suit,'' explains Gene, grabbing the sleeve of a shiny pinstripe suit in one store, ''says you're a greaseball.''
 I write that down.
 ''This suit,'' he says, grabbing the sleeve of a wide pinstripe jacket in another store, ''says you're a gangster.''
 I write that down.
 Monkeys, it seems, have it easy. From what I can tell, you want respect in Monkeytown, you beat up some other males, impregnate a few women, climb a tree and waddle out to the end of a branch where everyone can gaze up with awe at your magnificent genitals. Humans, having only partially evolved, still communicate the same messages, but are forced to do so by employing the clumsy metaphor of fashion. Thus, yellow socks. And shrunken suits. And designers whose names carry periods at the end.
 Gene talks about the cut of a jacket the way most men talk about sportscars and baseball. He talks about the way it is tailored, the material, the craft. Gene loves clothing, and clothing loves Gene. I feel like a third wheel. The $680 shoes, still angry about the whole urine thing, are cutting into my ankles. The tie is choking me, and the shirt feels like an iron corset aroundmy chest. But as I walk down Madison Avenue, a strange thing begins to happen: I'm beginning to enjoy this suit. It's like a pod in ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'': I feel older; I feel refined. I feel as if little Zachary could never pull this look off. I feel as if I listen to classical music. I feel as if every night I have a glass of sherry on the veranda before going to bed, and I feel as if I call going to bed ''retiring.'' I'm turning into a Northeast Caucasian Upper Middle Class ''Scarface.'' First you get the money; then you get the Church's shoes; then you get the Thom Browne. suit; then you get the convertible European sportscar; then you get the place in Southampton; then you start wearing your polo shirt collar up; then you give your house a name like ''Serenity'' or ''Breezy Point'' or ''Twin Gables.''
 Another strange thing begins to happen: Outside the clothing boutiques, my newfound feelings for classic refinement turn into newfound feelings of classic classism.
 ''I'm average,'' says one man's non-Bergdorf's suit.
 ''I summer where I winter,'' says another man's tie.
 ''I can't make it here,'' says the plaid sportcoat of a third. ''Can I make it anywhere?''
 ''No,'' says my shirt. My pants laugh. My tie says: ''Looking like that? I don't think so, honey,'' and my shoes agree. 
 This reminds me of the bedtime story I have been reading my son. The story is called ''Spider-Man's New Suit'':
 Peter Parker started wearing the new black suit under his clothes all the time. It made him feel cool. He had attitude. He was tough. But he wasn't feeling quite like himself. He wondered if it was because of the suit.
 ''I've got to get out of this suit,'' I say to Gene. 
 I thank Gene for his time and help and head for my office in Midtown. By the time I get there, I am tired and hungry and feeling worse than I did when little Zachary showed up to school in my clothing. I stop off at my usual breakfast place, a small deli on Third Avenue, and step up to the counter.
 ''What can I get for you, sir?'' the counter man asks. Yesterday, I was ''buddy.''
 ''Egg salad on rye,'' I say.
 ''Yes, sir.''
 A man in a Con Ed hard hat pushes up beside me. He is wearing dust-covered jeans and a dirty T-shirt.
 ''What can I get you, buddy?'' the counter man asks.
 Con Ed places his order, crosses his arms and waits. A man in a suit like mine orders a spinach-feta panini. A woman in a suit like mine orders a goat cheese-arugula-veggie wrap. He's a sir. She's a ma'am. Con Ed scowls.
 ''I live paycheck to paycheck,'' say his jeans.
 ''You should see my genitals,'' says my suit.
 Con Ed gets his sandwich before me, grabs some napkins and pushes past, bumping me with his shoulder. Our clothes speak different languages, so we don't speak at all. 
 Outside, the streets are packed, and traffic is at a standstill. The U.N.General Assembly is in session; the leaders of the sort-of-free world are generally assembling and illegally parking and making it impossible to get around. Yeshiva students fill the streets, heading over to the U.N. to protest Ahmadinejad's policies.
 ''I'm a devout believer in God,'' says a young man's yarmulke.
 ''I take the Old Testament very literally,'' says his rabbinical beard.
 ''Hitler Lives,'' says the placard in his hand. There is a large black swastika on the placard and a picture of Ahmadinejad beside it.
 ''The last American TV show I watched,'' says Ahmadinejad's sportcoat, ''was 'Miami Vice.' ''
 Back in my office, I change back into my jeans and sweatshirt. Suit Me shakes his head with disappointment and goes back to reading The Wall Street Journal. Later he will embezzle some funds, sell the last few barrels of oil that Saddam Hussein gave him and cheat on his wife with the young secretary in Accounting. Clothes make the man, the saying goes. In this case they made me an insufferable one. 
 It was hard for Peter to get rid of the black suit. It clung to him with an evil power. But he knew he could do it.
 I sit down at my desk, take out my sandwich and think about the folks over at the U.N., the guys ruining traffic -- not to mention the world -- and wonder if their suits are making them insufferable, too. Maybe if they all showed up in jeans they could get something accomplished now and then. Bush? Suit. Sarkozy? Suit. King Abdullah? Suit. Ahmadinejad? Suit. Whoever is running England now? Suit. What do you say, guys -- Casual 2008? As for me, I'll just phone Zachary's parents every night, find out what he's wearing to school the next day and wear something else.

HEADLINE: Rising Costs Undermine Wadsworth's Expansion

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

 BODY:
IT was a bittersweet day for Coleman Casey, a day of regret and relief, sadness and celebration, in almost equal parts. Three years after he and other associates of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art clinked champagne glasses to celebrate an elaborate plan to expand operations into the former Hartford Times building, the project was canceled because of insufficient funds.
 On Oct. 2, the State of Connecticut, which owns the long-vacant Times building on Prospect Street, across from the museum on Main Street, terminated the lease and returned the $2.5 million the Wadsworth paid in 2004 to secure the deal. 
 ''After much detailed study and evaluation, it became clear we just couldn't do it,'' said Mr. Casey, the museum's acting director and president of its board of trustees. (The museum's former director, Willard Holmes, resigned in April and is now deputy director of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts.) 
 ''It turns out that what was supposed to have been about a $16 million project would have cost more like $19 million'' Mr. Casey said. ''I don't know about you, but our philosophy is you don't spend money you don't have.''
 ''We entered into this lease pre-Hurricane Katrina,'' he said. ''Since then, building costs and energy costs have escalated dramatically.'' While the building's annual operating expenses -- for heating, electricity, security and the like -- were originally expected to be about $250,000, he added, ''we realized that those costs would certainly be well in excess of $300,000 a year.''
 When you add that to the fact that the Wadsworth has lost money over the last several years, Mr. Casey said, ''it was kind of a deadly combination of factors to deal with.''
 The museum reported a $284,062 deficit for fiscal year 2005-6, the most recent figures available. This year, however, looks a lot more promising. A 400-person, black tie dinner party and art auction on Oct. 6 raised ''several hundred thousand dollars'' for the museum, Mr. Casey said, adding that ''this fiscal year 2007-2008 looks like it will be the first year we'll break even in six years.'' 
 But the museum's 31-member board of trustees, according to Mr. Casey, has also been shaken by news of other museums having hard financial times nationwide. ''It seems to be a case of, 'If you build it, they will not come,'' he said, referring to several museums -- including the Denver Art Museum, which recently completed a large expansion and expected at least 1 million visitors annually, yet had only 630,000 in the 2007 fiscal year. ''These are cautionary tales,'' he said.
 ''I have to heap enormous praise on Governor Rell and the state agencies involved with the negotiations, that they understood without questioning the reasonableness of our conclusions,'' Mr. Casey said. The state will lease the Hartford Times building to Bradley Nitkin, a developer from Greenwich, who plans to build retail, office and restaurant space there. James Abromaitis, executive director of the Capitol City Economic Development Authority, said that the Times building will be incorporated into what is known as Mr. Nitkin's Front Street Project, a nine-acre retail, residential and entertainment development being built in the Adriaen's Landing area, along the Connecticut River near the Connecticut Convention Center.
 An unfortunate aspect of the broken deal is the cost to determine its feasibility. ''Several hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Mr. Casey said, had to be spent on studies and architectural plans. 
 The Wadsworth, which opened in 1842, had hoped to use the Times building for more galleries as well as office, storage and educational space. ''But now we'll go back to the drawing board to figure out how to renovate and reconfigure the space we have,'' Mr. Casey said, adding that the 196,000-square-foot museum is still the largest in the state.
 ''There is some real disappointment'' that the deal fell through, he said, ''but also a sudden, thrilling sense of forward momentum. It means we'll be able to fiscally manage ourselves much better. It gives us a chance to focus on what we've got, which is an enormous, extraordinary collection of art. Nothing is more important than the art.''

Doesn't the Governor Want Tourists to Visit?
 To the Editor:
 ''Neglecting Tourism'' (editorial, Sept. 30) rightly points out that tourism has survived in Connecticut despite a lack of leadership from Gov. M. Jodi Rell. 
 A bipartisan group of legislators created the Commission on Culture and Tourism in 2003, and it was making great strides in setting the bar for cultural tourism. 
 In its first three years, the commission worked with the state's five tourism districts and its many attractions and venues to expand the vacation guide. It added a biannual culture guide, instituted an annual statewide open house, employed innovative guerrilla marketing tactics, redesigned the state's tourism Web site and organized an annual conference. 
 It also awarded partnership grants, made major financial investments in collaborative tourism activities, and published a comprehensive culture and tourism economic analysis. And all of this despite dwindling budgets.
 Hundreds of individuals and businesses across Connecticut did the hard work of building the economic engine of tourism only to see the governor drain the gas from the tank by reducing financing and failing to appoint someone to head the agency.
 Why? Shortsightedness regarding an industry that is made up of restaurants, small retail businesses, lodgings, attractions and nonprofit groups? Fear that spending money on marketing would be viewed as soft? Or maybe because, after recent experience, it was clear that promotional campaigns would not again prominently feature the governor? 
 Whatever the reason, to not build on this success is truly a missed opportunity for the taxpayers of Connecticut.

 To Preserve Old Houses, We Must Find Them First
 To the Editor:
 In ''That Old House'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 30), Richard Moe notes that some communities are imposing moratoriums on the demolition of old houses until they figure out what to do. In many cases, the towns don't know where their historic structures are. 
 The students in my geographic information system, or G.I.S., class at Pace University worked with one town to define which structures existed before 1900 so those properties could be flagged for special consideration if a demolition permit were requested. What made the project easier was the availability of old maps of the town that showed the location of houses and businesses. Most towns have such maps in their historical collections. 
 State archives and the Library of Congress have digitized maps in their collections. By electronically lining up the current property maps and the old maps, the locations of the old structures can be determined. This use of G.I.S. in the service of historic preservation can be done by volunteers with a little training. The maps that are developed can give town officials knowledge of where their old houses are.

 Beware the Hidden Costs of Trash Hauler Licenses
 To the Editor:
 ''Trash Industry Corruption'' (editorial, Sept. 30) offers an unnecessary statewide solution to address improper local practices by a very small number of Connecticut haulers. 
 The members of the National Solid Wastes Management Association applaud law enforcement officials' efforts to root out corruption and punish lawbreakers under current laws. My third-generation trash hauling and recycling company and the vast majority of hauling companies in Connecticut should not suffer the cost and stigma of licensing because of a few in the industry. 
 Legitimate waste haulers should be allowed to compete for collection accounts now that law enforcement has purged the industry of bad actors. Hauler licensing and rate regulation of waste-to-energy plants are hidden taxes that would increase costs for all Connecticut citizens and businesses.

HEADLINE: A Global View Helps Industrial REITs

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
WAREHOUSES and distribution centers, often tucked away in far-flung industrial parks or ports, hardly seem as glamorous as the trophy office buildings or splashy apartment complexes and hotels that private equity firms have been clamoring to acquire. 
 In fact, of the roughly $65 billion in mergers and acquisitions this year involving real estate investment trusts, companies with portfolios of property, only one transaction involved a REIT from the industrial sector, according to SNL Financial, a research company. And that deal was valued at a mere $90.2 million. 
 But investors in the REITs that develop or own these industrial spaces have been reaping attractive rewards just the same.
 In the third quarter, industrial REITs were first among all REIT sectors, with an average return of 13 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts; from the beginning of this year through Thursday, the sector was up nearly 14 percent, on average. By contrast, property REITs over all posted a 2.59 percent return, on average, in the quarter and a 1 percent return this year through Thursday, the association said. 
 Favorable economic conditions have certainly helped, with rising industrial production and job and corporate earnings growth buttressing demand for industrial properties nationwide. Average occupancy rates are now in the low- to mid-90-percent range, up from the high 80's range just three years ago, according to Christopher Haley, a managing director of Wachovia Securities. 
 Even if the economy falters -- though it's not expected to, at least in the near term -- industrial real estate is likely to hold up well because most properties have long-term lease agreements, said Ross L. Smotrich, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns. ''It tends to be a relatively defensive asset class,'' he said. 
 But healthy fundamentals in the United States are only part of the story. These days, said Matthew Ostrower, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, ''overseas markets are where all of the action is.'' He was quick to add that ''not expanding so much domestically is not a statement about the economic cycle per se,'' but more a reflection of the need to open up logistical operations overseas. 
 Indeed, growing global trade is transforming the needs of both American and foreign companies, many of which are redesigning their logistical networks abroad. Europe, in particular, has attracted interest as its increasingly unified economy brings about a need for a pan-European distribution system. In many countries, such facilities are either nonexistent or obsolete.
 The two largest of the seven publicly traded industrial REITs -- ProLogis Trust and AMB Property -- have been expanding onto other continents. 
 ProLogis, the leader in the overseas movement, ''saw an opportunity to follow their customers, like DHL, Nike or Intel, who were saying, 'you're helping us out in Denver and Los Angeles; can you help us out in Japan, China or Korea?' '' said Louis Taylor, a senior real estate analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''That's been a big drive to the ProLogis business, and increasingly important for AMB.''
 ProLogis has operations in 20 countries in North America, Europe and Asia, which, according to its chief executive, Jeffrey H. Schwartz, ''collectively have 76 percent of the world's gross domestic product.'' He says the company is looking into eventually doing business in India as well.
 ''In the first half of the year, 88 percent of development starts were outside of North America,'' Mr. Schwartz said of the company's projects. He explained that the shortage of available land in many foreign markets, along with high barriers to entry in some places, augur well for his company's developments. 
 He said ProLogis was also developing more multistory buildings, especially in land-scarce Japan. And it is rapidly expanding in China, where it is ensconced in coastal cities and is now headed inland. Last year, the company announced that it was developing an industrial park in Beijing to serve as the primary logistics and distribution center for the 2008 Olympics.
 AMB, which focuses on properties near major international cargo airports and seaports, began expanding internationally only five years ago, with properties in Mexico. Today, it has operations in 13 countries, and more than half of the 46 projects in its development pipeline are international. In an analysts' conference last month, the company said it expected to have 75 percent of its new developments outside the United States by 2010, with target spots in Britain, Central and Eastern Europe and India. Earlier this month, it announced the acquisition of an industrial development project in London.
 Hamid R. Moghadam, AMB's chairman and chief executive, said the company planned to focus more on multistory development in urban areas, which he considers more efficient and better for the environment (and not just in Japan). ''It helps avoid urban sprawl,'' he said in a recent interview, ''and it's one way of being 'green.' '' 
 Other REITs with overseas interests, though to a far lesser degree, are First Industrial Realty Trust, which operates in 30 markets in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium, and DCT Industrial Trust, which operates in the United States and Mexico. 
 First Industrial has a broad range of industrial properties, large and small, in a variety of markets. Mr. Haley of Wachovia Securities says that this acts as ''a cushion'' against market volatility. 
 ''They're playing to all the asset types and to the local and regional markets,'' he said, while AMB, DCT and ProLogis focused on larger, more upscale developments. 
 Yet they all seem to have a similar business template, analysts say: buy or build, lease or sell, then move on to other projects. ''In doing that, they have been able to create profits through volume,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 Analysts remain bullish on the expansion plans of ProLogis and AMB, with some saying that share prices had room to grow this year. ProLogis has been trading in the $70-a-share range, while AMB is in the $65 range.
 Others, though, were more cautious about the industry in general, especially when it came to domestic operations. ''New supply has grown over the last several years to approximate demand,'' Mr. Haley said. ''There's a greater chance of occupancy declining. Therefore, the pricing power of industrial owners is less than what it was a year or so ago.'' 
 Still, said Mr. Ostrower at Morgan Stanley, ''earnings for ProLogis and AMB have been relatively strong this year.'' 
 ProLogis said its funds from operations, or F.F.O. -- a widely used gauge of real estate operating performance -- jumped to $309.9 million, or $1.16 a share, in the second quarter, from $229.3 million, or 90 cents a share, last year. Its third-quarter results are scheduled to be released on Oct. 25.
 AMB, meanwhile, reported second-quarter F.F.O. of $78.5 million, or 74 cents a share, down from $82.4 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier, though higher than Wall Street estimates. Its third-quarter results are scheduled to be released on Tuesday. 
 Investors and analysts alike will undoubtedly be watching the numbers closely. ''Those companies really drive the performance of the industrial segment,'' Mr. Taylor said.

HEADLINE: Enjoying Life Outside the Bubble

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
THE last time I talked to Kevin Landis was over lunch at Le Bernardin, the haute French restaurant in Manhattan, back in the fall of 2000. At the time, the air hadn't yet gone out of the Internet bubble, and as manager of the tech-focused Firsthand family of mutual funds, Mr. Landis was feeling pretty good about the fact that assets under management had gone from $2 billion to more than $6 billion in a matter of months. In fact, he was more than a little cocky. (So was I -- reporters don't eat at Le Bernardin anymore, at least if their publisher is paying.)
 So with the 16 percent rise in the Nasdaq this year, not to mention the meteoric rise of stocks like Google, which recently passed $600 a share for the first time, Mr. Landis is again feeling good. His flagship Technology Value fund is up 27 percent this year and has had an average annual return of 26 percent over the last five years. But he's no longer so cocky -- that got knocked out of Mr. Landis the hard way, when Firsthand suffered huge losses as the bubble finally burst early in the decade. 
 ''You don't want to ask for those numbers,'' he jokes. ''It's still painful and it always will be, and not because my mom's in the fund. It goes on your permanent record, like in school.'' In 2001, the Technology Value fund dropped 44 percent, and then plunged 56 percent in 2002. Firsthand's total assets under management, now about $750 million, are still a small fraction of what they were in 2000.
 With the fund's record of being up, down and up again, it seemed like a good time to ask Mr. Landis if tech investors are enjoying Web 2.0 or Bubble 2.0, as many commentators put it. 
 He says that while individual names like Research in Motion and Apple have begun to get pricey, the broader tech sector ''has got plenty of room to keep running.'' And unlike 2000, when the likes of Dr.Koop.com and Webvan went through the roof, no longer can just about any dot-com stock win investor enthusiasm. As for Google, he says ''it's pricey, but not hugely so.'' Google is ''a one-trick pony,'' he says, referring to the fact that most of its revenue is from search-related advertising. ''But it's a hell of a pony.''
 More established tech names like Intel and Cisco -- both of which still trade well below their bubble-era peaks but are up more than 20 percent this year -- have become mature, almost old-fashioned blue chips, with steady, if not exceptional returns, he says. 
 That other tech giant, Microsoft, has a cloudier future, he predicts. It's flat for the year, and Mr. Landis says ''they're going to have a hard time generating much more growth.''
 ''Microsoft conquered the desktop and then the server room,'' he adds, ''but what the heck else is out there for them?''
 Back in the fall of 2000, Mr. Landis was excited about the tax-cut plans of George W. Bush, then running for president, and less than enthralled by Al Gore. Today, though, he says he has a new appreciation for Mr. Gore, who just won the Nobel Peace Prize, and his green agenda, at least when it comes to alternative-energy companies that might gain from development of solar power.
 One favorite is SunPower, which makes solar panels that are much more energy-efficient than their predecessors. SunPower's shares have doubled this year, but Mr. Landis's preferred way of playing it is by holding Cypress Semiconductor, which owns 53 percent of SunPower but trades at a more reasonable price-to-earnings multiple. 
 Another pick on this theme is Applied Materials, a semiconductor play. ''These new solar panels are an offshoot of semiconductors,'' he says.
 OF course, this sector has enjoyed a spectacular run already, with First Solar now at $136, up from $30 at the beginning of the year. But Mr. Landis is hopeful. ''Alternative energy isn't where the Internet was in 1999,'' he assures me, with a touch of the exuberance that made him a regular on CNBC years ago. ''It's where the Internet was in 1980.'' Old ways die hard, I guess, and in Silicon Valley, where Mr. Landis grew up, the next big thing is always just around the corner.

HEADLINE: An Aging Bull Can Still Be a Raging Bull

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TO the growing list of descriptions for this bull market -- like ''record setting,'' ''resilient'' and ''uninterrupted'' -- you can add one more: ''old.''
 Last week, this bull did something that only four other stock market rallies since 1942 have accomplished: it lived to see its fifth birthday, on Oct. 10. 
 And, on Oct. 23, barring an 11th-hour market plunge, this bull will turn 5 years and 14 days old, surpassing the 1982-87 period as the third-longest bull run in the last 75 years, based on the Dow Jones industrial average. (Based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, it will become the fourth-longest rally.) 
 But doesn't that mean the bull is that much closer to being put out to pasture? 
 Not necessarily. Although aging rallies are a cause for concern, ''bull markets do not die of old age,'' said James B. Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter published in Whitefish, Mont.
 Nor do bulls always tire in their twilight years. For the handful of rallies that have had them, sixth years have produced stellar gains -- more than 25 percent, on average. 
 ''It's sort of like human demographics,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. ''You know how they say that if you make it to age 65, there's a great chance you'll live to at least 85? Well, if a bull market makes it through Year 3, and then Years 4 and 5, the sixth year turns out to be very, very good.''
 To be sure, it would be dangerous to count on a 20-percent-plus return over the next 12 months, based solely on how rallies have unfolded in history. 
 But you cannot deny that in many respects, this bull has played out to script so far. 
 Consider this: In the first years of bull markets since 1942, stocks have risen 38 percent, on average, according to S.& P. This bull advanced 34 percent in its first year. In the typical second year of a rally, stock prices rise an additional 11 percent. Almost true to form, this bull pushed equities higher by about 8 percent. 
 By the third year, bulls tend to slow down, posting average gains of just 4 percent. This bull slowed down, too, but not quite that much; it advanced 7 percent in Year 3. In the fourth year, bull markets tend to catch a second wind, posting average returns of 13 percent -- which is exactly how much this one gained. Then, in Year 5, stocks tend to advance an additional 8 percent. And in the fifth year of this bull market, equities rose 15.9 percent. 
 While few market strategists are predicting a 25 percent jump in stocks prices in the coming year, James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said, ''I think this market still has a ways to go.''
 What makes him think so?
 For starters, although this bull has had staying power, it has not been terribly strong, at least by historical standards. 
 Over the last 65 years, for instance, stocks have risen nearly 155 percent, on average, over the life of a bull market. In this rally, though, equities have gained a little over 100 percent. So you can't say that this market has gotten ahead of itself.
 Moreover, stocks have become a whole lot cheaper during this market, based on common valuation measures like the price-to-earnings ratio. A bull market is generally marked by climbing stock values, even by standards other than share price.
 Indeed, after starting off at a lofty 27 in October 2002, the stock market's P/E ratio has fallen to a much more modest 18. ''If anything, this market has become more attractive based on valuation,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
 This is not the way it's supposed to work. As bulls age, investors are supposed to be willing to pay ever-higher prices for stocks. Indeed, in the first three years of the previous bull market, which began in October 1990, P/E ratios for the S.& P. 500 index shot up to 22 from 14. ''This is the only postwar bull where P/E's have come down,'' Mr. Paulsen said. 
 Still, the news isn't all good. For example, this is now the second-longest, correction-less rally in stock market history. 
 Historically, stocks have gone through a correction, defined as a pullback of 10 percent or more, every one and a half years. Although this market has come close, falling 9.4 percent from July 19 to Aug. 15, it has not corrected, by the textbook definition, in nearly five years.
 It may seem counterintuitive, but corrective sell-offs can be crucial to the longevity of a bull. Think of them as tiny tremors. Small sell-offs in the market, like tremors, are thought to alleviate some of the pressure that builds up in the market. If there are enough of them, a big quake could be prevented.
 ''The longer you go without a correction of at least 10 percent, the greater the probability that any future correction will turn into a bear market,'' Mr. Stack said.
 At the end of the day, bull markets aren't killed by market forces. Instead, it's the underlying health of the economy that determines the market's longevity.
 Historically, Mr. Stack noted, imbalances in the economy, like inflationary spikes, have often derailed the markets. 
 WHAT potential imbalances lurk this time? Clearly, many people fear further unraveling of the housing market. Recent data shows that the housing market is cooling faster than many economists have expected. And ''we're a long way from the bottom of the unwinding process,'' Mr. Stack said.
 For Mr. Paulsen, the big question isn't necessarily housing, but a potential slowdown in the job market. In a worst-case situation, he said, recent credit market fears, prompted by problems in the mortgage market, would cause companies to postpone hiring. If so, the consumer would take a big hit.
 Though he doesn't see that situation as likely, he said, such a blow to consumers ''could be the end of this bull market.''

HEADLINE: A Frank With a Side of Ideology

BYLINE: By SAKI KNAFO

 BODY:
AT Gray's Papaya, a three-store chain in Manhattan known for its griddle-cooked hot dogs and tropical fruit drinks, dozens of multicolored signs promote a wide variety of items, among them papaya juice, pineapple juice, coconut Champagne and banana daiquiris. 
 Papaya juice is lauded as ''nature's own revitalizer,'' and customers who choose banana daiquiris are assured that they will ''go completely bananas.'' But in two of the three Gray's Papayas -- in Greenwich Village and on the Upper West Side -- among the signs flogging refreshing drinks are others that say in red capital letters, ''Run Mike, run!''
 Nicholas A. B. Gray, who founded the company in 1973, put up his first signs urging Mayor Bloomberg to make a bid for the White House in August, following widespread speculation that the mayor would enter the presidential race. Mr. Gray removed the signs when he went on vacation. But despite the fact that a Bloomberg presidential bid seems increasingly unlikely, the signs are back up, tantalizing passers-by with promises of ''free hot dogs on Inauguration Day.'' 
 Mr. Gray, a self-described C-Span enthusiast who speaks with a slight British accent, called the mayor a ''superb manager'' and added: ''I think he's cool under pressure. I don't think he needs any financial assistance, which makes it harder for him to be corrupted.''
 Mr. Gray, who is 70, has never been shy about using his store windows for political expression; Jimmy Carter, in 1976, and Bill Bradley, in 1999, both earned his presidential endorsement. And in 1998, when Bill Clinton was facing impeachment, Mr. Gray displayed a sign that read, ''Hang in there, Mr. President.'' Mr. Gray's interest in politics may also explain why his stores offer something called a Recession Special -- two dogs and a drink for $3.50. 
 David Wachtel, a retired airline employee from Whitestone, Queens, who was sipping papaya juice and munching on a frankfurter at the Gray's Papaya in Greenwich Village one recent afternoon, said he wasn't surprised to see a hot dog place taking a political stand. ''Around here,'' Mr. Wachtel added, referring to the Village, ''you could even have a sex store endorsing a president.''
 John Gallagher, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, commented by e-mail on Mr. Gray's politicking: ''Although the mayor has made it clear that he is not running for president, he is a big fan of Gray's Papaya hot dogs -- so much so that he had one there a couple days after his election in 2001.'' 
 Mr. Gray said he had had no idea that the mayor had patronized his shop. ''I just like the cut of his jib,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Shrugged

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KINSLEY. 
Michael Kinsley is a columnist for Time magazine.

 BODY:
THE AGE OF TURBULENCE 
 Adventures in a New World. 
 By Alan Greenspan. 
 Illustrated. 531 pp. The Penguin Press. $35. 
 So the suspense is over: Alan Greenspan is able to express himself in clear English prose. This is not entirely a compliment. For 18 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Greenspan was known for his inscrutable Congressional testimony. That joke had long become tired, and now he is exposed as a fraud. It seems from ''The Age of Turbulence'' that Greenspan enjoyed the obfuscation game: as a frank antipopulist, he thought and still thinks that an air of mystery around the Fed is a good thing.
 Wait. It gets worse. Not only can Greenspan discourse lucidly on economic matters, but he has also written the most unexpectedly charming Washington insider memoir since Katharine Graham's a decade ago. The books are very different. The charm of Graham's was its frankness. The publisher of The Washington Post dished and dissed, starting with her mother. Greenspan is the soul of tact. Far too many people are labeled as his ''friend.'' Even the mildest criticism is prefaced by a statement of high regard and/or followed by an expression of regret. He doesn't lay a glove on his mother. 
 The charm of Greenspan's book is its self-portrait. The author may have put as much art into the self as into the portrait, but the result is one of the more interesting characters in the history of our democracy: a saxophone-playing math dweeb who became not just powerful but glamorous, while remaining a dweeb. He writes, in reference to one of his early published articles, ''I declared, with all the enthusiasm of youth, 'Since small business may act as a barometer of cyclical movements, a survey of both the immediate and long-term trends in small corporate manufacturing is of particular interest.' '' You gotta love a guy whose idea of an important life lesson is: ''I have always argued that an up-to-date set of the most detailed estimates for the latest available quarter is far more useful for forecasting accuracy than a more sophisticated model structure.'' Words to live by.
 Greenspan resists all opportunities to portray himself as cool. He races past his early career as a professional jazz sideman, noting hastily that his saxophone teacher paired him up with ''a 15-year-old by the name of Stanley Getz,'' and that the band he played with included the pop artist Larry Rivers as well as the future Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment and the future composer of the ''theme music for M*A*S*H.'' He dismisses all popular music since (and including) Elvis as ''on the edge of noise.'' (Note the characteristic qualification.) He dwells on his boyhood love of Morse code. He brags that while his fellow musicians were smoking pot, he was doing their income taxes. He declares unnecessarily that in the 1960s, ''I didn't relate to flower power,'' adding with strange dignity: ''I had the freedom not to participate, and I didn't.''
 Freedom. For this proud square, this eager conformist and joiner of the establishment, freedom is nevertheless the supreme value of his life. Freedom and, he would add, rationality. In the early 1950s he joined the inner circle of Ayn Rand, the author of ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged,'' whose philosophy, known as Objectivism, was an extreme form of libertarianism that actually celebrated selfishness and greed. Many young brainiacs of dorkish tendencies go through an Ayn Rand period (her books are very popular at Microsoft). But Greenspan credits Rand as ''a stabilizing force in my life'' and was ''a regular at the weekly gatherings at her apartment'' through the early 1960s. She stood at his side when he was sworn in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974, and they ''remained close until she died in 1982.''
 Those weekly meetings sound like the famous ''Beyond the Fringe'' comedy routine about Bertrand Russell trying to ''trap the then young, and somewhat beautiful, G. E. Moore into a logical falsehood by means of a cunning semantic subterfuge'' involving apples in a basket. Before he met Rand, Greenspan was a logical positivist. He refused to accept the reality of anything that could not be verified by ''significant empirical evidence.'' His own existence, for example. Rand started calling him ''the undertaker'' and would ask friends, ''Has the undertaker decided he exists yet?''
 Rand, Greenspan explains deadpan, was ''a devoted Aristotelian'' and believed in ''an objective reality that is separate from consciousness and capable of being known.'' It is hard to imagine any other Washington power figure -- one thinks of Henry Kissinger -- raising the question of whether he exists in his own autobiography. (Penguin Press, the publisher that reportedly paid Greenspan $8.5 million for this book, must have thought he damn well better exist for that kind of money.) 
 As for an objective reality apart from consciousness -- in this age of spin, the less said about that, the better. Greenspan ultimately concluded that these basic issues didn't actually have to be settled before breakfast in order to make it through the day. Democracy implies disagreement, and ''compromise on public issues is the price of civilization, not an abrogation of principle.'' He credits Rand with broadening his outlook and making him more tolerant of new ideas -- not qualities she is often associated with.
 Rand's inner circle was a cauldron of politics and sex, but Greenspan (he says) participated only in the former. He was married for less than a year to Joan Mitchell, whose best friend's husband was Rand's lover (got that?). Discreet as always, Greenspan says only that ''I'd made an intellectual choice, not an emotional one.'' He and Joan are ''friends to this day.''
 He also remains good friends with Barbara Walters, who took him up after he became C.E.A. chairman. Or at least they were friends until this book. Walters took him to parties and introduced him to the beautiful people. Greenspan comments, in a rare lapse of tact: ''I usually thought the food was good but the conversation dull.'' Soon he became one of the beautiful people himself. For years after Walters, Greenspan was seen around with Andrea Mitchell of NBC News. His intentions about marriage were as hard to fathom and as eagerly speculated upon as his intentions about interest rates. They finally wed in 1997.
 Today, Greenspan and Mitchell are at the pinnacle of society in Washington and New York, invited everywhere and actually showing up more often than most people in their position would bother. Even in his 80s, Greenspan is a happy and energetic socializer. But he still gives every appearance of enjoying the food more than the company. He remains an unapologetic dweeb. His discussions of the high life in this book are perfunctory -- except for one bizarre reference to ''a cut-velvet burgundy and black Badgley Mischka'' (it's a dress) in which his wife looked especially fetching -- while a discourse on the economics of the tin can brims with the excitement of discovery.
 Although the ''Alan Greenspan'' of this book is a self-conscious creation of the author, even he may not realize how truly awful he is at telling a joke. ''I am only half joking,'' he says about what is at mosta quarter of a joke about forbidding people who want to be president from becoming one. He says ''only an economist could appreciate'' a joke about the size of the Mobil Oil company compared with that of the federal government, which he then proceeds to demonstrate.
 The hostesses who invite Greenspan to their dinner parties presumably have only the slightest clue of why he is, or was, or actually still is, so important, and the business executives who pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches don't know much more. Television pundits bring vast mountains of expertise and wisdom to a discussion of the Iowa caucuses. But throw a cut in the discount rate at them and you can see fear in their eyes as they blather toward the next commercial.
 The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has always been a big deal. Greenspan's predecessors include William McChesney Martin, whose sonorous name alone lent dignity to paper currency. And there was Arthur Burns, who cut exactly the right image with his omnipresent pipe, but who sold his soul to Richard Nixon by engineering a phony boom for the 1972 election. And then there was Paul Volcker, Greenspan's immediate predecessor, also with a pipe and 10 or 11 feet tall to boot. But Greenspan owns the role of Fed chairman the way Zero Mostel owned the role of Tevye in ''Fiddler on the Roof.''
 Milton Friedman deserves some of the credit. Greenspan became Fed chairman just as Friedman's theory of monetarism -- that the money supply determines the inflation rate -- became more or less universally accepted, and just after we peered over the hyperinflation precipice and pulled back. Friedman actually believed that expansion of the money supply should be put on automatic pilot. He did not favor someone pulling levers and twisting dials like the man behind the curtain in ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Nevertheless, Greenspan took the newfound importance of monetary policy, mixed in his number-crunching talents on the one hand and his social and business prestige on the other, topped it off with his soon-to-become-legendary mumbo jumbo at hearings, stirred the mixture, drank it and turned into a wizard.
 Why did Guess What Greenspan Is Thinking become such a serious sport during his tenure at the Fed? Why can his word move markets even now? The answer to the second question is that people are nuts. The answer to the first is that Greenspan's predictions about the economy may not have been better than anyone else's -- but he was in a position to do something about them. To put it in terms Greenspan the data lover might appreciate, his opinions as Fed chairman weren't important as a view of the data: they were data.
 Most of the bad publicity Greenspan has gotten since this book was published concerns the early years of the second Bush administration. That's when Greenspan gave every appearance of endorsing the president's grossly irresponsible tax-cut proposal. Greenspan said at the time that he was concerned about the danger of the huge surpluses that seemed to loom ahead for about five minutes. In the book he says he was ''wrong to abandon my skepticism'' about the reality of these surpluses and maintains that it's not his fault if people missed the part about canceling the cuts if the surplus didn't materialize. (''I can't be in charge of people's perceptions. I don't function that way. I can't function that way,'' he quotes himself saying piously to Robert Rubin, a former Clinton Treasury secretary, who begged him not to support the cuts.)
 This was an eccentric episode in several ways. According to his book, Greenspan -- whose Senate confirmation hearing was the same day Nixon went on television to resign -- dreamed that George W. Bush would be a reincarnation of Gerald Ford, whom he idealizes as the kind of man who could restore economic sanity to the nation through the combination of principled conservatism and bipartisan civility. Greenspan was deeply disappointed when this didn't happen. He says that ''behind the scenes'' he begged Bush to veto a few spending measures and was told that the president was afraid of antagonizing Dennis Hastert, of all people. Never before or since has anyone expressed fear of this already-forgotten figure who, as House speaker, was just a front man for the authentically scary Tom DeLay. When Congress passed Bush's tax cut in May 2001, Greenspan writes, ''I knew how Cassandra must have felt.'' It's a self-serving analogy. When Cassandra warned you, you knew you'd been warned. She didn't say, ''I can't be in charge of people's perceptions.''
 Although Greenspan was the best at inhabiting the role, the greatest Fed chairman of our time was Volcker. Greenspan would agree, I think. He writes of his immediate predecessor: ''What he masterminded ... was arguably the most important change in economic policy in 50 years.'' The Fed decided ''that it would no longer try to fine-tune the economy by focusing on short-term interest rates; instead it would clamp down on the amount of money available to the economy.''
 A wonderful thing about monetary policy is the way it disguises political or even moral decisions as theoretical or technical ones. You could describe what Volcker did as officially accepting the theory of monetarism, or as contracting the supply of M1. Whatever. But put bluntly, what he did was to purposely engineer the deepest decline since the Great Depression in order to wring inflation -- and the expectation of future inflation -- out of the economy. This set the stage for the generation of prosperity that Greenspan presided over.
 Greenspan deserves enormous credit for staying the course. And yet -- as he himself tells it in this book -- he also helped Ronald Reagan in 1980 to demagogue economic policy as a way of attacking Jimmy Carter. He wrote a speech for Reagan blaming Carter for ''one of the major economic contractions in the last 50 years.'' Reagan changed that to ''a new depression -- the Carter depression.'' Within a week, this had turned into: ''A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his!'' Greenspan says, ''What attracted me to Reagan was the clarity of his conservatism.''
 As Greenspan surely knows but doesn't admit, Reagan achieved this appealing clarity by ignoring the ''objective reality separate from consciousness'' that Greenspan used to treasure. And Greenspan does the same. Early in Reagan's administration, as a member of the president's economic advisory board, he supported Reagan's tax cuts ''if spending was restrained'' and if the Fed kept money tight. Volcker's Fed continued to do its bit but Reagan, famously, did not, leading to enormous deficits. Greenspan says, ''Congress shied away from the necessary restraints on spending.'' But the data -- those good old data -- show that the budgets Reagan proposed were only slightly smaller than the budgets Congress eventually passed.
 The data also show that George W. Bush has done a better job than Reagan did at controlling government spending. Spending has averaged 19.7 percent of G.D.P. during Bush's first six years -- Iraq war and all -- while it was 22.4 percent during Reagan's eight years. (If you assume a year's lag between policy and result, it's 22.3 percent.)
 Half this book -- the half that is getting no attention -- isn't memoir: it's what Greenspan calls ''detective stories'': just Alan riding the data wherever it takes him, having the time of his life, trying to solve all the world's economic puzzles, like why it took so long for computers to affect productivity, why incomes are becoming more unequal and what to do about it, the energy crisis, immigration, entitlements and so on. Not all of this is wildly original, but there are great nuggets and apercus. And it is all written in English and fully comprehensible.

HEADLINE: Where They Are Now

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
Donald H. Rumsfeld
 The former defense secretary, forced to resign by President Bush in November 2006, has an office in downtown Washington and is planning to write memoirs to be released in 2009. He is said to be talking to publishers on his own terms. ''Publishers are not interviewing Donald Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld is interviewing publishers,'' said Raymond F. DuBois, a former deputy under secretary of defense.
 Mr. DuBois said that Mr. Rumsfeld would like the book to focus on his entire career rather than just his recent past overseeing two wars, but his friends have tried to steer him away from the broader scope. ''Those of us who are close to him have suggested that it's the last six years that are of interest to us and the public and not his first six years in public life, when he was a congressman from Cook County, Ill.,'' Mr. DuBois said. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld is also working to create a foundation to underwrite university fellowships in national security studies. His friends insist that he is not bitter about his ouster, but in a recent interview with GQ magazine, Mr. Rumsfeld, when asked if he missed Mr. Bush, said, ''Um, no.''
 Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold
 General Newbold of the Marine Corps, the former director of operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired in late 2002 after objecting, to no avail, to plans by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for a small Iraq invasion force. ''I knew it was absolutely and fundamentally wrong and that we were being led into something for which the troops would pay the ultimate price,'' General Newbold said in a recent interview.
 In April 2006, as part of what became known as the ''revolt of the generals,'' General Newbold aired his views publicly in an essay in Time magazine. Now employed at a private equity group in Washington, General Newbold said he was glad he had spoken out. But he said he had stopped visiting wounded men and women at the Bethesda Naval Hospital and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center because he felt awkward about criticizing the conduct of the war when they had been in harm's way. ''That's a little uncomfortable,'' he said.
 He said he also missed his old friends. ''The Marine Corps is the best thing that ever happened to me,'' he said. ''It was that sense of a championship locker room.''
 Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton
 General Eaton, who was sidelined after he had trouble training the Iraqi military in 2003, retired in January 2006 and called for Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation in an op-ed article in The New York Times two months later. Now he lives in Fox Island, Wash., and describes himself as ''technically unemployed,'' although he is writing a memoir and remodeling a house.
 General Eaton, who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000 and 2004, said his unhappiness about mistakes in the war have led him to the Democratic Party. He has endorsed a local Democratic candidate for Congress, and expects to do more. ''That's probably where I'm headed, where I shift from an independent status,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 He said he had no regrets about speaking out except for the time it took from his life. General Eaton is regularly asked to appear on television and has written other op-ed articles for The Times. ''When I wrote that Rumsfeld should step down, those were apparently fighting words,'' he said. ''I expected them to blow over, but they didn't.''

HEADLINE: A Hatchback Plot Is Hatched

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
A SENATE investigation is in order. Alert Stephen Colbert, and have him put Volvo on notice: paint it any color you like, but the C30 looks like a pinko plot by those socialist Swedes. In fact, it's downright un-American. 
 Volvo may be owned by Ford, the pickup king whose Harley-Davidson and King Ranch editions couldn't make their U.S.-of-A. allusions any more clear. But this C30 hatchback isn't a truck, or even a made-for-Vermont Volvo wagon. Instead, what we have here is a sneaky-fast Euro hatchback, as sleek and modern as a Stockholm cafe, the kind of car that Americans have made perfectly clear they don't want.
 Or do they? 
 While the history of small hatchbacks in the United States is dwarfed by some literally longer chapters -- the Tailfin, the Guzzler, the Mighty Hummer -- the rest of the world caught on a long time ago. Small, zippy hatchbacks can not only be good for you, they can be good. 
 Here, finally, the coinciding spikes in Mini sales and gasoline prices have created an opening for the kind of fun, fashionable small cars that Europe (and Asia) rarely bothered to send our way. One of those no-shows is the Europe-only Ford Focus that shares its platform with this Volvo; Ford has decided that the European Focus is too expensive and sophisticated for us American rubes, even in small numbers. (We will soon get a rehash of the same old American-spec Focus instead.)
 That leaves us with the two-door Volvo and with the terrific four-door Mazda 3 hatchback that is built on the same architecture. 
 The C30 is a sprightly, shapely little wedge that drew more unbidden public praise than any Volvo I've driven in years. Its most striking design cue -- a daring all-glass hatch framed by a chunky tail -- was widely admired when shown on the Safety Concept Car that Volvo unwrapped in 2001. The design also makes a nod to the 1800 ES wagon of the early 1970s.
 Below its skin, the Volvo is essentially an S40 sedan with 8.5 inches and 300 pounds shorn from its rear end. That leaves a car roughly the size of a competing Volkswagen GTI or Audi A3, but nearly 10 inches shorter than a Mazda 3.
 Keeping things software-simple, Volvo offers 1.0 and 2.0 versions, starting at $23,445 and $26,445, respectively. Both models get the S40's 5-cylinder, 2.5-liter turbocharged engine with 227 horsepower and a buff 237 pound-feet of torque.
 That engine delivers the muted drone typical of five-cylinder power plants -- it could use a decongestant -- but it is plenty strong. Get it wrong with the throttle, and the C30 smokes its poor front tires throughout first gear. Get it right, and the little Swede runs like a luge headed downhill, hitting 60 miles an hour in 6.6 seconds with the five-speed automatic transmission, 6.2 seconds with the five-speed manual. And its turbo torque keeps things moving well into triple-digit territory. 
 Torque steer, a condition in which burly front-drive cars struggle to point straight ahead under hard acceleration, is especially well controlled. Fuel economy is acceptable for this class at 19 m.p.g. in town and 27 on the highway. 
 Naturally, Volvo works overtime on safety, and it drops its best abbreviations on the C30: there is the SIPS side-impact airbag protection system, the WHIPS whiplash-protection seats, the optional BLIS blind-spot monitor. In a 35 m.p.h. rear-end crash, the rear head restraints are designed to block intruding objects while the body diverts crash energy downward, away from the passengers.
 On rolling, wooded two-lane roads in the Sterling Forest area north of New York City, the C30 proved to be the rare Volvo with more than safety and citizenship on its mind. The car hung in nicely on turns, with an elastic, eager feel similar to the S40's.
 Especially with the softer suspension of the 1.0, the Volvo isn't as aggressively tuned as boy racer cars like the Volkswagen GTI or Mazdaspeed 3, but it's not playing their game. Instead, the C30 picks a spot between edgy and easygoing, including a ride that's quieter and smoother than many of its rivals. 
 Brakes, at least on my test car, seemed to be the squishy Achilles' heel, with average power and a pedal that began sinking near the floor during robust use. 
 The long coupe doors swing out extra-wide, requiring attention to avoiding whacking cars or fire hydrants. Step inside, and the C30 has the airy, modern-furniture feel of recent Volvos, including the curving waterfall panel that forms the center of the instrument panel. Also familiar are the excellent form-fitting seats and controls so simple and ergonomically correct they almost seem old-fashioned. Visibility is another strong point, with an enormous expanse of windshield and slim roof pillars. 
 With two distinct buckets, the back seat is tighter than some competitors that offer seating for five in a pinch. And while that hatch is distinctively stylish, the form hinders the function: with no metal frame, the glass panel is commendably light, but the opening is notably smaller than those of other hatchbacks. Forget about squeezing that flat-panel TV box inside. With seats folded or erect, the downsloping roof impinges on cargo capacity; a Kia Spectra's hatch seems as big as an S.U.V.'s in comparison. 
 If the hatch is somewhat stingy, so is the basic interior: It fairly rattles its bare bones, urging you to flesh it out with options. 
 My 1.0 version had a reasonable price of $25,170, but with a $1,250 automatic transmission and lovely blue metallic paint ($475) as the only options. (Version 2.0 adds a firmer suspension, sporty body trim, 18-inch wheels, larger exhaust outlets and a 650-watt audio system). 
 But even a quick scan of my surroundings revealed M.I.A. items like leather upholstery, heated and powered seats; a navigation system, Xenon headlamps, sunroof, cruise control, satellite radio, rain-sensing wipers and trip computer.
 All that, and much more, is available for a price. Some are part of the Custom Build program that charges a $300 entry fee for the pleasure of spending even more on options, including 17 exterior and 12 interior colors. 
 Some of this becomes annoying. From a tactile and aesthetic standpoint, the standard steering wheel seems straight from the Volvo mom catalog. But why should you have to pay $450 extra ($300 to join the Custom Build club, $150 for the wheel) for a sporty wheel in a sporty car? 
 Pour on the luxury sauce, and the C30 can shoot past $30,000 and even $35,000. To be fair, though, the Audi A3 has a similar high-flying price structure. 
 So while it's easy to poke fun at Americans' Conestoga-size tastes, cars like the C30 and A3 do cost a lot relative to their size. When a small hatchback passes the $30,000 mark, it's hard to avoid noticing a number of roomier, more powerful cars that cost the same or less -- from a loaded 268-horsepower Honda Accord to a Mustang GT with a V-8. 
 But the true small-car believer thumbs his nose at these beasts, or would if he could lift his elbow, usually wedged against the door. Count me among them: I've willingly paid a premium for several hot hatchbacks over the years. 
 Will America learn to love small-but-posh cars like the C30, or remain small-minded? Time, and the price of gasoline, will tell. 
 INSIDE TRACK: A little bit of skol.

HEADLINE: Sarah Jewett, Brian Smith

 BODY:
Sarah Elizabeth Jewett was married yesterday to Brian Todd Smith. The Rev. Bruce S. Comiskey, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at Edson Hill Manor, an inn in Stowe, Vt.
 The bride, 29, is a program development officer at the Eurasia Foundation, an organization in Washington that provides financing to nonprofit organizations in the former Soviet Union. She graduated cum laude from Princeton. 
 She is the daughter of Dr. Elizabeth Jewett and Dr. Mark Jewett of Randolph, Vt. Her father, an internist, practices in Rochester, Vt., at Gifford Medical Center. The bride's mother, a pediatrician, who is retired, worked at the center until last year. 
 The bridegroom, also 29, is studying Armenian at the Foreign Service Institute in preparation for a posting as a consular officer to the United States embassy in Yerevan, Armenia, in January. Until February, he was an economic reporting officer at the embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. 
 He is a son of Deborah Smith and Wayne Smith of Columbus, Ind. His mother teaches kindergarten at Lillian Schmitt Elementary School in Columbus. His father, who is retired, taught mathematics and was the athletic director at Northside Middle School, also in Columbus. 
 Ms. Jewett met Mr. Smith in December 2003 in St. Petersburg, Russia, where they were participating in a volunteer teaching program. He sat across from her at an introductory dinner and by the end of the evening there was an ''unacknowledged mutual crush,'' Ms. Jewett said. But Mr. Smith cautiously pursued a friendship at first. 
 Over the next few months, as they explored the city together, Mr. Smith contemplated kissing Ms. Jewett.
 ''I was waiting for the right moment,'' he said. But it never seemed to arrive. One night, after leaving a place called the Idiot Cafe, they rode the escalator into a deep subway station. Knowing that he was running out of time, he told Ms. Jewett, ''we're running out of steps.'' They were kissing when they reached the bottom.

HEADLINE: The Capital of Capital No More?

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the Moneybox column for Slate and the Contrary Indicator for Newsweek, where he is a senior editor.

 BODY:
Every day in Lower Manhattan, tourists stroll along the Capitalism Trail. They might start in the yard of Trinity Church, where Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary and architect of the early United States financial system, is buried. Nearby, on Broad Street, they amble past the hulking headquarters of the New York Stock Exchange. They might stop for a water break in front of 23 Wall, the fortresslike building at the junction of Broad that was the headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company and was known in its heyday as the Corner. As John Brooks wrote in his book ''Once in Golconda,'' the Corner was in the early 20th century ''the precise center, geographical as well as metaphorical, of financial America and even of the financial world.'' 
 The Corner is now a luxury condominium called Downtown by Philippe Starck. The most common financial transactions there probably involve paying the Chinese delivery guy or tallying bills from the luxury retailers -- Thomas Pink, Hermes and Tiffany -- that have opened outposts down the block. Wall Street has not been Wall Street for a long time. Big investment banks like Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns decamped for Midtown years ago, and the largest securities trading floor in the world -- belonging to the Swiss bank UBS -- is in Stamford, Conn. The N.Y.S.E., which is transforming into an electronic exchange, will close two of its remaining four trading rooms next month. The question today -- one being asked with increasing frequency and anxiety in certain quarters -- is whether New York as a whole is going the way of Wall Street. Are New York's days as the world's epicenter of finance coming to an end?
 If you've paid even glancing attention to the antics of hedge funds and private-equity barons over these last few years, the question might seem absurd. Walk by the rows of Town Cars idling on Park Avenue, past the Seventh Regiment Armory, where the Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman held his multimillion-dollar birthday party, past the hedge-fund aeries on Central Park West and Fifth Avenue, and New York City still seems to be the global capital of capital. This summer's credit crunch notwithstanding, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at near-record highs, and the Hudson's banks are overflowing with cash.
 But in today's burgeoning and increasingly integrated global financial markets -- a vast, neural spaghetti of wires, Web sites and trading platforms -- the N.Y.S.E. is clearly no longer the epicenter. Nor is New York. The largest mutual-fund complexes are in Valley Forge, Pa., Los Angeles and Boston, while trading and money management are spreading globally. Since the end of the cold war, vast pools of capital have been forming overseas, in the Swiss bank accounts of Russian oligarchs, in the Shanghai vaults of Chinese manufacturing magnates and in the coffers of funds controlled by governments in Singapore, Russia, Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia that may amount to some $2.5 trillion, according to Stephen Jen, a Morgan Stanley economist.
 Much of this money is being put to work at home. ''Now countries like China are generating enormous amounts of capital,'' says Felix G. Rohatyn, the veteran banker who engineered the financial rescue of New York in the 1970s. ''And of course they are going to want a piece of this distribution and the marketing.'' China is staging the initial public offerings of state-owned companies on local exchanges as a means of building up Chinese capital markets -- the $7.7 billion I.P.O. of China Construction Bank in Shanghai last month is just one example. 
 This growth represents a triumph of everything Wall Street stands for -- the ability of capital to seek returns across borders, the growing integration of the world's economy and the triumph of market activity in previously closed areas. And to a degree, this is good news for New York's asset managers, as private-equity firms and hedge funds now can raise capital from fresh sources. Nonetheless, the diffusion of wealth has unleashed angst among New York's financial elite, who may soon rue the excesses of recent years as a last-gasp blowout. 
 Last November, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a collection of chief executives, economists and policy makers intent on halting the apparent decline of America's (and hence New York's) competitive standing in finance, presented a report full of ominous warnings: ''Evidence presented here suggests that the United States is losing its leading competitive position as compared to stock markets and financial centers abroad.'' In January, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Senator Charles Schumer of New York released a report from McKinsey & Company that diagnosed the malady in detail. ''Today, in addition to London,'' the report's authors intoned, ''we're increasingly competing with cities like Dubai, Hong Kong and Tokyo.''
 Some of the trends highlighted in these reports are troubling for the United States financial-services industry and for New York, its spiritual and historical home. The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation noted that the U.S. share of global initial public offerings -- those outside the company's home country -- fell from 50 percent in 2000 to 5 percent in 2005. Until recently, the directors of China Construction Bank would have seen no alternative to a New York offering. Only New York had the experienced underwriters, the highly transparent, trustworthy markets and the deep pool of capital to handle such a deal. That's no longer the case. In 2001, New York's stock exchanges accounted for half of the world's stock-market capitalization. Today, the total is more like 37 percent. In 2005, 9 of the 10 largest I.P.O.'s took place outside the United States. The world's largest-ever I.P.O., the $19.1 billion offering of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was staged in Hong Kong in 2006. In the lucrative field of investment banking, sales and trading revenues, the McKinsey report concluded that ''European revenues are now nearly equal to those in the U.S.''
 These data points represent not so much a shifting from one power center to another but rather a change in how financial power is distributed. In this decade, the global economy has become multipolar. ''On the one hand, we have tremendous strengths,'' says Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup. ''We're located in the largest economy in the world. On the other hand, London is creating a regulatory environment that seems to me is equally as effective in terms of safety and soundness. Hong Kong and Singapore are clearly determined to develop as centers. The Chinese are investing in Shanghai.''
 Like automakers and consumer-products companies (Coca-Cola derives 70 percent of it sales outside North America), New York's leading financial institutions are trying to become global operators less reliant on domestic markets. In the last few years, the N.Y.S.E., the iconic symbol of Wall Street, has gone public, hired an aggressive, worldly C.E.O. (the former Goldman Sachs president John Thain) and merged with Euronext, which owns a derivatives market in London and stock exchanges in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. In its most recent quarter, NYSE Euronext derived 44 percent of its revenue and 62 percent of its operating income from outside the United States. Nasdaq, the second-largest New York exchange, was thwarted in its bid to buy the London Stock Exchange, but is taking a stake in OMX, which operates stock exchanges in Nordic countries in partnership with a Dubai investment firm.
 The big investment banks closely identified with New York are increasingly international, too. Goldman Sachs recently boasted that half of its revenues came from overseas. Overseas growth is good for shareholders and managing directors, who share in the profits. But an alliance with a Chinese investment bank doesn't necessarily translate into jobs for the messengers and support staff at Goldman Sachs in New York. 
 What does all this diffusion mean for New York's economy? Potentially, a great deal. Steve Malanga, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, estimates that there are 175,000 securities-industry jobs in New York, which pay an average wage of $350,000. The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation notes that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of the wages. But the impact is even larger, since the spending of Wall Street hotshots supports a huge number of other jobs. Between 1995 and 2005, the sector grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 percent in New York and provided more than a third of business income-tax revenues, according to McKinsey. ''There's no doubt that much of the financial and fiscal and economic revival of the city in the 1990s and then again after 9/11 can be attributed to the health and in fact dominance of Wall Street internationally,'' Malanga says. A long-term decline, in which the financial-services business slowly moves offshore or out of state over a period of years, would certainly inflict great damage. Without a manufacturing base, New York would become more dependent on its other large sectors like tourism, health care, government and education, none of which possess Wall Street's capacity for spinning enormous profits.
 It seems inevitable that we will see many more studies about the loss of New York's status. Unless they can persuade Congress to stop globalization and the free flow of capital around the globe, there isn't much New York's billionaire financiers can do to stop the city's relative decline. 
 Because of the high costs of living and doing business in New York, the city is likely to continue to lose market share. Take the case of BATS, an alternative trading platform based in Kansas City, Mo., that has come out of nowhere to gain a 9 percent share in the market for trading United States stocks. ''Our location is one of the principal factors that enabled us to go from start-up to the third-largest equities exchange in the U.S. in a matter of 18 months,'' says Joe Ratterman, its president and chief executive officer. The company's computers reside in a New Jersey data center, and it has two sales representatives in New York. But the rest of its 33 employees work out of a 10,000-square-foot office complex with views of downtown Kansas City. In a business in which competition is based on cost -- BATS appeals to investors looking to save a few pennies on trades -- a start-up in low-cost Kansas City has the same advantage over the N.Y.S.E. that a Chinese manufacturer does over a competitor in Ohio. 
 New York has stood at such inflection points before and survived. ''Between 1860 and 1920, the economy changed several times, from agricultural to industrial, and from industrial to financial,'' says Thomas Kessner, author of ''Capital City: New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Economic Dominance, 1860-1900.'' ''And each time, New York City was able to take advantage of the position it had achieved in previous standing and leverage that into leadership in the new era.''
 New York came into its own as the nation's banking center by the end of the Civil War, serving as the connection between Old World capital and New World ambition. (Much of the money used to build the railroads and other industries came from Europe via New York.) As American industrial companies gained scale and scope, they flocked to New York and to the banker J. P. Morgan, who lashed corporations together into giant trusts. John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil moved to New York. Because of this activity, ''the entire second tier of support -- trust attorneys, accountants and bankers -- grew up here,'' Kessner says. ''By 1900, New York had outdistanced every place but London in terms of the volume of business.''
 Over the next decades, as Europe was wracked by two wars, the United States finally built a solid financial infrastructure through bodies like the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 1990s, the end of the cold war, the spread of capitalism, the expansion of free trade and the economic growth of China all seemed to play into New York's hands. New York was the financial seat of the world's unchallenged superpower and the engine of a technology-fueled economy that held up while convulsions shook Latin America, Russia and Asia. 
 New York City's concentration of finance professionals may help preserve its status in this new era of global capital. BlackBerrys, Federal Express and NetJets may allow anybody to carry on business from any place on the globe. But a startling number of people in the financial industry believe they need to be in and around New York. Hedge funds can indeed be run from anywhere. But they need cash, and they need prime brokers -- large banks that lend them money and clear their trades -- and they need traders and lawyers, accountants and private bankers, psychologists and decorators. Nowhere is the concentration of professionals who cater to the needs and desires of the very rich greater than in New York. ''There are still a lot of meetings, a lot of information needs to be exchanged in person, and that's what really keeps people together,'' says Charles Jones, a finance and economics professor at Columbia University Business School. Meanwhile, the dollar, while painfully weak against many foreign currencies, still functions as the international medium of exchange. ''I think as long as the dollar remains the reserve currency, New York will remain the financial capital of the world,'' Rohatyn, the veteran banker, says.
 One way New York might transition at this turning point is to become more of a diversified economy focused on the needs of the global wealthy. Over the years, the lower-margin, less-profitable part of financial services -- back offices, trading operations, mutual-fund management -- has left expensive Manhattan in search of lower costs. That has left the city with higher-margin services that cater to wealthy institutions, corporations and individuals, like investment banking, hedge funds, private-equity firms and private bankers. High-end money management and advice, in other words, could become one of many goods and services -- auction houses and hotels, personal trainers and personal shoppers, helicopter services and estate lawyers -- that will attract the world's wealthy to New York. So rather than high-end luxury services fueled largely by Wall Street wages and bonuses, New York will have high-end luxury services that themselves fuel the economy.
 It's no coincidence that the blocks surrounding 57th Street and Fifth Avenue contain not only the nation's most valuable retail space but also its most valuable commercial office space. This latter-day Corner is dominated by street-level ultraluxury retailers like Van Cleef & Arpels, Tiffany and Bergdorf Goodman and by ultraluxury financial-services firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Icahn Associates. And yet J.P. Morgan's old Corner still seems to exert a gravitational force. The people living, dining and shopping on the new Wall Street today don't necessarily work there. They're drawn there for its character, for the new posh condos and for the many opportunities it affords residents to spend money.
 For years, Wall Street firms have urged companies to liberate the value of their real estate. The transformation of J. P. Morgan's 23 Wall Street into Downtown by Philippe Starck brings the advice home to the financial district. This summer, a condo at the William Beaver House, a new tower on the corner of William and Beaver Streets, near the stock exchange, sold for the equivalent of $2,836 a square foot, the highest per-square-foot price yet paid for a residence in the financial district. The buyer, according to The New York Times, was ''a wealthy financier from Madrid.'' And so New York's luxury economy scores another gain. More business for the broker who arranged the sale and for the decorators and workmen who will transform the space into a home befitting a wealthy financier from Madrid. Another resident in a neighborhood formerly dominated by office workers. Another customer for Thomas Pink.
 As trading goes electronic and as its business becomes more global, it's not unthinkable that in 2017, NYSE Euronext, having become an entirely virtual exchange, might hire Frank Gehry to sheathe its hulking headquarters in titanium and sell the lofts to Russian steel magnates and Indian outsourcing barons for $5 million apiece.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Pension Fund Inquiry Reaches Bank of Ireland Unit

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 12 

 BODY:
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's office is investigating a well-connected American division of the Bank of Ireland as part of its inquiry into the New York State pension fund.
 The division, Guggenheim Advisors, which is based in New York and caters to wealthy investors, has a board of paid advisers that includes Fred D. Thompson, the Republican presidential candidate and former Tennessee senator, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President Bush. There is no indication that either one is a subject of the investigation. 
 The Bank of Ireland, which says it is cooperating with the attorney general's office, is also conducting an internal inquiry into the unit. 
 Two executives who run Guggenheim made large donations to the campaign of former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi last year. In early 2005, Guggenheim secured a $447 million investment from the fund. 
 In the same inquiry, a fund-raiser for Mr. Hevesi, Bill White, has been subpoenaed by the attorney general's office. Investigators are said to be trying to determine if Mr. White, who is the president of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in Manhattan, solicited campaign contributions from executives of Guggenheim.
 Calls to Guggenheim and the Bank of Ireland were referred to Brian Maddox, an outside spokesman for the bank in New York. ''Guggenheim Advisors is fully cooperating with the investigation of the attorney general's office,'' he said, adding that the bank was ''undertaking its own internal investigation and has informed all relevant regulatory authorities.'' 
 Efforts to reach Mr. Lindsey for comment were unsuccessful. Todd Harris, a spokesman for Mr. Thompson, had no comment on the investigation. Mr. Harris said that Mr. Thompson had not been to a board meeting since June. ''Fred Thompson is an inactive member of an advisory board where his role is to advise on issues related to national security,'' he said.
 Mr. White said, in an e-mail message, ''I am voluntarily cooperating with the ongoing matter being reviewed by Mr. Cuomo's office.'' He added, ''It would be inappropriate for me to add anything further at this time.''
 Bradley Simon, a lawyer for Mr. Hevesi, said that ''Alan certainly has known Bill White for a long time.'' Mr. Simon said that Mr. White raised money for Mr. Hevesi's campaigns, but that Mr. Hevesi had ''no personal knowledge of Bill White having anything to do with pension fund business.'' 
 For the past nine months, Mr. Cuomo's office and the office of P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, have been pursuing a broad investigation into relations between the pension fund and companies that managed its money. The state's $154 billion fund is one of the world's largest pools of investment capital, and investment firms can reap lucrative fees by managing even a small fraction of its assets.
 For decades, investment firms have showered contributions on comptrollers, a practice that troubles government watchdog groups but is legal, except when it can be proved that investment business was given with the understanding that political contributions would follow.
 Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, won re-election last November but resigned on Dec. 22 when he pleaded guilty to a felony count for using state workers to chauffeur his ailing wife. Now, investigators are scrutinizing a widening circle of his friends and aides. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently began its own informal inquiry into oversight of the pension fund.
 The two top executives of Guggenheim, Patrick T. Hughes and Loren M. Katzovitz, each made a $25,000 contribution to Mr. Hevesi last October, according to records maintained by the Board of Elections. There are no other donations close to that size on record from either executive to a state political candidate, though both men have made significant contributions to several Republican candidates for federal office. 
 Guggenheim manages what is known as a ''fund of funds'' for the state pension fund -- acting in effect as an intermediary by investing the $447 million in a variety of hedge funds. 
 Guggenheim has earned $3.2 million in fees since it began managing money for the pension fund in February 2005, according to the comptroller's office. 
 The Bank of Ireland purchased a majority stake in Guggenheim in February 2006, after the firm won the business from the pension fund but before the political contributions were made. 
 Little had surfaced previously about the relationship between Mr. Hevesi and Mr. White. Mr. White, however, has long been an associate of the Fisher family, who started the Intrepid museum and have financed it over the years. The family and its Fisher Brothers development company were major donors to Mr. Hevesi, who for decades held city and state offices. 
 Hank Morris, Mr. Hevesi's former political director, has been linked to six businesses known as placement agents that reaped millions of dollars in fees by arranging deals between the pension fund and investment firms. 
 Mr. Soares's investigators have sought to determine whether Jack Chartier, who was Mr. Hevesi's chief of staff, used his official position to obtain a loan for a friend, the actress Peggy Lipton, from an investment firm that manages pension fund assets.
 Also, a brokerage firm run by Mr. Hevesi's elder son, Daniel, has been subpoenaed in Mr. Cuomo's inquiry. The firm, Praetorian Securities, acts as a placement agent, but Daniel Hevesi's lawyer has said that it did no business with the state pension fund and that her client did nothing improper. 
 Alan Hevesi raised money prodigiously from investment firms, and several prominent firms made donations to his younger son, Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi of Queens. 
 Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for the current comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, declined to comment on the inquiries but said that steps had been taken to improve oversight of the pension fund. ''We have a new policy that Comptroller DiNapoli implemented that will increase disclosure and prevent the conflicts of interest,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Discounters Are In For the Long Hauls

BYLINE: By DAVID KAUFMAN

 BODY:
UNTIL the start of Oasis Hong Kong airlines last year, Mark Exton was spending far longer than he desired flying between London and Hong Kong. As technical director of an automotive recycling technology company in Britain, he regularly traveled between the cities to check on his Chinese suppliers just outside Hong Kong. With business-class seats on nonstops from British Airways and Cathay Pacific often priced up to $8,000 round trip, Mr. Exton typically flew cheaper alternatives that saved money but required layovers and plane switches.
 That changed when he discovered Oasis Hong Kong. Employing three 747s, Oasis flies nonstop daily between Hong Kong and Gatwick Airport in London, offering one-way coach and business-class seats beginning at $:109 and $:470, respectively (about $230 and $980 at $2.09 to the pound).
 ''They're half the price of B.A. or Cathay, but with nearly the same levels of comfort and services,'' said Mr. Exton, who has flown Oasis's business class about a dozen times since January. ''And because there's no transfer involved, you get on the plane, get some sleep and arrive ready for work.'' 
 With its discount fare structure and long-range flights, Oasis Hong Kong, which is seeking licenses for flights between Hong Kong and San Francisco, Chicago, Italy and Germany, is a pioneer in low-cost long-haul air travel. Rolled out as independent start-ups or as arms of established carriers, these airlines are promising direct links to far-flung locations at far lower prices than the traditional carriers offer.
 ''We saw that 20 percent of the Hong Kong-to-London market was traveling via hubs to save money,'' said Stephen Miller, chief executive of Oasis, which added Hong Kong-to-Vancouver flights in June. ''So we were confident there was a market for this type of new airline.''
 Mr. Miller is not the only airline executive and Oasis is not the only airline bullish on the low-cost long-haul sector. AirAsia, based in Malaysia, is developing a long-haul spinoff called AirAsia X, which will begin flights on Nov. 2 between its Kuala Lumpur hub and Gold Coast Airport in eastern Australia; it hopes to expand service to China, Europe, India, Japan, the Middle East and South Korea. In the Australia-Southeast Asia region, AirAsia X will join Jetstar, the three-year-old low-cost division of Qantas that flies between Australia and New Zealand, Asia and Hawaii.
 In the United States, the newcomer Virgin America, partly owned by the Virgin Group, began service between the West and East Coasts in August. And since June, Zoom Airlines, based in Ottawa, has offered discount flights between New York and Gatwick as well as between Canadian cities and several British cities and Paris.
 The new carriers are clearly taking cues from their short-haul counterparts. Tickets, for instance, may usually be bought per segment without a required length of stay. On Zoom one-way tickets begin at $199 between New York and London, while transcontinental flights on Virgin America begin at $129 each way. 
 And long-haul fleets typically have only a few airplane models: Airbus A320s and A330s and, soon, Boeing 787s at Jetstar; Boeing 767s and 757s at Zoom; A320s and A319s at Virgin America; and A330s at AirAsia X, which is also looking to lease an A340 for a London flight. This allows the long-haul discounters to streamline training and hold down operational costs.
 Low-cost long-haul operators also try to keep planes in the air longer than do full-fare carriers, ''up to 17 or 18 hours a day,'' envisions Azran Osman-Rani, the chief executive of AirAsia X, ''as opposed to 11 or 12 for other airlines.'' 
 And like short-haul airlines, many of the new carriers use secondary airports at major destinations -- Zoom and Oasis Hong Kong at Gatwick, for instance, and Jetstar and soon AirAsia X at Australian airports like Melbourne's Avalon. With lower landing fees, these airports reduce costs, creating savings (theoretically) passed on to the consumer. Far less congested, the secondary airports ''will also help us maintain more flexibility and far quicker turnaround time,'' Mr. Osman-Rani said. 
 SHORT-HAUL operators focus on discounting to lure and retain passengers, but long-haul requires additional comfort and service to keep passengers happy. Nearly all the new long-haul airlines offer a discounted economy class as well as a higher-priced business class that is still cheaper than their full-service competitors'.
 ''Our research shows that nearly 30 percent of travelers are quality-focused,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Forrester Research. ''They're willing to pay affordably higher prices for better products.''
 Jetstar's StarClass is typical of the new discounted premium-class cabins. StarClass had its debut with Jetstar's expansion into the international long-haul market in late 2005 and is now available on all long-haul Jetstar flights. It distinguishes itself both in-flight -- with clubby leather seating, 38-inch seat pitch, laptop power points, video-on-demand consoles -- and on the ground -- with priority check-in, lounge access and increased baggage allowance. StarClass is a far cry from Qantas's first and business classes, but at just one-third more than economy fares, it ensures Jetstar's appeal to deeper-pocketed travelers.
 Oasis Hong Kong's business class and Zoom's premium economy class also include separate check-ins and bigger seating. Oasis also has higher-end cuisine and enhanced in-flight entertainment systems, and Zoom offers priority baggage handling, an extra baggage allowance and bar service. AirAsia X, meanwhile, will offer larger seats, with up to 55 inches of pitch, in its premium class; there will be no lounges, and meals will cost extra, just as in economy class and on the short-haul parent AirAsia. A far roomier seat is also the hallmark of Virgin America's first class, which includes 55 inches of pitch and built-in massage functions. 
 While Virgin America has eight first-class seats per plane, its chief discount rival, JetBlue, offers only a single class. Fred Reid, Virgin America's chief executive, said the separate class ''helps us attract both the high-end leisure and business markets.''
 Still, Mr. Harteveldt said, Virgin America and the other new carriers will consistently have to provide a ''better than expected'' experience. ''Consumers will try anything once,'' he said. ''But the airlines must really do their homework to get people onboard a second time.''

 BODY:
Doesn't the Governor Want Tourists to Visit?
To the Editor:
 ''Neglecting Tourism'' (editorial, Sept. 30) rightly points out that tourism has survived in Connecticut despite a lack of leadership from Gov. M. Jodi Rell. 
 A bipartisan group of legislators created the Commission on Culture and Tourism in 2003, and it was making great strides in setting the bar for cultural tourism. 
 In its first three years, the commission worked with the state's five tourism districts and its many attractions and venues to expand the vacation guide. It added a biannual culture guide, instituted an annual statewide open house, employed innovative guerrilla marketing tactics, redesigned the state's tourism Web site and organized an annual conference. 
 It also awarded partnership grants, made major financial investments in collaborative tourism activities, and published a comprehensive culture and tourism economic analysis. And all of this despite dwindling budgets.
 Hundreds of individuals and businesses across Connecticut did the hard work of building the economic engine of tourism only to see the governor drain the gas from the tank by reducing financing and failing to appoint someone to head the agency.
 Why? Shortsightedness regarding an industry that is made up of restaurants, small retail businesses, lodgings, attractions and nonprofit groups? Fear that spending money on marketing would be viewed as soft? Or maybe because, after recent experience, it was clear that promotional campaigns would not again prominently feature the governor? 
 Whatever the reason, to not build on this success is truly a missed opportunity for the taxpayers of Connecticut. 
 Jennifer Aniskovich Branford

HEADLINE: Racial Disparity Found Among New Yorkers With High-Rate Mortgages

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; Ford Fessenden contributed reporting

 BODY:
Home buyers in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods in New York City were more likely to get their mortgages last year from a subprime lender than home buyers in white neighborhoods with similar income levels, according to a new analysis of home loan data by researchers at New York University.
 The analysis, by N.Y.U.'s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, illustrates stark racial differences between the New York City neighborhoods where subprime mortgages -- which can come with higher interest rates, fees and penalties -- were common and those where they were rare. The 10 neighborhoods with the highest rates of mortgages from subprime lenders had black and Hispanic majorities, and the 10 areas with the lowest rates were mainly non-Hispanic white.
 The analysis showed that even when median income levels were comparable, home buyers in minority neighborhoods were more likely to get a loan from a subprime lender. 
 In Jamaica, Queens, for example, where the majority is black and the median household income was $45,000 in 2005, 46 percent of the mortgages were issued by lenders who specialize in subprime loans, the second highest rate in the city. In Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, which had a median income of $50,000 and is mostly white, the rate was among the lowest in the city, with 3.6 percent of home loans coming from subprime lenders.
 The analysis provides only a limited picture of subprime borrowing in New York City. The data does not include details on borrowers' assets, down payments or debt loads, all key factors in mortgage lending. And comparing neighborhoods is inexact; the typical borrower in one may differ from a typical borrower in another.
 Jay Brinkmann, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said there was not enough information in the Furman Center analysis and other studies on the issue to draw conclusions about whether subprime lenders were discriminating against minority home buyers. One of the crucial missing pieces is the credit histories of individual borrowers, he said.
 But the Furman Center study, a summary of which is being released today, still raises questions about the role of race in lending practices. A separate analysis of mortgage data by The New York Times shows that even at higher income levels, black borrowers in New York City were far more likely than white borrowers with similar incomes and mortgage amounts to receive a subprime loan.
 ''It's almost as if subprime lenders put a circle around neighborhoods of color and say, 'This is where were going to do our thing,''' said Robert Stroup, a lawyer and the director of the economic justice program at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.
 The New York State Division of Human Rights is investigating whether subprime lenders have been engaging in discriminatory practices by singling out minority communities.
 The Furman Center analysis is based on 2006 data that lenders disclosed under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 
 The study focused on mortgages issued by lenders identified by federal housing officials as subprime specialists in 2005. The list is made up of 210 companies, including major mortgage lenders like HSBC Mortgage Services and CitiFinancial, the consumer finance unit of Citigroup. But some lenders not included in the list may issue subprime loans, and not every loan made by the specialized lenders is subprime.
 Even so, housing and civil rights advocates said the findings highlight lending patterns that have long troubled them.
 They say minority communities whose financing needs were starved decades ago because of redlining -- banks' refusal to offer loans or other services in minority areas -- are now singled out for high-cost, high-risk mortgages in a kind of reverse redlining. 
 Any loan that carried an interest rate more than 3 percentage points above the prevailing rate for long-term Treasury bonds was considered a subprime mortgage. In 2006, Treasury rates ranged from 4.5 to 5.3 percent. Prime mortgage interest rates averaged 6.1 to 6.8 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
 Subprime loans are typically made to borrowers with credit histories that the mortgage industry considers less than prime. They can carry higher interest rates than traditional loans or adjustable rates that can make the mortgage difficult to repay once the interest rate resets. They can also carry higher fees and prepayment penalties and thus are at a high risk for foreclosure.
 Kumiki Gibson, the commissioner of the State Division of Human Rights, acknowledged last week that her agency was investigating subprime lenders, but she said she could not discuss the details. ''There was enough data to compel us to look into this,'' Ms. Gibson said.
 She said a variety of lending practices and patterns could be considered unlawful discrimination, like a mortgage broker who works only in certain neighborhoods or who offers white borrowers better rates than similarly qualified black or Hispanic customers. Many mortgages are handled by brokers who work as a liaison between borrowers and lenders and earn a fee
 The N.A.A.C.P. filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles this year against 12 mortgage lenders. The lawsuit accuses the companies of steering black borrowers into subprime loans.
 An analysis by The Times of the 2006 data that lenders disclosed under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act shows that in New York City, the rate of subprime lending is far higher for minorities than for whites even at higher income levels. For example, 24 percent of non-Hispanic white borrowers earning $125,000 to $150,000 took out a subprime mortgage in 2006, compared with 52 percent of Hispanics and 63 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the same income range.
 For borrowers earning $150,000 to $250,000, the rate of subprime loans was 20 percent for whites, 50 percent for Hispanics and 62 percent for blacks. That analysis looked at all mortgages reported to the federal government, not just those issued by companies identified as subprime lenders.
 The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development also analyzed the federal mortgage data and found that last year, 58.5 percent of home loans to non-Hispanic black borrowers were high cost, compared to 15.9 percent for non-Hispanic whites. The percentage of loans to Hispanics that were high cost was 45.5. 
 Subprime lending, which has grown at a rapid pace in recent years, has made it possible for many New Yorkers with modest incomes and poor credit histories to buy homes. At the same time, those loans have brought some borrowers to the brink of financial ruin or cost them their homes.
 Some economists and analysts said examining subprime lending by geography and race could be misleading because of the many variables not represented in the data, including the lack of banking services in some minority communities and historical differences in wealth and income among racial and ethnic groups.
 ''There certainly is a disgraceful element here, but how big it is, we don't know,'' said Julia Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, who looked at a portion of the Furman Center analysis. ''Is it a few rogue lenders, or is it an extensive problem that requires a regulatory response? We don't know yet.''
 The Furman Center's findings appear to echo recent studies from a number of local and national housing and fair-lending organizations that found racial disparities in subprime lending, high-cost mortgages and foreclosures.
 A study by the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit research group based in North Carolina, examined 50,000 subprime loans nationwide and found that blacks and Hispanics were 30 percent more likely than whites to be charged higher interest rates, even among borrowers with similar credit ratings. A report released in March by the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project and other groups found that in New York, blacks were five times and Hispanics almost four times more likely to pay higher interest rates for home loans than whites.
 ''There's no question that if you live in a predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhood you're going to be paying more for your mortgage,'' said Sarah Ludwig, executive director of the nonprofit Advocacy Project, which is based in New York.
 The Furman Center analysis showed that subprime lending remained widespread in New York. Last year, 19.8 percent of home purchase loans in the city were from subprime lenders, a higher percentage than in San Francisco (8.4 percent), Boston (14.2 percent) and Chicago (15.9 percent). Los Angeles had a rate higher than New York's, at 25 percent.
 New York City's subprime lending rate decreased by 3 percentage points between 2005 and 2006, but the rate was far higher than it was in 2002, when only 7 percent of loans were subprime, according to the Furman Center.
 None of the predominantly white neighborhoods in the Furman Center analysis had a lending rate from subprime companies higher than the overall city rate of 19.8 percent, while numerous black and Hispanic areas did.
 In the Middle Village and Ridgewood sections of Queens, both of which have white majorities and had a median income of $47,820 in 2005, 16.7 percent of the loans were issued by subprime lenders. In the Sheepshead Bay and Gravesend areas of Brooklyn, which also are mostly white and had a median income of $40,000, 10.8 percent of the mortgages were from subprime companies. Majority black and Hispanic neighborhoods with median incomes of $40,000 to $50,000 had far higher rates, including East Flatbush, where 44 percent of the loans were from subprime companies, and Queens Village (34.6 percent).

HEADLINE: World Bank Neglects African Agriculture, Study Says

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The World Bank, financed by rich nations to reduce poverty in poor ones, has long neglected agriculture in impoverished sub-Saharan Africa, where most people depend on the farm economy for their livelihoods, according to a new internal evaluation.
 The evaluation was posted late last week on the bank's Web site at a delicate moment. 
 The bank president, Robert B. Zoellick, after 100 days in office, declared in a recent speech that a Green Revolution for Africa was among his top priorities. On Friday, as ministers from around the world gather for the bank's annual meeting in Washington, it will release its flagship World Development Report, this year devoted to agriculture.
 The evaluation of the bank's role in African agriculture was conducted by an internal unit that assesses all of its operations and answers to the bank's board and president, not its management. 
 In the 1980s and 1990s, when African governments faced severe fiscal crises, the bank pushed for the public sector -- often badly managed and inefficient -- to pull back from agriculture, incorrectly assuming that market forces would jump-start agricultural growth.
 ''In most reforming countries, the private sector did not step in to fill the vacuum when the public sector withdrew,'' the evaluation found.
 One result, it said, is that farmers face practical obstacles: exorbitant fertilizer prices and shortages of credit and improved seeds. In recent years, yields for cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa were less than half of South Asia's and one-third of Latin America's, the evaluation said.
 At a time of growing debate about how to combat hunger in Africa, the evaluation team recommended that the bank, the single largest donor for African agriculture, concentrate on helping farmers get the basics they need to grow and market more food: fertilizer, seeds, water, credit, roads.
 Two poverty analysts who often disagree -- Professors Jeffery D. Sachs of Columbia University and William Easterly of New York University -- read the evaluation and found it withering.
 Professor Sachs called the evaluation ''a blistering, devastating critique.'' Professor Easterly, a research economist at the bank for more than a decade, likened the evaluation to saying Coca-Cola is bad at making its signature soft drink. ''Here's your most important client, Africa, with its most important sector, agriculture, relevant to the most important goal -- people feeding their families -- and the bank has been caught with two decades of neglect,'' he said.
 The bank's management, in its written reply to the evaluation, differed with some of the analysis and had a more optimistic reading of the agricultural growth data, but said it was already carrying out the evaluation's main recommendation -- that the bank should invest more in agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa.
 The evaluation noted that the bank's lending for African agriculture, which fell to a low of $123 million in 2000 from $419 million in 1991, had increased to $295 million in 2005 and $685 million in 2006.
 Bank managers, in a written reply and an interview on Sunday, said the evaluation team had not given enough recognition to the new directions the bank had taken since African leaders committed in 2003 to increase spending on agriculture. 
 ''We agreed with the general thrust of the evaluation,'' Obiageli Ezekwesili, vice president for the Africa region at the bank, said in an interview. ''What we, of course, want to state is that every evaluation is backward looking.'' 
 Looking ahead, she said, the bank is now working with African countries ''that have increasingly begun to realize that agriculture has to have pride of place in public expenditures.''
 More must be done to overcome a dearth of seeds and fertilizers, she said. 
 While acknowledging the recently increased aid levels, Vinod Thomas, who leads the bank's Independent Evaluation Group, said in the evaluation that the bank's limited financing for agriculture had not been well used. The evaluation group reviewed lending trends for a portfolio of 262 projects over the past 15 years that had agriculture components.
 ''The lending support from the Bank has been 'sprinkled' across various agricultural activities such as research, extension, credit, seeds and policy reforms in rural space, but with little recognition of the potential synergy among them to effectively contribute to agricultural development,'' he wrote.
 The evaluation also found that the bank, which has a staff of about 10,000, had only 17 technical experts assigned to the department that deals with agriculture and rural development in sub-Saharan Africa last year.
 Bank policies in the 1980s and 1990s that pushed African governments to cut or eliminate fertilizer subsidies, decontrol prices and privatize may have improved fiscal discipline but did not accomplish much for food production, the evaluation said.
 It had been expected that higher prices for crops would give farmers an incentive to grow more, while competition among private traders reduced the costs of seeds and fertilizer. But those market forces often failed to work as hoped.
 ''The whole thing was based on the idea that if you take away the government for the poorest of the poor that somehow these markets will solve the problems,'' Professor Sachs said. ''But markets can't step in and won't step in when people have nothing. And if you take away help, you leave them to die.''
 Professor Easterly said the bank's managers had made elementary mistakes. ''It was a simplistic, Economics 101 lesson, that if you raise prices, farmers produce more, which makes sense if farmers have roads, access to credit, good access to fertilizer markets,'' he said. ''But most of the time, farmers were lacking those.''
 Some agricultural analysts hope the current reconsideration of African agriculture offers a new opportunity.
 Carl K. Eicher, a professor emeritus at Michigan State University and an authority on African agriculture, said rich country donors and African governments also shared some responsibility for the continent's farming problems.
 ''The bank is turning the ship around and it has been for the last couple of years,'' said Professor Eicher, who has served as a consultant to the bank. ''So let's give them a little credit.''

HEADLINE: Banks to Start Fund to Protect Credit Market

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Three of the nation's largest banks, working together at the behest of the Treasury Department, are expected to announce this morning that they are creating a large fund to serve as a buyer of bonds and other debt at a time when many investors are avoiding them.
 Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase will create a fund, called a conduit, that will be able to buy around $75 billion to $100 billion in highly rated bonds and other debt from structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. Those vehicles own mortgage-backed bonds and other securities and have had trouble obtaining financing since early August, when the credit markets froze up. 
 The effort is intended to help SIVs that need to sell securities do so in an orderly manner. Bank and government officials are concerned that if these vehicles are forced to dump billions of dollars worth of debt in the coming weeks, it could cause a repeat of the crisis that rattled markets in August and sent the cost of mortgages and other loans soaring. 
 The joint effort is a result of more than a month of negotiations between bankers and government officials in Washington and New York. The talks picked up pace over the weekend, with bankers in New York and officials in Washington holding round-the-clock conference calls, according to people involved in the talks. Many details remain unresolved, but the banks plan to announce today a broad framework for how the fund will operate.
 The conduit is expected to start operating in 90 days and will stay in place for a few years until it has disposed of the assets it buys, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
 To maintain its credibility with investors from whom it would raising money, the conduit will not buy any bonds that are tied to mortgages made to people with spotty, or subprime, credit histories. Rather, it will buy debt with the highest ratings -- AAA and AA -- and debt that is backed by other mortgages, credit card receipts and other assets.
 Each of the banks will put up an unspecified amount of its own capital into the fund, and other banks from around the world are expected to join the consortium in the coming weeks. The conduit will raise most of its money by selling commercial paper, which is a form of short-term debt like Treasury bills but is issued by banks, corporations and investment vehicles.
 The conduit will pay market prices for the securities it buys. But it remains unclear how officials will determine the price of some bonds that have not been actively traded since August, because the difference between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers want has widened significantly.
 One analyst, Christian Stracke of the research firm CreditSights, said the effort appears to be an attempt to soothe tense investors in the debt market, rather than to provide substantive relief to the worst-hit mortgage securities. He noted that many of the banks participating in the fund had already been working on their own to ease problems at SIVs.
 ''For me, this is more of a P.R. blitz,'' he said. The banks are ''saying, it's not just that we are doing this on an ad hoc, individual basis. Rather, we have a plan and consortium in cooperation with Treasury, which gives it a veneer of respectability.''
 Mr. Stracke said that by serving as another buyer of the highest-rated securities, the banks are hoping to ease the immediate strain on SIVs, which could be forced to sell billions of dollars worth of assets in a fire sale if they are not able to raise new financing and when their capital falls below certain thresholds. The effort, however, will not resolve the longer-term problem many SIVs face with more risky mortgage bonds, he said.
 SIVs issue short-term debt that use the money to invest in longer-term securities with higher yields. There is about $300 billion in such vehicles, which are often organized by banks but are not actually owned or held by them.
 The Treasury's role in bringing together the banks is similar to the 1998 Federal Reserve effort that brought together major Wall Street banks to prevent the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management from collapsing under the weight of its aggressive financial positions. It is also an indication that Washington officials feel that the crisis in the credit market merits some intervention.
 Beginning in early August, investors' faith in complex securities was shaken by the downgrade of mortgage bonds and signs that the problem in the housing market would last longer than many had expected.
 The amount of commercial paper backed by mortgages and other assets fell to less than $900 billion as of Wednesday, from $1.18 trillion on Aug. 8, according to data from the Federal Reserve. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, on commercial paper that matures in three months shot up to 6.20 percent in early September from about 5.30 percent, according to data from Bloomberg. In the last three weeks, it has fallen back to about 5.36 percent.
 The problems raised alarms immediately in Washington, because commercial paper is a critical financial pillar for the economy, helping to provide money for home loans, credit cards and airplane leases. At the Treasury, Robert Steel, deputy under secretary for domestic finance, and Anthony Ryan, assistant secretary for financial markets, called top executives from about 30 banks to a meeting in Washington after realizing that the banks were not talking to one another about the crisis, people familiar with the talks said.
 Mr. Steel proposed the new ''superconduit'' of securities and suggested that the banks pick a group of evaluators, which would represent potential buyers, to approve all securities before they are contributed to the pool.

HEADLINE: Time for 'No Teeth Left Behind'?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Boom Times for U.S. Dentists, but Not for Americans' Teeth'' (front page, Oct. 11):
 The crisis facing American dental care calls for a comprehensive program. I would suggest a No Dental Patient Left Behind plan to guarantee that America is 100 percent free of tooth decay by, say, the year 2014. 
 All American residents will be assigned to a public dental clinic, which will be financed primarily by local property taxes. That will ensure that the quality of dental care available in every jurisdiction will be roughly proportional to local real estate values. 
 Every patient's teeth will be thoroughly tested each year, while progressively more stringent standards for adequate yearly dental progress will be enforced. The percentage of patients with any decay will fall each year, because the tests will focus the attention of all involved on the rate of failure and any disparities among economic, racial and linguistic subgroups. 
 Any dentist who does not adequately reduce his or her patients' rate of dental failure will face escalating sanctions, even including replacement of clinic staff or restructuring, which can mean anything from state takeover to imposing private management on public dental clinics.
 Dentists' renewed commitment to eradicate tooth decay, the revealing light cast by systematic testing, and the superior management that will come with state takeovers will combine to make America decay-free by 2014, at which time we will look back on the benighted era of c. 2007 with disbelief.

 To the Editor:
 It always appears that when there is a failure in the health care system it is appropriate to blame the health care provider rather than the system itself. Society would prefer to have the provider make up the deficit than to deal with confronting the issues.
 Access to care for all is the paramount issue. But having second- or third-tier lesser trained proxies delivering this care is not the answer -- care that most of this readership would not accept for itself. 
 Raising Medicaid fees from embarrassingly low levels; having insurance plans that actually cover the cost of doing business instead of token payment; subsidizing dental school education, from which many students leave with hundred of thousands of dollars of debt; and instituting public health measures to prevent dental disease would be a very significant start.
 It's time for society to reorganize its priorities. Rather than building bridges to nowhere and supporting other pork projects, we need to put our money into our most vital resource: the health of the American people.

 To the Editor:
 I am a practicing dentist of 32 years. Yes, I understand the problems that many Americans have in obtaining dental care in this country. But I also understand that tooth decay is a diet-related disease and is by and large preventable. 
 Our population needs to be better educated about the foods that promote dental decay. Manufactured, novelty foods, found mainly in the middle aisles of our supermarkets, whose main ingredients are refined carbohydrates are the culprits. These include cereals, pretzels, cookies, crackers, chips and candies, to mention a few. 
 Perhaps these packages should be labeled with warnings about the tooth-decay potential of its contents. In this way, people can make more informed choices and take more responsibility for their own diseases. Only then can we hope to alleviate the burdens that our health care system faces.

 To the Editor:
 Your article describes significant, multi-system problems inherent in American dental care. These problems require both private and government solutions that assure adequate work force and financing of children's dental care.
 While significant, these problems are not insurmountable. Several solutions were included in the bipartisan State Children's Health Insurance Program, which passed Congress with strong majorities but was vetoed by the president. Dental provisions in this bill include timely oral health education, prevention, stabilized dental coverage, quality assurance, state accountability, improved access planning and coordination across public and private delivery systems. 
 If Congress overrides the president's veto in its planned vote on Oct. 18, S-chip will do more to improve the oral health of millions of America's children than any legislation passed since health coverage for children was first established in 1967. Burton Edelstein

 To the Editor:
 ''Boom Times for U.S. Dentists, but Not for Americans' Teeth'' really hit home. 
 I'm a young, healthy professional who has a steady income at a nonprofit organization. I have medical insurance, but for the first time in my life, I do not have dental coverage. 
 This week, I will go to the dentist and pay $300 out of pocket for an exam and cleaning. I hope that I won't have any cavities. I just don't think I could afford it. Jessica Mele

HEADLINE: Financing for TXU Deal Is a Test for Debt Markets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Last month, the debt markets passed their first test of the fall with better-than-expected results. Now comes the second challenge.
 Six banks will start selling today at least $11 billion in debt to finance the buyout of the Texas energy giant TXU to two private equity firms. Analysts, bankers and investors see the offering as the biggest test yet of the high-yield credit market, which nearly shut down this summer. 
 In what is expected to be a packed meeting this afternoon at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, banks led by Citigroup will offer $7 billion in loans and $4.5 billion to $5 billion in bonds, according to people briefed on the matter.
 Much is riding on a successful sale. Turmoil in subprime mortgages seeped into the market for high-yield loans and bonds, which are often used to finance leveraged buyouts. Investors who had clamored for that debt in the last two years stopped buying the loans and bonds. 
 Banks that had rushed in to earn lucrative fees by financing the leveraged buyouts were saddled with billions of dollars in unsold debt. Many were forced to make significant write-downs in the last two weeks, and they must still contend with more than $300 billion in deals yet to come.
 But signs of life have emerged in the credit market. Last month's sale of loans supporting the $26 billion buyout of a processor of credit card payments, the First Data Corporation, exceeded expectations: the seven banks on that deal sold $9.4 billion, as demand exceeded expectations. Banks, led by Citigroup and Credit Suisse, sold the loans at about 97 cents on the dollar, a lesser discount than they had anticipated.
 TXU, now called Energy Future Holdings, is a much bigger deal. Its sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group for $45 billion was the largest ever leveraged buyout in the United States. Along with it comes $37.5 billion in debt that the banks must move off their books. Still, the sale of the TXU debt is expected to proceed more smoothly than the one for First Data; the energy company is considered healthier.
 TXU's loans will pay an interest rate of 3.5 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate, a widely used benchmark. In a potentially promising development, the banks plan to offer that batch of loans at about 99 cents to 99.5 cents on the dollar, or at almost no discount.
 The bond portion is expected to include $2.4 billion in pay-in-kind toggles, a note whose interest can be repaid by issuing more debt, according to a report by KDP Investment Advisors. 
 Many see the First Data sale as a model for selling buyout-related debt in a market still trying to regain its footing. By selling only a part of the loans, rather than the whole $24 billion in loans and bonds, the banks allowed investors to more easily digest the offering. That is a template that TXU's banks appear to be following.
 But the credit markets' nascent recovery could still stall if banks rush their offerings to market all at once, according to Justin Monteith, a KDP market analyst. Banks for First Data are expected to introduce a $4 billion to $6 billion bond offering in the next week or so, for example.

HEADLINE: Today's Harvest of Shame

BYLINE: By DEAN KLECKNER. 
Dean Kleckner is a farmer and the chairman of Truth About Trade and Technology, a nonprofit group that advocates free trade and biotechnology in agriculture. He was the president of the American Farm Bureau from 1986 to 2000.

 BODY:
Rudd, Iowa
 AS Congress heads into final negotiations over the farm bill, let's hope our elected officials are paying attention to the headlines: Brazil has scored yet another huge victory at the World Trade Organization over America's cotton subsidies; Mexico is likely to file a complaint with the global body over how we subsidize rice farmers; Canada may do the same over corn payments. 
 This is a troubling pattern, and there's a good chance America will lose more and more cases unless Congress makes changes in the farm bill, which expired last month. Washington simply must stop subsidizing farmers the way it does or risk reversing course on a half-century of steadily expanding trade opportunities. 
 I know all about subsidies. For years, I took them myself for my corn and soybean farm. I didn't really enjoy it, but they were available and I rationalized my participation: Other industries received payments and tax breaks -- why shouldn't I? In addition, I spent 14 years as the head of the American Farm Bureau, the leading farmers' lobby and a prime player in the creation of the subsidy system. 
 In the 1990s, however, a trip to New Zealand made me realize that eliminating subsidies was not just a free-market fantasy, but rather a policy that could work in an advanced industrial nation. New Zealanders had stopped subsidizing their farmers, cold turkey, in 1984. The transition was controversial and not without its rough spots, yet it succeeded. On that visit and several later ones, I never met a farmer who wanted to go back to subsidies.
 Today, it's obvious that we need to transform our public support for farmers. Many of our current subsidies inhibit trade because of their link to commodity prices. By promising to cover losses, the government insulates farmers from market signals that normally would encourage sensible, long-term decisions about what to grow and where to grow it. There's something fundamentally perverse about a system that has farmers hoping for low prices at harvest time -- it's like praying for bad weather. But that's precisely what happens, because those low prices mean bigger checks from Washington.
 Moreover, these practices hurt poor farmers in the developing world who find themselves struggling to compete. It's one of the reasons that the World Trade Organization won't let these practices stand. 
 Now would be a particularly opportune time to change the system. Food commodity prices are high, so a transition away from subsidies will hurt farmers less. Today's farmers enjoy much better marketing tools, crop protection and technology than they did only a decade ago. 
 The alternative is to put off the inevitable and risk a series of trade wars. When the United States loses a W.T.O. case, our aggrieved trading partners gain the right to retaliate through punitive tariffs on many American-made products, not just agriculture. For example, after the trade body ruled against the so-called Byrd amendment of 2000, which mandated that duties charged by Washington on imports deemed to be unfairly priced would go directly to American producers rather than to the Treasury, Canada and the European Union slapped sanctions on of such imports as American paper, cigarettes and oysters. 
 Politicians are fond of sticking out their chests and declaring that America's farm policies will be written in Washington, not Geneva. That's a good applause line, but at the same time Congress has rightly determined that it makes sense to participate in a global organization that establishes trade rules. American farmers depend upon the export market. For every two acres of wheat we grow, one is shipped abroad. The last thing we need is for our customers to quit buying because their governments are imposing tariffs with the approval of the World Trade Organization. 
 Yet Congress is getting in the way. It appears reluctant to approve bilateral agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. With the Doha round of global trade talks having screeched to a halt, these accords are now the primary means for expanding export opportunities.
 As for the farm bill, the answer isn't necessarily to get out of the subsidy business entirely (although it's preferable). The W.T.O. permits certain types of subsidies. The European Union spends substantially more public money on farmers per acre than we do, but its methods of payment are more compatible with global rules because they're based on acreage and production history rather than on current crop production and prices. This makes them less disruptive to international markets.
 Congress can change the farm bill to meet global rules while serving our public interests of a secure food supply, rural economic development and a cleaner environment. If it doesn't, it will reap us nothing more than a long losing streak at the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: Coalition of the Reluctant

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
A senior Pentagon official has spent this month on a magical mystery tour of little-known European and Eurasian capitals trying to deliver a dribble of troops for Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The low-profile trip reads more like a geography test than a geostrategic foray. It has whisked Debra Cagan, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for coalition affairs, from Tirana to Skopje, and on to Chisinau and Astana, among other luminous world metropolises.
 In Chisinau -- you guessed it; that's the capital of Moldova -- Cagan asked for more sappers in Iraq. Moldova currently has 11 bomb-disposal experts there. Yes, 11. 
 In downtown Tirana, hub of a 20th-century exercise in Communist folly and now a place in need of American money, Cagan pressed the Albanians to go beyond their 120-strong contingent in Iraq. Albania is considering an additional 125 to 150 troops.
 As for Cagan's stops in the Macedonian capital of Skopje and Kazakhstan's Astana, it's unclear what transpired. Macedonia has 40 troops in Iraq; the Kazakhs have 27 military engineers. Other states visited included Ukraine, which may offer a little help in Iraq, and the Czech Republic, which has 100 troops in Iraq and got promises of military equipment.
 Cagan declined to comment and a Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Almarah Belk, said in an e-mail message: ''It is premature to discuss the nature of her trip or any potential outcomes of her discussions with the various countries.''
 It is not premature, however, to say the trip smacks of desperation. Keeping many flags flying in Iraq is critical to making talk of a ''coalition'' credible. The 168,000 U.S. troops already account for about 94 percent of the forces there. The largest other contributor, Britain, is to halve its presence to 2,500 next year.
 Against this fraying backdrop, the strange idea of Pentagon brass spending two weeks hop-scotching continents to cajole countries -- many economically hard-pressed -- into sending a platoon or two looks less outlandish. That's where we are seven years into the Bush administration: stretched to the limit.
 The United States is as isolated in Iraq as a great power can be. A first term spent riding roughshod over friends and vaunting ''coalitions of the willing'' over alliances has not been righted by a second term of diplomacy rehabilitation. Wounds linger.
 I don't know Cagan and she wouldn't talk to me, but the least that can be said is her reputation is more for Rumsfeldian bluntness than the discretion of his successor as defense secretary, Robert Gates. At a big NATO political-military conference in Brussels on Sept. 19-20, anxiety over her trip ran high.
 A Europe-based U.S. NATO official who attended e-mailed me to say American diplomats are looking ''for ways to limit the damage she is sure to leave.''
 The note portrayed her as ''John Bolton on steroids'' with a tendency to be brusque with allies.
 The Pentagon describes Cagan as a highly effective player in the securing of basing rights in Central Asia for the war on terror and a well-connected builder of international coalitions.
 A biography says she ''was critical in transforming NATO's military forces to make them more responsive, agile and expeditionary.'' Even critics say she gets results.
 But at a Sept. 11 meeting in Washington with six visiting British parliamentarians, Cagan caused alarm similar to that expressed in Brussels a week later. The M.P.'s were briefed on the difficulty of dialogue with Tehran and U.S. concern that a British troop withdrawal from southern Iraq could benefit Iran.
 At one point, according to a British press report, Cagan expressed hatred toward Iranians, prompting a formal call for her resignation from the National Iranian American Council, which represents about one million Iranian-Americans.
 The Pentagon denied the remark. Alasdair McDonnell, a Social Democratic and Labor M.P. who was present, told me: ''I won't confirm or deny she said that. She might nuke me in the middle of the night. She's not somebody I'd want to tangle with.''
 Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative who was also present, said ''Cagan is straightforward, and if you're politically disposed to be put out by her, you would be.'' He himself was not.
 Colonel Belk said Cagan's briefing emphasized ''the U.S. administration's position that a precipitous U.K. withdrawal from Iraq could lead to the forfeiture of some gains and would help Iran.''
 Whatever Cagan's exact words, this much seems clear: a U.S. administration casting around for soldiering scraps in Moldova and Macedonia should be careful about saber-rattling toward Iran.
 U.S. hands are full in Iraq. Gates knows that. Nicholas Burns, the State Department's point man on Iran, knows that. My reading of them is that predictions of war with Iran are overblown, however hawkish the likes of coalition-cobbling Cagan may be.

HEADLINE: A Shake-Up At Citigroup May Follow Earlier One

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
When Citigroup's chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, shook up the leadership and structure of the investment banking unit last week, the move signaled a willingness to take dramatic action. 
 But it also diverted attention from another trouble spot: the bank's domestic consumer businesses, which analysts say have limped along without a clear focus and are facing one of the most challenging environments in years. The question for many analysts and investors, who will be listening to today's conference call on Citigroup's third-quarter results, is whether changes are also needed in the consumer unit. 
 Citigroup will kick off a week of bank earnings reports. While no bank is expected to escape this summer's credit storm and slowdown in the housing market, Citigroup is expected to be particularly hard hit. 
 Earlier this month, it warned that it would write off $5.9 billion after it suffered heavy losses from fixed-income activities and moved to shore up depleted reserves. Profit is expected to fall to about $2.2 billion from $5.51 billion, a 60 percent decline. 
 The heavy blow has raised questions about Citigroup's diversified business model and risk management practices in its investment bank. The problems have also raised fresh doubts about Mr. Prince's ability to manage the sprawling enterprise, despite strong support from Citigroup's directors and biggest shareholder. With attention focused on investment banking, the domestic consumer unit, which make about a third of its profit, has largely gotten a pass.
 But inside and outside Citigroup, executives and analysts suggest that the bank needs broader strategic changes. Its credit card division has lost market share, analysts said, and revenues are stagnating. The size and location of Citigroup's retail branches pale in comparison to its big rivals, analyst said, putting the bank at a disadvantage because it cannot use customer deposits to finance loans. 
 Though executives say that loan losses are contained, it is a large consumer finance and subprime lender. Indeed, about a third of this quarter's earnings hit -- nearly $2 billion -- is expected to come from setting aside more money to protect it from failing loans. 
 But the bigger issues may be those of strategy and leadership, analysts said. Citigroup's domestic consumer operations do not have a coherent identity. 
 Bank of America, for example, competes by pushing as many financial products as it can through its branches. The consumer strategy of JPMorgan Chase is to be a low-cost operator in national lending operations and put a branch on every street corner in rich markets like Chicago and New York. 
 Citigroup's strategy on the other hand ranges from leading innovation in mobile banking to building more branches and encouraging cross-business activities like integrating the brokerage firm Smith Barney into the retail network. 
 The most recent and articulation is that its credit card division is the internal A.T.M. for the bank's faster-growing units. 
 ''This business can be a good capital generator, helping the company to afford future stock buybacks, pay dividends and drive the expansion of acquisitions across the globe,'' said Eric W. Aboaf, the chief financial officer overseeing the North American consumer business in an interview yesterday. ''The goal of North America is to grow it at a healthy pace but also help our strategy to grow overseas.''
 Executives say there are signs of progress. After years of seeing little or no revenue growth, Citigroup's consumer operations reported increases of at least 6 percent in the first two quarters. 
 In aggregate, executives said its card business was doing nicely, even if the private-label portfolios it acquired from Sears and Home Depot face pressure from a deteriorating economy. They are optimistic about their branch-building efforts and the progress of the Smith Barney pilots in Boston and Philadelphia, which have broke even thanks to greater revenue growth. 
 ''It is a battleship, and it takes some time to turn,'' Mr. Aboaf said. Still, it faces significant challenges. The housing market is in the midst of a downturn; competitive pressure and interest-rate conditions are difficult. Its recent move to increase reserves by $2 billion, which executives say was based on signs of stress in economic and consumer payment data, suggests the situation will get worse.
 And then there are concerns about the fact that Citigroup has woefully underinvested in its computer systems for years. 
 ''At the least sexy of all levels, the company is just technologically behind the eight-ball of Bank of America and even J.P. Morgan,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, a banking analyst at CIBC World Markets. Citigroup in the second year of a five-year technology overhaul. Analysts believe that project will allow it catch up to, not surpass, its peers.
 That leaves Steven J. Freiberg, the head of Citigroup's North American consumer business, with essentially four options, none of which are considered particularly strong. First, the consumer business could divest certain core operations. Senior executives, for example, have floated the idea of selling its slow-growing credit card unit, said people close to the situation. 
 But Mr. Prince and Mr. Freiberg have always pushed back. Citigroup's growth plans depend on the cash that the unit throws off, and selling it might cause its business model, and expansion strategy, to unravel. 
 Second, Citigroup could acquire a major regional bank, which would allow it to significantly expand its retail franchise. But Mr. Prince has sought to refocus the bank to fast-growing markets overseas.
 Third, Citigroup could choose to push much harder on its growth strategy, pumping more into the retail operations. But that would involve a big multiyear investment at a time when Mr. Prince is under pressure to control expenses.
 That has left Mr. Freiberg to pursue the fourth strategy, which is to seek incremental gains where he can. Citigroup's strategy of building 100 branches a year will not pay off immediately but may down the road. Its online bank CitiDirect, is a helpful addition, analysts said, but is not a panacea to its deposit gathering problems. In addition, a recent restructuring may help improve sale productivity.
 In the end, analysts, said the changes that Citigroup made in its investment banking unit might have emboldened the bank to make some moves in the consumer businesses.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Sells New York as Town He Tamed

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Mark Santora contributed reporting from Estero, Fla.

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C., Oct. 13 

 BODY:
It was a depressed and devastated place: a city shoulder-to-shoulder with welfare recipients, free-spending city officials and greedy lawyers. New York was, in the telling of Rudolph W. Giuliani, a haven of high taxes and high crime, crumbling buildings and filthy streets. It was governed by liberals and dominated by Democratic voters who did not agree with the ideas of Mr. Giuliani but who nonetheless twice elected him mayor.
 This is Mr. Giuliani's New York -- his portrait of the city he inherited when he became mayor in 1994, presented to the nation as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. His portrayal offers an insight into the decidedly complicated relationship Mr. Giuliani has with the city that has made him such a formidable contender for his party's nomination.
 Mr. Giuliani is at once running against New York City and embracing it. It is his foil and fodder, a laugh line and an applause line. It is the city he has tamed and the place where he stared down -- as he tells appreciative Republicans to hearty applause -- liberals, criminals, welfare recipients, big-spending City Council members and the editorial writers of The New York Times. At times, talking about the city where he has lived most of his 63 years, Mr. Giuliani sounds like he was a stranger in his own land. 
 ''I got elected and re-elected honestly not because the people of New York City agreed with my ideas,'' he told an appreciative audience at the York County Republican dinner in Rock Hill, S.C., on Thursday. ''They didn't. They agreed with my results. You agree with my ideas.''
 ''Gosh, there are more Republicans on this side of the room than there are in all of New York City,'' Mr. Giuliani said brightly at a breakfast the next morning in Columbia, as he gestured to the right side of a dining room filled with builders and brokers. ''So I am really comfortable here.''
 Mr. Giuliani's description of how grim New York was when he rode into town -- and the amount of credit he claims for its revival -- would probably draw a skeptical reaction if he made it to many of his former constituents. For one thing, the economic turn-around that he touts was, to a considerable extent, the result of a surging national economy. And many New Yorkers found their city a vibrant and stimulating place to live before Mr. Giuliani took over. Beyond that, Mr. Giuliani, back when he was mayor, seemed more in tune with the views of his constituents than he now says he was: he supported gun control and gay rights, and promoted tolerant policies in the treatment of illegal immigrants.
 Still, across the field of candidates no one is as firmly identified and defined -- and by all appearances, helped -- by the place he calls home as Mr. Giuliani, and it only starts with his identification with the Sept. 11 attacks. One of his opponents, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, has done everything he can to cut his ties with his home state, while Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat who is ostensibly from New York, almost never mentions her home while she campaigns.
 Mr. Giuliani's New York is certainly not all bleak, particularly when he describes what it was like when he left office at the end of 2001. It is also, in his telling when he visits rural parts of the country like Iowa, a city not unlike small-town America. (He is referring to Staten Island.) In Florida, where Mr. Giuliani is looking for New York transplants to lift him to victory in the January primary, New York is the source of shared memories: Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, Zabar's delicatessen and the Yankees (well, maybe not this year). 
 ''You know, one of the nice things about being New York mayor is that Yogi is a friend of mine,'' he told a transplanted New Yorker in South Carolina, who stopped him for an autograph and to reminisce about the Yankees' championship years.
 But more than anything, Mr. Giuliani's New York is the laboratory that proved the failure of Democratic Party policies, just as his role as a Republican mayor in helping to revive the city is a vindication, he argues, of the very conservative policies that Republicans assert are at stake in this election -- personal responsibility, low taxes and the right balance of civil liberties and security. Again and again, he tells wide-eyed listeners of visiting London before he became mayor and being handed a brochure, that was being given to New York-bound Englanders by travel agents, that listed 10 tips to avoid being the victim of a crime.
 ''You know what the last tip was?'' he asked. '''Don't make eye contact.' Can you imagine going to a city and being told you shouldn't look at anyone?'' 
 He invokes the Time magazine cover headline in 1990 that most New York City residents would just as soon forget -- ''The Rotting of the Big Apple.'' And Mr. Giuliani recalls the days when, as he remembers them, a New Yorker couldn't walk up Third Avenue without being on the lookout for muggers, of the blocks of dirty book stores and prostitutes, of public urination and pot-smoking.
 ''We accepted pornography, prostitution as just commonplace,'' he said to a conservative audience in Washington last spring. ''We accepted street-level drug dealing as something we couldn't do anything about.''
 And this in South Carolina, as heads bobbed up and down across the room. ''There was a tremendous amount of crime. It was the crime capital of America. It was a devastated city in many ways. It was a depressed city.''
 He continued: ''You probably don't know that I took over a city that had 1.1 million people on welfare. That's bigger than the population of, like, almost any city in America. I had, like, a whole city on welfare.''
 It seems fair to say that New York City has become a bigger character in this campaign than some of Mr. Giuliani's actual opponents. Mr. Giuliani talked about New York City so much at one debate that a focus group of viewers assembled by MSNBC chastised him for it.
 And if Mr. Giuliani sees political gain in defining his candidacy around his mayoralty -- it took him 90 seconds to raise the subject in Columbia -- his rivals see in it opportunities to diminish him, arguing that New York is so fundamentally out of touch with the values of the rest of country that anyone elected there could not be a true conservative.
 In one example of this, Mr. Romney's campaign sent an e-mail message to reporters and bloggers attacking Mr. Giuliani that was headlined, ''Big City, Big Spender.'' It featured a montage of New York City, with Mr. Giuliani -- his head thrown back, his arms in the air -- superimposed over iconic photographs of New York.
 The accepted wisdom on Mr. Giuliani is that he is showing surprising strength in places like South Carolina because of Sept. 11. Still, he now talks more about what he did before Sept. 11 than what he did afterward. And it's clear that the image of him as a strong Republican mayor domesticating a Democratic city, true or not, is helping him greatly.
 Glenn McCall, the county chairman in Rock Hill, introduced Mr. Giuliani by reading a litany of the crime reduction statistics that Mr. Giuliani provides, and talked of the time when New York City was seen as ungovernable. ''Tourists didn't go there,'' Mr. McCall said. ''At the time, my wife, Linda, and I were dating, and she said, 'Can we go to New York?' And I said, 'No, are you crazy?'''
 The audience laughed. Mr. Giuliani laughed with them.

HEADLINE: Competing for Clients, And Paying by the Click

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK. 
Online: An archive of Adam Liptak's articles and columns: nytimes.com/adamliptak.

 BODY:
You can do cool things with Google, like take the pulse of the legal profession.
 Google is, of course, more than a search engine. It also sells advertising, including the shaded ''sponsored links'' that run next to the real search results. It auctions off those ads to advertisers, who agree to pay a given amount each time someone clicks on their link.
 ''Christmas recipes,'' for instance, was going for 54 cents per click the other day. ''Britney Spears'' cost 36 cents, and ''Britney Spears nude'' only 21 cents. 
 But ''Oakland personal injury lawyer'' cost $58.03. ''Asbestos attorney'' cost $51.68. And ''mesothelioma attorney Texas'' -- mesothelioma is a kind of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos -- cost $65.21. 
 A Web site called CyberWyre, at www.cwire.org, posts a regularly updated list of the most expensive search terms. ''The four leading industries are definitely law, medicine, finance and travel,'' said Sam Elhag, who writes for the site. On a recent visit, lawyers and lung cancer dominated the top 10.
 Ted Frank, the director of the Legal Center for the Public Interest at the American Enterprise Institute, said the fact that some personal injury lawyers were willing to pay $60 a click was telling, particularly given that relatively few of those clicks would bring in actual business.
 ''These lawyers don't really litigate cases -- they settle cases,'' Mr. Frank said. ''And they need a big inventory of cases. The only job of the attorney is to come up with the clients.''
 ''There is nothing wrong with what Google is doing,'' he added. ''There is nothing wrong with advertising for clients. It's just fascinating that clients are worth so much.''
 And there is no client more lucrative than one with mesothelioma. That word has hovered near the top of the CyberWyre list since 2003, Mr. Elhag said.
 William G. Childs, an assistant professor at Western New England College School of Law, explained why, as he put it, ''mesothelioma is clearly the highest-dollar value.'' 
 ''It doesn't happen except through asbestos, with vanishingly small exceptions,'' Professor Childs said. ''The vast majority of cases settle and settle rather easily. And they're not hard to work up.''
 The market for Google search terms says something, then, about the market for plaintiffs' lawyers. For reasons that baffle economists, personal injury lawyers all charge roughly the same amount for their services, typically a third to 40 percent of any recovery. 
 ''What explains this puzzle?'' asked Alex Tabarrok, who teaches economics at George Mason University. ''No one knows.'' It may be, he said, that offering to work for less might be thought to signal that you are a bad lawyer. 
 In any event, Mr. Frank said, the high prices on Google are a direct consequence of this economic anomaly.
 ''Instead of competing on price,'' he said of plaintiffs' lawyers, ''they compete on Google.''
 Google advertising has the benefit of being narrowly focused, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group. ''I assume relatively few people searching for 'mesothelioma' are doing it out of idle curiosity,'' Mr. Olson said.
 But some of them are looking for medical information, and they are often disappointed. ''If you are searching for information on mesothelioma,'' Mr. Olson said, ''you will have to dodge dozens and dozens of lawyer advertisements.''
 The top sponsored link that came up yesterday with a search for ''mesothelioma,'' for instance, was for a site that promised information ''about mesothelioma's causes, symptoms and types of treatment.'' It urged readers to contact a toll-free number for more information. In the fine print at the bottom, the site revealed that it was sponsored by a Texas law firm.
 For what it's worth, what little medical information appeared on the site seemed sound and disinterested. That is not always the case, Mr. Olson said. ''In areas like cerebral palsy,'' he said, lawyers' Web sites ''will steer you into highly tendentious information.''
 Personal injury lawyers are not the only ones who advertise on Google. ''Tax lawyer'' cost $34.32 the other day, ''bankruptcy lawyer'' $8.46 and ''patent lawyer'' $5.08. 
 ''Pro bono lawyer'' -- the kind who handles cases without a fee -- went for $2.89. (The top advertiser was a referral service for criminal defense lawyers. And no, they were not volunteering to handle cases pro bono.)
 Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School, said lawyers' enormous enthusiasm for Internet advertising meant the medium might have reached middle age. ''Lawyers are usually the slowest to adopt any form of new technology,'' she said. 
 Professor Childs, who has written about advertising by lawyers on Google on his TortsProf blog, lawprofessors.typepad.com
 /tortsprof, said he sometimes typed in Web site addresses rather than clicking on sponsored links when doing his research. 
 ''It feels a little weird to cost them 50 bucks to satisfy my curiosity,'' he said.
 That had not occurred to me. In working on this column, I looked at a bunch of lawyers' Web sites, at a cumulative cost to them of, oh, $1,000. Sorry.

HEADLINE: Hot Items On the Street: Recyclables

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
It was a case of good news, bad news for Luis Bosque as he parked in front of an Upper East Side apartment building earlier this month, looked over an assortment of trash that had been put out for recycling and loaded a steel bed frame inside his battered white van.
 The bad news was Lt. David Lois, a Department of Sanitation police officer who is part of an aggressive crackdown on what some officials have called recyclable rustling. Lieutenant Lois was observing Mr. Bosque from an unmarked patrol car. 
 But the good news for Mr. Bosque was that it happened just before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed into law a bill that greatly increased penalties for people who are caught using vehicles to steal metal, paper or other recyclable material that is left at a curb. Instead of the $100 ticket he received from Lieutenant Lois, Mr. Bosque could now be fined at least $2,000 and could have his van impounded. 
 ''While the theft of recyclables may seem like a harmless offense, this activity seriously damages the city's recycling program,'' Mr. Bloomberg said when he signed the law on Tuesday. With each theft, the city loses income from the sale of its own recyclables. 
 Todd Kuznitz, director of enforcement for the Sanitation Department, said the old law was not enough of a deterrent. ''Most of these guys will take a $100 summons, go around the corner and make another stop,'' he said.
 The problem, sanitation officials said, was reflected in a steep decline in the amount of recyclables that were picked up from some of the city's wealthiest and most densely populated blocks in a 12-month period that ended in July. 
 In parts of the Upper East Side, the officials said, the tonnage of bundled paper that was collected plunged 25 percent -- compared with 2 percent citywide -- and not because residents discarded less of it or became less responsible about separating recyclables from their other trash. Instead, a lucrative underground market has emerged. 
 Scrap metal, like the bed frame taken by Mr. Bosque, can be sold for up to $250 a ton, five times the price of a decade ago, according to a widely recognized index of commodity prices published by Waste News, a trade publication. Bundled paper or cardboard, the most commonly stolen of New York's recyclables, can bring in $90 to $120 a ton, more than double what the city receives under long-term contracts with its own brokers and processors. 
 That means someone can quickly fill a van in Manhattan, drive to Brooklyn, Queens or the Bronx, and sell the loot to one of several brokers. After that, most of the paper and metal ends up in China, Vietnam, India and other developing nations where demand for recyclables has soared.
 ''There has always been a fair amount of scavenging in the U.S., but the increase in demand from abroad has been dramatic,'' said Ted Siegler, an economist and consultant based in Vermont who has analyzed recycling around the world. 
 He said a piece of scrap metal taken from a Manhattan curb might end up in a steel mill furnace in Asia. 
 Mr. Siegler said the theft of recyclables had been increasing across the country, with thieves even plucking steel manhole covers from streets. But Manhattan is a special case. ''It has so much sitting on the curb in a congested area, and nobody has to go far to find a broker,'' he said.
 The city insists that it is going after only large operators who use vehicles and not the poor or homeless who are a familiar sight picking through people's garbage for cans, bottles and anything else of value. ''Technically, that is illegal, too,'' said Mr. Kuznitz, ''but morally, we don't go after those people.'' 
 But filling vans with paper and scrap metal can be back-breaking work and, apparently, not very lucrative either. Lieutenant Lois said many scavengers, like Mr. Bosque, speak little or no English, drive into Manhattan in run-down vans from out of state and are usually struggling to make ends meet.
 ''They've got to pick up tons to make any money at all, and people have to make a living,'' said a superintendent on East 92nd Street, who identified himself only as Harry, and said he had frequently seen men with vans picking up recyclables. ''I don't have a problem.'' 
 Mr. Kuznitz said the Sanitation Department was contacted in late 2006 by Upper East Side residents who complained about people making off with paper from their recycling and said they feared identity theft. Garbage truck drivers were told to keep track of the locations where pilfering was happening and how much was being taken. 
 For the city, the theft of recyclables means lost income. Under its contracts, the Department of Sanitation is paid $10 to $30 a ton for paper and about $190 a ton for metal. The thieves pose a particularly vexing problem, officials said, because they pick out the most sought-after trash -- clean, neatly bundled cardboard, or heavy pieces of metal -- thereby removing the creme de la creme from the city's mix.
 Mr. Kuznitz said the crackdown began this year, with 128 summonses issued since January, 63 of them during a blitz in July. He said that most of the summonses had been issued for stealing paper, mainly on the Upper East Side, and that the department's investigation had found that a paper processing firm in Brooklyn, Chambers Paper Fiber, which has a plant under the Manhattan Bridge, had helped coordinate the van pickups and had bought the paper.
 The city has not charged Chambers with any violations. But under the new law, brokers and processors who buy stolen recyclables can also be held liable, with fines of up to $5,000 for repeat offenders. A man who answered the phone last week at Chambers said no one was available to comment.
 Lieutenant Lois encountered Mr. Bosque about 5 p.m. on Oct. 4 in front of an apartment building on East 70th Street near Second Avenue. One of 74 sanitation police officers who are armed and authorized to make arrests, Lieutenant Lois was accompanied by another officer, Peter Melendez, in the front seat of an unmarked car. A reporter and a photographer were sitting in the back.
 Several blocks in the East 70s were selected because the city was to pick up recyclables the next morning.
 Mr. Bosque was spotted as he pulled over in his van, which bore Pennsylvania license plates. When he opened the back doors -- now only a few feet away and in full view of the officers -- it was obvious that the bed frame would not be his only cargo.
 The van was packed with metal -- a hot water tank, a stove and pipes. It was enough for Lieutenant Lois to act. 
 Speaking in Spanish, Mr. Bosque told Lieutenant Lois that he lived in Philadelphia and traveled to New York every week to work for a Queens metal fabricating shop. 
 When Lieutenant Lois asked him where the metal had come from, Mr. Bosque, appearing unfazed, said he received everything but the bed frame from the Queens shop. He had noticed the bed frame on East 70th Street and intended to use it in his home.
 ''From my experience, I'd guess he has been working the neighborhood,'' Lieutenant Lois said. He wrote a single ticket for a $100 fine, which Mr. Bosque accepted without protest.

HEADLINE: Gore Derangement Syndrome

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On the day after Al Gore shared the Nobel Peace Prize, The Wall Street Journal's editors couldn't even bring themselves to mention Mr. Gore's name. Instead, they devoted their editorial to a long list of people they thought deserved the prize more.
 And at National Review Online, Iain Murray suggested that the prize should have been shared with ''that well-known peace campaigner Osama bin Laden, who implicitly endorsed Gore's stance.'' You see, bin Laden once said something about climate change -- therefore, anyone who talks about climate change is a friend of the terrorists. 
 What is it about Mr. Gore that drives right-wingers insane?
 Partly it's a reaction to what happened in 2000, when the American people chose Mr. Gore but his opponent somehow ended up in the White House. Both the personality cult the right tried to build around President Bush and the often hysterical denigration of Mr. Gore were, I believe, largely motivated by the desire to expunge the stain of illegitimacy from the Bush administration. 
 And now that Mr. Bush has proved himself utterly the wrong man for the job -- to be, in fact, the best president Al Qaeda's recruiters could have hoped for -- the symptoms of Gore derangement syndrome have grown even more extreme. 
 The worst thing about Mr. Gore, from the conservative point of view, is that he keeps being right. In 1992, George H. W. Bush mocked him as the ''ozone man,'' but three years later the scientists who discovered the threat to the ozone layer won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2002 he warned that if we invaded Iraq, ''the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the United States than we presently face from Saddam.'' And so it has proved.
 But Gore hatred is more than personal. When National Review decided to name its anti-environmental blog Planet Gore, it was trying to discredit the message as well as the messenger. For the truth Mr. Gore has been telling about how human activities are changing the climate isn't just inconvenient. For conservatives, it's deeply threatening.
 Consider the policy implications of taking climate change seriously.
 ''We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals,'' said F.D.R. ''We know now that it is bad economics.'' These words apply perfectly to climate change. It's in the interest of most people (and especially their descendants) that somebody do something to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, but each individual would like that somebody to be somebody else. Leave it up to the free market, and in a few generations Florida will be underwater.
 The solution to such conflicts between self-interest and the common good is to provide individuals with an incentive to do the right thing. In this case, people have to be given a reason to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions, either by requiring that they pay a tax on emissions or by requiring that they buy emission permits, which has pretty much the same effects as an emissions tax. We know that such policies work: the U.S. ''cap and trade'' system of emission permits on sulfur dioxide has been highly successful at reducing acid rain.
 Climate change is, however, harder to deal with than acid rain, because the causes are global. The sulfuric acid in America's lakes mainly comes from coal burned in U.S. power plants, but the carbon dioxide in America's air comes from coal and oil burned around the planet -- and a ton of coal burned in China has the same effect on the future climate as a ton of coal burned here. So dealing with climate change not only requires new taxes or their equivalent; it also requires international negotiations in which the United States will have to give as well as get.
 Everything I've just said should be uncontroversial -- but imagine the reception a Republican candidate for president would receive if he acknowledged these truths at the next debate. Today, being a good Republican means believing that taxes should always be cut, never raised. It also means believing that we should bomb and bully foreigners, not negotiate with them. 
 So if science says that we have a big problem that can't be solved with tax cuts or bombs -- well, the science must be rejected, and the scientists must be slimed. For example, Investor's Business Daily recently declared that the prominence of James Hansen, the NASA researcher who first made climate change a national issue two decades ago, is actually due to the nefarious schemes of -- who else? -- George Soros.
 Which brings us to the biggest reason the right hates Mr. Gore: in his case the smear campaign has failed. He's taken everything they could throw at him, and emerged more respected, and more credible, than ever. And it drives them crazy.

HEADLINE: Oil Passes $86 a Barrel; Higher Energy Bills Seen

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices soared past $86 a barrel yesterday as tension in the Middle East and uncertainty about the direction of the American economy pushed prices to record levels.
 Crude oil for November delivery settled at $86.13 a barrel, up $2.44, or 2.9 percent, and the highest price since oil contracts began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1983. (In the late 1970s and early '80s, small quantities of oil traded on the then-new spot market for $40 a barrel, or about $100 in today's money.)
 Despite talk of an economic slump in the United States that could suppress oil demand, traders have been focusing on the same factors that drove up prices in recent years: global demand for energy that keeps defying expectations, tight oil supplies and little spare production capacity to cushion sudden shortages. 
 For consumers, the latest surge is likely to translate into higher energy bills. Last week, the Energy Department warned that heating costs would be 10 percent higher on average this winter than last year because of higher oil and natural gas prices. It also expected gasoline prices to jump next year. 
 Regular unleaded gasoline sells for an average of $2.76 a gallon nationwide, according to AAA, the automobile club. That is down from highs above $3 reached around Memorial Day but up from $2.23 this time last year.
 The latest surge in oil prices came after Turkey talked over the weekend of invading northern Iraq to chase rebel fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K. Yesterday, the government said it would seek the Turkish Parliament's authorization for a move. 
 The tensions on the Turkish border are a potential flash point in a volatile region that holds the bulk of the world's oil reserves. Iraq has the third-largest known reserves, after Saudi Arabia and Iran, though exports since 2003 have been reduced because of the war and insurgency. 
 The sustained rise in oil prices this year has surprised some energy analysts, who had expected a cooling toward the end of the year. Those expectations have been overturned by recent data showing lower-than-expected inventories in the United States, signaling resilient consumer demand and continuing problems in the domestic refining industry. 
 ''Oil is doing what it often does in periods of change or uncertainty: It runs until something stops it,'' an energy economist at UBS, Jan Stuart, said. ''This is not driven by fundamentals. This is momentum trading.''
 Despite the high prices, global oil consumption is rising, especially in China and the Middle East. Demand is expected to grow 2.4 percent next year, to 88 million barrels a day, according to the latest report from the International Energy Agency, which advises industrial nations.
 Iraq's Kurdish region, which had been relatively stable since the American invasion began, holds large oil reserves, especially in the area around the city of Kirkuk. But the pipeline linking those northern fields to Turkey has been crippled by hundreds of bombings.
 Iraq pumped about 2.2 million barrels of oil a day last month and exported about 1.7 million barrels a day, mostly from the southern terminal in Basra.
 In a recent report, Lehman Brothers energy analysts listed factors that might push down prices: milder-than-expected weather, unexpected growth in supplies from Nigeria or Iraq; or an American economic slowdown. 
 They concluded that despite the weakening American economy, the ''balance of risks still looks bullish,'' meaning prices may have further to rise.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Worries About Bad Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks pulled back sharply yesterday as news that major United States banks will set up a fund to help bail out the credit markets stirred concerns about bad debt. Oil prices also surged to $86 a barrel for the first time. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 100 points amid concerns about debt and rising energy costs as investors await third-quarter reports due this week from more than 80 components of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 The concerns about banking came after Citigroup, the biggest American bank, reported that third-quarter results fell 57 percent. The company said it lost more than $3 billion on mortgage-backed securities, leveraged debt write-downs and fixed-income trading.
 The Dow fell 108.28, or 0.77 percent, to 13,984.80. The S.& P. 500 fell 13.09, or 0.84 percent, to 1,548.71, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 25.63, or 0.91 percent, to 2,780.05.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 11.81, or 1.40 percent, to 829.36.
 Light crude settled up $2.44 at $86.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said that crude production by countries that are not OPEC members was probably falling despite rising demand.
 The week's economic calendar is light, putting more of the focus on quarterly results. Yesterday, the New York Empire State Index, a regional economic indicator published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, came in better than expected for October. The index rose to 28.75 from September's 14.70.
 Wall Street's unease yesterday followed a period of calm after worries about the credit markets disrupted markets worldwide over the summer. During August and into September, investors were concerned that mortgages made to borrowers with poor credit that had been bundled together and sold off as investments would resurface and cause widespread losses. 
 Indeed, some hedge funds and other investment vehicles worldwide that held subprime debt succumbed to the soured loans. It was not until the Fed stepped in with reductions in short-term interest rates, and the rates it charges to loan to banks, that the credit markets began to show signs of recovery.
 Citigroup fell $1.63, or 3.4 percent, to $46.24 after the bank raised its loan-loss provisions by $2.24 billion -- a higher amount than it estimated a week ago -- amid expectations of further deterioration in consumer credit. The bank also said it would delay repurchases of its shares.
 Medtronic fell $6.33, or 11 percent, to $50 after the company said it suspended sales of its Sprint Fidelis defibrillation leads because of a risk they could break.
 Biogen Idec jumped $13.08, or 19 percent, to $82.51, after the company said it might sell itself and that it had drawn interest from potential buyers.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about eight to three on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.29 billion shares compared with 1.06 billion shares traded Friday.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 100 18/32, and its yield remained the same, at 4.68 percent. Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Man's Vision to Carve Prime Real Estate From Hudson River Proves a Tough Sell

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Developers have long argued that you cannot go wrong buying waterfront land because no more is being created. But Charles J. Urstadt's dream is to extend Lower Manhattan a little bit farther into the Hudson River.
 Having overseen the creation of the landfill in the 1960s that became Battery Park City, Mr. Urstadt believes it can be done again. And he refuses to drop the idea, no matter how far-fetched others may find it.
 Mr. Urstadt, who was the first chairman of the Battery Park City Authority after it was created in 1968 and is now its vice chairman, has for years been advocating the potential benefits of adding 40 or 50 acres to Lower Manhattan. As a champion of filling in more of the river, he has stood nearly alone and attracted scant notice.
 But lately, some New Yorkers wary of even the slimmest possibility that this notion could take hold have started paying more attention. 
 ''I hadn't really taken it seriously,'' said Julie Nadel, chairwoman of the waterfront committee of Community Board 1. ''People say to me, 'That's a silly idea.' But I've seen sillier ideas than that happen. This could be one of those ideas.''
 So, Ms. Nadel, who also has a seat on the board of the Hudson River Park Trust, a state authority that is redeveloping the West Side waterfront, has scheduled a public discussion of Mr. Urstadt's proposal when her committee meets on Monday. Environmental advocates including Marcy Benstock, the executive director of the Clean Air Campaign, are expected to rebut the idea as a threat to local marine life.
 ''Building in the river is ruinous public policy,'' Ms. Benstock said in an interview on Friday. ''The stretch of the river just north of Battery Park City is a crucial habitat for sustaining fisheries up and down the whole East Coast.''
 Richard N. Gottfried, an assemblyman from Manhattan who sponsored the Hudson River Park Act, called Mr. Urstadt's idea ''outrageous.'' He said that law prohibited using landfill in the river between Battery Park City and 59th Street.
 ''This idea keeps rising from its coffin,'' Mr. Gottfried said.
 Such strident criticism does not seem to faze Mr. Urstadt. He says he has heard it all before, in the 1960s and 1970s, when he was the point man for Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's audacious plan to create Battery Park City by filling in almost 100 acres of the Hudson.
 Mr. Urstadt, who is now 78, is chairman of Urstadt Biddle Properties, a company based in Greenwich, Conn., that owns shopping centers throughout the Northeast. 
 He served as chairman of the state authority that was created to develop and run Battery Park City from late 1968 until 1978. Gov. George E. Pataki then reappointed him to the authority's board in 1998, a perch he has used as a platform for his campaign for more landfill.
 He recently pitched his idea in a meeting at City Hall with James Whelan, the chief of staff to the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel L. Doctoroff. Mr. Whelan suggested that Mr. Urstadt first seek the backing of the governor, Mr. Urstadt said.
 Mr. Urstadt admits that even Mr. Pataki dismissed the quest as futile because of the inevitable opposition from environmental groups. But Mr. Urstadt maintains that those arguments could be countered again, as they were during the planning of Battery Park City.
 ''What's their rational reason to oppose this?'' Mr. Urstadt said, referring to environmental advocates. ''To my knowledge, we didn't kill one fish in creating Battery Park City.''
 The original development is the cornerstone of the argument for expansion, Mr. Urstadt said. Battery Park City, he argued, has been a roaring success. Its high-rise apartment buildings house more than 9,000 residents, and it has more than nine million square feet of commercial space, including the headquarters of Merrill Lynch and American Express. 
 Critics of the authority point to its abandonment of a plan to set aside equal shares of its units for wealthy, middle-income and low-income tenants. Most of its residents now pay market rates. 
 Each year, the authority, which collects payments from building owners in lieu of property taxes, turns over more than $100 million to the city government. That amount could increase significantly if the space for more development were created, Mr. Urstadt said.
 ''It's economically desirable,'' he said. ''We can create that land for $75 a square foot. Depending on what you put on the land, it's worth $2,000 to $3,000 a square foot.''
 What Mr. Urstadt says should go on the 40 or 50 acres of landfill is a mix of residential buildings, commercial space and parks, similar to the makeup of Battery Park City. His idea involves filling in a swath of the river, about 1,000 feet wide and 2,000 feet long, with sand dredged from the bottom of Lower New York Bay. Until recently, he said the landfill should stretch north from the upper edge of Battery Park City. 
 A few weeks ago, however, when he was on his way to meet with Mr. Whelan at City Hall, Mr. Urstadt spotted a formidable obstacle. The Hudson River Park Trust had begun rebuilding Piers 25 and 26, which extend into the Hudson just north of Battery Park City.
 Mr. Urstadt said he immediately recognized that this development posed a problem for his plan, but not an insurmountable one. The simple solution, he said, would be to shift the site of the landfill several blocks to the north.
 So, on the fly, he decided the landfill would have to be between the rebuilt piers and Pier 40, near Houston Street. It would cross over the Holland Tunnel tubes, but Mr. Urstadt did not flinch because Battery Park City sits atop the tubes of the PATH train.
 This proposed landfill would not be contiguous with Battery Park City, making it a separate property rather than an extension. Mr. Urstadt, however, believes it still should fall under the jurisdiction of the Battery Park City Authority.
 Some supporters of Mr. Urstadt's proposal to expand Battery Park City were surprised to learn of this revised plan last week. James Gill, the chairman of the Battery Park City Authority, said he ''would be in favor of extending our boundary to the north'' by as much as 2,000 feet, but he said he did not know that Mr. Urstadt had laid out an alternate vision to Mr. Whelan.
 ''What Charlie is talking about is a totally different thing,'' Mr. Gill said. ''He's talking about another Battery Park City.''
 Indeed. Mr. Urstadt dubbed it Battery Park City North.
 Some people who know Mr. Urstadt described him as stubborn, but a longtime friend and colleague, Robert R. Douglass, said Mr. Urstadt was simply a determined optimist.
 Mr. Douglass, the chairman of the Downtown Alliance, a group supporting the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, helped Mr. Urstadt hatch the expansion idea and has endorsed it for several years. He said opposition was so automatic that he had never bothered to seek support from other directors of the Downtown Alliance.
 ''When it comes to any fill at all in the water, it's almost like a red light that stops any real discussion of it,'' Mr. Douglass said. 
 Except for Mr. Urstadt, who barrels on.
 ''It's just an idea he wants to keep alive,'' Mr. Douglass said. ''Hopefully, someday somebody will buy into it.''
 If so, Mr. Urstadt could start talking up another idea he has cooking: ''How about filling in the Harlem River?'' he mused. ''It doesn't do any good. The only thing it's used for is the Circle Line.''

HEADLINE: 3 Major Banks Offer Plan To Calm Debts in Housing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Gretchen Morgenson and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The biggest banks in the United States, with active encouragement from the Treasury Department, unveiled a plan yesterday to keep the housing-related debt crisis from worsening. 
 The plan calls for the banks to create a new financing vehicle to try to restore confidence and reduce the risk of a market meltdown by propping up an important part of the debt markets. But the banks hope to take minimal risk and avoid actually investing any of their own money.
 Although credit markets have calmed in recent weeks, and the stock market remains near record highs, some securities are almost impossible to sell anywhere near their previous prices. There is fear that allowing those securities to plunge in price could disrupt credit markets, alarm investors in everything from hedge funds to money market funds, and perhaps make it harder to borrow money, making a recession more likely. 
 If the banks' initiative works as planned, many investors that helped to finance risky loans -- including supposedly safe money market funds -- will be spared distress. And the banks will collect fees for little more than promising to make loans if no one else will. 
 ''The idea is to avoid a fire sale of assets,'' said one banker involved in the initiative, who asked not to be identified because negotiations on its terms are continuing. 
 The new entity, called a Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit, or M-LEC, could raise as much as $200 billion or more through the issuance of its own securities, and use the money to buy securities that otherwise might be dumped on the market. 
 The announcement by Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America came on the same day that Citigroup reported a sharp fall in third-quarter profits, with write-offs on troubled securities that were substantially larger than it had forecast just two weeks ago. Other financial institutions, including Merrill Lynch, have also had to take substantial write-offs.
 Though yesterday's move was meant to reassure the markets, investors reacted with doubt. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108 points, and financial stocks were among the worst hit. 
 ''I don't really see that this is going to make a significant difference,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''It seems a little more like a P.R. move, frankly.''
 Mr. Hatzius said he wondered ''why this is going on when previously the official word was that things were getting better.''
 The market upheaval that took hold in July arose from securities that were supposed to be safe -- and were certified as such by bond rating agencies -- even though they financed risky mortgages. Those securities would not default unless a large portion of the underlying loans went bad, and that was deemed unlikely. But in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis, questions have arisen about whether the rating agencies were too optimistic.
 The conduit could work brilliantly if it turns out that the collapse in the market value of the securities represents market panic rather than an accurate assessment of the likelihood of eventual default. If this is the case, then prices will eventually return to normal and this new creation will have bought time for that to happen.
 In the meantime, it is hoped that what amount to bank guarantees of some debt -- coupled with the fact the Federal Reserve is the lender of last resort for banks -- will persuade investors like money market funds to buy securities issued by the new conduit.
 If they will not buy, or if the securities really do not prove to be worth face value, however, little will have been changed.
 Details remained in flux yesterday, but some were not persuaded that the new structure would really do much. Josh Rosner, an expert in mortgage-backed securities at Graham Fisher, an independent research firm in New York, questioned why the banks needed to establish such a vehicle.
 ''If they really believe these are good assets being mispriced in the market,'' he said, the banks could just buy them and wait for the asset values to recover. ''This raises the question of whether the banks are doing this just to avoid taking their losses.''
 But some hailed the move as a way of preventing a crisis without directly involving the government, and said it reduced the so-called moral hazard that comes when the government bails out those who made risky bets, thus encouraging more foolish bets in the future. In this case, the Treasury encouraged the talks, but neither offered to put up money nor dictated the agreement.
 ''I don't see this as a bailout,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. ''There is no public money involved in this. The government's role here is facilitating discussion among private players to take care of this themselves. If the private players can find a way to help alleviate this, then why shouldn't they?''
 At issue is a borrowing crisis facing a group of institutions known as structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that were little known even to many on Wall Street until the credit crisis erupted this year. These vehicles essentially are private banks, albeit ones without the benefits of deposit insurance or the right to borrow from the Federal Reserve. They lend long term, and borrow short term. If they cannot borrow money, they are in trouble.
 The vehicles, often started by banks like Citigroup, were financed by issuing commercial paper, a form of short-term credit, for 90 percent or more of the value of their securities. The expectation was that the cushion of 10 percent or less would be enough so that the commercial paper could readily be sold at low interest rates, often to money market funds. Because commercial paper usually matures within months, not years, it is necessary to sell new commercial paper as the old paper is paid off.
 Now, however, it is practically impossible to sell such paper, and the SIVs are faced with the threat of having to sell many of their securities into a market with few buyers. ''It is in nobody's interest to see a disorderly sale of assets by the SIVs,'' said Nazareth Festekjian, a Citigroup managing director who was involved in planning the conduit.
 The proposal came about from discussions among the banks and the Treasury Department, in which one idea considered was for the banks to just purchase the commercial paper issued by the SIVs. But that was rejected by some bankers, a person involved in the talks said, and the conduit idea was developed.
 The new conduit will offer to buy many of the securities owned by SIVs, but at a cost to those vehicles. First they will have to pay a fee for the right to sell anything to the conduit, and part of that fee will be passed on to the banks, increasing their profits.
 Most of the proceeds will be paid to the conduits in cash, which they can use to redeem commercial paper. But a part of the payment, perhaps 5 percent of it, will instead be in junior securities issued by the conduit.
 Because those securities would bear the first losses suffered by the conduit, it is the SIVs, as a group, that will take the first risk that the securities turn out to be worth less than the conduit pays.
 ''The same folks who brought you the SIV in the first place are now repackaging them in yet another conduit,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ''I guess they figured there's strength in numbers.''
 The conduit would raise money by selling what it calls senior securities to investors who would be assured of payment unless losses grew so large that the junior securities were wiped out. The rest of the money would come from selling commercial paper, with the banks promising to buy that paper if no one else would.

HEADLINE: Resentment and Rations As Eritrea Nears a Crisis

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: ASMARA, Eritrea, Oct. 9 

 BODY:
The first thing you notice about Eritrea is that no one ever locks up a bike. 
 It is one of the poorest countries on the planet, situated in one of the world's most reliably violent regions, the Horn of Africa, yet Eritrea is virtually crime-free.
 Anytime, day or night, young couples stroll freely down the palm-lined avenues of Asmara, the capital. Old men in tweed jackets and vintage Ray-Bans park themselves at the 1930s chrome-trimmed Art Deco cafes and soak up the scene.
 But beneath the peace, harmony and South Beach style that once made Eritrea the little gem of Africa, cracks are beginning to show. There are bread lines, milk lines and lines for rationed cooking gas. At night, dissidents meet on dark streets to chat secretly in parked cars.
 Because of the rising prospects of war with Ethiopia, essentially Round 2 of a border conflict that has already killed 100,000 people, tens of thousands of Eritrean students have been conscripted into the army. 
 Relations with the West, especially the United States, have deteriorated to a historic low point, with the State Department threatening to designate Eritrea, a tiny country on the Red Sea that most Americans have never heard of, as a terrorist state for its support of Islamist rebels in Somalia. 
 As the country hits its most difficult point since winning its hard-fought independence 14 years ago, its people, once so famously united, are divided about what to do. 
 ''We just have to keep making sacrifices,'' said Letedngel Temelso, a mother of five and former guerrilla fighter who still has bits of shrapnel in her lungs. Sacrifice, she said, is part of the Eritrean national ethos.
 But a man named George, who walks Asmara's streets with a baseball cap pulled down low because he is part of an underground opposition cell, said that was ridiculous. 
 ''We've been stoic long enough,'' he said, adding that such criticism was not allowed and that if he gave his full name, he would be jailed. ''We didn't fight all these years for this.''
 Eritreans are proud of their history, even their colonial history. The Italians ruled the country for 51 years. After World War II, when Italy lost its few colonies, the world was not sure what to do with Eritrea. The superpowers stood by when Ethiopia swallowed it whole in 1962, which started a 30-year guerrilla war that Eritreans call ''the struggle.'' Their heterogeneous society rallied together, with Christians and Muslims, Tigrinya and Tigre (two of the bigger tribes) and men and women fighting together on the front lines.
 The Eritreans won the struggle in 1993 and Eritrea became an independent nation. At the time, the country was in ruins, with few natural resources. Its soil was pebbly and dry. But it possessed collective values forged in the trenches and stressing self-reliance that seemed so different from those of older African nations that were corrupt, debt-ridden and torn by ethnic rivalries.
 ''Eritrea showed enormous promise in the 1990s,'' said Dan Connell, a journalism professor at Simmons College in Boston who covered the war in the 1970s and has been writing about the country ever since. 
 ''But now you have a quiet population that is seething underneath,'' he added, saying the government's strict control of the economy and political culture were breeding resentment.
 There is only one legal political party, the Marxist-inspired People's Front for Democracy and Justice. The president, Isaias Afewerki, a former guerrilla leader with an intelligent, easygoing charm that belies a much steelier side, has been ruling since 1993. 
 When a group of prominent Eritreans spoke out in 2001, they were jailed and never heard from again.
 And the news media are dominated by the state-run Eri-TV, which sends its reporters around in little blue vans with ''Serving the Truth'' painted on the sides. 
 Eritrean officials are unapologetic. ''Whether there's democracy or not, whether there's freedom of expression or not, the ultimate judge will be the people of this country,'' Mr. Isaias said.
 He said his people supported him and understood that the problem with Ethiopia had ''affected every aspect of our lives,'' as he put it.
 ''Our political process overall has been held hostage because of this,'' he said.
 Eritrea, with a population of five million, and Ethiopia, population 77 million, went to war in 1998 over a seemingly insignificant border town called Badme. Thousands of soldiers were cut down in World War I-style trench warfare. 
 American diplomats helped broker a truce two years later but then backed off after Ethiopia ignored a United Nations-supported commission that said Badme belonged to Eritrea. The two sides have not made peace and recently accused each other of trying to start another war. Tens of thousands of troops are massed on each side, in case it breaks out.
 Trade links have been severed. Massawa, Eritrea's biggest port, used to be bustling with cargo headed to and from Ethiopia. Now it is a ghost town.
 Eritrea is having trouble getting enough wheat and milk for its people, and in the past few months long ration lines have formed. Shoppers sometimes wait for hours for a single loaf of bread. The country's few private industries are in trouble. In 1997, the Dahlak Share Company cranked out five million pairs of sandals, boots and snazzy leather dress shoes. Now, it produces one million.
 ''Most of our products used to go to Ethiopia,'' said Tamirat Tewelde, the factory's marketing manager.
 Its most famous product is the Shida sandal, a black plastic shoe that became the symbol of the struggle because in the 1980s the rebels built a mobile Shida factory underground that survived countless bombings. Today, that same machine stamps out Shidas in leaky metal molds. 
 The Shidas sell for less than $3. But they still have a mystique. Asmara's greatest war memorial is a pair of 20-foot-long sheet-metal Shidas.
 Nowhere is Eritrea's bunker mentality and underdog complex more evident than in Nakfa, a rocky little town north of Asmara. To get there, you pass hillsides terraced by 12-year-olds made to work during their summer vacations.
 Nakfa was the headquarters of the struggle, and it was up there, in the thin mountain air, that Eritrea's rebels were pounded relentlessly and nearly annihilated by the Ethiopians, who were armed first by the United States and then, after Ethiopia went Marxist, by the Soviet Union. Today, hundreds of miles of stone trenches snake along the ridgelines and disappear into the misty horizon.
 It is partly because of this against-all-odds legacy that Eritrea has turned into a magnet for rebels from across Africa, including Islamist leaders from Somalia, who have been waging a guerrilla war against Somalia's weak transitional government. 
 The Eritreans say they have given the Islamists political support only, but the United States and the United Nations accuse Eritrea of shipping them weapons. This is why the State Department is considering designating Eritrea a terrorist nation, which would put it in the same class as Iran, Cuba, Syria, Sudan and North Korea and mean severe sanctions.
 But many Eritreans are not worried. 
 ''We have our own country,'' said Hassan Mohammed Nur, a former fighter who gave 16 years of his life and his left leg to the struggle. ''After that, it doesn't really matter.''

HEADLINE: Three Share Nobel in Economics For Work on Social Mechanisms

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The Nobel in economic science was awarded to three American economists for creating and developing a sophisticated explanation of the interaction among individuals, markets and institutions. 
 Their work, called mechanism design theory, has influenced thinking on a wide range of problems in economics and political science, everything from the arrangement of government bond auctions to setting up patent systems and creating new voting procedures.
 Leonid Hurwicz, 90, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota, initiated the field of mechanism design theory, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in the citation yesterday for the award, which is not one of the original Nobel prizes and is known as the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. Professor Hurwicz's work was further developed by two 56-year-old economists who are sharing the prize: Roger B. Myerson, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Eric S. Maskin, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. 
 Professor Hurwicz, who was born in Moscow, started his work in the postwar years at a time when economists and others were heatedly debating whether socialist reforms were possible without a loss of economic efficiency. Those debates tended to be deeply ideological.
 Professor Hurwicz was a pioneer in applying a more rigorous, mathematical analysis to those issues. Last year, in a lecture to honor Professor Hurwicz, Professor Myerson said, ''Over many years and decades, Leo Hurwicz has worked to show how mathematical economic models can provide a general framework for analyzing different economic institutions, like those of capitalism and socialism, as mechanisms for coordinating the individuals of society.''
 The field of mechanism design theory strives to systematically take into account the realities of economic life. Adam Smith's ''invisible hand'' is a powerful metaphor that describes how the market, in theory, will always efficiently allocate scarce resources. 
 Yet real-world conditions tend to complicate things. Competition is not completely free, consumers are not perfectly informed, optimizing private production and consumption may have social costs, and institutions can strongly shape economic bargaining.
 ''It's not enough to say perfect competition doesn't work in many cases,'' Professor Hurwicz said in an interview yesterday. ''It should lead us to design economic institutions and mechanisms to bring better outcomes.''
 The work begun by Professor Hurwicz, and advanced by Professors Maskin and Myerson, gave economists and policy makers new intellectual tools for thinking about how to structure economic incentives and institutions to enhance social welfare. A public good like clean air, for example, is not accounted for in ordinary market transactions. Mechanism design theory provides a framework for determining whether government taxation is called for, and, if so, how to best design such as system.
 Mechanism design theory, economists say, borrows ideas from early game theorists like John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern and applied them to the creation of more desirable economic arrangements. ''They are talking about building economic institutions,'' said Alvin Roth, an economist at Harvard.
 The institutional focus, economists say, is an important contribution. ''Economists' most lasting influence comes from the design of institutions,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale. ''It is these mechanisms we use day to day that really matter to our lives.''
 Both Professors Myerson and Maskin were doctoral candidates at Harvard in the early 1970s, studying under Kenneth J. Arrow, who won the Nobel in economic science in 1972. In an interview yesterday, Professor Maskin recalled reading the work of Professor Hurwicz and being compelled by the potential breadth of the field.
 ''The subject really grabbed me because it was a wonderful combination of rigorous, careful analysis, but applied to important social issues,'' said Professor Maskin, who lives in the Princeton house once occupied by Albert Einstein. (Professor Maskin is the third Nobel laureate to have lived in the house; the second was Frank Wilczek, who won the prize in physics in 2004 and is now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) 
 Mechanism design, Professor Maskin explained, can be thought of as the ''reverse engineering part of economics.'' The starting point, he said, is an outcome that is being sought, like a cleaner environment, a more equitable distribution of income or more technical innovation. Then, he added, one works to design a system that aligns private incentives with public goals. 
 One recent subject of Professor Maskin's wide-ranging research has been on the value of software patents. He determined that software was a market where innovations tended to be sequential, in that they were built closely on the work of predecessors, and innovators could take many different paths to the same goal. In such markets, he said, patents might serve as a wall that inhibited innovation rather than stimulating progress.
 In Chicago, Professor Myerson said he was drawn to the field of mechanism design because it promised a deeper ''understanding of the logic of conflict and cooperation at the most fundamental level'' that could possibly help ''build better social structures.''
 The work that brought him a share of the Nobel was theoretical research on the optimal design of auctions. His work has served as intellectual starting point for others in setting up complex auctions like that used by the Federal Communications Commission for selling radio spectrum so that the government collects ample funds but also reserves some of the spectrum for public use and small businesses.
 In the last few years, Professor Myerson has expanded his vision, doing research, for example, on how to structure voting in Iraq to promote democracy. ''Democracy doesn't come by edict, but by institutions and mechanisms that ensure politicians must compete for the trust of voters,'' he said.
 It might seem a long way from economics, but Professor Myerson said such research was ''what a theorist like me can do. I'm trying to raise questions and encourage thinking about things in a more systematic way about how the playing field that we're acting on could be modified to improve the outcome.''
 The three economists will share the prize money, about $1.56 million in total.

HEADLINE: After Not-Guilty Pleas, Lawyers May Part Ways

BYLINE: By MICHAEL PARRISH

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES , Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The criminal case against the prominent class-action lawyer Melvyn I. Weiss and the firm that he founded, now known as Milberg Weiss, took several turns in federal courts on Monday. 
 Mr. Weiss, a co-defendant Paul T. Selzer, and lawyers representing a third defendant, Seymour M. Lazar, as well as the law firm, all pleaded not guilty at a brief arraignment before Federal District Judge Charles F. Eick. 
 But later that morning, in a status hearing before Federal District Judge John F. Walter, defense lawyers and federal prosecutors confirmed that Mr. Lazar had agreed to plead guilty -- to three charges, according to defense lawyers -- and would probably enter that plea on Thursday morning. 
 Assistant United States Attorney Douglas A. Axel also confirmed that Mr. Selzer and the prosecutors were in ''serious discussions,'' indicating the possibility of a plea agreement with him as well. If that occurred, Mr. Weiss and the law firm would be lone remaining defendants.
 A lawyer representing Mr. Weiss, Benjamin Brafman, and a lawyer for the law firm, William W. Taylor, also argued successfully for a delay in the trial, until Aug. 12, 2008, rather than Jan. 8. 
 The lawyers said they needed more time to prepare because their clients had been only recently charged in the case. 
 Mr. Brafman also said that he intended to ask that the trial be moved to Manhattan, in the interests of ''judicial economy.'' All federal witnesses, as well as the nearly 30 Milberg Weiss employees that he plans to call, are in New York, Mr. Brafman said. Mr. Selzer is the last California-based defendant. 
 Mr. Brafman told Judge Walter that while witnesses for a New York trial could be available in a matter of minutes, only a cab ride away, witnesses traveling to California would have to make a four-day trip for every appearance, considering travel time and unpredictable court procedures. 
 ''I've never been in a case that I have to bring so many witnesses so far,'' said Mr. Brafman, who expects the trial to last at least two months.
 Mr. Brafman also indicated that he might move to sever Mr. Weiss's case from that of the law firm. 
 Mr. Weiss, Milberg Weiss and the other defendants were charged with a scheme using plaintiffs that had been paid to help the law firm to file class-action suits ahead of competitors, which brought the partners higher legal fees after settlements. 
 Mr. Weiss was indicted on Sept. 20 by a federal grand jury that charged him with conspiracy, racketeering, obstruction of justice and making false declarations under oath. Prosecutors say that Mr. Weiss and his firm received $250 million in legal fees over 25 years in the kickback scheme. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Lazar, Thomas Bienert, said that he did not expect his client to serve time in prison. ''He's 80 and in ill health,'' Mr. Bienert said. 
 A week ago, Steven G. Schulman, of New York, who had been a partner at Milberg Weiss, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and agreed to help the prosecution. 
 Earlier, William S. Lerach and David J. Bershad pleaded guilty to federal charges in the case.

HEADLINE: For Cubans Fleeing to the U.S., The First Stop Is Often Mexico

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.

DATELINE: CORTES, Cuba 

 BODY:
Cubans are migrating to the United States in the greatest numbers in over a decade, and for most of them the new way to get north is first to head west -- to Mexico -- in a convoluted route that avoids the United States Coast Guard.
 American officials say the migration, which has grown into a multimillion-dollar-a-year smuggling enterprise, has risen sharply because many Cubans have lost hope that Raul Castro, who took over as president from his brother Fidel in 2006, will make changes that will improve their lives. Cuban authorities contend that the migration is more economic than political and is fueled by Washington's policy of rewarding Cubans who enter the United States illegally.
 In fact, unlike Mexicans, Central Americans and others heading to the southwestern border of the United States, the Cubans do not have to sneak across. They just walk right up to United States authorities at the border, benefiting from lax Mexican enforcement and relying on Washington's ''wet foot, dry foot'' policy, which gives them the ability to become permanent residents if they can reach United States soil.
 That is what Jose Luis Savater, 45, a refrigerator repairman from Havana, did in early October to reach southern Florida, which remains the goal for most migrating Cubans. 
 It took Mr. Savater almost four days to reach Isla Mujeres, Mexico, a coastal island, in a rickety boat made of wood, fiberglass and aluminum and powered by a jury-rigged motor used for irrigating fields. The 15 men and one woman with him took turns bailing.
 ''It's extremely dangerous,'' Mr. Savater said by telephone as he prepared to leave Cancun for the Mexican border. ''I saw myself dead. I suffered a lot.'' 
 But his next step was far easier: a flight to Matamoros, a border town just across from Brownsville, Tex., with the help of money wired from relatives in Florida. Some American officials are calling this new approach -- Cubans' strolling up to border stations and seeking political asylum -- dusty foot.
 Statistics make it clear that although the route is considerably longer, Cubans believe that traveling through Mexico from the tiny bayside village of Cortes and other new launching spots on the western side of Cuba increases their odds of reaching Miami. Almost twice as many -- 11,487 -- took it in fiscal 2007, which ended in September, as in fiscal 2005.
 By comparison, the Coast Guard intercepted just 2,861 Cubans crossing the Florida Straits in fiscal 2007, and 4,825 others eluded American authorities, reached United States soil and, under the ''wet foot, dry foot'' policy, applied for residency, according to the Coast Guard.
 The figures show that in fiscal 2007, migration from the island reached its highest level since 35,000 Cubans left in a mass exodus in 1994.
 ''The reason why people are willing to risk their lives to leave Cuba is the lack of hope and expectations,'' Sean Murphy, the United States consul general in Havana, told reporters in early October. 
 The new route is not just diverting migrants. Smugglers are shifting too, resulting in turf battles that are believed to be behind a string of killings over the summer of Cuban nationals in the Yucatan Peninsula, where many of the migrants come ashore. That area is also crisscrossed by narcotics traffickers, and there is fear that the two businesses could merge.
 The new route has attracted the attention of officials throughout the region, since Cubans sometimes go off track and land on other Caribbean islands or farther south in Central America.
 Manuel Aguilera de la Paz, Cuba's ambassador to Mexico, told reporters in early October that migration is at the top of the agenda as Mexico and Cuba seek to improve strained relations that prompted the two countries to briefly withdraw their ambassadors in 2004. 
 In Washington, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, has expressed concern about both the migration and the killings in the Yucatan, which have been concentrated near the resort town of Cancun. ''There is some kind of struggle going on among gangs,'' he said of the violence. He called the new route ''a recent phenomenon.'' 
 The Coast Guard's aggressive patrols in the Florida Straits prompted migrants to turn to the new route, most agree. Those patrols were increased after the 1994 exodus, which led the Clinton administration to adopt the ''wet foot, dry foot'' policy. The Coast Guard returns migrants who are caught at sea to Cuba, where authorities have said they will not face retribution. 
 ''It's practically Mission Impossible to go directly to Miami,'' said an American official who is tracking the issue but did not have approval to speak on the record about it.
 In Mexico, however, the coast is far more loosely patrolled and, some say, local authorities are more likely to look the other way for a bribe. 
 The rocky eastern shore of Isla Mujeres, a speck of an island near Cancun, is a popular landing spot. Despite the presence of a Mexican Navy post, Cuban boats land regularly. 
 ''We're looking for Colombian drug dealers, not Cubans,'' said a Mexican Navy enlisted man who was on night watch on a bluff that is the island's highest point. 
 Mexican officials said that when the navy does intercept vessels with smuggled migrants, mostly those in distress, they are escorted ashore. The smugglers are arrested and their boats seized. But migrants are in most cases fined and then released. They have 30 days to leave the country, plenty of time to find their way north. 
 The smuggling networks themselves have become more sophisticated. The smugglers operate out of Miami, with representatives on the coasts of Cuba and Mexico, experts say. They carry satellite telephones so the transfers of the migrants are done with military precision.
 Safe houses have been set up along the Mexican coast to help the Cubans elude Mexican authorities and avoid paying the fine. One Cuban who made it to Mexico said he was impressed by how well organized it all was. 
 Cuban rice and beans awaited him upon arrival in Mexico. Within days, he was off to the Texas border with instructions about what he should say to quickly enter the United States. Typically, the Cuban migrants are interviewed by agents who check their stories and whatever documentation they can produce, and listen closely for distinctive Cuban accents. Then, if no criminal records are found, the Cubans are generally allowed into the country. After a year, they gain permanent resident status.
 The kinds of craft being used are often a step up from the vessels previously used. The boats leaving Cuba used to be the most ramshackle imaginable: inner tubes strung together, or rusted-out vessels powered by car engines or oars or even, in at least one case, a weed trimmer. 
 While many, like Mr. Savater, the Havana repairman, still travel that way, for the right price Cubans nowadays can climb aboard sleek, modern boats with three 275-horsepower outboard motors hanging from the back.
 ''They look like they can fly,'' said a fisherman on Cuba's southwestern coast who has spotted the vessels and spoke of them with a jealous look in his eye.
 The boats swoop in to a prearranged spot on the Cuban coastline, quickly load and leave, with the price for the express service exceeding $10,000 in many cases. Some people -- mostly young men who know the coast well -- are allowed aboard without paying the full price, according to Cubans with knowledge of the business, but they have to promise to join the smuggling network and return to pick up more migrants. 
 Cuban authorities rarely stop the boats in time. They have set up military checkpoints along the coast and banned local residents from fishing along some stretches of beach to get a handle on the new escape routes. But the flow continues, mostly from remote beaches on the western half of the island.
 ''Mexico is that way,'' said a fisherman near Cortes, pulling his boat ashore in a popular smuggling spot and gesturing west. ''That's the new way out.'' 
 When Cuban authorities see a boat leaving, they use loudspeakers to warn of the dangers of the voyage and urge everyone to come back. But the boats rarely, if ever, do. If a boat seems headed for Florida, they radio the United States Coast Guard. If it seems on course to Mexico, they throw up their arms. 
 ''I'm on the lookout,'' said a young Cuban Coast Guard recruit outside Cortes, who was on what looked like a lifeguard tower jacked up 30 feet for a better view. Though he had high-powered binoculars, the stretch of coast he had to watch was vast. 
 Farther west, at another migrant-smuggling center, Cabo Frances, the army has set up a base at the beach and strung a tree branch across the only entry point with a small cardboard sign declaring it a military zone. Local residents have been told not to fish there until the problem is under control. 
 Like so much else in United States-Cuban relations, the migration is mired in bad blood. 
 Havana blames Washington for the exodus, saying that allowing Cubans who arrive illegally in the United States to stay permanently provides an incentive for people to risk their lives at sea. Cuban authorities grumble as well that Washington has issued only 15,000 of the 20,000 visas it promised under a recent migration accord to allow Cubans to enter legally. 
 The United States has a different view. American officials say government repression is the reason people are willing to risk their lives at sea. And they say that Cuban officials have not permitted the United States Interests Section in Havana to hire enough people to handle all the paperwork for the visas. 
 In Mexico, there is an acceptance of the arriving Cubans among coastal residents, with a tinge of resentment. ''It's sad that a Mexican can't enter the U.S. if they reach the border and a Cuban can,'' said Alba Rios, a resident of Isla Mujeres who has noticed significant numbers of Miami Cubans arriving on the island to aid with the migrant flow. 
 Some Mexicans are even getting ideas from the Cubans. A trade is developing in Cuban identity documents, and some savvy Mexican migrants are now practicing Cuban accents and rehearsing dramatic stories they intend to tell United States Border Patrol agents about the horrors they have suffered in Havana.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: The escape from Cuba to the United States increasingly includes a trip by boat to a place like Isla Mujeres, a coastal Mexican island whose harbor is at left and whose welcome map is at right. From there, migrants travel north to the border, where they are interviewed by American border agents, who check their stories and usually allow them in under a ''wet foot, dry foot'' policy.
 Some of the boats used by Cubans on their risky escape voyage lie in the harbor master's grounds on Isla Mujeres.(PHOTOGRAPHS BY ADRIANA ZEHRBRAUSKAS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)(pg. A12) MAP: Some migrants go to Isla Mujeres from Cortes, Cuba.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Office Manager Charged With Identity Theft and Grand Larceny

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK and BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The first report of a stolen identity and of the opening of a bogus charge account at Home Depot in the victim's name came from a Queens resident, according to the police. Within a week, five more people complained that they, too, had been victimized. 
 Investigators said they found a common link: all six had applied for loans at the same local mortgage office. Further investigation found still more victims, and fraud estimated to total more than $1 million, the police said. 
 Yesterday, they arrested the branch manager of the mortgage office, Jacob Milton, 41, and his sister, Nira Niru, 38, both of Port Washington in Nassau County. They were charged with identity theft, grand larceny and scheming to defraud.
 The suspects had no listed telephone numbers and could not be reached for comment.
 Mr. Milton is an immigrant from Bangladesh who was granted political asylum by the United States who had a cable television program in Queens for fellow immigrants from his homeland, the police said. 
 He worked for the Griffin Mortgage Company as manager of its branch at 72-32 Broadway, in Jackson Heights, and his sister was his secretary, the police said. The mortgage office was where the first six complainants had divulged personal financial information when they applied for loans, the police said. Many were seeking to become first-time homeowners. 
 But because the quoted interest rates were too high, the applicants withdrew and looked elsewhere. Some discovered their identities had been stolen when other mortgage companies ran credit checks, the police said. 
 Some victims also received bills from Home Depot for as much as $30,000 for merchandise they had not ordered or received, the police said.
 The number of victims is likely to rise to at least 12 by the time the investigation is finished, the police said.
 Mr. Milton engaged in a second type of fraud, according to the police, using other people's identities to take out mortgage loans.
 It was not clear whether he was using those loans in connection with his sideline business of buying, renovating and selling houses.
 Mr. Milton was arrested when he showed up for a court appearance in another case, in which he is being sued and also faces criminal charges, the police said. Details of that case were not immediately available.
 Officials searched the mortgage office and two residences that the police said Mr. Milton owned: one in Elmhurst, Queens, and one in Deer Park, in Suffolk County.

HEADLINE: Freed Iran Advocate Recalls His Jailing

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
After emerging from 140 days in the political section of Tehran's dreaded Evin Prison, Ali Shakeri had one main thing on his mind Monday -- not running afoul of another government by failing to meet the ultimate Oct. 15 deadline for filing his United States income taxes. 
 ''I was worried about them because I am a man who for the last 20 years has been trying not to break any law of any society,'' said Mr. Shakeri, 59, who arrived last Tuesday from Iran back to his home in Lake Forest, near Irvine in Southern California. 
 It remains obscure to him what law, exactly, the Islamic Republic of Iran believed he had broken when the police grabbed him on May 8 as he was boarding his flight for home, he said. 
 He was hauled off to Section 209 of Evin Prison, the place for political detainees, and subjected intermittently to about 70 days of interrogation. 
 A dual Iranian-American citizen, Mr. Shakeri had left for Tehran on March 14 to visit his ailing mother. She died soon afterward. 
 He was one of four Iranian-Americans seized around that time, and he said his interrogators tried to make something of the fact that Haleh Esfandiari, an academic with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, was also in Iran visiting her sick mother. Ms. Esfandiari was also detained but was released in early September. 
 ''They asked, 'How is it that all your mothers were ill?''' Mr. Shakeri, a real estate and mortgage broker, said in a telephone interview. ''I told them: Ask God. Every day hundreds of thousands of people have ill mothers -- it doesn't mean they are all related to each other.''
 More ominously, the interrogators focused on both his work as a founding member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California, Irvine, and the absentee votes he had cast for the reformist candidate in Iran's presidential elections. 
 As with the three other Iranian-Americans seized, the basic accusations against him swirled around the idea that he threatened national security by promoting a ''velvet revolution'' to undermine Iran's ruling clergy. 
 ''Your purpose is to help the reformists get rid of the other side,'' he quoted them as saying, and he said he responded that he was encouraging people only to participate legally and that the government should not interfere in the choices people made. Ultimately, he said, he thinks that he and the others were arrested to discourage any political activity by Iranians abroad.
 Mr. Shakeri said he was never physically mistreated but was often insulted verbally during his time in prison. He said he spent more than four of his five months in solitary confinement. Twice, inexplicably, he got 10-day spells in a larger cell with another prisoner as well as a bathroom, a television and newspapers. That was how he discovered that at least one other Iranian-American was in Evin, he said.
 All of them have now been released. 
 Otherwise, Mr. Shakeri said, to stave off the terrible loneliness, he tried to concentrate on issues larger than his immediate problems. He decided that his original goal in helping to establish the peacebuilding center was more important than ever, and that once released he would redouble his efforts to promote dialogue between the United States and Iran. Now, as before, he opposes economic sanctions over Iran's nuclear program and any military strike against Iran. 
 ''I had to do something to be morally strong and optimistic about the future and not lose my will,'' he said. 
 Mr. Shakeri said he read 37 books from the extremely limited selection in one bookcase. They included a 21-volume set of the complete sayings of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a history of philosophy and a translation of ''The Sorrows of Empire,'' an extended screed against American foreign policy. 
 Mr. Shakeri said he exercised daily by pacing. Most of the time he was in murky fluorescent light, but he was allowed to visit a room with a glass ceiling where he could see the sun. It was the one place he was not blindfolded while moving around the prison.
 He also lost 15 to 20 pounds, prompting him to go out to buy new suits when he got home, said his son Kaveh. 
 No one is sure what prompted his release, but during President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to New York for the United NationsGeneral Assembly, Kaveh Shakeri managed to attend a dinner for Iranian-Americans at the Hilton Hotel on Sept. 23. He introduced himself to the Iranian leader in Persian and asked him to release his father, repeating the request to several top aides. 
 ''I didn't feel any sense of shock -- he appeared intrigued, that is all,'' Kaveh Shakeri said. ''He said he would look into it.'' 
 The next day, his father was released after putting up the deed to his brother's house to meet his $107,000 bail. The elder Mr. Shakeri said he had no idea whether the case would ever resurface in court. The other Iranian-Americans released were left in similar limbo. 
 Iran Jails Rights Advocate
 TEHRAN, Oct. 15 -- A prominent human rights advocate was jailed here on Sunday after an appearance before the Revolutionary Court, which handles political crimes, Iranian news media reported Monday. 
 The dissident, Emadeddin Baghi, was imprisoned on a previously suspended one-year term on charges of acting against state security. Previously, Mr. Baghi, a journalist who has written for reformist newspapers here, spent three years in jail for pro-democracy articles. 
 After his release in 2003, Mr. Baghi founded a group called the Organization for the Defense of Prisoners' Rights and campaigned against capital punishment, which is widely applied in Iran. The daily newspaper Etemad reported Monday that Mr. Baghi had come under increasing pressure recently to end his activities.

HEADLINE: 2 Truck Drivers Die in Crash in New Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD G. JONES

DATELINE: UNION, N.J., Oct. 15 

 BODY:
The drivers of two tractor-trailers died on Monday when they were trapped in the wreckage of a fiery collision along an accident-prone section of Interstate 78 here. 
 Traffic was snarled for miles when the authorities closed the highway for 90 minutes. The accident, which occurred about 1:30 p.m. west of Exit 50A, forced the closing of the eastbound lanes of I-78 while firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze that was sparked by the collision. 
 Investigators were still interviewing witnesses and sifting through the wreckage late Monday; the scene was in such disarray that the authorities were still trying to piece together the series of events that led to the collision.
 The authorities said some witnesses described one tractor-trailer driving in the westbound express lanes while another traveled east. Other accounts put both trucks traveling in the same direction on one side of the highway.
 What is certain is that both tractor-trailers ended up in the eastbound lanes, mangled and burning.
 ''They hit, they rolled over and then they both caught fire,'' said Chief Frederic Fretz of the Union Fire Department, as he stood a few hundred feet from singed shrubbery and charred sound barriers in a residential section. 
 Chief Fretz said the two people who were killed were the drivers of the tractor-trailers, who could not escape the wreckage after the trucks rolled onto the shoulder of the highway, spilling their cargo. One truck carried gravel; the other, metal pipes. The authorities had not identified either driver by late Monday.
 ''We couldn't get to them,'' Chief Fretz said. ''They succumbed in the cabs of their vehicles.''
 Chief Fretz said that the accident occurred on a stretch that has been the scene of many accidents. Interstate 78 merges with Route 24 in the westbound lanes almost parallel to where the accident occurred.
 The chief said the eastbound lanes had recently been resurfaced. ''This is a typical accident out here,'' he said.
 Asked how often his department responded to serious accidents in the area, he replied, ''Daily.''
 People who live near the highway are also familiar with the sound of sirens and the sight of traffic tie-ups while accidents are being cleared. Some residents, though, said the crash on Monday was especially unnerving because of the amount of smoke and flames and the sound of the collision, which reverberated in homes half a mile away.
 ''I just heard these real loud booms,'' said Charlene Harris, 56, who lives in the Vauxhall section of Union and whose husband was at work not far away. ''My husband called me up and said, 'What just exploded?'''

HEADLINE: A Health Care Bargain

BYLINE: By PAUL O'NEILL. 
Paul O'Neill was the secretary of the Treasury from 2001 to 2002.

 BODY:
WHEN I look at the presidential candidates talking about the 47 million uninsured Americans and putting forth their health care reform plans, what comes to mind is a scene from December 2003: President Bush at a signing table at Constitution Hall in Washington, behind him grinning legislators celebrate making Medicare Part D the law of the land.
 Much was made of the great boon this would be for our older citizens, helping to pay for needed prescription drugs. One might have supposed that the generosity of spirit of the president and the lawmakers had been combined to pay for this gift. They were delighted to claim credit for this new entitlement, but no one said a word about the taxpayers who were being given the responsibility to pay for it. 
 I make so much of this episode because it has become the general case -- a tacit bipartisan agreement to obscure rather than illuminate the issues surrounding health care, to pander to voters rather than educate them on the conjoined issues of rights and responsibilities. On many issues, we now have government as an institution apart from the people: of itself, by itself, for itself.
 Here, the politicians seem to have agreed to ignore the central question: Should American citizenship bring with it the right to have financial access to medical care? Over time we have evolved an answer that is part yes and part no, creating a patchwork -- employer-financed insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, tax-advantaged health saving accounts and the like -- that results in vastly different levels of care for our citizens. 
 Few are satisfied with it, and for good reason. We are sufficiently wealthy and advanced as a society that we should consider financial access to needed medical care a birthright. But this is important: I mean this as a ''right'' in a context that joins rights with responsibilities, to separate it from the popular notion of an entitlement, which is often little more than a handout. 
 If we're going to have a new American birthright to care, there will be new American responsibilities. As a first principle, all citizens should provide as they can for their own medical care so they do not impose their own requirements on others. As such, we should mandate that all Americans pay in advance for coverage of catastrophic medical needs. 
 The two organizing principles would be that the costs of catastrophic care would be spread across the population through insurance, and that while the high costs of serious medical problems would be covered, there would still be large deductibles for most Americans for initial care. (These could be paid out of pocket, or consumers could take out supplemental insurance to cover them.)
 Obviously, for those people with little or no income or wealth, society as a whole would have to provide first-dollar coverage. It is only fair that those with more financial means share the burden. 
 This gives rise to many complex issues. At what income level should people be required to shoulder some and then all of their own insurance needs? Should there be one insurance pool for the entire population or should there be subnational pools? (I would lean toward a single national pool.) Should people be assessed extra premiums related to age or chronic conditions or drug or alcohol addiction? The answers are not obvious, but they are questions Congress and the presidential candidates are refusing to wrestle with. 
 There are several advantages to a system along these lines that go beyond simply providing care to all. First, since most Americans would have a significant personal cost until the catastrophic coverage took over, they would, at least in theory, shop for the best product. This would be a welcome change from the current system, in which there is virtually no cost and quality transparency. This new system could also lead us toward creating a framework for continuous learning by doctors and hospitals. No other sector of our society does such a bad job of learning from things gone wrong. A major reason for this is that the fear of malpractice suits leads doctors and hospitals to withhold information on bad incidents. 
 If, instead, the government required providers to report every error within 24 hours, the quality of care would rise considerably. In return, rather than having malpractice cases go to the civil courts, we could establish an independent body to determine the economic damage to the injured party and pay it from the general Treasury revenues. For this to work, the medical societies would need to finally step up to their responsibility and weed out incompetent providers. 
 The collection of data on medical errors could also be part of a broader effort to create a common national standard for individual medical records. Given the digitalization of the rest of our lives, it is absurd that lives are lost because hospitals can't immediately call up a patient's entire medical history on the Internet. 
 In the end, we cannot look at insurance coverage, medical costs, quality of care and information technology as separate issues. As we strive to make sure every American can get necessary treatment, we must look at every aspect of our health care system. We can do much better, and we should start now.

HEADLINE: Low in Polls, Bush Makes More Time for Friendly Crowds

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: ROGERS, Ark., Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Out there in the rest of America, polls show that about twice as many people disapprove of President Bush as approve of him. But here in a cavernous convention center hall, Mr. Bush found nothing but admirers Monday when he answered questions during a town-hall-style meeting. 
 One man began by commending Mr. Bush ''on your steadfastness and your faith.'' Another concluded by saying, ''Thank you for being my president for the last seven years,'' with an emphasis on the word ''my.'' A third expressed dismay that Mr. Bush could not run for president again.
 ''It's time for new blood,'' Mr. Bush replied. ''Plus,'' he added wryly, ''I'd be single.''
 The friendly audience in northwest Arkansas -- not a single questioner criticized Mr. Bush -- is typical of such let-Bush-be-Bush events, which the White House is staging with increasing frequency. Mr. Bush's aides like them because the president is much better in an informal setting, especially one where he can get his message across, conversation-style, without pesky reporters asking the questions.
 Mr. Bush's message Monday was the economy -- ''The worst thing we could do is run up taxes,'' he said -- and his looming fight with Congress over the budget. ''You're fixing to see what we call a fiscal showdown in Washington,'' he said, renewing his threat to veto spending bills he does not like. 
 About 300 people attended the session, for which the local chamber of commerce and the Arkansas Republican Party distributed tickets. The chamber's president, Raymond Burns, said he had hoped to draw an audience that represented ''a diversity of businesses,'' not a diversity of political points of view, and that had ''people who are respectful.''
 They were. Outside the hall, after lunch at a barbecue restaurant, Mr. Bush and his motorcade passed a few onlookers carrying ''impeachment now'' signs and antiwar signs. Inside the hall, the war in Iraq came up only when Mr. Bush talked about it himself. 
 Instead, he fielded questions on such matters as the possibility of government grants for private preschools (''Probably not,'' he replied) and a bill to raise the retirement age for pilots (he confessed he had not heard of it).
 The kicker came from a girl who asked when he thought there would be ''a girl president'' -- from the Republican Party. 
 ''You took my line,'' the president replied, apparently thinking for a moment that he was being asked about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York. ''I think there will -- a lady will be president, you know, and she'll be a Republican.''

HEADLINE: An Overblown Fear About S-Chip

 BODY:
To hear the Bush administration tell it, expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program would entice hordes of families to drop their private coverage and put their children on the public dole. As the Health and Human Services secretary, Michael Leavitt, argued in a recent television appearance, states that cover middle-income children as well as the poor are essentially telling people to ''cancel your private insurance and we'll have the government pay for it.'' 
 There are several things wrong with that claim. 
 First, nobody who enrolls in S-chip would be living on government handouts. The families would all be paying appropriate premiums and co-payments. It is also highly unlikely that a lot of people would drop private coverage to enroll in S-chip. States already monitor such substitution and take a number of steps to deter it. 
 New York estimates that only about 3 percent of the children enrolled in the program came from families that dropped employer coverage to obtain S-chip. Mathematica Policy Research, in a report prepared for the federal government, looked at states across the country and pegged the typical substitution rate at less than 10 percent. 
 Using a broader methodology and peering into the future, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill vetoed by President Bush would increase enrollment in S-chip and Medicaid by 5.8 million in 2012. Of that total, 3.8 million children would otherwise be uninsured and 2 million would be children who could have gotten private insurance in the absence of S-chip. 
 Even if that 1-in-3 substitution rate should turn out to be accurate, it is still far better than denying insurance to millions of American children. 
 From the standpoint of a child's health, it is often a good thing to substitute S-chip for private coverage. If the available private policy has skimpy benefits or is so costly it devours a family budget with large premiums and cost-sharing, the child may not get needed medical care.
 Some critics of S-chip like to cite substitution estimates that are much higher. Mathematica found that so-called ''population-based studies'' estimated the substitution rate at 10 percent to 56 percent, depending on the approach and assumptions used. These studies capture not only families that dropped private coverage to go into the S-chip program but also families that had an opportunity later to take out private insurance yet stayed on the public program. 
 The problem with these studies is that they assume that all parents that dropped or decided not to go with private coverage did so because of the availability of S-chip. They ignore other very possible circumstances, such as when families lose their private coverage because a parent dies or loses a job. These studies also take no account of whether a private policy, though theoretically available, was too costly to be affordable for a low-income worker.
 President Bush's preferred policy is to provide families with tax deductions to help pay for private insurance. Responsible economists estimate that such an approach would do far less to enroll uninsured children than would the proposed expansion of S-chip. The president's own budget proposal for maintaining the current S-chip program is so stingy that it would not even cover the number of children currently enrolled -- and would probably increase the number of children forced to go without health coverage by hundreds of thousands. 
 When the House votes on Thursday, all legislators concerned about covering uninsured children, and improving their health as a result, should vote to override President Bush's veto.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Moves to Stabilize Markets; Bernanke Is Troubled by Housing Trend

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
Two months ago, when credit markets around the world were freezing up in panic over failed mortgages, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that he was confident investors would work things out for themselves.
 ''We're going to work through this problem just fine,'' he said in an interview with CNBC on Aug. 21. ''I think what the American people need to understand, these things take a while to play out.'' 
 Mr. Paulson says he still holds that view. But in a sign that administration officials are more worried about underlying problems in the markets than they had previously let on, Mr. Paulson and other top Treasury officials are prodding and pushing Wall Street firms and the mortgage industry to come up with solutions -- and helping devise some of them as well.
 The plan announced Monday involves no money from taxpayers, and it was negotiated primarily between the banks themselves. But it highlighted Mr. Paulson's growing effort to marry two competing goals of the Bush administration: to stabilize the battered markets for mortgages and housing, but to avoid a government bailout that might encourage investors to take even bigger risks in the future -- what economists call ''moral hazard.'' 
 ''I have no interest in bailing out lenders or property speculators,'' Mr. Paulson plans to say, according to an advance text of a speech he will deliver on Tuesday. ''Still, we must recognize the very real harm to families affected by the housing downturn.''
 The Treasury's move coincided with a gloomy assessment of both the mortgage and housing markets by Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve. ''Despite a few encouraging signs, conditions in mortgage markets remain difficult,'' Mr. Bernanke told the New York Economic Club in a speech in Midtown Manhattan Monday evening. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the overall economy is still growing, suggesting that the Fed is not likely to cut interest rates at its policy meeting at the end of this month unless conditions worsen markedly in the next couple of weeks. But he predicted that the housing market has yet to hit bottom and that it was likely to be a ''significant drag'' on growth through early next year. A weak economy, he added, could reinforce problems in the credit markets.
 Mr. Paulson's effort to hammer out a plan with major banks to support mortgage-backed securities was headed by two of his top deputies, Robert Steel and Anthony Ryan, both Wall Street veterans. The two men herded rival bank executives into meetings and conference calls over the past month, and helped devise a plan aimed at jump-starting the frozen mortgage market.
 Mr. Paulson is becoming more active on other fronts as well. In his speech on Tuesday, he is expected to call for new nationwide rules for mortgage lenders, changes in the practices of credit-rating agencies and tougher scrutiny by federal banking regulators.
 Mr. Paulson also plans to step up pressure on mortgage lenders and mortgage-servicing companies to renegotiate terms for people in danger of defaulting on expensive subprime loans. 
 ''We have an immediate need to see results,'' Mr. Paulson is expected to say, according to the advance text of his speech. ''The current process is not working well. This is not about finger-pointing, it is about putting an aggressive plan together and moving forward.''
 In an interview on Monday, Mr. Paulson said the credit markets appeared to be slowly recovering from the panic of early August. But he sounded more worried than before about the wave of families that may face foreclosure as initial teaser rates expire on their subprime mortgages.
 ''I'm increasingly concerned there are some homeowners out there being harmed by the complexity of the system,'' he said. ''I want to see more results. I don't want to see foreclosures taking place where 50 percent of the people haven't talked to anybody.''
 All of this entails a delicate balancing act between two very different goals. On the one hand, administration officials want to avert a crisis of confidence in financial markets and reduce an expected torrent of foreclosures among people whose loans are set to jump to much higher interest rates over the next year or so.
 On the other hand, the Bush administration remains staunchly opposed to government intervention in financial markets and doubtful about imposing restrictions that might be aimed at protecting home buyers but could restrict the kinds of mortgage loans companies can offer. 
 Indeed, the bank deal announced on Monday suggests a cautious form of government pressure that often comes closer to jawboning and moral persuasion than to orchestrating bailouts or issuing edicts.
 ''This was developed by banks and by investors,'' said one senior administration official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''The secretary identified this as an area of the marketplace that was improving a little less slowly.''
 Treasury officials and at least some of the major banks had differing reasons for wanting to reach the same goal. The banks were worried about being caught with tens of billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities they might not be able to sell except at fire-sale prices worth only a small fraction of their face value.
 Treasury officials, meanwhile, wanted to restore confidence in the market for mortgage-backed securities. They were worried that continued fear and paralysis in that area would aggravate the downturn in housing and damage the broader economy.
 Mr. Paulson initiated a meeting in Washington with top executives from Citigroup and other major banks on Sept. 16, according to administration officials. At the time, the immediate distress in credit markets, which erupted in early August, had begun to ebb slightly. But Treasury officials saw continued problems for asset-backed commercial paper, the short-term securities that financial institutions had been issuing to pay for big bundles of mortgage loans.
 In calling together executives from top banks, Mr. Paulson said he was looking for ways to revive investor confidence in mortgage-backed securities that seemed to be fundamentally healthy and quite different from those backed by subprime mortgages and ''no document'' loans that require little or no verification of a borrower's income.
 The idea of the new pool is to fill it only with securities that have top credit ratings and have been scrutinized by a committee that includes potential buyers of those securities. The hope is that the new fund will be good enough to revive interest and rekindle the market for other mortgages.
 Both Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, expressed their frustration with the complex mortgage securities that are inscrutable to many investors. 
 ''I'd like to know what those damn things are worth,'' Mr. Bernanke said in response to a question after his speech. Until investors ''are confident in their evaluations,'' he added, ''they are not going to be willing to fund these vehicles.''
 And though he is not specific about his plans, Mr. Paulson plans to put more pressure on mortgage servicing companies to negotiate new terms with subprime borrowers whose monthly payments are set to jump sharply over the next year. ''You're going to see us quite active there,'' he said, ''working with the private sector for an integrated approach.''

HEADLINE: On Human Rights, U.S. Seems to Give Egypt a Pass

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO, Oct. 12 -- Last month, Hisham Kassem, an Egyptian human rights advocate, met with President Bush in Washington when he was flown there for an award granted by the National Endowment for Democracy. Mr. Kassem, the only winner from Egypt, said that Mr. Bush had spoken effusively about promoting democracy to the other recipients, but he did not address the topic when it came to Egypt.
 ''In comparison with my colleagues from other countries, this was the least of his interests,'' Mr. Kassem said. 
 He and other democracy campaigners in Egypt say that when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice meets with Egyptian officials in Sharm el Sheik on Tuesday as part of her preparation for a Middle East peace summit meeting, they expect from her a similar approach to Egyptian human rights and democracy. Even if she does raise the issues, analysts here say, it will have little impact.
 That is in sharp contrast to the administration's aggressive campaign for democracy in 2005 and 2006, which did have an effect and shows shifting American priorities, advocates and analysts say. 
 ''I think the American government does give Egypt leeway to deal with the domestic opposition so long as Egypt supports the American foreign policy in the region,'' said Mustapha Kamel el-Sayyid, a political science professor at the American University in Cairo. That includes helping Israel and the Palestinians find common ground and opposing the spread of Iran's influence.
 The shift is not so much that American officials no longer mention human rights and democracy; it is more that they do not follow up to ensure results. Instead, there seems to be a tacit understanding whereby Washington criticizes Egypt's human rights failings, Egypt takes umbrage at the ''interference'' in domestic affairs and little changes. 
 For example, last June, President Bush singled out a handful of political dissidents as ''unjustly imprisoned,'' including Ayman Nour, the onetime presidential candidate and opposition political leader here in Egypt, and greeted democracy advocates, including Saad Eddin Ibrahim, also Egyptian.
 Yet Mr. Nour remains in prison, a year into a five-year sentence. Mr. Ibrahim has been living in self-imposed exile, fearful that if he returns to Egypt he will be put in prison, again, for his political activities.
 With Mr. Nour in prison and Mr. Ibrahim on the run, with a human rights organization recently shut down, with journalists being imprisoned, with arrests of those out of step with the government, there is little evidence that Egypt -- or any other nation in the region -- is under any real American pressure for democratic reforms and human rights.
 ''I like to compare the U.S. to the European settlers of the past century,'' said Sateh Noureddine, a columnist at As-Safir, a pro-Syrian newspaper in Lebanon. ''The European settler said, 'I am coming to liberate, to develop, to modernize.' But after a while he stumbled upon realities and facts that he did not know before and that could not be ignored. This is what is happening to the U.S. today, hence the change in its policies, from an ideological agenda to a pragmatic one. They are looking to protect themselves and their interests.''
 Critics of the United States acknowledge that Washington faces resentment no matter what it does. It gets criticized for helping, and for not helping. In a public letter to Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, for example, an Iranian dissident journalist, Akbar Ganji, recently explained how Washington's pro-democracy efforts -- regardless of their intent -- were not helping in Iran.
 ''The Bush administration, for its part, by approving a fund for democracy assistance in Iran, which has in fact been largely spent on official institutions and media affiliated with the U.S. government, has made it easy for the Iranian regime to describe its opponents as mercenaries of the U.S. and to crush them with impunity,'' Mr. Ganji wrote.
 In Egypt, there had been a quiet, and grudging acknowledgment that the marginal improvements in the political dynamics here were driven by pressure from Washington in the past few years. Some demonstrations were tolerated. The chanting of slogans against President Hosni Mubarak was also tolerated. In 2005 and part of 2006, even leaders in the Muslim Brotherhood said privately that Washington's pressure was helping. 
 But that is over. In recent days the group Human Rights Watch has called on Egypt to free two men active in promoting the rights of the nation's tiny Shiite Muslim minority. The organization said the arrests appeared to be part of a broad crackdown ''on Egyptian rights activists, journalists, and other government critics.'' 
 Four days before Human Rights Watch issued its news release, Egyptian officials quietly issued their own press release announcing that the United States had signed agreements to deliver $301 million in aid to Egypt to help improve the schools, drainage and sanitation, health care and economic reform.
 The news release was issued by the state-run news agency, but unlike frequent headlines in the Egyptian press chastising Washington for trying to influence Cairo, this news was not reported in the Egyptian press. 
 In recent months, Congress has debated the $1.7 billion in aid -- which includes the $301 million -- that is given to Egypt each year, asking what the United States receives in return. The increased aid has not translated into increased influence on the domestic political process. It has become purely a matter of foreign policy.
 ''It is in the interest of the United States for Egypt to be a stable Arab country,'' said Emad Ghad, an analyst with the government-financed Ahram Center of Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''Egypt's behavior is predictable and in line with U.S. interests. The regime, for better or worse, is beneficial to the U.S. administration.''

HEADLINE: As Defaults Rise, Washington Worries

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
During the summer's credit crisis, investors concluded that the default rates on subprime mortgages made last year would probably prove to be the highest in the industry's history.
 But there now appears to be another contender for that dubious honor: loans made in the first half of this year.
 Borrowers who took out loans in the first six months of 2007 are falling behind on payments faster than homeowners who took out loans last year, according to a report by Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, an investment bank based in Arlington, Va. The data suggested that more Americans could lose their homes and that the housing market's troubles might persist longer than many analysts have been predicting. 
 The report's author, Michael D. Youngblood, a portfolio manager and analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, said that most mortgage companies and banks had not tightened lending standards for borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit until July or August, even though early this year regulators, analysts and mortgage investors knew that the easy lending policies of 2005 and 2006 were producing high default rates.
 ''There are $10.6 trillion of mortgage loans outstanding in the U.S., and even if the brakes had been slammed, it was going to take a long time to slow this locomotive down,'' said Mr. Youngblood, who has researched home lending for more than 20 years. ''And I don't see that the brakes were slammed on or that the engineer had a new track to follow. That track only now seems to be appearing.''
 He noted that Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest lender whose practices are often emulated by smaller companies, did not significantly tighten standards until August. And it was only in mid-July that Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, the large ratings agencies, said they would make major changes in the assumptions that they use to evaluate pools of home loans sold to investors.
 As of August, default rates on adjustable-rate subprime mortgages written in 2007 had reached 8.05 percent, up from 5.77 percent in July, according to Mr. Youngblood's analysis of pools of home loans put together by Wall Street banks and sold to investors. By comparison, only 5.36 percent of such loans made last year had defaulted by August 2006. Default rates on fixed-rate subprime mortgages were lower, but were rising at a similar pace.
 Data analyzed by Moody's confirms the trend Mr. Youngblood has identified. Executives at Moody's say they are monitoring the performance of recent loans, but were not yet ready to discuss their conclusions. 
 It is unclear whether loans made in the last couple of months are stronger, because lenders were making and securitizing far fewer of them and investors have grown wary of bonds backed by subprime mortgages. 
 ''You may not hear that much about that stuff, because it's not seeing the light of day,'' said Evan Mitnick, a managing director at Westwood Capital, a boutique investment bank in New York.
 In the first six months of the year, Wall Street securitized $215 billion in subprime loans, down 23 percent from the comparable period a year earlier, according to Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. By the end of August, the total had dropped by 33 percent from the comparable eight months of 2006.
 The recent weakness in job growth and falling home prices in many parts of the country have probably contributed to the higher default rates on loans from early this year, specialists say. 
 Job losses in the housing industry have put pressure on the economies of formerly fast-growing states like Arizona and Florida. And declining home prices have made it harder for borrowers to refinance loans, especially in cases where the buyers could afford the homes only with the help of the low introductory rates on adjustable mortgages.
 Those borrowers are expected to encounter further strain in the months and years ahead as their loans are reset to higher variable rates. When they try to refinance their mortgages, many of them will face stricter lending standards. Many lenders are now requiring borrowers to provide documentation of their incomes, and they will not lend more than 80 to 90 percent of a house's value.
 A survey of 500 borrowers with adjustable-rate loans released yesterday in Cleveland showed that the resetting of rates will put a significant strain on homeowners. 
 Among borrowers whose rates have already been reset, 41 percent said they were worried about their ability to make payments, compared with 18 percent of borrowers whose rates had not been reset yet. Nearly three-quarters of families with incomes less than $50,000 a year said that an increase in their rates would hurt them, compared with 40 percent with incomes above $50,000.
 The survey was conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates on behalf of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which is setting up a telephone help line for troubled homeowners.
 Financing homes with adjustable mortgages was popular during the housing boom because the borrowers could enjoy lower rates in the first two or three years and then refinance. That worked when house prices were rising fast, but now that prices are flat or falling, it is proving unsustainable, said Keith Ernst, a senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending.
 ''Subprime lending had problems with underwriting for a while, and it was evident in weak housing markets -- just ask the people in Cleveland,'' Mr. Ernst said. ''Now that the weakness is widespread, it has pulled the covers on all subprime loans.''

HEADLINE: D.M.V. Chief Is Pressed to Defend Plan to Give Licenses to Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 15 

 BODY:
In a hearing punctuated by angry exchanges about terrorism, Senate Republicans grilled the commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles on Monday, pressing him to defend Gov. Eliot Spitzer's plan to grant driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
 Senator Vincent L. Leibell, an upstate Republican, declared that under the proposal, Osama bin Laden could obtain a driver's license in New York. 
 The commissioner, David J. Swarts, shot back, ''I think we'd probably catch that right away.''
 Mr. Swarts then cracked, ''At least we'd know where he is,'' echoing a newspaper column on the subject.
 The four-hour hearing underscored the contentiousness over the issue, which is emerging as a major political firefight in the capital and beyond. Lou Dobbs has taken it up as an almost nightly cause on CNN.
 Republicans are threatening to cut off money for the D.M.V. if Mr. Spitzer goes ahead with the policy. Many Democratic politicians are either voicing their disapproval or quietly expressing worry that the governor has prompted voter anger and unnecessarily imperiled their chances in the 2008 election.
 On Monday, a poll conducted by Siena College was released showing overwhelming opposition to the plan, with 72 percent of New Yorkers opposing it. The poll also showed the governor's job approval numbers weakening.
 Republicans questioned whether technology measures being put in place could be effectively used in motor vehicle offices to check the authenticity of a myriad of foreign passports. Beyond terrorism concerns, they said the policy would in effect condone breaking immigration laws.
 The governor has said his policy would make the state more secure by bringing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants out of the shadows, allowing the state to maintain records on them. He has also said it would improve traffic safety and lower insurance costs by encouraging illegal immigrants to obtain licenses and insurance. 
 Mr. Spitzer said at an appearance on Monday that he was undaunted by the opposition. 
 ''It's what happens when you govern and make tough decisions, and do things that you believe are right, and don't govern based on polls,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 The hearing also vividly reflected the racial politics bound up in the proposal. The 10 Republicans on the two Senate committees running the hearing were all white men, and were in the middle, while the 5 Democratic members, all but one black or Hispanic, were relegated to the far ends of the hearing table. 
 Republicans scheduled a dozen opponents of the plan to follow the commissioner.
 ''Every single witness that they have invited today are in opposition,'' said Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., a Bronx Democrat, while Senator Bill Perkins, a Harlem Democrat, criticized Republicans for fostering the ''politics of fear-mongering.''
 The standoff is most likely to lead to a number of fights in the courts and over the division's budget. While the governor's staff has said it has the authority to begin granting the licenses without the Legislature's approval, Senate Republicans are threatening to withhold money for the new personnel and technology that would be needed to put the plan into effect. 
 Republicans are also threatening to sue to block the proposal. And about a dozen county clerks have said they would refuse to go along with the plan, and several of them, including one Democrat, appeared at Monday's hearing. The clerks' offices in many upstate counties double as D.M.V. branches, and the governor has threatened to take legal action against them if they do not carry out his policies. 
 ''This plan makes it easier, far easier, for driver's licenses to fall into the wrong hands, like those of potential terrorists,'' said Kathleen Marchione, the Saratoga County clerk who is the president of the New York State Association of County Clerks. 
 The clerks and some other officials have questioned why the governor did not move more slowly and obtain more public input in putting forward the plan. 
 On Monday, Senate Republicans pressed Mr. Swarts to urge the governor to reconsider, saying it would weaken security measures put in place since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 The governor's plan is similar to one in place in eight other states, but runs counter to a trend in a majority of states to explicitly bar illegal immigrants from obtaining licenses. 
 ''There seems to me to be a bit of arrogance here in jamming down the public's throat that this is good for you,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican and one of Albany's more mild-mannered politicians. ''And at this point I see no harm in recommending to the governor, let's just hold on a minute.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer has stressed that illegal immigrants would have to show a valid foreign passport to obtain the license, and Mr. Swarts urged the senators to accept that illegal immigrants live here and that the state government has to deal with that reality.
 Mr. Swarts said there are at least a million illegal immigrants in New York. ''They are here to stay,'' he added. ''Many of them participate in the economic viability of the state; to ignore their presence raises some questions.''
 But the Republicans appear determined. Senator Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, vowed ''this governor will not get away with this.''
 And despite Mr. Swarts's certainty that Osama bin Laden will not be getting a New York driver's license, Senator Leibell was not convinced.
 ''I'm not so sure,'' said Senator Leibell, adding, ''I will tell you this, you would be quite embarrassed if that happened.''

HEADLINE: Light on Business, Heavy on the Upbeat Anchors

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
ON Fox Business Network, the sky isn't falling -- it's the ground that is going up.
 The mood on Rupert Murdoch's latest television venture was so giggly and upbeat that it belied its own crawl, showing sinking stock prices. 
 For the inaugural show, the FBN anchor, Alexis Glick, asked Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton a few perfunctory campaign questions via satellite, then went down to Times Square to interview an entrepreneur of the day, the Naked Cowboy, a guitar-strumming singer who says he earns $250,000 a year serenading tourists in a cowboy hat and underpants, and much more in merchandising and record contracts. 
 ''No matter what you think at home,'' Ms. Glick, formerly a temporary anchor on the ''Today'' show on NBC, said, giddily holding up a souvenir hat and briefs. ''You can make a small business a reality.''
 This is not a network that caters to money managers or day traders. FBN provides economic news for people who don't follow the economy very closely and hate to hear bad news. Sunny, informal and downright perky, Fox Business Network comes off as a blend of CNBC and a fifth hour of the ''Today'' show-- with the underlying political drumbeat of Fox News. (Global warming is natural and so are tax cuts.)
 CNBC didn't ignore its new competitor yesterday. Throughout the day, ads for CNBC popped up on FBN, including a glowing testimonial from John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman of General Electric, which owns CNBC. 
 When Mr. Murdoch first announced his plan to create a rival to CNBC, he said he wanted to offer viewers a more ''business friendly'' network. That was puzzling at the time, because no one has ever accused CNBC stars like Jim Cramer or Maria Bartiromo of being anticapitalist. But not even they could match the ebullient spirits of FBN's on-air personalities. 
 Anchors described record oil prices with a lilt, they delighted in the fall of the dollar as a boon to American exports. The network even created its own stock market index, called the Fox 50, which tracks 50 companies with popular products, including Amazon.com, Home Depot and Yum Brands. (The Fox 50 finished the day down 7 points -- not down as far as the Dow Jones or Nasdaq.) 
 Mr. Murdoch has said that the newspaper he is acquiring, The Wall Street Journal, caters to Wall Street while his business network intends to serve Main Street. 
 CNBC began its midday program, ''Power Lunch,'' with a standup inside the Four Seasons, a Manhattan restaurant patronized by the likes of Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, and Barry Diller. FBN at noon flipped to a live shot inside the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. 
 Neil Cavuto of Fox News has his own show on the new business network, but it was Bill O'Reilly of ''The O'Reilly Factor'' who laid out FBN's business model during a cameo appearance. ''You want to basically have fun,'' Mr. O'Reilly told the anchor Cheryl Casone. ''Its so intense, the whole business world. The more fun you can have with it, I think the more people will watch.''
 It was hard to muster a lot of fun explaining the $100 billion superfund that the country's three largest banks have said they will create to shore up the market for mortgage securities. 
 Eric Bolling, a former financial news commentator who left CNBC for FBN, took quickly to the buoyant spirit of his new home. The superfund could have ''a positive impact,'' he assured Peter Barnes, a morning anchor. Mr. Bolling uttered the word ''bail,'' then corrected himself, saying that the superfund could ''put a calming tone on the market'' and have a ''real upside.'' When he said that the technical process was ''complicated,'' Mr. Barnes reminded him warningly, ''no jargon.''
 FBN makes a point of avoiding technical terms and Wall Street argot. The anchors on CNBC's morning show ''Squawk Box'' sit across from each other in their shirt-sleeves to mimic the look of a trading desk, and anchors speak against an electronic backdrop of charts and stock prices. 
 The hosts of the FBN morning show sat aligned on a curved banquette. A conversation about business blogs on the Internet was set around a wooden tea table, with bookshelves of magazines and newspapers in the background.
 Five o'clock is ''Happy Hour.'' To inaugurate that segment, the anchors Cody Willard and Rebecca Gomez sat in the bar of the Bull and Bear in the Waldorf-Astoria and chatted about business against a backdrop of vodka bottles and blondes. Yesterday, they congratulated Ivanka Trump on her new line of jewelry and sampled ice wines and cheese. 
 The stock market can close, but on Fox Business Network, the fun never stops.

HEADLINE: Record Price Of Oil Raises New Worries

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The price of oil jumped to yet another record yesterday, sparking predictions that motorists would see sharply higher gasoline prices by Thanksgiving -- and fears that $100-a-barrel oil is no longer such a distant prospect.
 Crude oil for November delivery settled at a new nominal high of $87.61 a barrel, up $1.48. Futures touched $88.20 a barrel during the day yesterday, after jumping nearly 3 percent on Monday. 
 In recent years the economy has seemed immune to rising energy prices, but some analysts fear that as they spiral higher they will undermine growth, already strained because of the downturn in the housing market. Such concerns contributed to a stock sell-off yesterday, with broad market indexes closing down about a half-percent.
 Oil traders, discussing the latest rise, cited a potential conflict on the border between Turkey and Iraq that could heighten Middle East tensions and possibly affect oil supplies from the region.
 ''Markets hate uncertainty,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. ''The fundamentals are very supportive of high oil prices. But the latest run-up has nothing to do with market fundamentals, but has to do with fear.'' 
 Since the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, oil exports from northern Iraq through Turkey have been sporadic at best because of frequent bombings of Iraq's northern pipeline. But as oil producers worldwide are straining to meet demand, commodity investors are focused on anything that might hurt supplies. 
 Turkey is an important corridor for oil exports from Iraq and the Caspian Sea. The Turkish military has threatened in recent days to cross the Iraqi border to root out Kurdish separatists who have mounted attacks inside Turkey. 
 Oil prices have more than quadrupled since 2001 as strong demand for oil from Asia, the Middle East and the United States has outpaced the ability of producers to bring on new supplies. With little spare production capacity, the oil markets have become more volatile.
 After adjusting for inflation, oil prices are getting closer to historic levels reached in the early 1980s, when an energy crisis, the Iranian revolution, and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war sent prices spiraling to about $100 a barrel in today's dollars.
 Energy analysts generally believe the market is overreacting to a possible Turkish incursion into northern Iraq. Antoine Halff, an analyst at Fimat, an oil brokerage, said he expected prices to ease once the market realized supplies would not be affected. 
 ''The rally seems bound to run out of steam,'' he said. 
 In the meantime, though, higher crude will translate into more costly gasoline, according to AAA, the automobile club. Gasoline has declined in recent weeks after demand dropped with the end of the summer driving season. But that is likely to change as refiners begin passing on higher oil costs to consumers, according to AAA's spokesman, Geoff Sundstrom. 
 Gasoline averaged $2.76 a gallon nationwide yesterday, according to AAA. Gasoline exceeded $3 a gallon this summer.
 Reacting to the rally of the last week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ruled out an emergency release of oil supplies. When it met in Vienna last month, the oil cartel agreed to a modest production increase of 500,000 barrels a day.
 OPEC's secretary general, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, said in a statement yesterday that OPEC was concerned with rising prices. But he pointedly added that ''there has been no interruption in crude supplies.''
 ''While the organization does not favor oil prices at this level, it strongly believes that fundamentals are not supporting current high prices and that the market is very well supplied,'' Mr. El-Badri said. ''The rising oil prices which we are currently witnessing are, however, largely being driven by market speculators.'' 
 Most analysts say the reasons behind the price increases are complex. They include refinery bottlenecks in the United States, a weak dollar, geopolitical threats in the Middle East, the war in Iraq, violence in oil-producing Nigeria, and resource nationalism in Venezuela and Russia that is driving away foreign oil investment. 
 They also include strong growth in demand from China and the Middle East, where fuel prices are kept artificially low through government subsidies.
 The International Energy Agency, an energy adviser to industrialized countries, said last week that it expected global oil demand to jump by 2.4 percent next year, to 88 million barrels a day. Some traders cited that prediction as one cause of the rally, although several analysts said the figure was unrealistically high given the slowing global economy. 
 ''There is a perception that fundamentals are more bullish than they actually are,'' said Roger Diwan, an analyst at PFC Energy, an oil consulting firm.
 Investors and hedge funds have also contributed to the run-up. Commodity investors seem to have shrugged off the risk of a recession in the United States after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month. As a result, they have returned to commodity markets in force recently, analysts said.
 Some investors are buying oil to hedge against the decline in the value of the dollar. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has declined nearly 8 percent against the euro.

HEADLINE: In Shift, 40% of Immigrants Move Directly to Suburbs

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
About 4 in 10 immigrants are moving directly from abroad to the nation's suburbs, which are growing increasingly diverse, according to census figures released yesterday.
 The Census Bureau's annual survey of residential mobility also found that after steadily declining for more than a half-century, the proportion of Americans who move in any given year appears to have leveled off at about one in seven. 
 ''For blacks, especially, it mimics the 50s-style suburban movement, most pronounced for married couples with children, owners and the upwardly mobile,'' said William H. Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer.
 Dr. Frey's analysis of mobility patterns found that while Hispanic and Asian immigrants were more likely to settle first in the nation's cities, ''after they get settled, they follow the train to the suburbs.''
 The migration of blacks to the South continued, with net gains of blacks also seen in the West. The South was the dominant region in recording gains among Hispanics living in the United States who moved.
 ''The fast growth of construction and low-skilled jobs, plus the general affordability of parts of the South for upwardly mobile Hispanics, has made the South a key destination,'' Dr. Frey said.
 The 2006 Current Population Survey found that nearly 40 million people had moved in the preceding year, or about 14 percent. Residential mobility has remained at that rate for several years now after declining steadily from a high of 20 percent since the census began measuring it in 1948. While the census count of movers from abroad includes returning citizens, the bulk of movers are foreign born. 
 Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said traditional gateway cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles were still magnets for immigrants who move to join friends and relatives. But particularly in the South and West, where central cities were less likely to develop dense cores, immigrants are following jobs to the suburbs and settling there first.
 ''It's a really important shift,'' Ms. Singer said.
 The highest rates of moving were among residents of the West and the South, Hispanic people, the unemployed and renters. Some 30 percent of renters lived elsewhere a year earlier, compared with 7 percent of owners.
 Almost half of the movers said they changed residences because they wanted more space or less. Sixty-two percent moved within the same county, 20 percent moved from another county in the same state, 14 percent moved from another state and 3 percent moved from abroad.

Van Jones is a rare bird. He's a black social activist in Oakland, Calif., and as green an environmentalist as they come. He really gets passionate, and funny, when he talks about what it's like to be black and green:
 ''Try this experiment. Go knock on someone's door in West Oakland, Watts or Newark and say: 'We gotta really big problem!' They say: 'We do? We do?' 'Yeah, we gotta really big problem!' 'We do? We do?' 'Yeah, we gotta save the polar bears! You may not make it out of this neighborhood alive, but we gotta save the polar bears!' '' 
 Mr. Jones then just shakes his head. You try that approach on people without jobs who live in neighborhoods where they've got a lot better chance of getting killed by a passing shooter than a melting glacier, you're going to get nowhere -- and without bringing America's underclass into the green movement, it's going to get nowhere, too.
 ''We need a different on-ramp'' for people from disadvantaged communities, says Mr. Jones. ''The leaders of the climate establishment came in through one door and now they want to squeeze everyone through that same door. It's not going to work. If we want to have a broad-based environmental movement, we need more entry points.''
 Mr. Jones, who heads the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland, which helps kids avoid jail and secure jobs, has an idea how to change that -- a ''green-collar'' jobs program that focuses on underprivileged youth. I would not underestimate him. Mr. Jones, age 39and a Yale Law School grad, exudes enough energy to light a few buildings on his own. 
 One thing spurring him in this project, he explained, was the way that the big oil companies bought ads in black-owned newspapers in California in 2006 showing an African-American woman filling her gas tank with a horrified look at the pump price. The ads were used to help bring out black votes to defeat Proposition 87. That ballot initiative proposed a tax on oil companies drilling in California, the money from which would have gone to develop alternative energy projects. The oil companies tried to scare African-Americans into thinking that the tax on the companies would be passed on at the pump.
 ''The polluters were able to stampede poor people into their camp,'' said Mr. Jones. ''I never want to see an N.A.A.C.P. leader on the wrong side of an environment issue again.''
 Using his little center in Oakland, Mr. Jones has been on a crusade to help underprivileged African-Americans and other disadvantaged communities understand why they would be the biggest beneficiaries of a greener America. It's about jobs. The more government requires buildings to be more energy efficient, the more work there will be retrofitting buildings all across America with solar panels, insulation and other weatherizing materials. Those are manual-labor jobs that can't be outsourced.
 ''You can't take a building you want to weatherize, put it on a ship to China and then have them do it and send it back,'' said Mr. Jones. ''So we are going to have to put people to work in this country -- weatherizing millions of buildings, putting up solar panels, constructing wind farms. Those green-collar jobs can provide a pathway out of poverty for someone who has not gone to college.'' 
 Let's tell our disaffected youth: ''You can make more money if you put down that handgun and pick up a caulk gun.''
 Remember, adds Mr. Jones, ''a big chunk of the African-American community is economically stranded. The blue-collar, stepping-stone, manufacturing jobs are leaving. And they're not being replaced by anything. So you have this whole generation of young blacks who are basically in economic free fall.'' Green-collar retrofitting jobs are a great way to catch them. 
 To this end, Mr. Jones's group and the electrical union in Oakland created the Oakland Apollo Alliance. This year that coalition helped to raise $250,000 from the city government to create a union-supported training program that will teach young people in Oakland how to put up solar panels and weatherize buildings. 
 It is the beginning of a ''Green for All'' campaign (greenforall.org) that Mr. Jones -- backed by other environmental activists like Majora Carter from Sustainable South Bronx -- is launching to get Congress to allocate $125 million to train 30,000 young people a year in green trades.
 ''If we can get these youth in on the ground floor of the solar industry now, where they can be installers today, they'll become managers in five years and owners in 10. And then they become inventors,'' said Mr. Jones. ''The green economy has the power to deliver new sources of work, wealth and health to low-income people -- while honoring the Earth. If you can do that, you just wiped out a whole bunch of problems. We can make what is good for poor black kids good for the polar bears and good for the country.''

HEADLINE: Giants' Defense Earns Trust After Slow Start

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
The Giants' defense had to quickly take the field unexpectedly three times against the Falcons on Monday night because of what Coach Tom Coughlin called ''sudden-change situations.''
 Football fans and those who value the economy of words might call them turnovers. But each one of them at the Georgia Dome had the ultimate effect of providing the brightest signs of the Giants' resurgence 
 The offense gave the ball to the Falcons. The defense jogged onto the field. And, after three plays, the defense ran back off. 
 Every momentum-changing possibility was snuffed out by the defense. The Giants won their fourth game in a row, 31-10, but a picture larger than the final score emerged from the victory. While the offense has been wildly unpredictable, the defense has emerged as the most trusted component of the team.
 No one saw that coming a month ago. The Giants have awakened their latent championship hopes, and it is mostly the defense doing the rousting.
 ''The ability to go on the field in those situations and force the other guy to go three-and-out, those were exceptional defensive plays which really stated very strongly to everyone on our team that, you know what, we do have the ability to bail ourselves out if we do make mistakes,'' Coughlin said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. ''Not that we ever want to make a mistake, but it is a confidence boost.'' 
 Through the first two games, the defense of the first-year coordinator Steve Spagnuolo looked like a failed experiment. Since then, it looks as if it could carry a team deep into the postseason.
 A month ago that was implausible. The Giants were 0-2. The defense allowed 11 touchdowns and 80 points in the two losses. The unit was among the worst in the league by nearly every statistical barometer. And there was little indication that it would get better beyond the assumption that it could not get worse. 
 Something clicked, and even the Giants are not entirely sure how the switch was thrown. They confidently expected to grow into the new defensive alignments drawn up by Spagnuolo, who inherited nearly every defensive starter and assistant coach who worked under Tim Lewis in 2006, with diminishing results. 
 They believed they would evolve into a good defense. Instead, the improved defense seems to have been created by the big-bang theory.
 ''Those first two weeks, we were looking at ourselves, looking at the talent we have on this team, thinking, 'Hey, all we got to do is go out there and show up,''' defensive end Justin Tuck said after Monday's game. ''Obviously, they score 80 points on us, you've got to do something different.''
 Over the past four weeks, the Giants have allowed an average of 13.5 points a game, fifth-fewest in the N.F.L. By all those barometers, the Giants have been a top-10 defense over the past month.
 ''Honestly, I think the reason were playing so well is that we still have that 0-2 mentality,'' linebacker Antonio Pierce said. 
 Coughlin is a believer in motivational slogans, and they are sprinkled around the locker room and other areas of Giants Stadium. One tells players to ''prepare, practice and play as if you lost your last game.''
 The Giants did not just lose their first two games to the Cowboys (45-35) and Packers (35-13). The defense was embarrassed. It knew it was the team's weak link, and the degree of awfulness looks, through hindsight, like an odd blessing. It created an uncomfortable and unstated peer pressure, where one unit fears being viewed as the main reason for a team's overall failure. Even within the defense, there was worry about letting others down. 
 ''The secondary took a lot of flak about coverage, we took a lot of flak about the pass rush,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said after Monday's game. ''When we pop that film on, I don't want them to look at the defensive line and think that we're not giving them everything that we have, and vice versa.''
 Players wondered if such self-reflection would have occurred had the defense been simply middling. But the fact that the Giants worry about how others in the locker room view their performance can be viewed as a promising sign. A year ago, the Giants surged to 6-2 before an injury plague weakened the lineup, and internal bickering cast the franchise in a dysfunctional glow. 
 There have been no fissures to the facade of unity. Coughlin already feels this season is different, and not only because of the team's relative physical health.
 ''The players have been very supportive of each other,'' Coughlin said. ''There is a very good sense of responsibility. Leadership is doing a good job. There is a solid feeling in the locker room that if we stick together and everybody does their job, we can win. Those are the things that are prevailing.''
 It seems the only thing that might throw the Giants off-balance is some sort of ''sudden-change situation.'' But even those do not scare them now.
 EXTRA POINTS
 Plaxico Burress is the second N.F.L. player since 1970 with at least one touchdown catch in the first six games of a season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The other was Jerry Rice, who did it in all 12 games he played in the strike-shortened 1987 season. ... Monday's victory was the 600th regular-season win in Giants history. They are 600-502-33. Only the Bears (672) and the Packers (629) have more victories. ... Amani Toomer established one franchise mark Monday -- his 587 career receptions is one more than Tiki Barber had -- and set himself up for another. He has 48 touchdown receptions, tying him for first with Kyle Rote.

HEADLINE: Sometimes in the Woods, Hunters Become the Hunted

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Devised for minimum fuss and maximum tension, ''Trigger Man'' is the little thriller that could. Claiming inspiration from actual events, this smartly written sophomore feature from the young director Ti West -- whose debut, ''The Roost,'' exhibited a similar disdain for excess -- begins at a dawdle and ends at full gallop. Only the patient will be rewarded. 
 Unfolding during a single day, ''Trigger Man'' follows three New York friends on a first hunting trip to the woods of Wilmington, Del. For the opening 40 minutes, the movie simply allows us to tag along as the men, wearing orange safety vests and carrying rented rifles, search inexpertly for deer and converse in the shorthand of longtime pals. (''So she's got you smoking again?'') As jumpy as a stalker, the camera skulks behind, sneaking close and pulling back so abruptly that you would think that the hunters themselves were the prey. Uh-oh.
 The economy of Mr. West's filmmaking (he also wrote, shot and edited the movie) demands an uncluttered soundtrack: for long stretches we hear nothing but birdsong and rustling leaves. When violence occurs -- with jolting swiftness -- the director maintains his composure, staging his steel-trap finale in the eerie emptiness of an abandoned factory complex. It will be interesting to see if this reserve survives the increased pressures and budget of his current project, ''Cabin Fever 2.'' 
 TRIGGER MAN
 Opens today in Manhattan. 
 Written, directed and edited by Ti West; director of photography, Mr. West; music by Jeff Grace; produced by Larry Fessenden, Peter Phok and Mr. West; released by Glass Eye Pix. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 80 minutes. This film is not rated. 
 WITH: Reggie Cunningham (Reggie), Sean Reid (Sean), Ray Sullivan (Ray), Larry Fessenden (Henchman), James Felix McKenney (Shooter) and Heather Robb (Jogger).

HEADLINE: Banks' Safety Net for Lenders May Have Holes in It

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Suppose your credit card companies demanded that you pay off your balances in full by month's end and that you not use your cards for the foreseeable future.
 If your family is like the many American households that rely on revolving credit, such a request could cause severe financial pain. It may force you to sell a car or rely on a rich relative. Longer term, you may have to reduce your spending significantly.
 Far-fetched as that may seem, it is analogous to the situation that a group of financial enterprises known as structured investment vehicles are facing. Created about 20 years ago by American and European banks, these vehicles, known in the industry as SIVs, have become middlemen that channel hundreds of billions of dollars from investors around the world to American home buyers, credit card users and corporations. 
 The danger that many of these would collapse and create ripples in the economy by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow raised alarms at the Treasury Department a month ago.
 At its prodding, three large banks announced Monday that they would start a fund to serve as buyer of last resort for SIVs that were forced to sell billions in bonds and other debts linked to mortgages, credit card balances and other loans. 
 Depending on how popular the fund is, it could end up with a large share of the SIV's outstanding balance of $320 billion.
 On Wall Street, reaction to the proposal has been less then enthusiastic. Stock gauges have weakened. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which set a record a week ago, has fallen 1.5 percent since the plan was announced, in part because of weak earnings reports from companies like Citigroup and Ericsson. Treasury prices have risen as investors have sought the safety of government-backed debt. 
 Many investors and analysts describe the fund as a stopgap that will relieve some pressure but not address more intractable problems with mortgage securities held by the structured investment vehicles.
 ''It's very much a partial fix,'' said Ethan S. Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. But he said that when combined with the efforts of the Federal Reserve, which has cut interest rates and stepped up lending to financial institutions, the fund should be ''an important cushioning of the blow to the capital market.''
 ''There is still a shock to the economy, but it's a lot less than it was,'' Mr. Harris said.
 It remains unclear how much of the economic problems that started in the housing market with subprime loans to people with weak credit have been alleviated or forestalled by these various interventions. In speeches this week, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged that the housing market was continuing to weaken.
 The barometers that analysts use to evaluate the health of the market and the economy are providing conflicting and tentative signals. The premium that investors demand to hold risky loans rather than government-backed debt has narrowed since early September, but it remains far wider than it was at the start of the year.
 ''The trend is still to recovery, but it's not a straight line up,'' said Andrew Feltus, a bond portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston.
 Another indicator, the price of insurance on corporate bonds, worsened -- suggesting that investors were more worried than they were before the fund was announced, said Ed Rombach, a derivatives market analyst at Thomson Financial. ''Judging by the reaction in the market, it has reminded people that there is a problem out there.''
 People involved in the discussions that led to the fund's creation are hoping that it eases investors' anxiety by providing greater demand for the bonds held by the structured vehicles, many of which have not been actively traded since the credit market tightened in late July and early August. Investors have avoided the securities out of concern that they may contain risky loans made to homeowners and that their credit ratings may have been formulated on the basis of overly optimistic assumptions.
 Deborah A. Cunningham is a senior vice president who oversees taxable money market accounts at Federated Investors of Pittsburgh, which was involved in the negotiations about the fund as an investor that lends money to SIVs. She acknowledged that some vehicles did overextend themselves in subprime mortgages, but said that most invested in much healthier bonds that have been tarnished in a rush to judgment. Some problems were brought on, she said, by SIV operators' not fully disclosing their holdings.
 Ms. Cunningham said the group that created the fund, which is known as the Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit, is hoping that the fund's mere creation will provide some comfort to investors. ''The Treasury Department will consider this an extreme success,'' she said, ''if this is never, ever funded -- if it's never needed.'' 
 It is too early to judge if that might be the case. Trading in mortgage and other bonds and securities, which the vehicles may be forced to sell, remains anemic. At the same time, their ability to finance themselves by issuing short-term loans known as commercial paper has not improved appreciably.
 Investors are waiting for more details to emerge, and weak earnings reports from big banks have clouded any upbeat news, said Alex Roever, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase who has followed the agreement but is not involved in it.
 Any narrowing in the premium that investors demand to hold commercial paper rather than government debt as a result of the fund's creation, he said, ''is not really noticeable.''

HEADLINE: Lehman Pledges $10 Million to Black College

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers said yesterday that it had pledged $10 million to Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, to develop a program that will help send its students to Wall Street. 
 The program is intended to help create a more diversified work force in financial services. According to data provided by nine leading Wall Street banks last year, women, on average, made up 33 percent of the analysts, a job filled mostly by those just out of college. Women represent 25 percent of associates and 14 percent of managing directors.
 There are no specific statistics for how many of those women are black, a number that by all estimates is diminutive. 
 ''The financial services industry has been dominated by white men,'' the president of Spelman, Beverly Daniel Tatum, said. ''Certainly we have had some students pursue careers on Wall Street,'' she said, but most come ''from backgrounds where they have limited exposure to financial services.'' 
 The donation will create the Lehman Brothers Center for Global Finance and Economic Development and finance curriculum and courses, the creation of a scholarship program and recruitment of faculty members. 
 The program will include the creation of a minor course of study, focused on global finance and economic development, that will evolve into a full major over the next several years. Sophomores will attend an ''investment banking boot camp'' to introduce them to a career in finance, and Spelman students will be matched with Lehman mentors.
 Richard S. Fuld Jr., chairman and chief executive of Lehman, said: ''There is a clear need to increase participation of historically under-represented groups in the global financial industry. We are in a unique position to partner with Spelman College to create a new model that will prepare women of African descent for successful careers and leadership in the corporate world.'' 
 The donation is from Lehman Brothers directly, not its foundation, and is its largest grant ever. Lehman has also established partnerships with Harlem Children's Zone in New York, Lehman Brothers Center for Women in Business at the London Business School and Oaklands School in London.
 Wall Street firms, long known for being patrons of the arts, are increasingly donating to universities and underprivileged students to help create a more diversified work force in their industry. Goldman Sachs, for example, donated $2 million this year to endow the Goldman Sachs Leadership chair in civil and human rights at Morehouse College in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: Subprime in Black and White

 BODY:
Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom, black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers, even after controlling for factors such as income, loan size and property location. 
 The Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University released a study this week highlighting a disturbing pattern of racial disparities. Using data gathered by the federal government, the study showed that the 10 New York City neighborhoods with the highest rates of subprime lending in 2005 had black and Hispanic majorities, while the 10 areas with the lowest rates were mainly non-Hispanic white. The higher incidence of subprime lending to borrowers of color held up even when the median income levels of the neighborhoods were comparable. 
 And as The Times's Manny Fernandez reported this week, the Furman findings are consistent with a separate analysis of mortgage data by this paper, which found that high-income blacks and Hispanics in New York City were two to three times more likely than comparable non-Hispanic white borrowers to have subprime loans. 
 Other studies have shown similar racial disparities in Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and other cities.
 The bad news doesn't end there. Neighborhoods where subprime borrowers are concentrated are the same neighborhoods that are now experiencing high rates of default and foreclosure. That's because many subprime loans were not designed to be affordable over the long term, but rather to be refinanced before their initial teaser rates rose. That often hasn't been possible as home values have dropped and credit standards have tightened, leaving borrowers stuck in loans that have become unmanageable. 
 The mortgage lending industry says it's impossible to say that such patterns are the result of discrimination because the federal data do not include so-called risk characteristics like borrowers' credit scores, other debts or how much of a down payment they were able to make. 
 But the burden of proof has to be on the lenders to show that no discrimination has occurred. They have data on the risk characteristics of their borrowers. When the Federal Reserve began in 2004 to require lenders to provide specific data on subprime loans, the industry fought successfully to keep the risk profile of borrowers, including credit scores, under wraps. Now, with indications of discrimination rife, Congress must demand that data be fully disclosed.
 The crisis in subprime lending is already threatening to be a socioeconomic disaster with hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk of losing their homes. Whether there has also been widespread racial discrimination by lenders is a question that lawmakers must confront fully, without delay.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Meets Expectations With a Solid Third Quarter

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported solid quarterly sales and profits yesterday, matching Wall Street's expectations, as the performance of its services business offset weakness in hardware and software.
 The housing-related debt woes in the banking industry did hit International Business Machines in the third quarter, however. Financial services companies are among I.B.M.'s largest customers, and they pulled back from buying mainframe computers and large software packages at the end of the quarter.
 I.B.M. is a bellwether for corporate spending on information technology -- computer hardware, software and services. Investors watch the company's quarterly results closely for signs that capital investment may be flagging, as troubles in the banking sector threaten to slow down the economy as a whole. 
 But Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said there was little evidence of a spillover from the mortgage debt crisis. ''It was a financial services issue and predominantly in the United States,'' Mr. Loughridge said in a conference call with analysts after stock trading closed for the day. ''I don't think this is a general economic issue.''
 Mr. Loughridge said that technology purchases delayed in the third quarter would most likely be made in the current quarter, suggesting that the banking industry's problems would be contained and temporary.
 Yet some analysts said I.B.M.'s results, while an encouraging performance by the company, left lingering doubts about the outlook for technology spending. Leading indicators of a slowdown in technology spending, according to A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, are found in three places: signings of short-term services contracts, software license revenue and hardware purchases.
 All three of those indicators were down for I.B.M. Signings of short-term contracts, those that typically last nine months or less, fell from a year ago -- the only blemish in a strong performance by the services business. Software revenue rose 7 percent, to $4.7 billion, but a number of larger software deals did not close as expected during the quarter.Hardware sales fell 10 percent, to $4.9 billion, in the quarter; mainframe revenue alone dropped 31 percent.
 I.B.M. reported that its revenue rose to $24.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 7 percent from the year-earlier quarter -- or 3 percent after adjusting for currency gains because of the dollar's weakness.
 About 60 percent of the company's sales are outside the United States. Growth was robust in fast-growing markets where I.B.M. has made big investments in recent years, including India, where sales rose 48 percent, and China, up 25 percent.
 I.B.M.'s net income rose 6 percent from a year earlier, to $2.4 billion. Earnings rose 16 percent, to $1.68 a share, up from $1.45 a year ago, when I.B.M. had more shares outstanding. Like many companies, I.B.M. has an aggressive share repurchase program.
 The company's revenues were in line with analysts' estimates, as compiled by Thomson Financial, and earnings came in a penny above the consensus forecast of $1.67 a share.
 I.B.M. said it was comfortable with the estimates of Wall Street analysts for the full year of 2007, which are for revenue of $97.4 billion and earnings of $6.97 a share.
 I.B.M.'s shares fell slightly in after-hours trading. During the regular session, I.B.M. gained $1.57 a share, or 1.3 percent, to close at $119.60 a share. 
 The services business continues to get stronger, with revenue rising 14 percent, to nearly $13.7 billion. I.B.M.'s services business includes such activities as running data centers for customers and using technology and research to streamline corporate operations like procurement and marketing.

HEADLINE: Splitting Up At Scripps; McClatchy Profit Falls

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The E. W. Scripps Company will split itself into two publicly traded companies by separating its faster-growing cable television networks and Web businesses from its newspapers, which have been hurt by falling advertising revenue. 
 The split, announced yesterday and expected to take effect by mid-2008, is another acknowledgment of the nationwide downturn in newspaper advertising. 
 Separately, the McClatchy Company, the publisher of more than 30 daily newspapers including The Miami Herald and The Sacramento Bee, reported a 55 percent drop in profit amid declines in real estate advertising and announced that it would take an undetermined charge against its third-quarter earnings. Revenue was down more than 9 percent. 
 McClatchy is the first major newspaper company this quarter to report earnings, setting the stage for what could be dispiriting results in the next few weeks.
 Scripps had been weighing a separation since the beginning of the year. Analysts reacted well to the decision, saying that they viewed it as an effort to unlock value for shareholders.
 ''Scripps was really viewed as a newspaper company, so it was trading in line with its newspaper peers,'' said Alexia Quadrani, a media analyst at Bear Stearns. ''In reality, the majority of cash flow was coming from higher growth cable and Internet businesses, but they weren't getting any credit for that.''
 Scripps is the second media company to announce a split this month. Two weeks ago, the Belo Corporation said it planned to spin off its newspaper entities into a separate company from its television stations, raising the question of whether Gannett, the largest publisher in the United States by circulation, might consider doing the same.
 ''I think the question is, will Gannett follow? They're one of the few newspaper companies that still have broadcast assets,'' Ms. Quadrani said.
 The successful HGTV and Food Network cable channels, a result of the company's aggressive diversification strategy, will anchor the new company, called Scripps Networks Interactive. It will also include three younger cable television brands and two Internet search businesses.
 ''These are very special assets that in some ways were underappreciated by the markets,'' said Frederick Searby, an analyst at JPMorgan.
 The separate E. W. Scripps Company will maintain the company's traditional assets, including The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis and 17 other newspapers; 10 broadcast television stations; the United Media syndication outlet; and the Scripps Media Center news service.
 The interactive lifestyle brands of the new company are expected to report $1.4 billion in combined annual revenue, significantly more than the legacy company's $1.1 billion.
 Richard A. Boehne, the chief operating officer, will become chief executive of E. W. Scripps, succeeding Kenneth W. Lowe, who will become president of Scripps Networks Interactive.
 ''Scripps believes strongly that local is a very specific media category that will continue to exist,'' Mr. Boehne said. ''Platforms may change over time, but local is a category that should provide enduring value.''
 Scripps shares closed yesterday at $45.93, up 8.6 percent. McClatchy closed at $18.92, down 1.3 percent, and down from $43.03 at the beginning of the year. 
 Scripps and McClatchy had been hit particularly hard by the real estate downturn in Florida and California, where both companies own significant newspaper assets. On Tuesday, Gary Pruitt, McClatchy's chief executive, said he could not foresee an end to the slump.
 ''It's clear the economies of these two markets and perhaps the country as a whole are experiencing a greater slowdown than many had anticipated just a few months ago,'' he said in a statement. ''We do not know when this downturn will end.''

HEADLINE: Foreigners Shedding U.S. Securities

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg News) -- International investors sold a record amount of American securities in August. 
 Total holdings of equities, notes and bonds fell a net $69.3 billion after an increase of $19.2 billion in July, the Treasury Department said Tuesday. None of the dozen economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted the decline, the first since Russia defaulted in 1998.
 Foreigners dumped American assets as mortgage defaults set off a surge in borrowing costs that spurred central banks to flood the banking system with cash and forced the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates.
 Also Tuesday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States rose 0.1 percent in September, restrained by a slump in the auto industry.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Start-Ups Awash in Dollars, Again

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley's math is getting fuzzy again. 
 Internet companies with funny names, little revenue and few customers are commanding high prices. And investors, having seemingly forgotten the pain of the first dot-com bust, are displaying symptoms of the disorder known as irrational exuberance.
 Consider Facebook, the popular but financially unproven social network, which is reportedly being valued by investors at up to $15 billion. That is nearly half the value of Yahoo, a company with 38 times the number of employees and, based on estimates of Facebook's income, 32 times the revenue.
 Google, which recently surged past $600 a share, is now worth more than I.B.M., a company with eight times the revenue.
 More broadly, Internet start-ups are drawing investment based on their ability to build an audience, not bring in revenue -- the very alchemy that many say led to the inflation and bursting of the dot-com bubble. 
 The surge in the perceived value of some start-ups has even surprised some entrepreneurs who are benefiting from it.
 A year ago, Yahoo invested in Right Media, a New York-based company developing an online advertising network. Yahoo's investment valued the firm at $200 million. Six months later, when Yahoo acquired Right Media outright, the purchase price had swelled to $850 million.
 What changed? According to Right Media's chief technology officer, Brian O'Kelley, very little, except that Yahoo's rivals, Microsoft and Google, were writing billion-dollar checks to buy online advertising networks, and Yahoo thought it needed to pay any price to keep up. 
 ''I have to say I giggled,'' Mr. O'Kelley, 30, said of the deal that earned him millions. He has since left Right Media and is starting another company. ''There is no way we quadrupled the value of the company in six months.''
 The trend is described as a return to madness (by skeptics) or as a rational approach to unlimited opportunities presented by the Internet (by true believers). Greed, fear and a desperate rush to pick the next big winner are all adding fuel to the fire that is Silicon Valley's resurgence. 
 ''There's definitely a lot of betting going on, and it's not rational,'' said Tim O'Reilly, a technology conference promoter and book publisher.
 Mr. O'Reilly is credited with coining the phrase ''Web 2.0,'' which refers to a new generation of Web sites that encourage users to contribute material. His Web 2.0 conference, which begins Wednesday in San Francisco, has become a nexus for the optimism around the latest set of society-changing online tools. But that has not stopped Mr. O'Reilly from worrying that the industry is minting too many copycat companies, half-baked business plans and overpriced buyouts. 
 When the bubble inevitably pops, he said, ''there are going to be a lot of people out of work again.''
 Putting a value on start-ups has always been a mix of science and speculation. But as in the first dot-com boom and the recent surge in housing, seasoned financial professionals are seeming to indulge in some strange instinct to turn away from the science and lean instead on the speculation.
 This time around, people indulging in that optimistic thinking are not mom-and-pop investors or day traders but venture capitalists whose coffers are overflowing with money from university endowments and hedge funds. Many of those financial professionals say that this time, everything is different.
 More than 1.3 billion people around the world use the Internet, many with speedy broadband connections and a willingness to immerse themselves in digital culture. The flood of advertising dollars to the Web has become an indomitable trend and a proven way for these start-ups to make money, while the revenue models of the dot-coms of yesteryear were often little more than sleight of hand. 
 ''The environmental factors are much different than they were eight years ago,'' said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital and an early backer of YouTube. ''The cost of doing business has declined dramatically, and traditional media companies have also woken up to the opportunities of the Web.
 ''That does open up the aperture for a different outcome this time,'' he said. 
 Some trace the start of the new bubble to eBay's $3.1 billion acquisition of the Internet telephone start-up Skype in 2005. EBay's chief executive, Meg Whitman, reportedly outbid Google for the company. This month, eBay conceded it had grossly overpaid for Skype by about $1.43 billion, and announced that Niklas Zennstrom, a Skype co-founder, had left the company. 
 Google's acquisition of YouTube last year for $1.65 billion, under similarly competitive bidding, might have accelerated the transition to loftier values. Google executives and many analysts argued that YouTube was well worth the price tag if it became the next entertainment juggernaut.
 It still might. More than 205 million people visit YouTube each month, according to the research firm comScore. Still, Citigroup estimated that YouTube would bring in $135 million in revenue next year. At that rate, YouTube would have to grow considerably to account for just 5 percent of Google's annual revenue of nearly $12 billion.
 ''We are almost going back to year 2000 types of errors,'' said Aaron Kessler, an Internet analyst at Piper Jaffray. Internet companies ''are buying users instead of revenue and profitability,'' he said.
 The Skype and YouTube windfalls helped to give the newest batch of Internet entrepreneurs dreams of improbable wealth. They also brought back practices that had seemingly been discredited during the first boom. For example, in the first dot-com gold rush, Internet companies did not have to make money to acquire serious investments dollars. Now that once again is true. 
 Twitter, a company in San Francisco that lets users alert friends to what they are doing at any given moment over their mobile phones, recently raised an undisclosed amount of financing. Its co-founder and creative director, Biz Stone, says that the company was not currently focused on making money and that no one in the company was even working on how to do so.
 ''At the moment, we're focused on growing our network and our user experience,'' he said. ''When you have a lot of traffic, there's always a clear business model.''
 That is not necessarily illogical in the current climate. A European competitor, Jaiku, which is similarly devoid of a mature business model, was acquired last week by Google for an undisclosed sum. With the competitive logic that prevails at the major Internet companies, the deal might have further raised Twitter's appeal to Google's rivals.
 The high value placed on many start-ups and minimal requirements for financial performance are raising expectations of other entrepreneurs. Sharon Wienbar, managing director of Scale Ventures Partners, an investment firm, cited the $100 million valuation that investors gave to the Internet genealogy site Geni.com, founded last year in Los Angeles by a veteran of PayPal. 
 ''Now every entrepreneur thinks he should get that,'' Ms. Wienbar said. ''I have a feeling a lot of entrepreneurs are secretly meeting for beers on the Peninsula, saying, 'Hey, look what I got.''' 
 Mr. O'Kelley, formerly of Right Media, said other entrepreneurs had begun to think that the financing game is best played by avoiding actual revenues -- since that only limits the imagination of investors. ''It's a screwed-up incentive structure, just like you had in the first bubble,'' he said.
 Another company benefiting from the exuberance is Ning, which allows users to create their own MySpace-style ad-supported social networks. It was recently valued by investors at more than $200 million, mainly because its main backer and founder, Marc Andreessen, has a successful history with the Internet hits Netscape and Opsware.
 Mr. Andreessen argues on his blog that there is no bubble and that the high prices represent a rational desire to stake a claim in the potentially huge markets of the future. But he acknowledges that a seemingly inexhaustible flood of capital into Silicon Valley is helping to power the boom. Venture capitalists are flush with cash from institutional investors, eager for Internet-style returns on their money. 
 ''The upward valuations pressure is the result of decisions being made by people wearing suits in cities like New York and Boston who would never ever meet with start-ups,'' Mr. Andreessen said in an interview. ''If that ever goes away, it will have consequences. But it doesn't look like they will change their minds.''

HEADLINE: Duel Over a Monopoly

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
At first, the Amgen sales director chatted about the hot weather when she called on a small Baltimore chain of kidney dialysis clinics. Then, according to the chain's chief financial officer, she delivered a chilling warning. 
 If the clinics switched from Amgen's anemia drug to a new medicine planned by a big competitor, and then the competing drug was knocked off the market by an Amgen patent lawsuit, the chain might have to pay a much higher price to resume using Amgen's drug. 
 ''And I was like, 'Did I just meet with the mob?''' said Tracey Mooney, the chain's chief financial officer, recalling the July 2006 exchange. Amgen, she said, was effectively threatening to turn her clinics, run by the nonprofit Independent Dialysis Foundation, into a money-losing operation. 
 With the anemia drug accounting for about a third of total costs, she said, Amgen ''can make or break me.'' 
 Amgen would not comment, saying the matter was part of its litigation with the competitor, the Swiss drug giant Roche -- a case that could go to a federal jury in Boston this week. In its legal briefs, Amgen says that any ''alleged threats,'' even if they were made, were inconsequential. 
 But there is nothing inconsequential about the looming clash. Even as Amgen reels from recent safety questions about its anemia drugs, it is bracing for a possible assault by Roche on its franchise, worth $7 billion a year.
 It is a war that will be waged not so much with medical studies as with marketing muscle and bare-knuckles pricing tactics intended to capitalize on the rules of Medicare. And because of quirks in those rules, the product with the higher price might have the competitive edge. 
 Roche says it expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve its drug, Mircera, by Nov. 14. If it reaches the market, Mircera will break the monopoly Amgen has had selling anemia treatments to American dialysis centers since the approval of its drug, Epogen, in 1989. 
 Since then, Amgen has sold more than $25 billion worth of Epogen, including $2.5 billion worth last year. Most of those billions came from Medicare, which pays to treat almost all the nation's 350,000 dialysis patients. Almost everyone whose kidneys stop functioning develops anemia. 
 Mircera would also compete with Amgen's newer anemia drug, Aranesp, which now has even bigger sales than Epogen, and with Procrit, a drug sold by Johnson & Johnson under a license from Amgen. Aranesp and Procrit are used primarily to treat patients with kidney disease who are not on dialysis, as well as patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. Roche is seeking approval of Mircera only as a treatment for kidney disease, not for use in cancer therapy. 
 Amgen's first line of defense is its patent-infringement lawsuit in Boston. Because the judge has already ruled that Mircera infringes one Amgen patent, Roche must convince the jury that the patent itself is invalid. 
 If Roche fails, Mircera might never reach the market. But if Roche prevails, the fight will move out of the courtroom and into the marketplace. 
 According to documents made public in the litigation, both companies have planned for years for their showdown, even conducting ''war games'' in which some executives acted as the competition to develop pricing strategy. 
 A crucial factor in the battle is that dialysis clinics can profit from drugs they administer on site, including the anemia drugs, which are usually infused intravenously during dialysis. The profits come from the difference between the clinics' cost for the drugs and the often higher rates at which Medicare and private insurers reimburse them. Hospitals and doctors' offices can also make money this way. 
 In the past, some drug companies have gamed this system by setting list prices far higher than actual prices, increasing profit for doctors as a way to win their loyalty. Pharmaceutical companies caught rigging the reimbursements in this way have been assessed big fines. Medicare has since changed its rules to greatly reduce the ability of drug companies to ''market the spread,'' as the tactic is known. 
 Medicare now reimburses doctors and clinics for medicines at 6 percent over the drugs' actual average selling price, which is about $170 for an average weekly dose of Epogen. A small dialysis provider might make about $7 on that weekly treatment; a large chain, with bigger discounts from Amgen, could make much more. 
 But there is a six-month lag in calculating the average price. So for the first six months a new product is on the market, Medicare generally reimburses at 6 percent above the wholesale price set by the maker. 
 Documents unsealed as evidence in the litigation indicate that Roche planned to use that six-month period to essentially buy market share by setting a wholesale price that, although a bit lower than Aranesp's official list price, would be about 38 percent higher than Aranesp's current average selling price and 78 percent higher than Epogen's. 
 Roche could then offer big discounts off the wholesale price to clinics, hospitals and kidney centers -- potentially allowing them several times the profit they would get from using Amgen's products. 
 If that happens, Economics 101 would be stood temporarily on its head. Rather than lowering prices, competition would end up raising Medicare's costs, at least for the first six months. 
 Asked about the documents, George B. Abercrombie, the president of Roche's North American pharmaceutical division, said the company had not made a final decision on Mircera's pricing. In a brief filed in the litigation, Roche said it needed to offer discounts to establish itself in the market and bring about competition. 
 Mr. Abercrombie, declining to discuss the first six months, said, ''We believe firmly that our availability will offer competition and will over time bring prices down in this market and save payers money.'' 
 Herb B. Kuhn, the deputy administrator of Medicare, also said competition would kick in after six months. ''New entrants have a profound effect on the downward push on prices,'' he said, ''and we don't see that this would be any different.'' 
 But Amgen, according to internal memos made public in the patent case, debated internally for years about how best to neutralize what it described as Roche's ''unfair pricing advantage.''
 At one point, it even considered taking Epogen off the market for a year -- forfeiting nearly $3 billion in sales -- a period that under the rules would enable Amgen to resume Epogen sales using the same price tactic Roche has considered. Such a move, dialysis providers say, would have created severe medical and business disruptions for the patients and clinics. 
 An Amgen consultant also proposed having the company conduct clinical trials of its own drugs to ''monopolize key trial sites'' and impede Roche's ability to perform the studies it needed for approval. ''Every month we delay'' Roche's drug, the consulting firm, BAI, explained in a slide, is the equivalent of $100 million in extra sales for Amgen. It is not clear whether the idea was put into practice. 
 Amgen was especially worried that Roche would lure away two big dialysis chains, Fresenius and DaVita, which each account for about a third of the dialysis market. So it protected itself by making a pact in fall 2006 with Fresenius. The chain agreed to stay with Amgen exclusively for five years in exchange for additional Epogen discounts and rebates. And Roche was locked out of one-third of the dialysis market. 
 According to an internal Amgen slide, the contract ''spends'' $300 million to ''buy insurance'' against a potential loss of $2.5 billion in business from Fresenius. 
 Ronald Kuerbitz, the chief administrative officer of Fresenius Medical Care North America, said his company agreed to the deal because there was no evidence that Mircera, if it even reached the market, would be medically superior to Epogen. 
 There were ''so many unknowns about CERA,'' he said, using another name for Roche's drug, ''that the smart move was to take the money offered to us, rather than risk that and hope the CERA product would turn out to be a better decision.''
 Another Amgen strategy was to offer hospitals bigger discounts on two other drugs for which it has a virtual monopoly -- Neupogen and Neulasta, both used against the side effects of chemotherapy -- if the hospitals bought most of their anemia drugs from Amgen. 
 Amgen, according to documents, also decided to emphasize to customers that it was confident it would win the patent case, to discourage the clients from switching to Mircera if the drug became available before the case was decided. 
 Roche's antitrust counterclaims in the patent suit are scheduled to be heard in a separate trial starting in December. 
 In legal filings, Amgen argues that its actions were normal competitive practices and that its extra discounts to Fresenius and to some hospitals lowered prices. It also says that even though there are hundreds of dialysis providers, Roche could cite only Ms. Mooney's case and one other instance in which Amgen was said to have threatened reprisals for switching to Mircera. In neither case, Amgen argues, did the supposed threats result in loyalty to Amgen. 
 Indeed, they may have had the opposite effect. 
 ''It's that kind of threatening demeanor of the company that makes me want to go to the competition,'' Ms. Mooney said. Her chain has recently become a paid consultant to Roche, teaching its sales force about the dialysis business.

HEADLINE: After Inquiry, Facebook Agrees to Tougher Safeguards

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
To satisfy New York State prosecutors who accused Facebook Inc., the popular social networking Web site, of falsely advertising itself as a safe online environment, Facebook yesterday agreed to immediately post sterner warnings about the dangers to children using the site and to respond more speedily to complaints from users about inappropriate sexual messages.
 The changes are part of a settlement with the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, whose office last month announced that it had been investigating whether the Web site misled users by promoting itself as a place where minors were safe from sexual predators. 
 Mr. Cuomo said the settlement would serve as a ''new model'' under which law enforcement and Internet companies could work together to protect children and recognize that they share responsibility to police illegal activity online. 
 By using consumer-protection laws to tackle the thorny problem of Internet safety, Mr. Cuomo appears to be building on the tactics of his predecessor, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who used state laws to prosecute fraud on Wall Street.
 ''Any site where you are attracting young people, you must assume you are simultaneously attracting those who would prey on young people,'' Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. ''Whether you are a shoe company or you're an Internet company, consumer protection laws apply.''
 Facebook also agreed to hire an independent company to track its responses to complaints, which it said can range from thousands to tens of thousands per day. The independent monitor will report twice a year to Facebook and the attorney general. 
 ''To the extent that the competitors of Facebook say, 'We have to do this now so we can be competitive with Facebook,' that's a good thing,'' Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference yesterday. He added that his office was talking to other companies with similar social networking sites, but declined to name them. 
 Chris Kelly, Facebook's chief privacy officer, stood beside Mr. Cuomo to announce the deal and called the settlement part of the company's effort to grow while maintaining users' sense of safety and community. ''We actually think we'll end up attracting more people'' because of the new measures, he said.
 Facebook began as a network in which college students could communicate only with other college students, but has since expanded to include 47 million users of all ages. Mr. Kelly said that the company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., believed 80 percent of its users were over 18, but that it had no firm data. Myspace, one of its main competitors, has about 70 million users, and drew attention earlier this year when it said it had removed 29,000 convicted sex offenders from its site.
 Over the summer, investigators from the attorney general's department of economic justice, led by Eric Corngold, posed as teenagers and received sexually suggestive messages from adults within days of posting profiles on Facebook. Complaints about the incidents, made by the investigators via the site's online system, went unanswered for weeks. 
 Prosecutors said the operation demonstrated how Facebook might have been engaging in deceptive practices because it promoted itself online as a place where minors were safer from adult sexual predators than on other social networking sites. 
 Under the agreement, Facebook will clearly state on its site that it cannot guarantee that users will not be subjected to illegal or inappropriate contact. The company will bar children under 13 from the site and suggest that parents consider supervising older children's online activity. It also agreed to create easy-to-find links for consumers to report sexually inappropriate conduct or content on the site, and to act on complaints within 24 hours. 
 Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general in Connecticut, said in a statement yesterday that Web sites needed to take stricter steps, like screening violent or racist content that children could view, requiring identity verification and segregating minors' profiles from those of adults.

HEADLINE: Edwards Plays His Roots Card in Bid to Win South Carolina

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

DATELINE: RIDGELAND, S.C., Oct. 11 

 BODY:
At a dinner held recently by county Democrats here, the master of ceremonies introduced John Edwards, the guest speaker, as the ''native son'' of South Carolina. 
 ''I do understand what is happening in your state,'' Mr. Edwards said when he took the microphone to sustained applause and faced hundreds of people at the dinner, which was held in a school auditorium. ''I understand it because I have lived it. I don't have to read it in a book. Nobody has to explain it to me. I don't have to see it on television. I have lived it. I have seen every single problem and every single challenge that you face here in South Carolina.''
 Mr. Edwards's victory in this state's 2004 Democratic primary gave him a much-needed boost that kept his presidential campaign alive. But this time, polls suggest that Mr. Edwards faces an uphill battle here against his two main opponents, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, who have set up formidable ground operations in this early primary state. 
 Now, as Mr. Edwards's campaign struggles against two better-financed candidates, he is hoping to replicate his 2004 victory by capitalizing on his roots in the state. Though born in South Carolina, Mr. Edwards, the son of a mill worker, was raised in North Carolina and went on to be a senator from there. 
 ''Part of his message is something no one can duplicate; he was born there,'' said Harrison Hickman, Mr. Edwards's pollster. 
 ''In fact, almost 10 percent in exit polls last time said they voted for the candidate who understood the problems peculiar to South Carolina,'' Mr. Hickman said. ''That is something we would hope to capitalize on again.'' 
 Like other Democratic candidates, Mr. Edwards has been focusing more heavily on Iowa, site of the nation's first nominating contest. But last week, in South Carolina to shore up his support, he tailored his message to show that he understood better than any other candidate the concerns of the state's residents. 
 ''I think once my message gets through, people remember that I understand their lives, and I understand it very well,'' Mr. Edwards told reporters, when asked about his poll rankings. ''We'll do well here.'' 
 Mr. Edwards has made 15 trips to South Carolina since declaring his candidacy, compared with 9 by Mr. Obama and 7 by Mrs. Clinton, according to his campaign.
 This time around, Mr. Edwards is trailing for several reasons, Mr. Hickman said. In South Carolina, state polls tend to follow national polls, he said, and voters are mostly exposed to candidates through newspapers and television advertisements. Mr. Edwards has not yet run television advertisements here. 
 ''Voters tend to come to the primary contest later, when the campaign advertising takes off,'' Mr. Hickman said. ''Unlike Iowa and New Hampshire, where every day you can walk outside and see a presidential candidate and strike up a conversation.'' 
 Campaigning here in one of more than 15 campaign stops from Kentucky to Iowa to South Carolina in just over a week, Mr. Edwards forcefully highlighted his message on education, insurance and rural economic development.
 He spoke in Darlington, Summerton, Kingstree and here in Ridgeland -- four towns along a corridor where some people live without plumbing, have lost jobs and are struggling to escape generations of entrenched poverty left over from the sharecropping days.
 At Brown's BBQ in Kingstree, Mr. Edwards went from table to table, where he was received like a regular guy, shaking hands with diners whose plates were loaded with collard greens and fragrant barbecued meat. 
 ''He is straightforward,'' said Jeannette Chambers, 57. ''He seems like he is taking a lot of interest in low- and middle-income families. And he is a Southerner.''
 Mr. Edwards joked with customers as he paid for a takeout meal.
 ''I got an $8 haircut compared with a $400 one,'' John Medley said in a joke referring to a widely mocked haircut that Mr. Edwards had billed his campaign for.
 ''This one cost me nine,'' Mr. Edwards replied, not skipping a beat.
 ''Yours is still higher than mine,'' Mr. Medley said.
 In this state, as elsewhere, Mr. Edwards tried to close the gap between perceptions of his own life and those of the people he addressed.
 ''I am just like you,'' he told hundreds of African-American high school students here, where only 67 percent of the students finish high school in four years and many need financial assistance with meals. ''I grew up the same way you are growing up. I grew up in a small town in the South. We didn't have anything when I was growing up. And now because of some hard work and some luck, I am actually a candidate for president of the United States.''
 Denise Laarhoven, an unemployed mother of four, watched proudly as her son Sherman Dula Jr. stood and asked Mr. Edwards about gasoline prices. But she said she was a Clinton supporter.
 ''I am Southern, but that doesn't mean anything,'' Ms. Laarhoven said. ''Once they get into that White House, they ain't going to worry about us. They're not going to come back here and see us. They are not going to shake our hands, like he did, again.''

HEADLINE: Global Warming Starts to Divide G.O.P. Contenders

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
While many conservative commentators and editorialists have mocked concerns about climate change, a different reality is emerging among Republican presidential contenders. It is a near-unanimous recognition among the leaders of the threat posed by global warming.
 Within that camp, however, sharp divisions are developing. Senator John McCain of Arizona is calling for capping gas emissions linked to warming and higher fuel economy standards. Others, including Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are refraining from advocating such limits and are instead emphasizing a push toward clean coal and other alternative energy sources. 
 All agree that nuclear power should be greatly expanded. 
 The debate has taken an intriguing twist. Two candidates appealing to religious conservatives, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, call for strong actions to ease the effects of people on the climate, at times casting the effort in spiritual terms just as some evangelical groups have taken up the cause.
 The emergence of climate change as an issue dividing Republicans shows just how far the discussion has shifted since 1997, when the Senate voted, 95 to 0, to oppose any international climate treaty that could hurt the American economy or excused China from responsibilities. 
 The debate among Republicans is largely not about whether people are warming the planet, but about how to deal with it. 
 The issue inserted itself into the presidential campaign on Friday with the announcement that Al Gore had won the Nobel Peace Prize for work highlighting the threat posed by climate change. 
 The leading Democratic candidates rushed to praise Mr. Gore, underlying how that party has sought to seize the issue with proposals like higher standards for fuel mileage and taxing emissions of carbon dioxide.
 The issue had been gradually bubbling up among leading Republicans as top corporations, including some in petroleum, have been pushing to address it. 
 Mr. McCain, who acknowledges that he knew little about the climate problem when he sought his party's presidential nomination eight years ago, held a Senate hearing on climate change in 2001 and quickly became a convert to the notion that carbon emissions were warming the planet. 
 In recent years, he has fought to introduce measures for caps on dangerous emissions. Last week, Mr. McCain promised to demand sharply higher fuel standards from the automobile industry. 
 He also promised to have the United States join the international climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, although only on the condition that India and China join, too. Many experts say that condition is unlikely to be met at the moment. 
 ''I don't know what it is going to be like the rest of my life on this planet,'' Mr. McCain said at the Global Warming and Energy Solutions Conference on Saturday in Manchester, N.H. ''But I can tell you this. I have had enough experience and enough knowledge to believe that unless we reverse what is happening on this planet, my dear friends, we are going to hand our children a planet that is badly damaged.''
 Mr. Romney and Mr. Giuliani say little about the potential dangers of climate change and almost nothing about curbing emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. They talk almost exclusively about the need for independence from foreign oil as a necessity for national security.
 Fred D. Thompson, after mocking the threat in April, said more recently that ''climate change is real'' and suggested a measured approach until more was known about it.
 In the tangled Republican race, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney have been much more hesitant to criticize policies of President Bush, who in his two presidential campaigns said that more study of climate change was needed before imposing restrictions on heat-trapping gases. 
 On the campaign trail, Mr. Giuliani has said, ''I do believe there's global warming,'' but in a speech on energy in the summer in Waterloo, Iowa, he had hardly a word about the environment. Instead, he focused on tapping domestic sources of energy, including coal, which is considered a major contributor to global warming.
 ''Ethanol, biodiesel, clean coal, nuclear power, more refineries, conservation,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''There's no one single solution. But each one of these has to be expanded 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent.
 ''America has more coal reserves than Saudi Arabia has oil reserves. Aren't we safer and better off relying on our own coal reserves than on a part of the world that is a threat to us?''
 Mr. Romney has voiced an almost identical theme, with the two candidates saying they will lead an effort to make the United States energy independent that will be on the scale of putting a man on the Moon or the race to build an atomic bomb. 
 To illustrate the commitment to new fuel sources, a clip of Mr. Romney's forum in April in Derry, N.H., has been posted on his campaign's Web site. 
 ''That is much broader than one form of fuel like ethanol,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I believe we have to be developing more energy sources ourselves, which would include offshore drilling and drilling in ANWR, nuclear power, biodiesel, biofuel, ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, probably liquefied coal. We have enormous supplies of coal.''
 Mr. McCain said in his speech on Saturday that he wanted to push for alternative fuels, but he implied that more needed to be done to protect the environment.
 One priority, he said, would be to establish ''cap and trade,'' a system in which corporations are essentially rewarded for deep cuts in harmful emissions. 
 Mr. McCain has written a bill on that and forced two votes, losing both. 
 In addition to calling for improved fuel efficiency, which he repeated last week in a speech in Detroit, Mr. McCain said he supported an effort to develop an automobile battery that can travel 150 to 200 miles without a charge and would finance the research and development for that. 
 The senator opposes a measure that many environmentalists desire, a carbon tax, most likely as another gasoline tax. He told the warming and energy conference that he generally opposed new taxes but that he also believed that poor workers who tended to commute to work longer distances would be disproportionately affected.
 Mr. McCain said it took a few months of hearings as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee after the 2000 election for him to realize the threat from climate change. Asked about Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Romney's commitment to energy independence, he said voters should look at their records.
 ''What were they doing in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006?'' Mr. McCain asked.

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan Gains a Tenant, but Merrill Lynch May Leave

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The NCR Corporation, the data processing giant and the largest maker of automated teller machines, announced yesterday that it is moving its executive office from Dayton, Ohio, to a new skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who spent more than two years wooing the company, hailed NCR's decision to lease the 35th floor at 7 World Trade Center as the latest indication of Lower Manhattan's resurgence as an international financial capital. 
 But NCR's move involves only 200 employees, and its headquarters will remain in Dayton. Its announcement comes at the same time that the investment bank Merrill Lynch, which has about 10,000 employees in Lower Manhattan, is considering moving north to a new skyscraper opposite Pennsylvania Station. 
 A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the company expects to decide by the end of the month.
 State officials are optimistic that Merrill Lynch will either expand at its current site in the World Financial Center or move to a skyscraper that would be built nearby at ground zero. But the investment bank also has its eye on a site farther uptown, the Hotel Pennsylvania, across Seventh Avenue from Penn Station. 
 ''NCR's decision to relocate its executive offices to the World Trade Center site is a vindication of the strategy we've been pursuing all year,'' said Avi Schick, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. ''Of course, Merrill is the big fish. We hope to reel that one in soon.''
 Mr. Schick and the Spitzer administration have taken the position that Merrill Lynch should remain downtown, where it could get tens of millions of dollars in incentives and tax breaks. The state has insisted that it would not provide Merrill Lynch with any incentives or subsidies to move uptown. 
 Defying predictions of a collapse of the downtown financial district after Sept. 11, thousands of new residents and jobs have moved there in the past few years. Goldman Sachs is now building a new headquarters across West Street from ground zero. 
 And earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase and Governor Spitzer announced that bank's plans to build a $2 billion investment banking headquarters for 7,000 employees at the corner of Church and Liberty Streets. If Merrill Lynch joins them, Speaker Silver, who represents Lower Manhattan, said it would ensure the area's position as a financial center for the next 50 years.
 Merrill Lynch currently occupies 222 Broadway and Tower 2 at the World Financial Center, but its lease expires in 2013. Under one proposal, the landlord, Brookfield Properties, would enlarge three floors at the base of Tower 2 to allow for 80,000 square feet of trading floors. Under a second option, Merrill Lynch would build a 2.4-million-square-foot building at the World Trade Center site.
 But Merrill Lynch has told state and city officials that the Pennsylvania Hotel site, which is owned by Vornado Realty Trust, would allow them to build even larger trading floors and to own the building. The site, however, sits over train tracks, posing an engineering and security challenge. It must also be rezoned for a commercial skyscraper, a process that could take a year.
 In recent weeks, Merrill Lynch has been bargaining with state and city officials over location and a subsidy package. In 1997, the city gave Merrill Lynch a benefit package worth at least $27.6 million after the company threatened to move employees to New Jersey.
 ''What we need more than anything else is the contiguous space that allows for 70,000-to-80,000-square-foot trading floors comparable to what we have in London and Tokyo,'' said Jason Wright, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch. ''If we don't have that, we'd consider ourselves to be at a competitive disadvantage in New York.''
 Speaker Silver, however, said he was hopeful that Merrill Lynch would remain downtown. ''I think we're getting close,'' he said. ''I think we'll succeed.''

HEADLINE: The World Bank, the Little-Noticed Big Money Manager

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the seventh floor of an office building near the White House, dozens of traders are sitting at computer terminals, studying global trends in currencies, commodities and interest rates, looking for ways to maximize returns for one of the world's biggest money market funds.
 But this is the trading floor at the World Bank, best known for tapping government coffers to fight poverty. Less well understood, the bank also oversees $55 billion in readily tradable assets in its own portfolio and those of governments and groups that have asked the bank to manage their assets.
 Like any big corporation's treasury department, the bank employs modern Wall Street hedging techniques like currency and interest rate swaps to protect its own funds. Increasingly, it also helps poor countries by supplying risk-management services or acting as a partner in their hedging activities -- sometimes in competition with Wall Street banks.
 Now, Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank since July, wants to expand these efforts further to help poor countries make their money work harder, supplementing its traditional programs to fight poverty, disease and wretched living conditions. 
 This week Mr. Zoellick will be outlining his priorities when he meets in Washington with finance officials from around the globe at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Bank officials say his mission to leverage the bank's capital by sharing its risk-management skills and increasing lending to countries like China and India -- the so-called middle-income countries -- and the private sector will be a highlight of his debut on the international stage. 
 ''I want us to be better partners with our clients by offering financing services and knowledge services so they can develop their own markets and their own expertise,'' Mr. Zoellick said in an interview. ''We've got the capital at the World Bank, and we can leverage it more effectively.'' 
 When three provinces in Colombia, for example, borrowed dollars from the bank, they entered into a currency swap with the bank to protect the value of their loan for projects that had to be paid in pesos. The bank is generally using such swaps to make it easier for a variety of countries to set up bond markets in their own currencies. 
 Bank officials say a coffee-exporting country might do a commodities swap with the bank to protect itself against price fluctuations in coffee. Or a Southeast Asian country taking out yen loans from Japan for an aid project, but getting paid in dollars from its exports, might ask the World Bank for a currency swap that hedges the risk in converting its earnings to repay the loan. 
 Since taking office, Mr. Zoellick -- a former trade envoy, diplomat and Goldman Sachs executive -- has called for the bank to do more in this area as part of a general theme that the bank can stretch itself to become more relevant in a world where poor countries can turn to a lot of places for loans.
 In a speech last week, the new president said the bank's main priorities would be combating poverty, speeding aid to countries torn by war, promoting regional cooperation to combat disease and climate change, aiding the Arab world and providing technical assistance. 
 But the leveraging of assistance to middle-income countries that is, as he puts it, ''faster, better and cheaper'' than its aid in the past is likely to be Mr. Zoellick's signature issue, along with his determination to tap revenues from loans to these countries and private sector businesses for use by the poorest countries. For example, the arm of the bank that aids private sector projects has helped private Chinese companies issue corporate bonds. 
 Critics say that Mr. Zoellick is simply looking for ways to expand the World Bank's role when he should be shrinking it and focusing on helping the poorest of the poor countries. China sits on more than a trillion dollars in reserves and even has its own multibillion-dollar aid program with projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
 ''The bank should not be involved in lending to countries that can get credit on their own,'' said Ian Vasquez, director of the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group in Washington. ''In employing these risk-management strategies, the bank is displacing market actors. It should not be using taxpayer money -- which is where the money comes from -- for those purposes.''
 Mr. Zoellick rejects such criticism as reflecting a misunderstanding of what ''middle income'' poor countries like China and India need and want.
 ''They want our financial services as well as our knowledge on poverty, energy, health and education,'' he said. ''These countries want our expertise, and it makes sense to package that expertise with services in asset and liability management.''
 Mr. Zoellick's efforts were also met with some skepticism at the Treasury Department when he laid out his agenda. One area he mentioned, officials said, was for the bank to provide disaster insurance to poor countries to protect against floods or drought. According to bank and Treasury officials, there were some concerns that the bank would be competing with big commercial and investment banks that offer these services.
 But various officials said Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who helped choose Mr. Zoellick for the job after Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy defense secretary, resigned in the wake of an ethics scandal, backed him and his proposals enthusiastically.
 Mr. Zoellick said the bank was going only where the private banks were not ready to go. 
 ''This idea of competing with the private sector is more theoretical than real,'' he said. ''In my time at Goldman Sachs, I never once heard anyone mention any concern about competition with the World Bank.''
 Many investment bankers agree, saying that even if private sector institutions lost business to the World Bank, they would more than make up for it in the long run once countries are weaned off the World Bank's aid.
 ''I would say, 'More power to you, Mr. Zoellick,''' said Antoine van Agtmael, chairman of Emerging Markets Management, a consulting firm, who is widely credited with coining the term ''emerging markets'' several years ago.
 ''I have heard that some investment banks are whining about losing business,'' Mr. Van Agtmael said. ''What they should think about is the new business that the World Bank is creating for them in the future.''
 The World Bank's entry into the arena of swaps and other hedging strategies is only one way that Mr. Zoellick wants to leverage bank resources. He also hopes to use the income earned by lending to middle-income countries and businesses in poor countries to pay for poverty programs.
 In September, Mr. Zoellick persuaded the bank's board to tap $3.5 billion in revenue from the middle- income-country lending facility and the private-sector- lending facility to help pay for an ambitious effort to raise nearly $40 billion for programs for the poorest countries in the next three years.
 ''That was not an easy decision for the board,'' said a bank official, speaking anonymously because the discussions were confidential. ''The emerging countries on the board were worried that his strategy would be an excuse for rich countries not to deliver the aid that they promised.''
 The World Bank, established at the end of World War II to help European countries get back on their feet, has mobilized more than a trillion dollars for aid programs in more than 60 years of existence.
 The bank aids middle-income poor countries by borrowing money at low cost with its triple-A credit rating, and then lending at a slightly higher rate. Mr. Zoellick recently cut interest rates charged to the middle-income countries. While that means lower returns on those loans, bank officials hope those countries will borrow more, thus increasing funds available to poor countries.

HEADLINE: Financial Issues Lead the Market Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street sank for a second consecutive day yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the slumping housing market remained a ''significant drag'' on the economy.
 Mr. Bernanke's speech on Monday night in New York elevated concerns that the summer's credit tightness might persist into the winter -- a sobering thought for investors who are sifting through mixed third-quarter earnings and watching energy costs rise.
 ''First of all, the worry is we're getting more bad news on housing. No. 2 is higher oil prices. That's a pretty bad combination,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. 
 Crude oil prices rose above $88 in intraday dealing before settling at $87.61, another record, and a National Association of Home Builders index that tracks expectations of future home sales fell for the eighth month, to the lowest point since January 1985.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 71.86 points, or 0.51 percent, to 13,912.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 10.18 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,538.53, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index lost 16.14 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,763.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gave up 6.01 points, or 0.72 percent, ending the session at 823.35.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outpaced those advancing by a margin around 5 to 2 on light volume of 1.29 billion shares.
 A day after Citigroup reported a steep third-quarter profit decline and announced plans with other banks to set up a fund to support the credit markets, more banks released disappointing results. Wells Fargo shares fell nearly 4 percent after the bank said third-quarter earnings increased less than analysts had expected and it increased its loan-loss reserves in preparation for more problems in consumer credit. KeyCorp declined nearly 6 percent after posting a 33 percent drop in profit. U.S. Bancorp also reported a dip in third-quarter earnings.
 Nasdaq stocks could get a boost today, though: Intel and Yahoo posted better-than-expected quarterly results after the bell yesterday, and their stocks rose after hours. I.B.M., which reported a 6 percent increase in third-quarter profit, rose $1.57, to $119.60. After hours, the shares fell $1.80, to $117.80.
 Edward Yardeni, an economist who runs Yardeni Research in Great Neck, N.Y., said, ''The first batch of earnings news for the third quarter gives some reason for concern, particularly for the banks, who are probably going to continue to have problems with their own portfolios.''
 A couple of bright spots in the financial industries were State Street, a trust bank that posted a profit rise of 29 percent on strong revenue from servicing fees and trading services, and Bear Stearns. The investment arm of the Chinese cabinet is planning a bid for a stake in the brokerage house. State Street rose $5.75, to $74.68; Bear Stearns advanced $2.36, to $123.05.
 Bond prices rose as investors pulled money out of stocks. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 8/32, to 100 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.65 percent from 4.68 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills.

HEADLINE: Paulson Sees Deeper Housing Woes

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. acknowledged on Tuesday what home builders and debt-loaded homeowners have felt for the last year: The meltdown in housing is worse than expected and has not yet hit bottom.
 ''The housing decline is still unfolding, and I view it as the most significant current risk to the economy,'' Mr. Paulson said on Tuesday in a combative speech at Georgetown University in which he called for changes by mortgage lenders, credit rating agencies and Wall Street investment banks that had resold mortgages to investors around the world.
 ''The longer housing prices remain stagnant or fall, the greater the penalty to our future economic growth,'' he warned. 
 But even as Mr. Paulson highlighted a number of underlying problems he wanted to fix, he was cautious about proposing specific changes and warned against flatly prohibiting some of the mortgage industry's most-criticized practices.
 ''We need to strike a careful balance of providing consumer protection without limiting overall credit availability,'' he said. He acknowledged that he had learned of ''shameful'' behavior by mortgage brokers, but he defended the use of two practices that Democratic lawmakers and some housing advocacy groups want to prohibit: hidden brokerage fees, which push up a person's interest rate, and prepayment penalties, which lock people into expensive subprime loans for two or three years. 
 ''There are clearly circumstances in which any one of these features can make sense for the borrower,'' Mr. Paulson said, echoing what industry lobbyists have said for years in defending their practices.
 Mr. Paulson delivered his speech at a time when the housing downturn and credit crunch have moved to the top of the political agenda in Congress. On Tuesday, the National Association of Homebuilders' index of sentiment among home builders dropped to its lowest point since it was started 22 years ago.
 Industry experts and administration officials predict that hundreds of thousands of people with subprime loans were likely to likely to lose their homes over the next year or so. Mr. Paulson predicted that foreclosure proceedings would begin on one million homes this year.
 As Democratic lawmakers accuse the Bush administration of being too slow in reacting and propose measures of their own, Mr. Paulson has become the administration's point man on the issue as well as its liaison with Democrats.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Paulson seemed intent on laying out a broad and pragmatic agenda. He suggested areas in which the administration might be able to resolve long-standing differences with Democrats, like expanding the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage finance companies.
 But he carefully resisted a number of Democratic proposals, including those that could make it possible for homeowners to sue Wall Street firms for mortgages that turned out badly.
 The Treasury secretary expressed concern about the difficulties faced by borrowers who try to renegotiate loan terms, because most subprime mortgages are bundled into securities and sold by anonymous investors. But his main proposal was a voluntary alliance of mortgage-servicing companies that would try to reach out to homeowners before they fell behind on payments.
 Several Democratic lawmakers praised Mr. Paulson for highlighting important problems, but complained that the Bush administration was moving too slowly.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said 400,000 foreclosure filings had taken place in the last two months. 
 ''Every week, the administration moves closer to what many of us say is needed, but they do it so slowly, so haltingly, that they keep falling behind,'' Mr. Schumer said in a conference call on Tuesday with reporters. 
 Mr. Paulson made it clear that he was dissatisfied with what had happened in the marketplace and that he wanted to push for change. But on many issues, he stopped short of advocating proposals of his own. 
 He sharply criticized credit rating agencies that had failed to recognize the risks in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities. But he tiptoed around the issue that many analysts have argued is a central conflict of interest for rating agencies: that they earn their fees for evaluating a new security offering only after the offering has been sold to investors.
 Mr. Paulson mentioned the issue, saying that ''we must examine the role of credit rating agencies, including transparency and potential conflicts of interest.''

HEADLINE: Turkey Resolves To Give Go-Ahead For Raids in Iraq

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU and SABRINA TAVERNISE. 
Sebnem Arsu reported from Istanbul, and Sabrina Tavernise from Amman, Jordan.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Turkey's Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to authorize sending troops into northern Iraq to confront Kurdish rebels in hide-outs there, sending an angry message to the Baghdad government and its Washington sponsor. But Turkey, a member of NATO, made it clear that it would not immediately carry out the resolution. 
 The 507-to-19 vote was the culmination of months of frustration here with the United States, which has criticized Kurdish rebels who attack Turkey from Iraq but has failed to get its Kurdish allies in Iraq to act against them. President Bush on Wednesday reiterated American wishes for a diplomatic solution. 
 The vote to authorize sending troops, which Turkish officials say gives them up to a year to take action, was, in essence, a blunt request for the United States to acknowledge Turkey's status as an important ally in a troubled and complex region. 
 ''We're at a point that our patience has run out,'' said Cemil Cicek, a government spokesman and a member of Turkey's Special Council Combating Terrorism. With Turkey central to oil transit in the region, United States crude oil futures soared to an all-time high of $89 a barrel on Wednesday, Reuters reported, though prices later dropped. 
 The vote came as relations between the countries were strained by a House committee's passage last week of a bill calling the World War I-era mass killing of Armenians an act of genocide. In a nod to Turkey's importance as an ally in Iraq, Congressional leaders began to back away on Wednesday from a commitment to hold a vote on that bill. 
 ''We are at a defining moment in Turkish-American relations,'' said Morton Abramowitz, the American ambassador to Turkey during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, commenting on the Turkish vote. ''This is a very big warning sign to the Americans and to the Iraqi Kurds.''
 Security experts here and in the United States agreed that Turkey was unlikely to cross the United States with a full-scale military operation. Still, the government is closer than it has been in years to military action of some sort, embarrassed into acting by a public angry over mounting deaths and what is seen as American inaction. 
 More than two dozen Turks, some of them civilians, have been killed in cross-border rebel attacks in the past several weeks, and the powerful Turkish military which, unlike the government, has long been pressing for action, is fanning public anger. 
 Along Turkey's border with Iraq on Wednesday, Gen. Ilker Basbug, commander of the Turkish land forces, told villagers in Besagac that the killing of 12 Turks in late September by Kurdish rebels was ''a crime against humanity,'' according to Turkey's official Anatolian News Agency.
 ''We share your grief,'' he said.
 The vote itself drew responses from the leaders of three countries -- the United States, Syria and Iraq -- and set off a flurry of diplomacy as officials in several countries worked strenuously to avert military action. 
 ''We are making it very clear to Turkey that we don't think it is in their interests to send troops into Iraq,'' Mr. Bush said. ''There's a better way to deal with the issue than having the Turks send massive troops into the country.''
 He said Turkish troops were already in Iraq, a reference to the small number of soldiers based at observation posts near the border, which is loosely controlled by Iraqi Kurdish forces but is largely porous. The United States does not have troops stationed there but it controls the airspace. 
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq, in a 30-minute phone conversation on Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said, ''Let's do whatever is necessary together,'' the Anatolian News Agency said.
 But Turkish officials say that recent diplomatic efforts have failed. Turkey signed a security agreement with Iraq in September, but since then, killings by Kurdish rebels, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K., have only risen. 
 ''The government has been bringing the P.K.K. issue in at every high-level meeting with the U.S., but we have achieved nothing in the last five years,'' said Egeman Bagis, a lawmaker and Erdogan adviser. ''The Armenian resolution has come as the last straw of the disappointment.''
 He and others argue that Turkey supports the United States in fighting its war on militancy in Iraq -- 70 percent of American air cargo for Iraq travels through Turkey -- but that the Americans have not reciprocated, even though they formally occupy the area in question. 
 ''The U.S. must realize the seriousness of this situation and Turkey's determination to root out terrorism,'' said a lawmaker, Nihat Ergun, during the debate. ''Iraq has become a stomping ground for terrorists.''
 Once considered a dutiful follower of United States policies, Turkey no longer shies away from talks with world leaders the United States opposes. Turkey signed a preliminary agreement on buying natural gas from Iran, a deal harshly criticized by the Bush administration last month.
 The response to Wednesday's vote underscored that new independence, with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, an antagonist of the United States with his own Kurdish minority, weighing in on the issue after official meetings in Ankara, the Turkish capital. 
 ''We certainly support and back the decisions by the Turkish government in combat against terror and terror activities,'' Mr. Assad said. 
 He also took a swipe at the Bush administration: ''It is important to note that the powers that have invaded Iraq are those primarily responsible for the terror activities and attacks because they control the country.''
 The vote places Mr. Erdogan in a delicate position. He was skeptical of the Turkish military's desire for offensive action last spring, but he is now advocating it himself in what Turkish political analysts characterized as a last-ditch effort to press the United States and its closest allies in Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds, to act.
 ''Nobody wants to go there, there is no point to do so, but the parliament's motion is a good diplomatic tool in relations with the U.S.,'' said Mehmet Altan, a political analyst.
 As the policy grinds forward, Mr. Erdogan may find himself making decisions that go against Turkey's own interests in the region. Mr. Abramowitz cited Incirlik, the American air base in southern Turkey, as an example. Taking away American access to the base, one potential consequence of Turkish anger over American policy, would undermine Turkey's interest in keeping Iraq intact, he said.
 Mr. Erdogan, who played down plans for military action on Tuesday, gave few new clues on Wednesday, saying, ''What matters is what Parliament has said,'' Reuters reported. 
 Turkey has not carried out a raid into Iraq since the American invasion in 2003, and it is uncertain what type of operation Turkey would choose. It made several large-scale raids in the 1990s, under a deal with Saddam Hussein, most recently in 1997 with more than 40,000 troops, but security experts said a small commando strike was more likely.
 But what happens next depends more on the United States and its Iraqi Kurdish allies, Mr. Abramowitz said. Mr. Erdogan will try to leverage the new permission to press them into action. 
 On Wednesday, the reactions seemed like more of the same. 
 ''We hope the wisdom of our friend Prime Minister Erdogan will be so active that there will be no military intervention,''said President Jalal Talabani of Iraq, a Kurd, who was on a visit to Paris, Agence France-Presse said. 
 Barham Salih, the Kurdish deputy prime minister of Iraq, in London on an official visit, struck a tone similar to that of Mr. Bush. 
 ''Threats are not useful,'' he said, according to Bloomberg News. A Turkish raid ''will have serious implications for Iraq, Turkey and for our bilateral relationships.''
 ''It will not be helpful to anybody,'' he added.
 The consequences of a large-scale raid would be severe. Turkey is seeking acceptance into the European Union, a bid that would probably be seriously harmed if it invaded. The northern Kurdish region in Iraq is a bright spot for the United States in its enterprise there, with a booming economy, bustling with Turkish companies, and a functioning political system. 
 Mr. Bagis said there would be no offensive if action was taken against Kurdish rebels in the northern region and if Congress dropped the Armenian genocide bill.

HEADLINE: Core Inflation Remains Steady, Presenting a Puzzle to the Fed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Hopes that the Federal Reserve will again cut interest rates at the end of the month were further reduced yesterday after a report showed inflation holding steady in September. But a worsening housing slump and a mixed economic outlook could put the Fed in a difficult spot as it considers what steps to take in the months ahead.
 Prices of consumer goods ticked up 0.3 percent in September, a slightly higher-than-expected increase that reversed a 0.1 percent decline in August. The Consumer Price Index's core rate, a gauge of inflation that excludes relatively volatile food and energy prices, held at 0.2 percent, where it has been since June, the Labor Department said yesterday. 
 The report suggests that pricing pressures have remained in check. But the Fed, always wary of inflation risks, prefers a slower rate of 1 percent to 2 percent. Overall inflation was up 2.8 percent compared with September 2006, its highest 12-month growth rate since March. Higher prices for rent, gasoline and food, especially fruit and vegetables, led the increase as consumers began to feel the effects of surging oil prices and a weaker dollar.
 The inflation picture, coupled with recent reports that have indicated a more resilient economy than analysts expected, makes it more likely the Fed will keep rates unchanged when it issues its decision on Oct. 31. 
 But upward pressure on prices may offer conflicting evidence for the Fed's rate-setting committee, analysts said. The Fed has signaled that it is willing to make additional cuts to jump-start growth, especially if economic conditions worsen in the fourth quarter. But an increased risk of higher prices could give pause to the central bankers, who tend to be wary of igniting inflation through rate cuts. 
 ''It is much more difficult to weed inflation out of the economy than it is to revive an economy that's in trouble,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, a research firm in Princeton, N.J. ''Labor costs have been growing, and that's squeezing profit margins. Then we've got a falling dollar and record high oil prices. All of this tells us that inflation pressures are likely to build in the future.''
 A survey of business and economic conditions released yesterday by the Fed warned of ''upward pressure'' on prices across the country, pushed along by higher food prices and more expensive imports. 
 The report, known as the beige book, also noted a slowdown in job growth, manufacturing activity and consumer spending. Businesses said that overall expansion was ''mixed'' and ''modest,'' and many executives said they were uncertain about how they would fare in the fourth quarter.
 Much of the uncertainty stems from the ailing housing market, which continues to decline. There were fewer groundbreakings in September than in any other month in the last 14 years, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. New housing projects dropped more than 10 percent, to an annual pace of 1.3191 million, falling short of even reduced expectations. That news did not seem likely to improve any time soon: housing permits declined 7.3 percent last month, a substantial slowing from a 4.8 percent drop in August.
 Fed bankers and staff members will now watch to determine whether the housing turmoil bleeds into the broader economy, while also keeping an eye on inflation levels. 
 ''They're in a tough spot right now because they still have the inflation to deal with, yet they're looking at third- and fourth-quarter earnings that are supposed to be weaker than expected,'' said Ryan D. Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management.
 The Fed next meets Oct. 30-31 and then on Dec. 11, making predictions what it will do a chancy matter. And yesterday's reports, while worrisome to some analysts, are unlikely to sway the prevailing belief that the Fed will keep its current target for the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 4.75 percent at the end of the month.
 The central bankers have seen recent signs of strength, like a strong September jobs report and a pickup in retail sales, which indicates an increase in consumer spending. The trade deficit narrowed in August and is now at its lowest level since January; exports were also up.
 And September's plunge in housing starts, while painful, was hardly surprising. Top officials seemed to foreshadow the statistics in speeches early this week. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Monday night that housing problems would create a ''significant drag'' on domestic economic growth into next year, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, also warned of continuing turmoil in the housing market.
 Some investors betting on the Fed's actions yesterday increased the prospects of a quarter-point cut at the next meeting. But other investors and analysts said the futures market had simply overreacted to the weak housing data. 
 The Fed ''wants to tell the market that they have the flexibility to move if needed, but they certainly don't want to lay the foundation for additional moves,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn. ''My call is for them to stand pat.''

HEADLINE: Taxes in Developed Nations Reach 36% of Gross Domestic Product

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
After dipping briefly in the first years of this decade, taxes are growing again around the world, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said yesterday.
 Taxes in 2005 equaled the previous peak year of 2000, the organization said, when by one measure 36.2 percent of gross domestic product in 30 industrial countries, including the United States, went to taxes at all levels of government.
 The organization, which is based in Paris, said that when final figures are in for 2006, they will most likely show a new peak. 
 The report defines taxes as ''compulsory, unrequited payments to general government.''
 The cost of government has risen by about 20 percent since 1975, when taxes accounted for less than 30 percent of the gross domestic product of the organization's member countries. 
 The increase in the ratio of taxes to gross domestic product since 2000 occurred despite cuts in tax rates in most of the countries, said Christopher Heady, head of tax policy for the organization.
 But even with reduced corporate tax rates, Mr. Heady said that worldwide corporate profits had risen so sharply since 2002 that the amount of money flowing into government coffers had increased.
 He attributed most of the long-term rise in taxes to expanded social insurance programs, like universal health care and pensions.
 Mr. Heady said two forces were at work in the rising proportion of taxes to economic activity. 
 One was an upturn in world economic activity since 2002, and especially a sharp rise in corporate profits. The second factor, he said, was that while many countries cut tax rates, the cuts were made in a way that subjected more individual income to tax at the highest, albeit reduced, rates. 
 C. Eugene Steuerle, an Urban Institute tax economist who served as a policy adviser in the Reagan administration, said that the rise in tax receipts as a share of economic activity was not likely to last if tax rates remained unchanged.
 ''Growing inequality of income has added to tax collection,'' Dr. Steuerle said, ''but it is unclear how much of that will continue, because it can't.''
 Dr. Steuerle said the surge of revenue had helped politicians around the world put off dealing with looming future government liabilities for government-financed pensions and health care.
 The greatest increase in the share of economic output going to taxes since 1975 was in Turkey and Spain, the organization said. 
 In Turkey, taxes more than doubled, to 32.5 percent of gross domestic product, while in Spain they nearly doubled to 36.7 percent, the O.E.C.D. calculated. 
 Only in the Netherlands did the share of national income going to taxes decline, down by 1.7 percentage points, to 39.5 percent of the economy.
 In Italy, taxes grew from 25.4 percent of gross domestic product in 1975 to 42.7 percent last year. 
 A trend away from consumption taxes is also under way, Mr. Heady said, despite evidence that such taxes tend to have less of a dampening effect on economic growth than income taxes and, especially, corporate income taxes.
 ''The results we have to date,'' Mr. Heady added, indicate ''countries grow faster, all else being equal, if they make greater use of consumption taxes.'' But he pointed to the United States as a paradox, noting that it has had real economic growth for more than a quarter-century even though it relies very little on consumption taxes.
 ''There is some evidence that countries with higher tax-to-G.D.P. ratios grow somewhat slower and have lower G.D.P. per head, controlling for other factors, but this is not a very clear relationship,'' he said.
 As an example, he cited Sweden, which ''has the highest tax-to-G.D.P. ratio in the O.E.C.D., just over 50 percent, and yet it is one of the O.E.C.D. countries with the strongest economic performance over the past 20 years or so.''
 That example, he said, showed that ''a lot depends on how this money is spent.''
 ''Governments can spend money for all sorts of different purposes -- they can spend in ways that encourage economic growth, improve the infrastructure, but there are obviously ways of government spending that does not promote growth,'' Mr. Heady said.
 Taxes in the United States -- from the federal income tax and Social Security tax to local property levies -- rose to 28.2 percent in 2006, from 25.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1975, the O.E.C.D. said. It reported that American taxes peaked at 29.9 percent in 2000, slipped to 26 percent in 2004 and then began rising again, a finding consistent with recent statistical tables released by the Internal Revenue Service.

HEADLINE: Housing Downturn Takes Big Toll on Cities' Revenue

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting from New York, and Catrin Einhorn from Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Suddenly everyone wants more from Chicago's taxpayers. 
 Mayor Richard M. Daley asked last week for a 15 percent jump in the property tax. Todd H. Stroger, the president of Cook County's board, called on Wednesday for increases in sales, gasoline and parking taxes. And all that does not even begin to address ways of keeping the financially troubled bus and train systems running.
 While Chicago's case may be extreme, it is by no means unique. Across the country, local governments are feeling a financial strain driven largely by the nation's real estate downturn. City finance officers predict slowing revenue even as they remain under pressure to keep spending, especially in areas like health care and pensions, according to an annual survey by the National League of Cities. 
 To handle budget deficits they now expect, many cities are increasing fees for services, and some are considering raising property taxes, said the report, to be released Thursday.
 ''We know what's coming here,'' said one author, Christopher W. Hoene, director of policy and research for the National League of Cities. ''If the housing market continues to flatten out or even decline, we're in for some tough times for cities.''
 The signs are all around, in flattening property assessments (which mean flattening property tax revenue) as well as rising mortgage foreclosures, which also bode poorly for revenue collections. 
 In Milwaukee, where a new budget proposal would cut the number of firefighters on some ladder trucks, the value of residential property had been increasing an average of about 13 percent a year since 2001. But those increases slowed sharply during 2006, said Mark P. Nicolini, the city's budget and management director. 
 In Palm Beach County, Fla., foreclosures rose to 4,830 in 2006 from 3,049 in 2005. And in just the first eight months of this year, the number hit 7,544, said Sharon R. Bock, the county's comptroller and clerk. Vacant job positions in Ms. Bock's office are going unfilled, and ''it could get worse,'' she said. 
 In Cleveland, revenue from building permits has fallen about $450,000 short of projections this year. Further, foreclosures have limited the city's ability to borrow money, because municipalities borrow against the assessed value of their property base, said Sharon A. Dumas, the director of finance. Cleveland had hoped to borrow about $45 million this year for capital projects, Ms. Dumas said, but now the number will most likely be closer to $35 million.
 For the moment, she said, the city is finding relief in an unlikely place: baseball. Taxes on tickets for the Cleveland Indians' postseason games against New York and Boston could bring in more than $1 million. 
 In interviews, some city and county budget officials said the direct effects of the housing downturn could have a lag time of several years when it comes to local government revenue, whose level depends on property reassessments. Some pointed to factors particular to their cities -- a loss of state aid, perhaps, or legislation limiting local property tax collections -- as more dire. 
 ''In some respects, this may be a correction,'' Mr. Nicolini, of Milwaukee, said of the real estate decline. ''If the job market stays relatively strong, it's less of a concern. But if the trend were to continue, then it gets worrisome.''
 Even in New York, where revenue has soared the last several years, officials have been predicting a slowdown and are preparing for belt-tightening. The anticipated falloff is due in large part to lower expected profits on Wall Street and a projected decline in real estate transactions, rich sources of tax revenue.
 ''The good times don't go on forever,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday, ''and while I don't think we're going to have a recession in this city, I think it's probably true that we will have a slowdown in economic activity, a slowdown in tax revenues.''
 The report from the National League of Cities was based on responses from finance officers in 359 cities, all with populations of 10,000 or more, from April to June. It found that 7 in 10 believed their cities were better able to meet fiscal needs during 2007 than in 2006, but that many were quite pessimistic about the years ahead. In the Midwest, the picture was already grim: almost half reported that their cities were less able to meet their financial needs this year than last.
 Some local and state governments built up large surpluses in recent years, which, they hope, will cushion them now. Next month, the United States Conference of Mayors meets in Detroit to look at the real estate downturn and its effects on residents and municipal budgets. 
 In Chicago, meanwhile, Mayor Daley confirmed Wednesday that he was pondering yet another way to raise money: selling or leasing city parking meters to a private company. Questioned about the notion, Mr. Daley pointed to everything he must pay for.
 ''How are you going to do all this?'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Vision Of a Nation No Longer In the U.S.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
COLD SPRING, N.Y.
 If any New Yorker were to become the theoretician for a new secessionist movement, it figured to be Kirkpatrick Sale.
 Mr. Sale, 70, was a campus rabble-rouser at Cornell in the 1950s long before Berkeley made being one fashionable, a model for a character in Richard Farina's classic '60s novel, ''Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me,'' a writer who worked briefly with his college pal Thomas Pynchon on a musical called ''Minstral Island.'' 
 For half a century, he's written more or less from the left on issues of decentralization, the environment and technology -- in praise of Luddites, envisioning with dread the rise of the Sun Belt, lambasting Christopher Columbus as a despoiler of the American Eden and predicting environmental doom in a way that is making him at the moment look more prescient than cranky. 
 And though he once described the personal computer as the devil's work (its efficiencies producing more ''social disintegration, economic polarization, and environmental devastation''), there he was Tuesday at his modern Adirondack-style house in the woods looking in delight at the inbox on his laptop.
 ''Look at this,'' he said. ''There are 177 more messages from people who want to get on our mailing list. There's nothing that has brought right and left together like this.''
 ''This'' was the Second North American Secessionist Convention, held Oct. 3 and 4 in Chattanooga, and attended by 15 delegates representing 25 states, plus 40 sympathetic observers. It followed, amazingly enough, the First North American Secessionist Convention, held the year before in Burlington, Vt.
 In this country, secession has not had the greatest odor since the 1860s, when it produced a movement now seen as racist, violent and a loser. But the spirit of Mr. Sale and his pro-secession Middlebury Institute actually has more to do with Vermont.
 There, a group called the Second Vermont Republic has become a small-bore local phenomenon, with its call for a ''genteel revolution,'' opposed to ''the tyranny of Corporate America and the U.S. government,'' and committed to ''the peaceful return of Vermont to its status as an independent republic and more broadly the dissolution of the Union.'' Hence those ''U.S. Out of Vt!'' T-shirts. 
 Similarly, the language of the convention's Chattanooga Declaration decries excess corporate and governmental power, says that the deepest issues of the time go beyond left and right and declares that liberty can survive only if political power is returned to local communities and states. 
 ''The American Empire is no longer a nation or a republic,'' it says, ''but has become a tyrant aggressive abroad and despotic at home.''
 Even those ill-disposed toward the idea of an independent Vermont, Hawaii or Alaska or to the new Confederacy envisioned by the League of the South might see some logic here. Back in 1981, the journalist Joel Garreau published ''The Nine Nations of North America,'' mapping out how economics, geography and culture really made it more logical for the United States, Canada and Mexico to be nine nations than three. 
 Mr. Sale argues that the big theme of contemporary history, from the collapse of the Soviet Union to the evolution of the United Nations from 51 nations in 1945 to 192 now, is the breakup of great empires. And some on both left and right agree that the only cure for a federal government that's too big and too powerful is to make it less big and less powerful.
 His relentlessly bleak vision is that catastrophic events, long term (collapsing dollar, out-of-control oil prices, climate change) and short term (Iraq, Katrina, government-sanctioned torture), will produce the downsizing of America, secession movement or no.
 ''The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well,'' he said.
 Still, he concedes, there are a few roadblocks. Another 177 e-mail messages might feel like a revolution, but in that big, bad, computer-fueled world it's just another tiny blip in the din. Local control might look fine in green, crunchy Vermont but perhaps looks less fine if it meant Southern states maintaining segregated schools and water fountains through the '60s. Who is going to pay your Social Security, build interstate highways or finance NASA? 
 And just how to make secession happen -- legally and geographically -- is, he concedes, still a work in progress. One option might be state by state, but then there are those Neo-Confederates in the South, or advocates of independent New England, Cascadia (Washington, Oregon, British Columbia) or New Acadia (Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and the four Atlantic provinces of Canada).
 Mr. Sale was asked what nation he's prepared to live in.
 ''I'd like the Hudson Valley,'' he said. ''I'd even include New York City, the whole Hudson watershed. It would be rich in resources and culturally unified. That's the whole point of secession. If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt, inefficient, militaristic, oppressive, repressive, but you don't want to move to Canada or France, what do you do? Well, the way is through secession, where you could stay home and be where you want to be.''
 Of course, there might be problems here, too. What about the poor orphaned folks in distant Buffalo or Rochester or the vast empty acres upstate? What if the city didn't want to join and wanted to be its own smug Cosmopolitania instead? Where would the Bronx, the one borough on the mainland, end up?
 Oh, well, life's difficult.
 ''You would call it Hudsonia,'' he said, warming to the thought. ''That's the thing about secession. It fires up the imagination like nothing else.''

HEADLINE: Seeing Sugar's Future in Fuel

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: LOREAUVILLE, La. 

 BODY:
Todd Landry, a farmer who conjures big stands of sugar cane from the muddy fields of southern Louisiana, has been struggling lately against droughts and freezes and hurricanes. Come January he will confront another peril: expanded sugar imports from Mexico.
 ''Will we have a flood of sugar coming across the border?'' Mr. Landry wondered in a Cajun drawl. ''Survival is on our minds every minute of every day.'' 
 Mr. Landry and other sugar producers think they have spotted a life raft, and its name is ethanol.
 Taking a cue from Midwestern farmers who have improved their lot by selling corn to ethanol distilleries, sugar cane and sugar beet farmers want an ethanol deal of their own, paid for by American taxpayers. 
 A little-noticed provision in the new farm bill working its way through Congress would oblige the Agriculture Department to buy surplus domestic sugar caused by the expected influx of Mexican sugar next year. Then the government would sell it, most likely at a steep discount, to ethanol producers to add to their fermentation tanks. The Bush administration is fighting the measure.
 Sugar producers say the cost would be relatively low and the plan would help keep prices at a level they consider fair. As a side benefit, the deal would allow the nation to produce more ethanol to mix with gasoline, displacing some foreign oil, they say.
 But ethanol producers are unenthused. And the plan is drawing fire from opponents of agricultural subsidies and from longtime critics of the sugar industry, who complain that producers already have one of the best deals in American agriculture.
 ''It's a tax burden without a benefit that distorts both the ethanol market and the food-ingredient market,'' said Richard E. Pasco, counsel for the Sweetener Users Association, a lobby group for food companies that use sugar. ''And guess who will pay the price? Taxpayers and consumers.''
 The Congressional Budget Office calculates the cost at $660 million over five years, relatively cheap as farm programs go. But that is an estimate based on assumptions about how much sugar will come across the border. In truth, no one is sure.
 ''The U.S. Department of Agriculture would be taking on a limitless commitment,'' said Robert L. Thompson, a University of Illinois professor of agricultural policy, ''to buy any quantity of sugar offered at a guaranteed price, and that would get very expensive, very quickly.''
 At issue is a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the big trade pact meant to create a common market among Mexico, Canada and the United States. Though NAFTA was adopted in 1993, some of its more controversial provisions are only now taking effect.
 One of them will soon open the United States to unlimited sugar imports from Mexico -- the biggest crack in years in the wall of price supports and protectionism the government, at the behest of the sugar industry, has erected against foreign competition. That system includes quotas to limit domestic production and tariffs to limit imports, resulting in a market price for sugar in the United States that is typically twice the world market price.
 The NAFTA provision will work in both directions, with the United States able to export to Mexico a form of corn syrup often used as a sweetener. That sweetener, much cheaper than sugar, could displace some sugar use in Mexico, making more available to ship to the United States.
 Amid uncertainty over what will happen, the nation's 12,000 sugar cane and sugar beet farmers are appealing to Washington for an insurance policy. ''If Mexico decides to overproduce and send that to our market, they have the potential to eat up our market,'' said James H. Simon, general manager of the American Sugar Cane League.
 Sugar cane grows only in warmer states, with production concentrated in Florida and Louisiana. Farmers in some northerly states grow sugar beets.
 In southern Louisiana, still recovering from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, cane is cultivated on 420,000 acres and has been a mainstay of the economy for generations.
 Across a big swath of the state, the sweet smell of molasses wafts on the breeze in autumn, social life revolves around sugar fairs and festivals, and old sugar kettles decorate flower gardens. Whitewashed mansions, stately but not always well maintained, are shaded by live oaks draped with moss. 
 People fear the loss of a way of life with the onslaught of Mexican sugar. Louisiana's farmers and mill workers say sugar is in their blood, in part because few crops grow so well in the difficult climate, punctuated in recent years by powerful hurricanes that ripped crops from their roots.
 ''Sugar farming has been my whole life,'' said Michael Comb, 48, general manager of the Louisiana Sugar Cane Cooperative in St. Martinville. ''I was 8 years old when I got on a tractor in a sugar field. It's all I know.'' 
 Sugar farmers see the ethanol proposal as the beginning of a much larger national commitment to producing energy from cane. 
 Brazil, famously, has displaced much of its gasoline by turning cane juice into ethanol. Sugar prices in the United States are far too high for that -- and this country imposes a steep tariff that discourages ethanol imports from Brazil. 
 But the American sugar industry believes that with new technology, the pulp left over after juice is pressed from cane could eventually become a fuel source for cars.
 The proposal under consideration in Washington ''could be a bridge for greater things for sugar,'' said Anthony Joe Judice, 61, who works fields along the muddy waters of Bayou Teche, near St. Martinville. ''It's like an engagement to a future marriage.''
 The sugar ethanol provision has won approval in the House. With the support of Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, it may get through the Senate despite opposition from the administration and the food industry.
 The measure would be grafted onto an existing sugar policy so complex that even many farmers have trouble understanding it. The government limits the supply of sugar through production quotas and import restrictions, and it uses financial mechanisms to set an effective price floor.
 The system does not cost taxpayers money directly, a point of pride for the industry. But it costs consumers money in the form of higher sugar prices. The system has been subjected to withering criticism for decades, but the sugar lobby has clout on Capitol Hill. Sugar producers donated $2.7 million in campaign contributions to House and Senate incumbents in 2006, more than any other group of food growers, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington group.
 The new farm bill would retain much of the existing system, which sugar producers defend on the ground that virtually every country with a domestic sugar industry has strong protections. But it would add more guarantees, including one that would assure American producers 85 percent of the market no matter how much sugar comes in from abroad.
 To effect that policy, the government would buy excess sugar and sell it at a loss to ethanol producers. They ferment corn starch to ethanol, but adding a little sugar can speed the reaction.
 Mark E. Keenum, the Bush administration's under secretary of agriculture for farm and foreign agricultural services, said administering the ethanol program would be ''very cumbersome.''
 Mr. Keenum suggested that the Agriculture Department would end up buying sugar for 22 cents a pound and selling it to ethanol producers for 4 to 7 cents a pound. ''You can easily do the math and look at the loss potential,'' he said. 
 He added that the department tried selling sugar to the ethanol industry in 2001, but ethanol producers were interested in buying only 10,000 of 100,000 tons made available to them, even at a low price of 4 cents a pound.
 Ethanol producers, who could be forced to invest in new equipment to process sugar, say they do not have much use for the idea. ''In today's grain-based biorefineries, the amount of sugar you could introduce into the process would be fairly small,'' said Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association. 
 Mr. Keenum said the Agriculture Department did not want to be forced to sell only to ethanol producers, arguing that it might get a better price selling sugar for animal feed, pet food or industrial alcohol. On that point, the sugar lobby is willing to negotiate.
 The sugar producers say whatever its costs, the new farm bill is needed to save their industry.
 ''We don't like the government spending money, but if they are going to give away our market to foreign imports then we have to look for alternatives,'' said Mr. Simon of the American Sugar Cane League. ''We're confident we can get this farm bill passed and that will keep our heads above water until we're able to realize the full opportunities of energy production from sugar cane.''

HEADLINE: European Will Oversee Accounting Standards

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
After a search that lasted more than a year, the body that governs the International Accounting Standards Board has found a new chairman, Gerrit Zalm, who was the Dutch finance minister for more than 11 years. 
 The International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, which both appoints members of the standards board and raises money for its operations, has come under considerable pressure in Europe from some politicians who think the board should be more accountable to governments, and should pay more attention to their opinions in setting accounting standards.
 International accounting standards are gaining acceptance in many countries in the world, although in some cases governments have ordered exceptions, and the United States is considering accepting them beginning with reports filed in early 2009.
 The European Commission, acting at the behest of French banks, decided that European companies could ignore part of one standard, dealing with derivatives, and said the standards board should find a way to work out a compromise that would satisfy the banks. Despite several rounds of talks, no compromise has emerged.
 Backers of the standards board say they believe that it must be viewed as an independent body that sets standards based on principles, not through a consensus of interested parties, and that the standards should be uniform rather than subject to national variations.
 That was the view of the first chairman of the foundation, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve. When he stepped down in 2005, the trustees began a search for a chairman who was known and respected by European governments and favored an independent standard-setter.
 Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa became chairman in early 2006, but left almost immediately when he became Italian finance minister. Philip A. Laskawy, an American and former chairman of Ernst & Young, took the post while the trustees searched for an acceptable European. 
 Mr. Zalm was deputy prime minister and finance minister in the Netherlands from 2003 until February of this year, after a stint as finance minister from 1994 to 2002. He is now the chief economist for DSB Bank, a consultant to PricewaterhouseCoopers and to Permira, a private equity fund. Mr. Zalm takes office at the end of this year.

HEADLINE: Library of Congress Advances 2 Digital Projects Abroad

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The Library of Congress announced an ambitious plan on Wednesday to digitize a collection of the world's rare cultural materials -- artifacts ranging from a photo collection of a 19th-century Brazilian empress to a crackly recording of the 101-year-old grandson of a slave. 
 The library also signed an agreement with Unesco in Paris to move ahead with the World Digital Library project, which is in the testing phase and will not be available for public use until next year.
 Other national libraries appear poised to cooperate in the venture, which is modeled after the Library of Congress's vast American Memory project that has posted millions of original items on the Web, including Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
 ''The vision is simply that this is a means for promoting far better intercultural understanding in the world,'' said James Billington, the librarian of Congress for more than 20 years and the driving force behind the project, which aims to overcome the digital divide in developing countries by offering the collection free online.
 The World Digital Library is proceeding as European libraries develop their own digital collections. The European Digital Library will release its prototype next year, and is a response to Google's efforts to digitize libraries in the United States and Britain.
 The French National Library has already developed a test project, Europeana, for the European library and is in the process of digitizing 300,000 books. Bruno Racine, the president of the French library, said there was no competition between that project and the World Digital Library. 
 ''The multilingual dimension seems to be a very ambitious challenge, and if we can contribute usefully, we will be happy to do so,'' Mr. Racine said of the World Digital Library.
 The world library started two years ago with a $3 million grant from Google and technical assistance by Apple. Initially, five other libraries contributed material for the prototype, including the national libraries of Egypt, Brazil and Russia.
 The digital library is searchable in seven languages, with video commentaries from curators alongside material including original maps, manuscripts, photographs and recordings. 
 The aim is that the material will ultimately be available on personal computers, hand-held devices and some of the basic, inexpensive laptops that are being developed for use in emerging economies.
 When library officials displayed their new handiwork, though, the high technology was overshadowed by the ancient treasures it could show off: an elaborate 17th century map of the world with California depicted as a sliced-off island; a 1903 Thomas Edison film of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island; and a 17th century Arabic manuscript on the fundamentals of geometry.
 ''My name is Fountain Hughes,'' declared a firm Southern voice in one of the recordings posted on the site dating to the 1940s. ''My grandfather belonged to Thomas Jefferson. My grandfather was 115 years old when he died. And now I am 101 years old.''
 The project's organizers, according to Laura Campbell, an associate librarian at the Library of Congress, are working to raise money, discussing alliances with Nokia and the Vodafone Group and gathering commitments from countries to participate.

HEADLINE: Aiming to Expand Reach, N.B.A. Travels to China

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
LeBron James stood in the middle of the court at halftime, an advertisement as big as any for next year's Olympics.
 He waved a replica of the red and silver torch for the Beijing Games while Chinese and United States flags hung from the rafters of the newly built Qizhong Arena.
 The public-address announcer mingled English with Chinese. David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, was at the game. The jazz musician Kenny Gee sat in the front row. 
 ''The atmosphere was amazing,'' James said ''Everything I expected and more.''
 James and his Cleveland Cavaliers lost a preseason game on the outskirts of Shanghai on Wednesday, beaten, 90-86, by the Orlando Magic.
 But the final score was the least of it.
 This was the first of the N.B.A.'s three China games, and Stern was on hand to explain the league's massive expansion plans in a country with the world's fastest growing major economy. This is also where 300 million people -- the entire population of the United States -- are reported to play basketball.
 The halftime show -- James aside -- featured a juggler balancing one-legged on a unicycle.
 ''I thought it was a big deal tonight even though it was a preseason game,'' Cavaliers Coach Mike Brown said. ''It almost felt like the electricity you feel in some of the buildings in a game that kind of matters.''
 The teams play again Saturday in Macau, a former Portuguese territory. On Thursday in Macau, the Magic faces a Chinese all-star team.
 Danny Ferry, Cleveland's general manager, acknowledged the trip was taxing but said it might pay off during the year. 
 ''I think it's a pretty good team building experience when you go to the other side of the world as a group and kind of bunker down that way,'' he said.
 Before the game, Stern discussed the N.B.A.'s new China subsidiary, N.B.A. China. Timothy Chen, one of China's top business executives, began work Monday as the company's new chief executive officer. Stern said plans call for setting up ''the second N.B.A., the N.B.A. of China.''
 He did not elaborate but said the expansion would involve working with the 16-team China Basketball Association.
 ''This is a long-term project where discussions have literally just begun and would, of course, involve the securing of significant financing from capital sources to finance substantial arena development throughout China,'' Stern said.
 The N.B.A. generated about $50 million in revenue last year from China, the league's largest market outside the United States. That pales compared with overall N.B.A. revenue of almost $4 billion. But N.B.A. officials have said the 80-person staff in China is set to grow five times in the next several years with increased revenues sure to follow.
 Stern has held two days of meetings in China talking with television partners, advertisers and sponsors about ways to expand basketball in China. He said the N.B.A. was seeking financing. Ninety percent of the new subsidiary will be owned by the league. Two 5 percent shares will be sold to Chinese investors and to a United States media company.
 Li Yuanwei, the China Basketball Association's executive vice president, said he welcomed the venture, provided China received its share.
 ''Together we can greatly expand the market for basketball,'' Li said. ''I think the Chinese market is big enough, but it is still emerging and underdeveloped.
 He added, ''As long as it is carried out on an equal footing and in a mutually beneficial manner, I believe our cooperation will lead to a win-win situation.''

HEADLINE: Accused Firm Keeps Giving To Democrats

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Over the years, as it became Exhibit A for critics of shareholders' class action lawsuits, the law firm of Milberg Weiss often enjoyed the support of Democrats who called the suits an invaluable weapon in the universal conflict between big business and the little guy.
 The Democrats, in turn, enjoyed the support of Milberg Weiss and its partners, who together have contributed more than $7 million to the party's candidates since the 1980s. 
 Last year, the firm was indicted on federal charges of fraud and bribery. But the political partnership has not been entirely severed. Since the indictment, 26 Democrats around the country, including four presidential candidates, have accepted $150,000 in campaign contributions from people connected to Milberg Weiss, according to state and federal campaign finance records. And some Democrats have taken public actions that potentially helped the firm or its former partners. 
 The recent contributors include current and former Milberg partners who had either been indicted or were widely reported to be facing potential criminal problems when they wrote their checks. One, William S. Lerach, was a fund-raiser for John Edwards's presidential campaign until his guilty plea last month. Melvyn I. Weiss, a founder of the firm, gave the maximum $4,600 to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York in June. Other firm members contributed to the presidential campaigns of Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware.
 Milberg Weiss reaped billions of dollars in legal fees over four decades as the acknowledged king of class action lawsuits, which accused executives of misleading investors with erroneous financial statements or some other fraud. According to the indictment, the New York-based firm ran a ''racketeering enterprise'' that collected a quarter billion dollars in 250 cases in which people were paid secret kickbacks for serving as plaintiffs. 
 The law firm has denied the charges.
 The reluctance of Democrats to shut off the cash spigot, even in the face of scandal, underscores how the pressure to raise money creates marriages of political interests that can be difficult to break up. Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform, called it the ''natural outcome of a system where huge amounts of private contributions are raised and spent, and the political parties turn to groups with interests in government to feed the spending machine.''
 In the current campaign, the race for cash has led to several embarrassments for the Democrats, including the indictment of a trial lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, who was accused of using straw donors to make illegal contributions to Mr. Edwards's 2004 presidential campaign, and the arrest of Norman Hsu, a businessman accused of fraud who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Mrs. Clinton.
 In addition to the kickback charges in the Milberg Weiss case, federal agents have investigated accusations that the firm funneled campaign contributions through plaintiffs and expert witnesses in the 1990s, said two lawyers familiar with the inquiry. The guilty plea entered by Mr. Lerach hinted at that, but it also specified that prosecutors would not pursue campaign finance violations, in exchange for Mr. Lerach's admission that he had conspired to obstruct justice by concealing the kickbacks.
 Beyond campaign contributions, Milberg Weiss became deeply ingrained in the financial firmament of the Democratic Party in other ways. Members of the firm gave $500,000 toward construction of a new Democratic National Committee headquarters, and some became partners in a private investment venture with several prominent Democrats. They included former Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, who is a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton, and Leonard Barrack, a Philadelphia trial lawyer who was once the national fund-raising chairman for the Democratic Party.
 Along the way, as Milberg Weiss's brass-knuckles legal strategy made it a target for Republicans advocating limits on class action suits, it usually could count on Democrats in Washington to protect its interests. After federal prosecutors indicted the firm in May 2006, four Democratic congressmen issued a joint statement, posted on Milberg Weiss's Web site, accusing the Bush administration of persecuting lawyers who take on big businesses.
 The statement, signed by Representatives Gary L. Ackerman, Carolyn McCarthy and Charles B. Rangel, all of New York, and Robert Wexler of Florida, contained several passages that appear to be lifted directly from a ''class action press kit'' distributed by a national trial lawyers group. All but Mr. Wexler have received campaign contributions from Milberg Weiss partners.
 More recently, Mr. Edwards, a trial lawyer who became wealthy pursing personal injury cases, joined labor unions and consumer groups last May in pressing securities regulators to intervene in a lawsuit against banks brought by Mr. Lerach on behalf of Enron investors. His campaign said Mr. Edwards's actions had nothing to do with Mr. Lerach, and were consistent with the candidate's longstanding defense of working people.
 Still, Mr. Edwards's willingness to be seen doing anything that could benefit Mr. Lerach, and allowing him to raise money, provided fodder for critics. At the time the Edwards campaign took on Mr. Lerach as a fund-raiser, it was already widely reported that Mr. Lerach, who left Milberg Weiss in 2004, was one of the unnamed co-conspirators cited in court documents related to the firm's indictment. 
 In all, Mr. Edwards collected about $16,000 from people connected to Milberg Weiss, including Mr. Lerach and two other former Milberg Weiss lawyers who had joined him at his new firm, Patrick J. Coughlin and Keith F. Park. Federal authorities agreed not to prosecute them as part of the plea deal with Mr. Lerach. (Mr. Lerach also raised $64,000 for Mr. Edwards from members of his new firm who were not named in the Milberg case.)
 ''With Edwards, he has associated himself with people in his campaign that don't represent the face that even the trial lawyers want to put forward to the country,'' said Walter K. Olson, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, who has written extensively on the American legal system.
 Eric Schultz, a spokesman for the Edwards campaign, said that it had given Mr. Lerach's $4,600 personal contribution to charity and that ''should anyone else be found guilty of wrongdoing, we will donate their contributions to charity as well.''
 ''The bottom line is, the system is far from perfect,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''The influence of money in politics has gotten out of control. That's why John Edwards has decided to play by the rules that were designed to ensure fairness in the election process by capping his campaign spending and seeking public financing.''
 John W. Keker, a lawyer for Mr. Lerach, declined to comment on his client's guilty plea.
 A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said her presidential campaign did not intend to return the contribution from Mr. Weiss. A spokesman for the Obama campaign, whose Milberg Weiss contributions came from lawyers not directly involved in the kickback scandal, declined to comment. 
 In a statement denying the charges in the indictment, Milberg Weiss, which continues to operate, said: ''The indictment is unprecedented and unfair, and the firm intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges. We are confident that we will be fully vindicated.''
 The indictment of Milberg Weiss was a stunning turnabout for the firm, which has recovered $45 billion for clients since it was founded in 1965.
 Its approach was controversial. The moment a publicly traded company's stock dropped, Milberg Weiss would enlist a shareholder as a plaintiff and rush to court with a lawsuit. Usually, the sued company would end up settling rather than risk going to trial.
 Milberg Weiss's supporters gave it credit for enforcing accountability in the boardroom. Critics, however, accused the firm of economic terrorism, and with the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 a business-backed movement took hold to change securities laws to make it harder to bring shareholder lawsuits.
 The firm found a friend in President Bill Clinton, who, a few days after being seen chatting and shaking hands with Mr. Lerach at a White House dinner in 1995, vetoed legislation that clamped down on class action suits. Congress overrode the veto, but the image remained of a close relationship between the president and Mr. Lerach, a Lincoln Bedroom guest during the Clinton presidency who donated more than $100,000 to Mr. Clinton's presidential library.
 Beginning in 2000, federal investigators began looking into Milberg Weiss's litigation practices, particularly its uncanny ability to beat other firms in the race to be named lead counsel in large class action suits, thereby ensuring itself a larger percentage of fees. By last year, two people had pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from Milberg Weiss in return for being on call to serve as plaintiffs in more than 100 lawsuits; an expert witness used by the firm was implicated in the fraud; and two partners, Steven G. Schulman and David J. Bershad, had been indicted.
 Both Mr. Schulman and Mr. Bershad have since pleaded guilty. Late last month, Mr. Lerach also pleaded guilty, leaving Mr. Weiss as the only named partner facing criminal charges.
 The case has taken a toll not only on the lawyers involved, but also on the firm's name plate. After Mr. Lerach left to form his own practice in San Diego, his old firm dropped his name, becoming Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman. Two resignations and guilty pleas later, it is now simply Milberg Weiss.

HEADLINE: Bush Optimistic on Mideast Peace Despite Tense Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
President Bush expressed optimism on Wednesday that the Israelis and Palestinians could negotiate a peace agreement as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ended four days of talks here with a spasm of discord between the sides.
 After what appeared to be a tense meeting with Ms. Rice, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of failing to take the peace process seriously by refusing to discuss issues he considered essential to holding the international conference Mr. Bush has proposed for this fall.
 ''It's impossible to go to the conference at any price,'' Mr. Abbas said after meeting with Ms. Rice at the presidential compound in Ramallah. 
 Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, responded by saying it served no purpose to negotiate delicate questions about the future of a Palestinian state in public. She declined, when asked, to discuss Palestinian demands that any conference include talks on borders, a future capital in Jerusalem, refugees and Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories.
 ''The idea is not to raise expectations that can lead to frustration and to violence,'' she said, voicing widely held Israeli skepticism.
 Ms. Rice, making her seventh trip to the region this year and the most extensive one yet, has tried to get the sides to agree on a written statement that would outline the scope of the international conference, planned for Annapolis, Md., possibly in November.
 The meeting's timing appeared increasingly uncertain on Wednesday, with continuing clashes in the Palestinian territories and steps by Israel that Mr. Abbas's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, said were ''hindering the endeavor to reach a substantive document to go to the conference.''
 In Washington, Mr. Bush did not respond directly to Mr. Abbas's warnings, but he said he remained confident that progress could be made.
 ''The attitude is, let's work together to see if we can't lay out that vision for the sake of peace between Israel and the Palestinians,'' he said at a news conference. ''And it's possible.''
 Ms. Rice spent an unusually large part of her time here meeting not only with political leaders, like Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, at a working dinner on Wednesday night, but also with religious figures, business executives and other civic leaders.
 Her aides described the encounters as an effort to break out of the confines of diplomatic meetings. ''You understand, given the nature of the jobs,'' a senior official said, ''everywhere you go you're in a bubble.''
 On Wednesday, the secretary traveled to Bethlehem, a city hemmed inside the West Bank by the barrier the Israelis have built. Ms. Rice, a daughter and granddaughter of Presbyterian ministers, visited the Church of the Nativity, built on the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ, where she spoke of her own faith. ''I think I could spell Bethlehem before I could spell my name,'' she said.
 She added that a largely Muslim city like Bethlehem, which also includes Rachel's Tomb, a sacred site for Jews, was a model for reconciliation. As she visited, Israeli jets roared overhead.
 Samir Hazboun, director of a research and consulting organization and a member of the Bethlehem Chamber of Commerce, said that he and others there had told Ms. Rice that actions Israel considered necessary for its security were harming the Palestinian economy and the ability of the Palestinian Authority to provide basic government functions and security.
 ''We have high expectations from the Americans,'' he said. ''We see this as the last opportunity.''

HEADLINE: 'The American' in France

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
PARIS
 Not only is Christine Lagarde France's finance minister, ready to forsake her native tongue, she is, she says, ''happier doing this in English.'' With that, right off the bat, she declares in ringing Anglo-Saxon: ''We are trying to change the psyche of the French people in relation to work.''
 A hopeless task, some might say. Deep in the Gallic soul resides the notion that work is exploitation, a ruse concocted by American robber barons, best regulated and minimized and offset by hours of idleness. The demise of the Soviet Union left France leading the counter-capitalist school. 
 But Lagarde, 51, tall and striking, is not known as ''the American'' for nothing. Think of her as the face of a new France ditching its cold-war hangover. The sobriquet reflects her linguistic skills, her background as a highflying executive for the Baker & McKenzie law firm and her Chicago-cultivated candor.
 In an interview, Lagarde says that more than two decades at a U.S. corporation taught her: ''The more hours you worked, the more hours you billed, the more profit you could generate for yourself and your firm. That was the mantra.''
 The equivalent mantra in the French bureaucracy might be: the fewer hours you work, the more vacation you take, the more time you have to grumble about the state of the universe and the smarter you feel, especially compared to workaholic dingbats across the Atlantic with no time for boules.
 So Lagarde, appointed four months ago by President Nicolas Sarkozy, is aware that she faces a big challenge: ''What was really striking to me when I came back from Chicago in 2005 was that the law on the 35-hour week had passed and been internalized by individuals and, I think, had produced disastrous effects.'' 
 What effects? ''People did not really talk about their work. They talked about their long weekends.''
 Lagarde's goal, she says, is to slash France's chronically highly unemployment -- now about 8 percent -- to 5 percent by 2012 and increase the proportion of the total population in jobs to 70 percent from 63 percent. Rehabilitating work is central to this ambition.
 Tax cuts, the termination of unemployment benefits for those refusing two valid job offers, later retirement, incentives for those working more than 35 hours, a slashing of the bureaucracy associated with job-seeking and improved professional training are among measures enacted or envisaged. Legislation to reverse the 35-hour week is possible.
 ''I think we have to go around it,'' Lagarde says of the law. ''To demonstrate that it's not a holy principle and it can be modified, varied, mitigated and possibly reversed.''
 Not without a fight, however. French workers are expected to take to the streets today in what will likely be one of many big strikes against the Sarkozy-Lagarde reforms. Former governments have caved as Bastille-storming specters rose.
 Not this time, insists Lagarde. ''We certainly have the resolve to see reforms through,'' she says. ''A significant majority voted in support of a reform program that was completely advocated, advertised, trumpeted.''
 France, she suggests, is changing in the image of a president whose approach ''is not being constrained by rules, principles, protocol, straitjackets.''
 The country, long hung up in a left-bank bubble filled with quaint notions of reversing globalization, now wants ''to take advantage of a globalized world, rather than be defensive.''
 To which I say: hallelujah. Without a dynamic France, Europe cannot be revitalized, and a Europe in a Gallic funk is bad for everyone. If an overbearing America has been a problem, an underperforming Europe has been its complement.
 Better European performance, Lagarde thinks, is linked to exchange rates. ''There is a competitive disadvantage in having a strong euro versus a relatively weak yen, a deliberately weak yuan and a low dollar,'' she says ahead of a G-7 meeting tomorrow. 
 Another problem Lagarde faces is with a potential insider trading scandal at the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, the partly state-owned parent of Airbus whose stock plunged after delays in the A-380 superjumbo jet. She insisted there had been no government wrongdoing.
 Still, small shareholder losses incurred as executives cashed in, and the impression of a cozy relationship between private and state capital, will not help Lagarde in her revolutionary efforts.
 This revolution, she insists, must begin in the French head. Lagarde has become the anti-Descartes by declaring the French should think less to work more.
 ''What has escaped my critics,'' she says with a smile, ''is that clearly before action, there must be thinking. But we have been splitting hairs and talking about the sex of angels for long enough. We know the solutions to all our evils. So let's roll up our sleeves.''
 Hallelujah -- and as we Anglo-Saxons say, Vive la France!

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Candidates Address Entitlements

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The Republican candidates addressed ballooning costs of entitlements on Wednesday. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani promised not to raise taxes to keep Social Security solvent, and Fred D. Thompson said high-income Medicare beneficiaries might have to pay more for their care. 
 The candidates made their remarks here before members of the Club for Growth, an antitax group. When Mr. Giuliani was asked by the club president, Patrick J. Toomey, whether he would rule out raising taxes as part of Social Security reform, he responded that he ''would rule out a tax increase for that purpose or for any other purpose.''
 ''I think a tax increase would be very damaging to the American economy,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''A tax is a tax on wages. And it doesn't matter what you call it.''
 Mr. Thompson has said growing costs of entitlements need to be dealt with, but has been short on specifics until recently.
 Raising the prospect of increased fees for upper-income Medicare beneficiaries, he said, ''We have to address the question of whether or not we can we stick with the same premiums and deductions for the higher-income-type recipients on Medicare.''
 ''All of these will be part of a little further discussion,'' he added.
 Mr. Thompson has also recently suggested changing Social Security so that benefits are increased at a slower rate to keep the program solvent.
 The forum gave Mr. Thompson a chance to sharpen attacks on fellow Republicans, further heating up an intramural brawl. On Monday, he took on Mr. Giuliani on his home turf, New York. On Wednesday, Mr. Thompson echoed that attack, while widening his targets with what was apparently a reference to a criticism of Mitt Romney's years as Massachusetts governor.
 Mr. Thompson said that while he was pushing tax cuts in Congress, others raised state fees.
 For months, the Republican candidates have tried to highlight their fiscal conservatism. Mr. Thompson has portrayed himself as the ''consistent conservative.'' 
 Mr. Romney said last week that he spoke for ''the Republican wing of the Republican Party.'' Mr. Giuliani said Wednesday that he hoped to follow in President Ronald Reagan's footsteps.
 The conference was intended to showcase the leading Republicans to a group that is a conservative watchdog on economic issues for Congress and the presidential contenders. It also compiles detailed ''presidential papers'' grading candidates on their records on economic issues. 
 The Club for Growth has fiercely lobbied Mr. Giuliani in recent weeks, after he told The Associated Press in an interview that he would not rule out raising taxes to help shore up Social Security, a position he appeared to discard on Wednesday.
 Mr. Giuliani's opinions on tax policy have swung back and forth over the years. When he was mayor of New York, he disparaged the idea of a flat tax in general and a specific proposal for one floated by Steve Forbes, the billionaire.
 But this year, when Mr. Forbes publicly endorsed him for president, Mr. Giuliani reversed course and said he liked the idea.

HEADLINE: Putin Is Said To Offer Idea On Standoff Over Iran

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI; C. J. Chivers contributed reporting from Moscow, and Steven Lee Myers from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, proposed a new way to help resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear program during an extraordinary meeting with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the country's chief nuclear negotiator on Wednesday.
 The negotiator, Ali Larijani, told reporters that Mr. Putin, who was granted an audience with Ayatollah Khamenei on Tuesday evening, ''offered a special proposal.'' Neither the Iranians nor the Russians would disclose any details, but Mr. Larijani said the Iranian side was studying it. 
 ''One of the issues he brought up was his view on the nuclear issue,'' Mr. Larijani said, according to the ISNA news agency. ''We are reviewing it now.'' 
 State-run television and news agencies quoted Ayatollah Khamenei as telling Mr. Putin, ''We will think about what you said and about your proposal,'' even as he added that Iran was ''determined to provide our country's need for nuclear energy.''
 Mr. Putin's visit highlighted the fact that Russia seems to be increasingly distancing itself from the United States and the Europeans on a strategy to curb Iran's nuclear program. While those nations have sought to impose new Security Council sanctions on Iran, the governments of Russia and China have resisted, arguing that more time is needed. 
 Earlier, Moscow proposed to enrich uranium in Russia for use in Iranian reactors, assuring that Iran would not produce the highly enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons. Tehran rejected the idea as an impingement on its sovereignty. 
 During his visit, which included a meeting with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Putin also warned the West against a military attack on Iran, stressing that Tehran had a right to peaceful nuclear energy. He also said that the Russian-built nuclear power plant at Bushehr, in southern Iran, where construction has been slowed by a dispute over payments, would be finished as scheduled. 
 Underscoring the friendly nature of the visit, a joint statement spoke of ''the closeness of Russian and Iranian positions over the key world questions and the development of cooperation to establish a world order that is more just.''
 It also stressed the need to solve the nuclear issue as quickly as possible ''through politics and diplomacy''; committed Russia to speed up discussions for the construction and sale of Tupolev 214 and Tupolev 334 airliners; and spoke of increased cooperation in energy and aerospace. 
 Russia is eager to deepen its diplomatic and economic relations with Iran. Iran's Fars news service reported that Mr. Putin said during his meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei that Russia was ready to ''expand ties without limitations.'' As Iran's most senior official, the ayatollah has final word on state matters, and his decision to see Mr. Putin was regarded as significant in itself. Even Mohamed ElBaradei, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, did not see Ayatollah Khamenei when he visited here last year. 
 Mr. Putin has recently met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
 Russia and China hold veto power on the Security Council, and Iran is relying on both countries, which have important trade ties with Iran, to oppose another round of sanctions. Moscow has already voted for two sets of milder sanctions. The United States and European countries have said that they will impose tougher sanctions on Iran if it refuses to suspend its sensitive uranium enrichment activities. 
 Mr. Larijani is scheduled to discuss Iran's nuclear case with Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, in Rome next Tuesday. 
 An American official who was part of a delegation that visited the Kremlin last week suggested that Mr. Putin intimated in private that he had concerns about Iran's nuclear program as well.
 ''I will tell you that what we heard last week once the cameras left was not bad,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record. ''I cannot rule out that he delivered a message that we would like.''
 He also said that the construction delays at Bushehr were not coincidental and were part of Russia's strategy of proceeding slowly with aid to Iran.
 In Jerusalem, Ms. Rice answered questions about Mr. Putin's visit to Iran by saying that Russia continued to back the diplomatic process to review the possibility of new sanctions following reports next month by Dr. ElBaradei and Mr. Solana. Russia, along with China, opposed a new round of sanctions at a meeting in New York last month.
 Neither Mr. Solana nor Dr. ElBaradei was informed by the Russians about Mr. Putin's proposal, officials in both their offices said. Ms. Rice discussed Iran extensively during meetings in Moscow last week, including one with Mr. Putin, who she said supported the goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. ''I saw no evidence that Russia intends to do anything but stay on that path we laid out,'' she said, appearing with Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni.
 But clearly Russia has emerged as at least a semi-independent broker in the nuclear crisis. Just hours after Mr. Putin left Iran, Israel announced that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would visit Russia on Thursday for what one official described as a ''last-minute, urgent meeting.''
 U.S. Ties Missile Shield to Iran
 BRUSSELS, Oct. 17 (Agence France-Presse) -- The United States could change its approach to developing a missile shield if Iran were to suspend uranium enrichment in its nuclear program, a senior State Department official said on Wednesday.
 The official, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried, said that United States officials had explained Washington's stance to Russia in talks at NATO headquarters to help allay fears that the missile shield posed a threat to Russia. ''Our real concern is not Russia,'' Mr. Fried told reporters in Brussels.

HEADLINE: Bush and Congress Honor Dalai Lama in Plain View

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Over furious objections from China and in the presence of President Bush, Congress on Wednesday bestowed its highest civilian honor on the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists whom Beijing considers a troublesome voice of separatism.
 Dressed in flowing robes of dark burgundy and bright orange, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, beamed and bowed as the president and members of Congress greeted him with a standing ovation and then praised him as a hero of the Tibetan struggle. President Bush called him ''a man of faith and sincerity and peace.''
 But the Dalai Lama said he felt ''a sense of regret'' over the sharp tensions with China unleashed by his private meeting on Tuesday with Mr. Bush and by the Congressional Gold Medal conferred on him in the ornate Capitol Rotunda. 
 In gentle language and conciliatory tones, he congratulated China on its dynamic economic growth and recognized its rising role on the world stage, but also gently urged it to embrace ''transparency, the rule of law and freedom of information.'' 
 The 72-year-old spiritual leader made clear that ''I'm not seeking independence'' from China, something that is anathema to Beijing. Nor, he said, would he use any future agreement with China ''as a steppingstone for Tibet's independence.''
 What he wanted, he said, was ''meaningful autonomy for Tibet.'' 
 The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since the Chinese Army crushed an uprising in his homeland in 1959. 
 Speeches by the president and the top leaders of each party emphasized the Dalai Lama's humble beginnings and humanitarian achievements, as well as a long history of American support for him. He was also lauded by the Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate and a previous winner of the Congressional Gold Medal, which is cast in the image of the recipient. 
 When the speaker of the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi, noted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had given the Dalai Lama, then very young, a watch that displayed the phases of the moon -- and that he still had it -- the honored guest tugged on his robe, held his wrist out before President Bush, tapped on the watch and grinned. 
 Earlier, Beijing offered a sharp new rebuke of the award ceremony, which the top Chinese religious affairs official condemned as a ''farce.'' 
 ''The protagonist of this farce is the Dalai Lama,'' said Ye Xiaowen, director general of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, Reuters reported. Other officials have warned, without specifying, of a ''serious impact'' on relations between the United States and China.
 Mr. Bush, during a news conference, appeared unconcerned. 
 ''I don't think it ever damages relations,'' he said, ''when an American president talks about, you know -- religious tolerance and religious freedom is good for a nation.'' 
 The two have met three times before. But in the face of the Chinese broadsides, their encounter on Tuesday was held with the maximum discretion: in the White House residence, not the Oval Office, with no cameras present, and shorn of the trappings of a meeting of the president and a political leader. 
 Mr. Bush reminded reporters that he had told President Hu Jintao of China, when they met recently in Sydney, Australia, that he would meet the Dalai Lama. During the award ceremony, he urged the Chinese to do the same. 
 ''They will find this good man to be a man of peace and reconciliation,'' he said.
 Apparently in a protest over the award, China pulled out of a multiparty meeting this month to discuss Iran. It also canceled a human rights meeting with Germany, displeased by Chancellor Angela Merkel's meeting last month with the Dalai Lama.

HEADLINE: Putting Poor Children Second

 BODY:
President Bush's justification for vetoing a bill to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or S-chip, is that he wants to ''put poor children first'' rather than extend coverage to middle-class children. That explanation would be more believable if Mr. Bush had actually been putting poor children first. On far too many occasions, the president has sacrificed the interests of poor children to what he deems higher budgetary or ideological priorities. Congress should not allow Mr. Bush to do the same with S-chip.
 For the past several years, the Bush administration has been squeezing federal support for Medicaid, the primary program to help the poorest families and their children. Instead of ensuring that more poor children receive coverage, the president is trying to close programs that find and enroll them. His budget for fiscal year 2008 seeks to eliminate funds for a ''Cover the Kids'' outreach program. A proposed rule change would also eliminate federal matching funds for local school personnel to do Medicaid outreach and enrollment activities. 
 The administration clearly wasn't putting poor children first when it strongly supported Congressional bills that would impose new charges on needy beneficiaries -- a step that could jeopardize health care for millions of poor children in coming years. The administration also proposed, unsuccessfully, to change Medicaid from an unlimited entitlement into a capped block grant that could have fallen short of needs in bad economic times. 
 As part of the anti-immigration hysteria, it imposed onerous new paperwork requirements, leading to declines in Medicaid enrollment by citizens in some states. The move also posed potential problems for foster children, for whom it is often difficult to get documents quickly, until Congress stepped in to exempt them. 
 In education, the president got off to a strong start with his No Child Left Behind Act. It imposed new testing and reporting requirements to measure progress in the schools. With bipartisan support in Congress, he helped to provide a substantial increase in federal funds for the first couple of years. But then his budgets and Congressional appropriations flattened out, forcing cuts in programs targeted at low-income children. The president's latest budget calls for an overall decrease in federal support for elementary and secondary education.
 Funding for Head Start and Early Head Start, which provide health and education services to some 900,000 preschool children, has not kept up with inflation over the past five years, forcing programs to lay off teachers, reduce salaries and curtail operating hours. The president's budget also seeks to eliminate Even Start, a program to help preschoolers and their mothers develop literacy skills.
 Not all of the news is so bad. The administration has done relatively well in supporting food stamps and child nutrition programs. It has also taken commendable steps to improve the quality of care in Medicaid and S-chip, increase childhood immunization rates and help states ensure that children on Medicaid get appropriate diagnosis and treatment. 
 A lot more needs to be done, including reducing the number of American children who do not have health coverage. 
 The bill that the president has vetoed would increase funding for S-chip substantially and would, in fact, ''put poor children first.'' Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, a key sponsor, estimates that some 92 percent of the children who would benefit would come from families with incomes below twice the poverty level, the group the president says he wants to concentrate on. 
 House members should vote today to override the president's veto. It is the best way to protect America's low-income children.

HEADLINE: Despite Slowdown in Auction Business, eBay Posts a Strong Quarter

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
EBay, the e-commerce company, said it continued to grow quickly in the last quarter -- with a few stutters related to its slowing core business of Internet auctions.
 In its third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, eBay reported sales of $1.89 billion, up 30 percent from last year and ahead of Wall Street's forecast of $1.83 billion.
 One blemish on the results: the company reported a $936 million net loss because of a recent write-off stemming from its problems making money from Skype, the Internet calling service it acquired in 2005. Excluding one-time items like the Skype write-down, the company had $564 million in profit, up 53 percent from $367 million in the third quarter last year. 
 ''I would say it was a strong quarter,'' Meg Whitman, chief executive of eBay, said in an interview. ''The strength came from eBay International, PayPal merchant services, ticketing site StubHub, classifieds and advertising, which all performed above expectations.''
 Ms. Whitman omitted eBay's auction business in the United States from that list. Analysts have been closely watching it for signs that its growth is slowing, and in eBay's latest report, it indeed showed further signs of stagnation. Gross merchandising volume, the total amount of economic activity on eBay, was up 14 percent over last year, but that growth rate declined from 17 percent last year.
 The number of active users on eBay, 83 million, was unchanged from last quarter, and the number of auction listings was down 5 percent from last year, a trend that eBay is trying to reverse by making the site more fun to use and by being more responsive to problems.
 ''I think we have improved the product this year,'' Ms. Whitman said. ''We've done work in customer support, trust and safety and different pricing scenarios, which we continue to test.''
 She added: ''I don't think there is a silver bullet, but we are doing all the right things.''
 Despite the mixed message on auctions, investors increasingly have other things on their minds when evaluating eBay, which is based in San Jose, Calif. PayPal, the online payment company, reported $470 million in sales this quarter, a 35 percent increase from last year. PayPal accounts for a quarter of eBay's revenue.
 ''This is the most interesting side of the story right now,'' said Scott W. Devitt, managing director for Internet consumer services at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. 
 Mr. Devitt pointed to PayPal's initial successes in positioning itself as an alternative to credit cards outside the world of eBay, such as on the Web sites of major airlines. ''The big opportunity here is to disrupt credit cards over time. These are huge opportunities that PayPal is pursuing,'' he said.
 Analysts like Mr. Devitt have urged eBay to consider selling PayPal shares to the public. Ms. Whitman said the company had no plans to do so.
 This fall, investors have rallied behind eBay, propelling the stock up 18 percent since the beginning of September, in the belief that PayPal was growing quickly and that the company was finally stabilizing its core auctions business. 
 In after-hours trading eBay's stock was up 15 cents, to $40.75. 
 The net loss for the quarter resulted from a decision, announced this month, to write off $1.43 billion in value for Skype, for which it has conceded it drastically overpaid. Part of that write-off canceled a further incentive-based payout, called an ''earnout,'' to Skype investors that the companies had negotiated during their original deal. 
 Ms. Whitman spoke about the Skype write-off for the first time. ''It was disappointing, and we were sorry that it was necessary,'' she said. ''But I think we are in better shape. The earnout was definitely getting in the way of running Skype the way we wanted to run it. Now that the earnout is out of the way and we have taken the write-down, we have the opportunity to have a new day at Skype.''

HEADLINE: Distressing Trends for Food Banks: More Clients, Fewer Supplies

BYLINE: By WINTER MILLER

 BODY:
On a recent weekday at the BedStuy Campaign Against Hunger, one of Brooklyn's largest food pantries, shelves that are usually piled high with staples like rice and canned meats were empty, a stark illustration of the crisis facing emergency food providers across the city.
 The Brooklyn organization is among about 1,000 food pantries and soup kitchens supplied by the Food Bank for New York City, the largest distributor of free food in the city, whose mission has been crippled by what officials describe as its worst food shortage in years. 
 At its sprawling warehouse in Hunts Point, in the Bronx, the Food Bank is storing about half what it housed in recent years. Instead of distributing 5.5 million pounds of food a month to food banks and soup kitchens, the Food Bank now offers 3 million pounds. So rather than having 10 trucks on the road at any given time, there are now only 3 or 4.
 ''It's the first time in a few years that I could walk into the warehouse and see empty shelves,'' said Lucy Cabrera, the president and chief executive of the Food Bank, which helps feed about 1.3 million people a year.
 Officials at the Food Bank say the bare shelves stem from a steady decline in federal emergency food aid, though a farm bill stalled in the United States Senate could increase that aid. 
 According to a study to be released today by the Food Bank and Cornell University, New York City receives a little more than half the amount of emergency food annually from the federal government that it did three years ago. The shortfall is occurring as the number of families and individuals relying on soup kitchens and food pantries in New York City has risen to 1.3 million from 1 million since 2004. 
 As a result, food pantry workers say, people in need are getting fewer provisions and less variety, and some pantries have been forced to open less frequently. And the demand for emergency food will most likely rise as families spend more of their incomes on school and holiday expenses, Food Bank officials said.
 Rethea Bruno, 63, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant and is a regular at several local food pantries, described the supply she found at the Campaign Against Hunger pantry as ''pitiful.'' ''You're getting less food,'' she said. ''You get the bags home and you're stunned.'' 
 The problem besetting the citywide Food Bank is also affecting providers of emergency food nationwide who are supplied by America's Second Harvest, the country's largest hunger relief organization, which assists 50,000 providers. Federal food donations to food banks have been stagnant since 2002. 
 But organizations have been hit hardest by declines in a separate federal program that buys excess crops like peaches and potatoes from farmers and then donates them to food banks. Those donations have shrunk to 89 million pounds last year from 251 million pounds in 2003. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, says he is optimistic that the farm bill will pass within the next month. He said the delay involved sections of the bill unrelated to the nutrition portion. 
 Separately, the House of Representatives voted in July to increase the budget for food stamps and other nutrition programs by $4 billion, which would include an increase in emergency food assistance to $250 million from $140 million. It also would require an automatic increase in food assistance based on the rate of inflation, addressing one of the reasons food banks are now struggling. 
 At the Campaign Against Hunger pantry in Brooklyn, which is usually a hub of activity as visitors catch up with one another on the latest gossip, fewer people are showing up since word got out that the cupboards were running bare. On one day, the middle aisle held 13 cans of corned beef, a single jar of peanut butter and a few hundred cans of spaghetti in sauce. The canned and fresh fruit were gone. 
 ''It's devastating,'' said the Rev. Melony Samuels, a minister at the Full Gospel Tabernacle of Faith who oversees the food pantry. ''It has gotten so bad.''
 A storage room the pantry uses was filled with mostly empty wooden pallets. ''It's not that we have the stuff and we're not putting it out,'' Ms. Samuels said. ''It's out.'' 
 In better times, the pantry might get 190 cases of assorted foods every week; now the shipments are much smaller. One recent week, all it got was six cases of peanut butter and pasta. 
 ''In order to keep food on our shelves, we need to roll in $5,000 per month easily, and you're looking at half or less of that coming in,'' Ms. Samuels said, adding that she might not be able to stock her pantry with turkeys for Thanksgiving.
 Penny Flood, 48, who manages the kitchen at Neighbors Together, a soup kitchen near the Campaign Against Hunger pantry, says she is also getting less food and less variety. In the basement storeroom, Ms. Flood pointed out that the shelves for vegetables were depleted but that those used to store cans of tuna were full. 
 Ms. Samuels, who has the task of turning away hungry customers from the Campaign Against Hunger pantry, worries that if the shortage continues she may have to close her doors. ''If that farm bill does not pass, I honestly don't know what we're going to do,'' she said. ''I don't know what we're going to say to people.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS Dow Dips, but Nasdaq Stages a Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a volatile session mixed yesterday as investors' concerns about sluggish housing and tight credit intensified their uneasiness over corporate profits. Rising oil prices only added to the market's malaise. 
 Upbeat earnings reports from Yahoo and Intel encouraged buying in the technology sector, which drove the Nasdaq composite index sharply higher.
But the Dow Jones industrial average dipped on uncertainty about how well corporate America will fare over all, particularly after I.B.M. reported modest software sales and United Technologies said 2008 would be challenging.
 The Dow fell 20.40, or 0.15 percent, to 13,892.54, paring the session's worst losses after falling more than 130 points in earlier trading.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 2.71, or 0.18 percent, to 1,541.24, while the Nasdaq gained 28.76, or 1.04 percent, to 2,792.67. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.54, or 0.19 percent, to 824.89.
 The Dow and the S.& P. both hit records last week, but Wall Street has since pulled back on anxiety about the slowing economy. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve said in its beige book that growth cooled in the third quarter. Investors are also jittery about accelerating inflation -- which could prevent the Fed from lowering rates again -- after oil prices momentarily touched a fresh high of $89 a barrel.
 Oil gave up the gains, however, losing 22 cents to close at $87.29 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The lending landscape, meanwhile, continued to deteriorate. Standard & Poor's cut the ratings on 1,713 classes of securities backed by mortgages issued in the first six months of this year. They were valued at $23.35 billion.
 Bond prices rose sharply on the news that new-home construction in September slowed to the weakest pace in 14 years. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 23/32, to 101 17/32. The yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 4.55 percent, from 4.65 percent.
 Investor expectations for the third quarter had been low, given the turmoil in the financial and credit markets during the summer. Some early profit reports -- particularly in the financial sector -- proved disappointing. Strong results from component companies of the Dow -- including JPMorgan Chase and Intel -- did not offset investor unease over results from two other components, I.B.M. and United Technologies.
 United Technologies fell $2.85, or 3.6 percent, to $76.80, despite a 20 percent rise in profit. The company said it expected international growth to moderate and foresaw a continued slowdown in the American economy.
 I.B.M. lost $3.82, or 3.2 percent, to $115.78. The company posted a 6 percent profit rise, but investors focused on the modest 3 percent rise in software revenue.
 JPMorgan was up $1.26, or 2.8 percent, to $46.37 on the bank's 2 percent rise in profit despite big write-downs related to soured mortgages and leveraged corporate debt.
 Yahoo, which said late Tuesday that third-quarter profit fell less than analysts had expected, gained $2.13, or 8 percent, to $28.82.
 Intel posted a 43 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, and its shares jumped $1.24, or 5 percent, to $26.72.

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls To New Low Compared With Euro

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The dollar sank to a new low against the euro Thursday as fresh evidence of losses in the mortgage industry stoked fears of a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in the United States and crude oil rose to another record.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro traded at $1.4294, up from $1.4186 on Wednesday. Crude oil for November delivery rose $2.07, or 2.4 percent, to $89.47 a barrel. In after-hours electronic trading, the price rose slightly above $90. 
 The declining dollar has made commodities, which are priced in dollars, more attractive as investments, while tensions between Turks and Kurds over border violence in northern Iraq have helped keep oil prices rising. 
 The dollar's retreat came as European employers issued their clearest call yet for international action at the Group of 7 meeting, which begins on Friday, to curb currency market volatility. A strong euro has the potential to slow European exports, and volatility upsets plans for hedging.
 BusinessEurope, the Brussels federation of employers' associations, said in a letter to four European finance ministers that the ''unduly rapid movements'' of currencies were ''an increasing source of concern, with the euro and other European currencies reaching historically high levels in recent months.'' It also called for an upward valuation of the yuan and the yen.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed Oct. 8 to advocate for a higher yuan at the Group of 7 meeting. Officials overseeing the euro will also visit China before the end of the year to urge Beijing to revalue its currency.
 After appearing to stabilize for a few weeks, the euro rose to an all-time high of $1.4310 during trading Thursday before giving up some of its gains. 
 Markets were rattled Thursday when Bank of America reported a sharp drop in third-quarter profit because of write-downs of bad debts; poor results from investment banking, reflecting credit market turmoil; and consumer banking setbacks. That helped feed worries that the credit squeeze stemming from the housing industry's decline would hit corporate profits and slow growth.
 ''It's amazing how much these initial announcements can drive a dollar sell-off these days,'' said Simon Derrick, head of currency research in London for Bank of New York Mellon. ''That said, I think the skids were already underneath the dollar earlier this week.''
 Indeed, the data continued a bad week for the United States economy, where an end to housing industry woes is not yet in sight. A government report Wednesday showed that new home construction plunged to a 14-year low in September.
 New signs of weakness in the United States could lead the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate when it meets this month, a step that might bolster the economy but would also reduce the appeal of dollar-denominated assets. 
 Coming at a time when the European Central Bank is considering when to raise rates again, this differential in rates has emerged as a main driver of the dollar's weakness.
 BusinessEurope called on the Group of 7 finance ministers and central bankers to find solutions ''within the sphere of multilateral consultations, and notably with clear commitments in the G-7.'' The letter was also signed by the heads of business lobbies in Germany, France and Italy. ''Persistent disequilibria in the world economy continue to harbor the danger of further appreciation of European currencies in the face of large external deficits in the U.S. and inflexible currency regimes in other parts of the world,'' they wrote.
 The comment alluded to the enormous United States current account deficit, whose sheer size has left currency markets vulnerable to jitters that foreigners would tire of lending the cash required to cover the shortfall, a reflection of how much more Americans spend than they save.
 It also referred to China's foreign exchange management, which has kept the yuan low against the dollar.

 'THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS' In previews; opens on Nov. 8. This adaptation of a C. S. Lewis novel takes the point of view of a demon (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.
 'SPAIN' In previews; opens on Oct. 30. This modern-day fairy tale is about a recently divorced woman with an overactive imagination (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200.
 'THINGS WE WANT' Previews start on Monday. Opens on Nov. 7. Ethan Hawke directs a new dark comedy by Jonathan Marc Sherman about three brothers forced to live together after the death of their parents. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.
 'YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN' In previews; opens on Nov. 8. Mel Brooks follows ''The Producers'' with this mock-horror musical directed by Susan Stroman (2:45). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. 
 Broadway
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened on Broadway 32 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'DIVIDING THE ESTATE' In the midst of death we are inescapably in life, with all its attendant pettiness, in Horton Foote's deeply funny play about a quarrelsome, greedy Texas clan going downhill fast. Michael Wilson directs a fine cast that includes Elizabeth Ashley, Penny Fuller, Gerald McRaney and the incomparable Hallie Foote (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'THE GOLDMAN PROJECT' This tidy drama about the secret of a Holocaust survivor proves to be an unlikely light entertainment (2:00). June Havoc Theater at the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)
 'GREETINGS FROM YORKVILLE' No theme is hardier in musical theater than that of the ingenue trying to break into the big time: In this slender but sweet musical, basically a glorified cabaret evening, the set-up has a veritable reality-show spin, since it is the true story of the people who wrote and are performing it. Anya Turner and Robert Grusecki, a struggling team of songwriters, portray their efforts to get ahead in the songs they wrote along the way, some of which are very good, and which are well sung, particularly by Ms. Turner, who has a deep, warm voice with a hint of whiskey in its color. The question is whether the happy ending that this piece cries out for is actually being provided by its current incarnation (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Anne Midgette) 
 'HAMLET' The Pearl Theater Company's deliberately modest production, directed by Shepard Sobel, makes a virtue of simplicity and throws the role of Hamlet in high relief, as it should be. Sean McNall, with his pleasant, open face, seems at first an odd, too light choice for Hamlet. But he uses his agreeable manner as a weapon that lends force to the character's quick turns to sarcasm and cruelty and anger. And, best of all, he makes us listen to Hamlet's rushing thoughts. This production may not be daring, or even particularly emotional, yet there's real value in a working company smartly engaged in Shakespeare (2:45). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters. (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'THE POWER OF DARKNESS'Leo Tolstoy's rarely produced morality play about greed and redemption is an intriguing curiosity, more interesting than good (3:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Zinoman) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story, but the starry cast, which includes Sarah Wynter and Sarita Choudhury, plays it all with a chilly detachment (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'ROCK DOVES' Marie Jones, who wrote the popular two-hander ''Stones in His Pockets,'' considers the troubles that have followed the end of the Troubles in this Belfast-set comedy-drama. Four marginal characters share their sorrowful pasts when they take refuge together in an abandoned building. Fine acting transcends the writing's flaws (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 53rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Caryn James) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and plenty of eye-rolling to be had in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Hampton) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 'WHEN THE MESSENGER IS HOT' Chick lit for the stage, basically, with three actresses dividing the role of an urban woman undergoing an emotional crisis. Mother is dying, and a good man is hard to find. Genial but pedestrian (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 
 Off Off Broadway
 'THE BEEBO BRINKER CHRONICLES' If you can still get a ticket, do so. This overheated, over-the-top saga, based on Ann Bannon's pre-Stonewall lesbian novels, is teeming with delights (1:30). Fourth Street Theater, 83 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (La Rocco)
 'NIGHTMARE: GHOST STORIES' This annual Lower East Side haunted house has some decent frights, though you may leave wishing there had been more. An accompanying maze, new this year, is disappointing (1:00). Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

 Last Chance
 'THE CHILDREN OF VONDERLY' In this risk-taking new play by Lloyd Suh, an assortment of adopted siblings with disabilities has grown to adulthood, and their house has become a sort of de facto group home. But the death of the family patriarch and the frailness of his wife leave everyone considering the future. Mr. Suh, whose play is given a fine production by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, explores the seldom-discussed world beyond those feel-good Special Olympics posters: disabled children too can have leaving-the-nest issues (2:05). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE DINING ROOM' A respectful, understated revival of A. R. Gurney's portrait of a well-to-do Northeastern society that is dramatically changing, if not coming to a complete end (2:00). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'IPHIGENIA AT AULIS' At only 45 minutes, the Gardzienice Theater's production is not exactly the play that Euripides wrote but an impressionistic meditation on it, with the emphasis on movement and music. Language -- much of the dialogue is delivered in Polish, with no subtitles -- is just another element of sound and rhythm. If you don't have a good working knowledge of the story, that can be frustrating, which is too bad, because the director, Wlodzimierz Staniewski, has found the means to make resonant themes physical, including the way communal will can work in terrifying ways. La MaMa Annex, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Saltz) 
 'NIGHT OVER TAOS' Maxwell Anderson's 1932 play about 19th-century rebels in New Mexico demonstrates why the playwright is out of fashion (2:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-0255; closes on Sunday. (James) 
 'SCARCITY' An unpersuasive and at times repellent slice of white-trash life. Lucy Thurber's comedy-drama opens a grimy window on a poor family's garden-variety dysfunctions in Massachusetts. Beer, battery, boredom (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)
 'TILL THE BREAK OF DAWN' The performance artist Danny Hoch's first full-length play is warm and often likable, but also a bit of a mess. A group of young urban idealists from New York City pay a visit to Havana, where they meet various locals and a refugee from the Black Power movement. Mr. Hoch's lively characters and charged-up dialogue are a pleasure; the play's slack structure and prolixity are not (2:15). Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closes on Saturday. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE WOLVES IN THE WALLS' High-spirited, all-out Halloween season fun (1:15). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010; closes on Sunday. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 
 'THE YOUNG LADIES OF ... ' Taylor Mac has fashioned a delightfully invigorating new take on the searching-for-my-father theme. He (performing in drag) uses letters he says were written to his father, a soldier in Vietnam, by women in response to a newspaper advertisement Dad ran, seeking correspondents and possible R&R dates. But his real interest is in making his own connection to Dad, whom he barely knew. A droll family slide show, some nutty songs and a lot of references to the musical ''Carousel'' are all part of the mix; only at the end does Mr. Mac indulge in some cliches (1:20) Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Saturday.

HEADLINE: Experts Urge Exchange of Scientific Talent

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
The federal government should create a commission to promote the free flow of scientific knowledge and researchers from other countries while balancing the threat from enemies, an expert panel said Thursday. 
 The panel, appointed by the National Research Council, which provides advice to American policymakers, said colleges and research institutions must continue to bring in foreign science and engineering students. ''The global scientific enterprise thrives on the movement of students and scholars across borders and among institutions,'' it said in a report.
 ''For more than 50 years,'' the report says, ''U.S. research universities, the envy of the world, have welcomed and fostered the talents of both foreign-born and U.S. students in the service of national and economic security.''
 With fewer American students choosing careers in science and engineering, the American research and development effort cannot be sustained without a significant and steady infusion of foreign participants, the committee said. 
 But the panel said safeguards are needed to ensure that important research does not fall into the wrong hands. It recommended creating a standing government commission ''to address ongoing shared concerns of the security and academic research communities,'' including export and visa policies and participation of foreigners in research.
 The commission should be led by the president's national security adviser and the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and include representatives from academic research institutions and national security agencies, the panel recommended.
 Forming this commission, the panel said, should allow the government to strike a balance between science and security.
 Jacques Gansler of the University of Maryland, a former Pentagon official who is co-chairman of the committee, said research institutions have taken steps since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to address security concerns.
 ''However, both the security and scientific communities agree that losing our leading edge in science and technology is one of the greatest threats to national security,'' Dr. Gansler said in a statement. ''Unnecessary or ill-conceived restrictions could jeopardize the scientific and technical progress that our nation depends upon.''

HEADLINE: Head of Reconstruction Teams in Iraq Reports Little Progress Throughout Country

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Attempts by American-led reconstruction teams to forge political reconciliation, foster economic growth and build an effective police force and court system in Iraq have failed to show significant progress in nearly every one of the nation's provincial regions and in the capital, a federal oversight agency reported on Thursday.
 The report, by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, comes as the United States tries to take advantage of a drop in overall violence to create a functioning government here. 
 The release of the report was linked to testimony on Thursday by the special inspector general, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee.
 There are bright spots in the effort to put together a functioning nation, Mr. Bowen found: economic growth in the Kurdish north; tribal reconciliation in the western desert province of Anbar; and patchy progress in the development of local governments. Beyond that, some of the provinces are showing increasing ability to create plans, write contracts and carry out construction projects to rebuild Iraq's physical infrastructure, the report says.
 A central finding of the report, Mr. Bowen said in his testimony, was that even with 32 of the teams, called provincial reconstruction teams, or P.R.T.'s, now deployed around the country at a cost of $1.9 billion as of August, the program still has not developed concrete methods to measure the effects of the teams on progress in the country.
 Mr. Bowen said his office had recommended a year ago that more definite performance measures be put in place. ''I would like to have been able to come today and tell you that those plans have been developed and those metrics are being applied, but they haven't,'' Mr. Bowen said, according to a transcript of his remarks by the Federal News Service.
 Still, the report did find that the teams had made ''incremental progress'' in selected areas ''despite continuing political and ethnic conflicts, as well as the difficult security situation.''
 The counselor for public affairs at the United States Embassy in Baghdad, Philip T. Reeker, said, without specifying details, that the embassy had some reservations about the way Mr. Bowen's office had gauged progress by the P.R.T.'s in Iraq.
 But Mr. Reeker added, ''We share many of the report's observations and its assessment that P.R.T.'s have achieved measurable progress in a short period of time under very challenging circumstances.''
 The teams were assembled to promote reconciliation, support counterinsurgency operations, foster development and build the capacity of local officials to govern, Mr. Reeker said. ''Implementing democratic, transparent governance takes time and requires long-term commitment,'' he said.
 Perhaps the most revealing information in the report emerges not from the grading of the teams themselves, but in the extraordinary geographic reach they provide in observing and assessing the current state of play in the areas of politics, economics, security and the rule of law in Iraq.
 The report collected observations from most of the 32 teams, and pieced together an almost encyclopedic view that has been sorely lacking as both the American and Iraqi governments try to gauge how far the country has come in binding its wounds, creating functioning institutions and restoring services.
 The picture that emerges is far from confidence-inspiring, and raises the question of whether any Western program, no matter how well founded, can overcome the challenges of putting Iraq back together again.
 Dividing the country into five regions in order to assess problems and progress, the report gave, at best, mixed grades to all five.
 In the northern provinces, the report found, ''efforts have failed to significantly influence sectarian and tribal leaders to address the issue of reconciliation.'' Uncertainty over the fate of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, which at some point must decide whether or not to join the semiautonomous provinces in the far north, ''is casting a shadow over the region,'' the report found.
 In the center, where Baghdad is located, local institutions are taking over functions once carried out by United States officials. But getting Iraqis to take responsibility for maintaining facilities built by the United States, like water treatment plants or office buildings, ''remains a significant challenge,'' the report found.
 In the province of Diyala, just to the east of Baghdad, there have been moves toward reconciliation, ''but it will take years to overcome ill will between tribes.''
 The provinces just to the south of Baghdad are ''economically stagnant'' and in the southern provincial capital of Basra, the small- and medium-size businesses that flourished before the 2003 invasion have since withered.
 ''Efforts to restart them are stymied by a lack of skill or interest,'' the report found.
 Even in Anbar, where the tribes have joined with the United States to fight militants associated with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown Sunni extremist group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign-led, a lack of fuel and reliable electricity is hindering economic development, the report found.
 In spite of those challenges, Mr. Reeker of the United States Embassy said, the presence of the teams in the provinces to collect such detailed information in a country still clouded by the fog of war is in itself an advantage for the American effort here.
 ''Reporting and analysis from the field makes a huge difference -- that we have people out in the field to do that,'' Mr. Reeker said.

HEADLINE: A Losing Session Ends on a Late Bounce

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street pared its losses to finish mostly flat yesterday but remained uneasy after disappointing results from Bank of America provided further evidence that the credit crisis was hurting the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell as much as 60 points early in the session, rebounded as bargain hunters entered the market, betting that yesterday's dismal data could persuade the Federal Reserve to lower rates again.
 Bank of America, considered a bellwether for the banking industry because it has branches across the country, said ''significant dislocations'' in the capital markets sent third-quarter profits down 32 percent. Citigroup and Washington Mutual reported similar results in recent days.
 Treasuries rallied and the dollar fell to a new low against the euro after the Labor Department said the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits shot up last week by the largest amount since February. The report was far worse than economists expected, and signaled that the labor market could be starting to weaken from a downturn in housing and the global credit turmoil.
 ''There are so many factors going on right now between the dollar getting crushed, oil moving higher and news out of the banking sector,'' said Gregory A. Church, chief investment officer of Church Capital Management. ''Yet, it is amazing to me that this market continues to lift its head. The market came back somewhat because there's that whole camp that thinks any bad news is good news that the Fed will lower rates.''
 The Dow fell 3.58, or 0.03 percent, to 13,888.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.16, or 0.08 percent, to 1,540.08, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index added 6.64, or 0.24 percent, to 2,799.31. 
 Technology shares have outperformed this week as some investors regarded profits at some of these companies as better able to withstand an economic slowdown.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies edged up 0.14, or 0.02 percent, to 825.03.
 Oil prices continued their advance amid further tensions between Turkey and Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. Light crude rose $2.07 to settle at a record $89.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Technology could provide a bright spot for uneasy investors today. After yesterday's closing bell, Google posted a 46 percent jump in its third-quarter profit, topping the big expectations that had elevated the Internet search leader's stock price by more than $100 in the last month. Google, which ended the regular session up $6.14 at $639.62, rose to $647.00 in heavy after-hours trading.
 About 60 members of the S.& P. 500 have reported quarterly results so far this week. Most of the attention has been on the nation's biggest banks, which reported mostly disappointing results on write-downs from leveraged loans, mortgages and consumer credit.
 Bank of America fell $1.18, or 2.4 percent, to $48.85.
 Washington Mutual tumbled $2.55, or 7.7 percent, to $30.52 after it reported quarterly profit plunged 72 percent.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 16/32, to 101 17/32. Its yield, which moves inversely to prices, fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.55 percent.

HEADLINE: A Shot in the Night and Its Aftermath

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Worlds collide with violent consequences in ''A View From 151st Street,'' a new play by Bob Glaudini presented by the LAByrinth Theater Company at the Public Theater. The worlds in question are rather alien places in the universe of New York theater. Set in Harlem, Mr. Glaudini's modest, quietly moving drama offers a needed corrective to flashier, more widely disseminated depictions of the meaner streets of Manhattan. 
 Thumbnail descriptions of its central characters -- good cop, bad drug dealer, addict in rehab -- may evoke images typical of the police procedurals glaring from television screens 24 hours a day. And the plot does hinge on a calamitous meeting between cop and dealer that ends when gunshots rip into the night and rip apart a life or two.
 But Mr. Glaudini (the author of last season's similarly understated ''Jack Goes Boating''), his sensitive director, Peter DuBois, and the skilled cast are not in the business of selling lurid sensation. The spray of gunfire in ''A View From 151st Street'' carries a slighter dramatic charge than the keenly observed interplay of the men and women trying to reconstruct their lives in its aftermath. 
 The play's starkly divided structure translates one of its important ideas into clear theatrical imagery: namely that there are many different social and cultural economies jumbled together, side by side but distinctly separate, in the upper reaches of Manhattan. The neighborhood is nothing so simple as a turbulent melting pot, in which the bad inevitably taints or destroys the good. Violent conflicts may occur, but they are not an everyday occurrence in the lives of the neighborhood's inhabitants.
 Delroy, the dealer and a relentless amateur rapper, lives most of his life on the street and in his head. Played with a rhythmic bounce and a blustery bravado by Craig (muMs) Grant, Delroy stands alone, deep into the beats in his earphones, reeling off rhymes full of braggadocio and the usual explicit epithets as he waits for buyers to show up. Japhy Weideman's lighting and the evocative set by David Korins place him in a glum nightscape cut off from the rest of the drama, which largely takes place in the modest apartment of Daniel (Juan Carlos Hernandez), a detective who takes a bullet when a buy from Delroy goes disastrously awry.
 Daniel returns home with no control over his bodily functions, no memory of his wife, Lena (Liza Colon-Zayas), or sister, Irene (Elizabeth Rodriguez), and certainly no recollection of having invited an old Army buddy, Ray (Andre Royo), to share the apartment while he recovers from his addiction to crack cocaine. Lena and particularly the feisty Irene are wary of Ray's presence but grateful to have another pair of hands available to feed and dress Daniel and help him through the long, wearying process of rewiring his body and mind, beginning with learning the alphabet. 
 Language is a particular concern for Mr. Glaudini, whose characters speak many different flavors of English. Daniel's detective colleague, Monroe (Russell G. Jones), who stops by to check on his progress and squeeze out some clues to the identity of his assailant, takes pride in the clarity and formality of his speech. He can't help but make cracks about Ray's looser way with verb forms. Ray, meanwhile, becomes irritated when Mara (Marisa Malone), the Russian nurse who helps with Daniel's therapy, and with whom Ray is carrying on, makes the word ''bicycle'' sound powerfully Slavic when she is tutoring him.
 The common ground of a shared language, Mr. Glaudini subtly suggests, may not be easy to reach or maintain, but is vital in keeping the healthier channels of human relationships functioning. The solipsistic, profanity-laced rants of Delroy -- almost incomprehensible at times -- mark him as a character beyond the reach of the healthy feeling that flows between Daniel and his family and friends. And when one of the play's characters suddenly descends into the mire of crack addiction, the first thing to go is his grasp of words.
 Perhaps because Mr. Glaudini's understanding of the forms and functions of language is so sensitive, he is a laconic writer who prefers economy and precision to overelaboration. Most of the exchanges in ''A View From 151st Street'' are loosely shaped, without much care for making a major dramatic point. And the cast of characters is too expansive for each one to develop many layers.
 Still, vivid performances and a mellow jazz-funk score by Michael Cain help put flesh on the play's strong but spare bones. Terrifically performed live, by a trio conducted by Paul J. Thompson, the musical interludes ease the transitions between the distinct worlds of the play and provide an underscoring of emotional texture, a mood of languid melancholy, that perfectly fits the quiet grooves of Mr. Glaudini's writing. 
 Ms. Colon-Zayas and Ms. Rodriguez give nicely contrasted, warmly funny performances as the solid and steady Lena and the more tempestuous Irene, each loving and possessive in different ways. Mr. Hernandez makes Daniel's frustration and confusion moving and believable, without employing an unnecessary ounce of poignancy. Mr. Royo's Ray is an economical but fully drawn portrait of a man trying to shake off the ghosts of the past; particularly powerful is the scene in which he wages a nervous, silent battle to conquer a temptation to slip into old habits. 
 There is also much pleasure to be had in simply watching the ease with which the performances flow together, as the men and women whose lives intersect with Daniel's gradually knit themselves into a strong fabric of community. It is not an artificially bright fabric, however. As Daniel's crisis slowly abates, others threaten.
 Mr. Glaudini is too honest an observer to stoop to easy moralizing. But in showing how those who fall into the underworld withdraw from the embrace of friends and family, he finds a potent image to illustrate the dehumanizing effects of drugs. When they succumb to the shadowy allure of addiction, Delroy and his clients cut themselves off from the daylight of humanity. They're left alone, in the dark, with only their own ravening demons for company.

 Broadway
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Ben Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley) 
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'DIVIDING THE ESTATE' In the midst of death we are inescapably in life, with all its attendant pettiness, in Horton Foote's deeply funny play about a quarrelsome, greedy Texas clan going downhill fast. Michael Wilson directs a fine cast that includes Elizabeth Ashley, Penny Fuller, Gerald McRaney and the incomparable Hallie Foote (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed ofodd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'THE GOLDMAN PROJECT' This tidy drama about the secret of a Holocaust survivor proves to be an unlikely light entertainment (2:00). June Havoc Theater at the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. 
 (Jason Zinoman)
 'GREETINGS FROM YORKVILLE' No theme is hardier in musical theater than that of the ingenue trying to break into the big time: In this slender but sweet musical, basically a glorified cabaret evening, the set-up has a veritable reality-show spin, since it is the true story of the people who wrote and are performing it. The question is whether the happy ending that this piece cries out for is actually being provided by its current incarnation (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Anne Midgette)'HAMLET' The Pearl Theater Company's deliberately modest production, directed by Shepard Sobel, makes a virtue of simplicity and throws the role of Hamlet in high relief, as it should be. This production may not be daring, or even particularly emotional, yet there's real value in a working company smartly engaged in Shakespeare (2:45). Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Rachel Saltz) 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman)
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan (212) 239-6200. 
 (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters. (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story, but the starry cast, which includes Sarah Wynter and Sarita Choudhury, plays it all with a chilly detachment (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Caryn James) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and plenty of eye-rolling to be had in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'WHEN THE MESSENGER IS HOT' Chick lit for the stage, basically, with three actresses dividing the role of an urban woman undergoing an emotional crisis. Mother is dying, and a good man is hard to find. Genial but pedestrian (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.
 (Isherwood)
 Last Chance
 'THE CHILDREN OF VONDERLY' In this risk-taking new play by Lloyd Suh, an assortment of adopted siblings with disabilities has grown to adulthood, and their house has become a sort of de facto group home. But the death of the family patriarch and the frailness of his wife leave everyone considering the future. Mr. Suh, whose play is given a fine production by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, explores the seldom-discussed world beyond those feel-good Special Olympics posters: disabled children too can have leaving-the-nest issues (2:05). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 
 'IPHIGENIA AT AULIS' At only 45 minutes, the Gardzienice Theater's production is not exactly the play that Euripides wrote but an impressionistic meditation on it, with the emphasis on movement and music. Language -- much of the dialogue is delivered in Polish, with no subtitles -- is just another element of sound and rhythm. If you don't have a good working knowledge of the story, that can be frustrating, which is too bad, because the director, Wlodzimierz Staniewski, has found the means to make resonant themes physical, including the way communal will can work in terrifying ways.

 'TILL THE BREAK OF DAWN' The performance artist Danny Hoch's first full-length play is warm and often likable, but also a bit of a mess. A group of young urban idealists from New York City pay a visit to Havana, where they meet various locals and a refugee from the Black Power movement. Mr. Hoch's lively characters and charged-up dialogue are a pleasure; the play's slack structure and prolixity are not (2:15).

 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE YOUNG LADIES OF ... ' Taylor Mac has fashioned an invigorating new take on the searching-for-my-father theme. He (performing in drag) uses letters he says were written to his father, a soldier in Vietnam, by women in response to a newspaper ad that Dad ran, seeking correspondents and possible R&R dates. But his real interest is in making his own connection to Dad, whom he barely knew. A droll family slide show, some nutty songs and a lot of references to the musical ''Carousel'' are all part of the mix (1:20) Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow.

HEADLINE: The Toughest of Problems In the Brightest of Terms

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
The first thing you'll notice about the PBS series ''E2: The Economies of Being Environmentally Conscious,'' besides the graduate-seminar title, is how beautiful it looks. Scene after scene, from Minnesota wind farms to sari-clad Bangladeshi micro-borrowers to the smoke billowing from coal-fired power plants, is painterly and evocative; a shot, set against a deep blue sky, of a freight train passing in front of an oil refinery could have been lifted from a Terrence Malick film. 
 This high gloss, combined with an unrelenting optimism about the possibilities of confronting, and solving, problems like global warming and third-world poverty with a combination of new technologies and enlightened free market capitalism, gives the series an unusual atmosphere. Most environmental documentaries try to persuade or preach or, these days, scare; ''E2'' feels as if it's trying to cheerlead and to sell.
 That makes it an odd fit on today's PBS, where news and public affairs programs like ''Frontline,'' ''Now'' and ''Bill Moyers Journal,'' with their reporting and advocacy on Iraq, civil liberties and other fraught topics, are simultaneously among the best and the gloomiest shows on television. ''E2'' won't be joining those shows in prime time, not in New York, anyway; its second six-episode season begins this afternoon at 3:30 on WNET's high-definition channel, with a report on community-based wind cooperatives.
 The program does give screen time to naysayers; in an episode that examines ideas for making coal-fired and nuclear power plants cleaner and safer, one of the talking heads argues forcefully against a plan to sequester huge amounts of carbon dioxide emissions in underground geologic formations. But he's drowned out by the positive chorus: ''We will solve the world's energy problems'' is the takeaway.
 And why not? The series's producers -- a former advertising executive and a filmmaker who met shooting a deodorant commercial -- have every right to be positive, and that attitude probably helped them recruit Morgan Freeman as their narrator. (And, no, the show isn't sponsored by Mobil or BP; the primary sponsor appears to be Autodesk, a maker of design software.)
 The one thing I missed in the program's ''solutions-based storytelling'' (in the words of the production company's press notes) were any solutions that had to do with changing our consumption-based habits. Apparently no sacrifices will be necessary; our ''needs'' for energy and capital can be met indefinitely through technological wizardry and common sense. I'm not sure that I'd want to have to make that case to the stone-faced crowds of Bangladeshi men in the backgrounds of the gorgeously shot segment on the miracle of micro-lending.

HEADLINE: Putin Criticizes U.S. on Iran, Missile Defense and Iraq War

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin used a three-hour session in which he answered questions from the Russian people on Thursday to reiterate his criticism of the Bush administration's missile-defense plan, its stance on Iran and the Iraq war. 
 Mr. Putin also waded into domestic issues, trying to tamp down fears of rising inflation and saying that he wanted a powerful Parliament in place after legislative elections in December. But he did not offer any hint about whom he would endorse to be his successor as president when his term ends next year.
 Mr. Putin announced this month that he would lead United Russia, the party that he created and that dominates the political landscape, in the parliamentary elections and that he might become prime minister after his term as president ends.
 As he has in previous years, Mr. Putin displayed a detailed knowledge of numerous topics as he spoke before a live television audience and answered questions from Russians around the country, some delivered live, some phoned in or sent by e-mail.
 Officials said more than 2.5 million questions were submitted; the president answered more than 50 of them. The questions were screened in advance. While many people expressed concern about specific issues -- including housing, the cost of food and the quality of health care -- none of the questions that were answered during the session were overtly hostile to Mr. Putin.
 Though most questions focused on domestic matters, Mr. Putin was also asked about foreign policy, and he often responded with criticism of the United States. Apparently referring to President Bush's intensified warnings to Iran over its nuclear program, Mr. Putin said dialogue was more productive than ''a policy of threats, various sanctions or power politics.'' 
 He described the Iraq war as ''absolutely pointless'' and said the United States should set a date for withdrawing its troops.
 Mr. Putin met last week in Moscow with the American secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, attacking the Bush administration's plans to build parts of a missile-defense system in Central Europe.
 Speaking on Thursday, Mr. Putin indicated that he thought that the Americans were taking into consideration Russia's alarm about the system. But he noted that Russia was prepared to retaliate if changes were not made, though he did not say how.
 ''I assure you that such steps are being planned, and we will take them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Leaders of Venezuela and Colombia, Ideological Opposites, Are Tightening Ties

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has no closer friend in South America than President Alvaro Uribe, an Oxford-educated lawyer raised in the privileged world of cattle estates and elite schools. Hugo Chavez, the president of neighboring Venezuela, was born into poverty and rose through the ranks of the army before emerging as the chief scourge of American policy in the region. 
 Such ideological opposites might be expected to focus on historical rivalries between their countries, which were at the edge of war as recently as the late 1980s. Instead, they are rapidly moving to strike energy deals, resolve a boundary dispute and increase trade, with Colombia's exports to Venezuela climbing to a record $4 billion this year. 
 ''This is the most favorable moment for relations between the two countries since they separated in 1830,'' said Socorro Ramirez, a political scientist at the National University here and a specialist on Venezuela, referring to the origins of Colombia and Venezuela as one nation after their independence from Spain. 
 Obstacles to warmer ties persist, with senior officials often exchanging barbs. Their 1,400-mile border remains a haven for guerrillas, drug trafficking and other intrigue; two Colombian intelligence agents were recently killed on the Venezuelan side in an unsolved incident. New tolls at the Colombian border led to protests in Venezuela in October. 
 But Mr. Uribe has surprised Colombia's conservative establishment by embracing projects that have lifted Mr. Chavez's profile across the region. Most boldly, he welcomed Mr. Chavez's offer to help broker the release of dozens of captives held by Colombia's largest rebel group, including three American military contractors captured in 2003. 
 [At a summit meeting near Venezuela's border on Oct. 12 to inaugurate a pipeline taking Colombian natural gas to its neighbor, Mr. Uribe also offered to join the Bank of the South, a regional development bank championed by Venezuela as an alternative to Washington-based institutions like the World Bank.] 
 American concerns over drug trafficking and energy security are in play in this new stage of Andean diplomacy. The United States remains the main consumer for both Colombia's cocaine and Venezuela's oil, but Washington's low prestige in much of the Andes has left Mr. Uribe, boxed in by pro-Chavez governments in Ecuador and Bolivia, with little choice but to strengthen bonds with Mr. Chavez.
 Mr. Uribe is still subject to taunts from Mr. Chavez, who practices a confrontational style ingrained in Venezuela's political system, as when he urged the Colombian leader in October to lend a guerrilla leader a plane to travel to Caracas for talks. The suggestion was met here with bland declarations of respect for Venezuela as a ''brother country.'' 
 ''What exists in Venezuela, as well as Colombia, is political leadership that reflects the popular will, and we respect that,'' said Fernando Araujo, Colombia's foreign minister. [On Thursday, Mr. Araujo's office disavowed comments in Washington by Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, who said he had little faith in Mr. Chavez's efforts to mediate with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.] 
 Efforts here to engage Mr. Chavez stand in sharp contrast with those of the Bush administration, which has clashed with Venezuela over issues like Mr. Chavez's growing arms purchases from Russia and his tightening political alliances with Cuba and Iran. 
 ''Uribe surely has no illusions about Chavez's regional ambitions, but he wisely keeps any provocative rhetoric in check,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington focusing on Latin America. ''Washington might draw some lessons from Uribe's ability to deal with Chavez.'' 
 Relations between the neighbors have evolved since reaching a critical point in 2005, when a diplomatic crisis erupted over Colombia's abduction in Venezuela of Rodrigo Granda, a senior guerrilla leader with FARC, who had been living near Caracas. Mr. Uribe freed him in September in a gesture intended to move the hostage talks forward; Mr. Granda quickly decamped to Cuba. 
 Since 2005, Mr. Uribe and Mr. Chavez have steadily mended ties, driven largely by growing economic interdependence and Venezuela's ambitions to lessen its reliance on the United States as the main market for its oil.
 Venezuela, for instance, has South America's largest natural gas reserves but still needs more from eastern Colombia to maintain oil production in the region around Lake Maracaibo. But Venezuela has said it would like to reverse the pipeline's flow once its own reserves are tapped. 
 The two countries are also considering a pipeline to take Venezuelan crude oil to Colombia's Pacific coast, a project that would reduce delivery time of exporting oil to China, a cornerstone of Mr. Chavez's desire to diversify Venezuela's energy exports. 
 Recent economic policies in Venezuela, meanwhile, have created bountiful opportunities for Colombia. For instance, Venezuelan farmers stymied by price controls have been unable to meet climbing domestic demand for food, with Colombian farmers rushing to meet Venezuela's shortages of basic food items. 
 ''How long will the honeymoon last?'' Poder, a business magazine here, asked in a report in October marveling at Colombia's new phase of relations with Venezuela. The country's exports to Venezuela are surging almost 50 percent this year, with food gaining 31 percent in the first half of 2007 from last year, and automobile exports surging 59 percent. 
 The Uribe government has developed a nonconfrontational policy toward the Chavez administration; Mr. Chavez has a similar way of dealing with Mr. Uribe. He has avoided pressing him on claims of human rights abuses by death squads, an issue some legislators in Washington have used to delay a trade deal between the United States and Colombia. 
 Scholars liken the warming ties to precedents elsewhere in the region, like the thaw in the 80s between Argentina and Brazil, countries whose militaries were once oriented toward border threats but that are now too busy trading with each other to focus on disputes. 
 The similar governing styles of Mr. Uribe and Mr. Chavez may also have helped the leaders form a bond. Both leaders prioritize close contact with the poor, attack critics in the media and have lashed out at political opponents. 
 ''Uribe is a populist of the right and Chavez is a populist of the left,'' said Kenneth Maxwell, a professor of Latin American history at Harvard. ''They see eye to eye.''

HEADLINE: From The Back Of the Pack

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Rindge, N.H.
 The first thing you notice about Mike Huckabee is that he has a Mayberry name and a Jim Nabors face. But it's quickly clear that Huckabee is as good a campaigner as anybody running for president this year. And before too long it becomes easy to come up with reasons why he might have a realistic shot at winning the Republican nomination:
 First, Republican voters here and in Iowa are restless. That means that there will be sharp movements during the last 30 days toward whoever seems fresh and hot. 
 Second, each of the top-tier candidates makes certain parts of the party uncomfortable. Huckabee is the one candidate acceptable to all factions. 
 Third, Huckabee is the most normal person running for president (a trait that might come in handy in a race against Hillary Clinton). He is funny and engaging -- almost impossible not to like. He has no history of flip-flopping in order to be electable. He doesn't seem to be visibly calculating every gesture. Far from being narcissistic, he is, if anything, too neighborly to seem presidential. 
 Fourth, he is part of the new generation of evangelical leaders. Huckabee was a Baptist minister. But unlike the first generation of politically engaged Christian conservatives, Huckabee is not at war with mainstream America. As a teenager, he loved Jimi Hendrix, and he's now the bass player in a rock band that has opened for Willie Nelson and Grand Funk Railroad. 
 Fifth, though you wouldn't know it from the past few years, the white working class is the backbone of the G.O.P. Huckabee is most in tune with these voters. 
 He was the first male in his family's history to graduate from high school. He paid his way through college by working 40 hours a week and getting a degree in two and half years. He tells audiences that the only soap his family could afford was the rough Lava soap, and that he was in college before he realized showering didn't have to hurt. ''There are people paying $150 for an exfoliation,'' he jokes. ''I could just hand them a bar of Lava soap.''
 His policies reflect that background. At the recent Republican economic debate, he was the candidate who most vociferously argued that the current economy is not working for the middle class. As the others spoke, he thought to himself: ''You guys don't get out much. You should meet somebody who's not handing you a $2,300 check.''
 He condemns ''immoral'' C.E.O. salaries, and on global trade he sounds like a Democrat: ''There's no free trade without fair trade.'' (Polls suggest most Republican voters are, sadly, with him on this).
 Sixth, he's a former governor. He talks about issues in a down-to-earth way that other candidates can't match. For example, he's got a riff on childhood obesity that rivets the attention of his audiences. He asks them to compare their own third-grade class photos with the photos of third graders today. Then he goes down the list of the diseases that afflict preteens who get Type 2 diabetes.
 ''The greatest challenge in health care is not universal coverage,'' he argues while introducing his health care plan. ''It's universal health. A healthy country would be less expensive to cover.''
 Seventh, he's a collaborative conservative. Republicans have tended to nominate heroic candidates in the Reagan mold. Huckabee is more of an interactive leader. His Legislature in Arkansas was 90 percent Democratic, but he got enough done to be named among the nation's top five governors by Time.
 He endorses programs that are ideologically incorrect for conservatives, like his passion for arts education. He can't understand how the argument over the size of the S-chip funding increase became an all-or-nothing holy war. He also criticizes the Bush administration for its arrogance. ''There was a time when people looked up to the U.S. Now they resent us, not because we're a superpower but because we act like one.''
 Huckabee has some significant flaws as a candidate. His foreign policy thinking is thin. Some of his policy ideas seem to come off the top of his head (he vows, absurdly, to make the U.S. energy independent within eight years).
 But Huckabee is something that the party needs. He is a solid conservative who is both temperamentally and substantively different from the conservatives who have led the country over the past few years. 
 He's rising in the polls, especially in Iowa. His popularity with the press corps suggests he could catch a free media wave that would put him in the top tier. He deserves to be there.

HEADLINE: An Improbable Favorite Emerges in Cajun Country

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: FRANKLINTON, La., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
An Oxford-educated son of immigrants from India is virtually certain to become the leading candidate for Louisiana's next governor in Saturday's primary election. It would be an unlikely choice for a state that usually picks its leaders from deep in the rural hinterlands and has not had a nonwhite chief executive since Reconstruction. 
 But peculiar circumstances have combined to make Representative Bobby Jindal, a conservative two-term Republican, the overwhelming favorite. Analysts predict Mr. Jindal, 36, could get more than 50 percent of the vote in the open primary, thus avoiding a November runoff and becoming the nation's first Indian-American governor. If he fails to win a majority, he would face the next-highest vote getter in the runoff. 
 Louisiana Democrats are demoralized, caught between the perception of post-hurricane incompetence surrounding their standard bearer, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who is not running for re-election, and corruption allegations against senior elected officials like William J. Jefferson, the congressman from New Orleans. 
 Leading Democrats begged off the governor's race, and Mr. Jindal's opponents are from the second tier, trailing so badly in polls that Mr. Jindal has ignored most of the scheduled debates among candidates, leaving the challengers to take grumbling verbal shots at his empty chair. 
 The prize is not necessarily an enviable one: Louisiana is the nation's poorest state, measured by per capita income; one of its unhealthiest; the worst in infant mortality; and the least educated. It is last in attracting new college-educated workers. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced by Hurricane Katrina, the police department in New Orleans still operates largely out of trailers, and neighborhoods are still trying to rebuild. 
 ''The storms didn't cause all of our problems -- they revealed a lot of our problems,'' Mr. Jindal said in a brief interview this week. ''It's an incredible opportunity to change the state.'' 
 But he is not a natural fit for Louisiana. The state likes its governors to know the fundamentals of the Cajun two-step, speak some derivation of French patois, and at least get to a duck blind, regularly and publicly. But Mr. Jindal has labored assiduously to overcome the disadvantage of being a non-Cajun, Rhodes Scholar policy wonk whose given name was Piyush, and who has a penchant for 31-point plans. 
 He is a born-again Roman Catholic who has suggested that teaching intelligent design as an alternative to evolution may not be out of place in public schools, favors a ban on abortion and opposes hate-crimes laws. Conservative views aside, the slightly built congressman is anything but a backslapping good ol' boy. 
 He lost to Ms. Blanco in 2003 largely in places like this, Washington Parish, a hardscrabble rural area 70 miles north of New Orleans, where voters openly expressed unease four years ago about opting for someone of Mr. Jindal's race. In areas where the Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke won in the 1991 governor's race -- here and in the deeply conservative parishes of north Louisiana -- Mr. Jindal lost. 
 But by Wednesday, three days before Mr. Jindal's second attempt at the governor's mansion, he was greeted here, if not with great warmth, at least without alarm. The congressman, tossing souvenir cups from a fire truck in a town parade, was met with shouts of ''Hey Bobby!'' from the rural whites lining the route. 
 Mr. Jindal picked out familiar faces in the crowd, greeted the sheriff like an old friend and posed for a picture with man sporting a Confederate flag tattoo. 
 For months, the congressman has cultivated the rural areas where he lost in 2003, ''witnessing'' in remote Pentecostal churches, neutralizing his image of being hyperqualified -- head of the state health department at 24, head of the university system at 28 and under secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services at 30 under President Bush -- that did not help him the last time. In one recent debate, Mr. Jindal boasted that he had made 77 trips to north Louisiana since announcing his candidacy. 
 Insinuations about his excessive intellectual capacity are still being made. ''It's not going to be about the smartest person in this race,'' Walter Boasso, a Democratic state senator and one of Mr. Jindal's opponents, said recently. But such remarks do not seem to be catching on with voters apparently weary of bumbling at the Capitol in Baton Rouge and at City Hall in New Orleans. 
 This time, Mr. Jindal is aiming his multipoint plans at ethical reform in state government, schools and economic development, and attacks on his wonkishness have fallen flat. Mr. Jindal kept a low profile after Hurricane Katrina, but opponents are not attacking him for that either, perhaps because few others in Louisiana's political class have stepped up.
 Mr. Jindal told a group in Jefferson Parish this week that he had ''150 specific proposals,'' after rattling unflinchingly through a good many in a 12-minute speech. 
 He makes a particular case for a ''war on corruption,'' as he puts it, in Baton Rouge, proposing to tighten financial disclosures on lobbyists and legislators and to prohibit business relationships between legislators and the state. He promises to build up infrastructure like ports, to devote attention to research universities and promote technical training. He hardly mentions Mr. Bush, a sharp contrast to four years ago when he often boasted of his connections to the president. 
 Past governors have charged into Baton Rouge promising reform only to founder in the change-resistant Legislature. Mr. Jindal will most likely face long odds too, if he fulfills the near-universal prediction that he will come out on top.

HEADLINE: China's Economic Puzzle

 BODY:
President Hu Jintao used the opening of China's Communist Party Congress on Monday to call for China to rethink its economic path. What's extraordinary is that his country's leadership has failed to do anything about it before that. 
 The strains generated by China's huge investments in export industries are assuming shocking proportions. Unbreathable air and noxious rivers compete for attention with the global damage caused by the enormous consumption of energy and growing carbon emissions. In return, the investments are producing meager job gains. The spending power of Chinese families is lagging far behind economic growth. The no-holds barred development of export industries along the coast, at the expense of the interior, is boosting income inequality to levels rarely seen outside of Africa. 
 China's colossal trade surplus, $186 billion in the first nine months of 2007, is a diplomatic nightmare. The policy of supporting exports with an undervalued currency is fueling pressure in the United States Congress for punitive tariffs on Chinese imports. 
 If this were not enough to alarm the leadership in Beijing, its foreign exchange policy also threatens to become a financial disaster. The central bank is amassing $20 billion to $30 billion in dollar reserves each month to keep a lid on the yuan. The cache now probably tops $1 trillion. The inevitable day when the yuan is allowed to increase in value will see an enormous investment loss.
 Beijing must ease the emphasis on manufacturing exports and do more to expand domestic consumption. To start, it could spend a much larger share of its revenues on the threadbare systems of public health, education and pensions. The lack of an effective social safety net, which encourages the Chinese to save to the hilt, is one of the reasons China's share of consumer spending is among the lowest in the world.
 Perhaps most important, Beijing must also change the way it pegs the value of the yuan to the value of the dollar. That not only pumps up the trade surplus, but it also requires interest rates to remain low to avoid pulling more money into the country and putting upward pressure on the currency. 
 Low interest rates have fed the humongous investment in export facilities, which boosts energy-guzzling industries like steel and construction but produces few jobs. Employment in China is growing by only 1 percent a year. 
 Freeing the exchange rate for the yuan would help rein in investment and channel it into light industry and services, which are more labor intensive and should put less stress on the environment. Rising interest rates would also boost household income. Together, they would contribute to consumer spending. 
 The Chinese leadership realized the need to ''re-balance'' growth in 2004. They have taken some small steps, including modest increases in health spending and tax cuts, but they have been too timid to push hard toward a new strategy. At the local level, export growth remains the only real objective. 
 Beijing must realize that China's stability depends on the deft management of the transition from booming export-led growth to broadly based economic development that is less damaging to the environment and more widely shared. In this country, lawmakers who would punish China need to understand that they are merely fostering Chinese resentment and making it easier for special interests to resist reform by waving the flag. Chest-thumping in Washington makes things worse.

HEADLINE: World Bank Report Puts Agriculture at Core of Antipoverty Effort

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
For the first time in a quarter century, the World Bank's flagship annual report on development puts agriculture and the productivity of small farmers at the heart of a global agenda to reduce poverty. Three-quarters of the world's poor still live in the countryside.
 The World Development Report, released yesterday, is the first on agriculture since 1982. Just a week ago, an internal evaluation unit chided the bank for its neglect of agriculture in Africa and its plummeting financial support for that sector over the past 15 years -- support that did not begin to grow significantly until last year. 
 More broadly, the report crystallizes an emerging consensus among wealthy countries, philanthropists and African governments: Increased public investment in scientific research, rural roads, irrigation, credit, fertilizer and seeds -- the basics of an agricultural economy -- is crucial to helping Africa's poor farmers grow more sorghum, corn, millet, cassava and rice on their miniature plots.
 Foreign aid for agriculture has plunged as support for global health and primary education has surged. The fight against AIDS and other diseases is keeping millions of people alive, and rising elementary school attendance is lifting literacy rates. But most poor Africans make their living in agriculture and need to grow more to feed themselves and earn their way out of destitution, many analysts say.
 ''We're not saying health and education aren't important,'' said Alain de Janvry, one of two authors of the report, ''Agriculture for Development,'' who has taught agricultural economics at the University of California, Berkeley, for 40 years. ''But if you look at Africa, there's no alternative to agriculture as a source of growth.'' 
 The World Bank is not the first to reach this conclusion. African governments, at a 2003 African Union summit, promised to more than double their own very low public spending on agriculture. In 2005, the United Nations Millennium Project, led by the Columbia University economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, advocated major investments to increase the productivity of poor farmers in Africa. 
 Last year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation joined the Rockefeller Foundation to help bring a green revolution to Africa. The Gates Foundation, known for its work on global health, was motivated in part by an awareness that extreme poverty and malnutrition were underlying causes of much of the sickness and premature death plaguing Africa.
 But the bank, the world's leading development institution and financier of antipoverty programs, plays a unique role in advising poor countries, and its return to agriculture is likely to influence practical policies across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where hundreds of millions of farmers and landless laborers are still mired in poverty.
 The 365-page report was conceived before the arrival of the bank's new president, Robert B. Zoellick, but he embraced its themes yesterday in Washington, while acknowledging the recent critical evaluation of the bank's own performance.
 ''To make this successful, we're going to need to increase investment,'' he said at a forum that was shown live on the Web.
 Robert S. McNamara, an earlier World Bank president, initiated the last period of ambitious investment in African agriculture, in the 1970s. Internal evaluations found that many of those projects and subsequent ones failed for a variety of reasons. Often, they were complex, devised and run by professionals from outside the countries being helped and not adopted wholeheartedly by poor countries that had little capacity to carry them out independently and, sometimes, little commitment to poor farmers. 
 In the 1980s, in the era of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the World Bank increasingly withdrew its support from agriculture and expected private markets to spur growth through competition. Bank officials even thought profit-seeking companies would build toll roads in remote parts of Africa. 
 But, as the recent internal evaluation found, private markets often failed to deliver a range of goods and services farmers needed, including improved seeds, fertilizer and credit.
 In India's green revolution, which began in the 1960s with the introduction of new high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat, the World Bank, the United States and the Rockefeller Foundation encouraged the Indian government to play a pivotal role in the provision of seeds, fertilizer and credit, said Uma Lele, an agricultural economist who worked at the bank for 35 years and evaluated many of its agricultural programs before retiring. The Indian state also set floor prices for wheat and rice to ensure farmers a return on their investments.
 In the effort to bring an agrarian revolution to Africa, much of the debate from now on will focus on the role that African governments should play in spurring farm productivity. Economists who have read the World Development Report said there was clearly still a great deal of ferment and disagreement within the bank about many of the particulars. For example, should African governments give farmers subsidies to buy fertilizer, and under what conditions?
 The report notes that agricultural subsidies have a way of becoming deeply entrenched politically long after their original purpose has been served.
 The report found, for example, that if European countries, the United States and other wealthy nations removed all tariffs and subsidies for cotton, soybeans and other oilseeds -- practices that reduce the world price of those commodities and make it harder for unsubsidized farmers in poor countries to compete -- developing countries' share of world trade in cotton and oilseeds would be more than 80 percent in 2015 instead of only about half.
 Derek Byerlee, an agricultural economist with the bank who wrote the report with Professor de Janvry, said at a panel discussion yesterday that the United States' subsidies to cotton growers were ''directly and negatively impacting African farmers.''
 Professor de Janvry said the report was not meant to settle the complicated and difficult policy questions, but ''to change the conversation.''

 BODY:
XEROX'S PROFIT FALLS Xerox said that its quarterly net income fell 53 percent from a year before despite a boost from a tax gain, but solid sales of new color printers helped revenues beat expectations. Xerox, said its third-quarter net income dropped to $254 million, or 27 cents a share, from $536 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company benefited from a tax gain. On an adjusted basis, the earnings represented a 17 percent increase over a year ago. 
 (REUTERS) 
 CATERPILLAR CUTS FORECAST The heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar said that its third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, but lowered its outlook for the year based on slow U.S. economic growth. Shares of Caterpillar fell 5.27 percent, leading the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 360 points. Caterpillar earned $927 million, or $1.40 per share, compared with $769 million, or $1.14 per share in the year-ago quarter. And revenue increased 9 percent, to $11.44 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.43 per share on revenue of $11.19 billion, according to Thomson Financial. (AP) 
 FEWER FLIGHTS AT J.F.K. The Transportation Department, preparing to convene a meeting with airlines on Monday to thin the schedule at Kennedy International Airport in New York, announced that it would like to cut landings and takeoffs there to 80 or 81 per hour. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously estimated the capacity of the airport at 88 to 98 flights per hour in good weather, and 71 flights or fewer in bad weather. The Air Transport Association, the trade group of the major airlines, said in a statement that the number was disappointing. The department, in its announcement, said it favored ''market-based solutions'' to cut traffic, and it has discussed the possibility of raising landing fees in peak periods. The airlines oppose that. MATTHEW L. WALD
 SCHLUMBERGER'S PROFIT Schlumberger reported a 35 percent jump in third-quarter profit that was tempered by weaker-than-expected results in North America. The oilfield-services company said strong demand in Latin America, Russia and Asia offset weakness in the Gulf of Mexico and other domestic markets. But the results did little to encourage investors. Schlumberger shares fell $12.30, or more than 11 percent, to close at $99.32. (AP)
 YAHOO EXECUTIVE LEAVES The chief marketing officer at Yahoo, Cammie Dunaway, is leaving the company, joining a management exodus that has unfolded as the Internet icon struggles to snap out of a financial funk. The company did not give a reason for Ms. Dunaway's departure. She joined Yahoo in 2003. (AP) 
 BOSTON SCIENTIFIC SHARES RISE Small signs of improvement in slumping medical device markets lifted Boston Scientific shares despite a $272 million third-quarter loss for the company, which is aggressively cutting jobs. Boston Scientific's shares rose 57 cents, to $14.42. The loss, reported two days after the company announced 2,300 job cuts, equaled 18 cents a share. Sales rose 1 percent, to $2.048 billion from $2.026 billion a year ago, a slight turnaround from the previous quarter, when sales dipped 2 percent. Not counting expenses related to acquisitions and asset sales, Boston Scientific's profit was 20 cents a share, compared with 10 cents a share a year ago. (AP)
 3M REPORTS SALES GROWTH 3M, the maker of 50,000 products from Scotch tape to electronic road signs, said third-quarter earnings rose 7.4 percent. But an increase in sales was less than analysts estimated, and the company's shares dropped 8.5 percent. Net income climbed to $960 million, or $1.32 a share, from $894 million, or $1.18, a year earlier, 3M said. The company raised its full-year profit forecast. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 PROFIT JUMPS AT MCDONALD'S Strong breakfast sales in the United States and a weak dollar overseas proved a potent combination for McDonald's in the third quarter, helping the fast-food chain to a 27 percent jump in profit despite rising costs. McDonald's posted an impressive $1.07 billion in net income, and executives said they hope to keep the momentum going with more new products, hinting that specialty coffees may be coming soon. Carl Sibilski of Oyster Capital Management said the company's surge may be exaggerated by the weak dollar. (AP)

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Is Reinstated for Man Wrongly Suspected in 9/11

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday reinstated a lawsuit against the F.B.I. that was brought five years ago by an Egyptian student wrongly suspected of aiding the Sept. 11 hijackers with a sophisticated aviation radio in his hotel room.
 The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit by the student, Abdallah Higazy, who was detained for 34 days shortly after the terrorist attack. 
 Mr. Higazy said that during an interrogation an F.B.I. agent coerced him into saying that the radio -- which a security guard at the Millenium Hilton Hotel had said was in his room -- was his when it was not.
 Mr. Higazy, the son of a former Egyptian diplomat, came to New York from Cairo in August 2001 to study computer engineering at the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He had had some schooling in Virginia and was sponsored, in part, by the United States Agency for International Development, which put him up in a 51st-floor corner room at the Millenium, across Church Street from the twin towers.
 When the towers were attacked, Mr. Higazy fled the hotel with all its other panicked guests, taking only his wallet and the clothing on his back. 
 Three months later, he returned to retrieve his belongings and was arrested by the F.B.I. on a material witness warrant after the security guard said he had found the radio, capable of communicating with passing airplanes, in Mr. Higazy's room.
 Within days, Mr. Higazy was given a lie-detector test and interrogated by Special Agent Michael Templeton of the F.B.I. who, Mr. Higazy said, coerced him into claiming ownership of the radio by making threats against his family in Egypt. 
 Mr. Higazy's suit claims that Agent Templeton, who has denied the charges, said he would make sure Egyptian security forces gave his family ''hell'' unless he cooperated. 
 During Mr. Higazy's detention, an airplane pilot, an American, returned to the Hilton to retrieve the radio, which he said he had accidentally left behind in his 50th-floor room. 
 Mr. Higazy was released. The security guard, Ronald Ferry, pleaded guilty to making false statements to the F.B.I., and an internal inquiry cleared Agent Templeton and others of any wrongdoing connected to the false confession.
 In December 2002, Mr. Higazy filed his lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claiming that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination had been violated. The suit was dismissed in a June 2005 decision by Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who wrote in her order that ''Templeton's conduct and threats as a matter of law cannot be classified as conscience-shocking or constitutionally oppressive,'' the appeals court noted.
 In its own ruling, the appeals court sent the question of whether Mr. Higazy's Fifth Amendment rights had in fact been violated back to Judge Buchwald for reconsideration and a potential trial. It said that Agent Templeton was not immune, as an employee of the government, from civil rights claims.
 The law ''asks whether an officer in Templeton's shoes would have known that he was violating the right in question,'' the appellate panel wrote. ''We believe that a reasonable jury could conclude that he did.''
 Earl Ward, one of Mr. Higazy's lawyers, said, ''We're very pleased that the court reinstated the lawsuit, and we're looking forward to bringing this issue before a jury.''
 The F.B.I. declined to comment.

HEADLINE: There's Peril in the Parallels as China Takes a Top Spot

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS China's ruling Communist Party gathered for its 17th National Party Congress this week, it could boast of something that would have been unthinkable in the days of Mao. China now leads the world in the number of publicly traded companies with market values of more than $200 billion. 
 China passed the United States in that regard this year, with 8 companies among the 20 most highly valued ones in world stock markets. The United States has seven, Western Europe has four and Russia has one.
 Such an extraordinary capitalist accomplishment is not necessarily good news for the investors whose purchases propelled the companies to such heights of value. As can be seen from the accompanying tables, which show the world's most valuable companies at the end of the 1980s and the 1990s, dominant markets may be vulnerable to a fall.
 In 1989, it was Japan that stood atop the stock market table, with 14 of the top 20 companies by market capitalization. Those who said Japanese valuations were ridiculous had lost lots of money, and American bookstores were full of titles on Japan's path to economic pre-eminence. In Congress, there was plenty of talk about legislation to protect American companies from unfair competition.
 A decade later, rather than Japanese banks, it was technology and communications companies that dominated the world markets. 
 Both of those lists now provide painful memories for some. The 1989 list was dominated by the banks, whose profits were enhanced by their stakes in many other Japanese companies whose shares were also soaring. After Japan's bubble burst, those banks were brought down by bad loans, leading to mergers and bailouts.
 Some of the companies on the 1999 list, like Intel, Microsoft and Cisco, remain successful, but with values well below their 1999 levels. Others, like Lucent (now part of Alcatel-Lucent) and AOL (now part of Time Warner) are worth a small fraction of what they were then.
 The Chinese stock market boom has parallels in both previous lists. Now it is China's trade surplus that angers American politicians, and it is China's success that has inspired a long list of books. Chinese companies have profited from owning stakes in other companies whose stocks are soaring. 
 China's stock prices have also been pushed up because there is a limited number of shares available for investors to buy, with most shares controlled by the Chinese government. There is a parallel to 1999, when only a small portion of shares in many American technology companies had been sold to the public, creating a limited supply as investors crowded in.
 There are just three names that appear on all three lists, a fact that is an indicator of the change that has taken place. General Electric has endured, and so has Exxon, although it had to merge with Mobil to maintain its high position.
 The other name is AT&T, but that is a bit deceptive. The 2007 AT&T is a result of the takeover of the old AT&T, which had fallen on hard times, by SBC, a company that was in turn once spun off by the old AT&T.
 Even if the Chinese market is now a bubble, there is no guarantee that it will not continue to expand. The valuations of Japanese companies in the late 1980s and technology stocks in the late 1990s seemed unreasonably high for years before they collapsed.

HEADLINE: Rules Urged To Govern Investing By Nations

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The world's leading finance ministers called Friday for a joint effort to set up guidelines for government-owned investment funds to make sure their investment strategies are clear and conform to sound business standards.
 The measure stemmed from concern about plans by Russia, China and the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East to buy up companies, banks and real estate in the West.
 In a communique issued Friday evening, the ministers said that cross-border investment was generally ''a major contributor to robust global growth'' but it asked that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the organization that represents advanced industrial countries participate in setting rules of conduct when the investors are governments themselves. 
 In another development, the finance ministers for the first time explicitly called on China to bring about a rise in the value of its currency, a step that might make exports from China more expensive and imports less expensive. 
 The call for a code of ''best practices'' for government-owned investment funds was seen as a veiled warning to countries not to use their investments to influence the political climate in the countries in which they invest, nor to invest with political motives in mind, for instance, by trying to control a sector of the economy in a rival country. The statement referred to such practices as ''risk management'' and ''accountability.''
 It appeared to reflect mounting anxiety in Europe, especially, that Russian investments were aimed at controlling more of the region's energy infrastructure. David H. McCormick, under secretary of Treasury for international affairs, said this week that best practices also meant the avoidance of political influence in any investment decision.
 Following the communique, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. held a private dinner for the finance ministers in what he and others described as a process to reach out for the first time to the managers of government-owned ''sovereign wealth funds,'' which experts say now control up to $2.5 billion in investments.
 Morgan Stanley and other analysts say the government funds could grow to $17.5 billion in the next 10 years, making them major players on the international economic scene and possibly major players in countries where they own assets.
 The finance ministers' statement did not name any countries, but officials said it was directed at China, Russia and other countries that have started using revenue from oil and other exports to buy stakes in Western companies. The concern in Europe and the United States is that these purchases could provoke a backlash.
 Mr. Paulson was the host of the meeting among finance ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan as they met Friday afternoon. All were in Washington for annual meetings sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
 The weekend of meetings was to focus on concerns among the scores of finance ministers and central bankers about the precarious state of the world economy, and the lack of transparency in some markets that appear to have damped investor confidence.
 Also on the agenda is the concern in Europe about the decline of the dollar against the euro, which has hampered European exports, and the American and European criticism of what they say is China's deliberate policy of using an undervalued currency to promote exports.
 The finance ministers' message Friday evening repeated the recent predictions of many economic experts that the severe troubles in the housing sector in the United States ''will likely moderate'' the growth of the global economy.
 ''Nevertheless, our overall economic fundamentals continue to be strong,'' the ministers said, adding that growth in ''emerging markets'' -- a reference to China, India, Brazil and other developing countries -- were still providing ''critical impetus to the strength of the world economy.''
 But in a sign of the growing importance of sovereign wealth funds, the Western finance ministers were planning to have dinner Friday night with representatives of the funds from Russia, China, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and other countries.
 The call for a voluntary code of ''best practices'' stopped short of saying that countries should not invest with political motivations in mind. Officials involved in drafting the communique said there was a concern that it not be seen as ''bashing'' Russia, China, Saudi Arabia or other investing governments.
 The Bush administration has for months called for a voluntary code of conduct and previously asked for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help draw one up. 
 But the bank and the fund have resisted the request to go beyond a call for sound investment and asset management strategies. Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said this week that it was not the bank's role to tell countries not to exercise what they determine to be their own national interest in making investments.
 ''That's a question of national judgment,'' Mr. Zoellick said, noting that the United States, Canada and Germany had set up their own entities to bar investments that might damage their national security and that these decisions should be left to governments.
 So far American officials say they see no evidence of sovereign wealth funds exercising political decisions through their investments, but there is concern in Europe about Russia's use of its sovereign wealth funds and its government-owned oil companies buying pipelines and other energy infrastructure in Europe.
 While Russia sees such purchases as enhancing its energy security, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and others are concerned that Russia might try to coerce Europe on political decisions by using its oil power, much as it did during the crises of a couple years ago in Ukraine.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about proposals to establish international guidelines for government-owned investment funds misstated the amount of money that ''sovereign wealth funds'' control now and are expected to control in the future. Analysts say the funds now control up to $2.5 trillion, not billion, and that could grow to $17.5 trillion, not billion, in the next 10 years.

HEADLINE: Sending Up Satellites and Closing the Digital Divide

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
SATELLITES have not proved as important to high-speed communications as telephone and cable lines have. But they do have an important role in helping close the digital divide between people who have access to broadband communications and those who do not, says Pradman P. Kaul, chief executive of Hughes Communications, based in Germantown, Md. Mr. Kaul's company recently launched a $310 million satellite to improve its service in the American market. He has been involved in satellite communications for nearly four decades, since earning a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1968. 
 Here are excerpts from a conversation: 
 Q.It seems that Americans communicate more via high-speed cable and digital subscriber telephone lines than via satellites, suggesting that satellites have not lived up to their promise. Do you agree?
 A. No, each technology has its place, and its advantages in terms of applications and when it's used. Clearly, significantly more bits of data are transmitted on cable and DSL than satellite, but what satellites do well is broadcast and multicast applications, as in the case of DirecTV and EchoStar broadcasting television. They have close to 30 million subscribers. In almost every country in the world, direct-to-home television is going great guns.
 A second thing satellites are very good at is, once you put a bit up on a satellite it reaches anywhere in the region that the satellite is serving. There is no place in North America that you can't reach. The ubiquitous coverage that satellites offer is a major advantage. For broadband Internet access capabilities, there are probably 15 million households in the United States who don't get it and will not get it for a long time. So satellites play a great role in bridging the digital divide. 
 Q.Why aren't cable and telephone companies making a stronger effort to reach all Americans?
 A. It's an economic issue. The cost of running a piece of wire or a piece of optic fiber is high, and it requires a density of subscribers to give them an economic return on the investment. In rural areas, the economics just don't pay out. With satellites, it doesn't cost any more to reach the one guy sitting on top of the mountain in the state of Washington than it does the guy in downtown Manhattan.
 Q.Can you offer as fast and as robust communications as the cable and telephone companies?
 A. The service is robust and in some cases offers a higher level of reliability than you get from cable and DSL. In terms of speed, that's an economic issue. We just launched a new satellite called Spaceway 3 that will be in service in the United States by January of next year. The speeds that satellite offers can match any speed that is available terrestrially. The question is what you charge for it? 
 Q.Did the failure of Motorola's Iridium project, which was supposed to provide worldwide voice and data service for anyone with a handset, cast a pall over the broader field of satellite communications?
 A. It obviously did not do what it was supposed to do. There were a whole bunch of issues that caused it not to reach its original objectives. That was a different application from ours. It was for mobile phones. What they did was build a constellation of satellites in low-Earth orbit, so they were constantly moving to be able to handle the mobility. It was a much more complex, difficult market. What we're trying to do is different. We're using fixed satellites. We don't rely on 60 satellites working together in unison. 
 Q.Why have satellites been more useful for entertainment than for sending data like e-mail messages?
 A. If you are broadcasting a football game, you're sending the same football game to every home. With a satellite, you only send it up once and 200 million homes in the United States can receive it. The economics of that are incredible as opposed to sending the football game individually to each home via wires. You'd be sending it 200 million times.
 Q.What is the divide between those who have access to high-speed communications versus those who don't? Is it an urban-rural split?
 A. It's actually rural and suburban where people don't have it. It amazes me sometimes when I look at it. Even in major Washington, D.C., suburbs, which is our neighborhood, there are big pockets where you can't get DSL or cable.
 Q.How will satellite compete against cable and telephone companies as those companies seek to offer all three forms of communication, meaning voice, data and entertainment?
 A. You're talking about the triple play concept. The cable guys are now beginning to offer people not only television entertainment, but also broadband data and telephone service. The phone companies are beginning to put fiber to the homes so in addition to the voice and data, they can offer the entertainment channels. So yes, I think you're going to see the triple plays, but there's still a big market for people to offer single services but offer them well and offer them economically. 
 Q.How fast can your company grow?
 A. In the United States, we have more than 350,000 residential subscribers. In the next two or three years, we hope to get to one million residential subscriptions. In addition, we have a strong enterprise business. We have hundreds of Fortune 2000 customers and their whole data networks. 
 Q.Why did you have a French company, Ariane, launch your satellite from the South Pacific?
 A. Launching is a very small industry. There are only three or four companies that launch satellites of the size that we built. 
 Q.Did you go to watch it being launched into space?
 A. Yes, it was exciting, especially when it's your own satellite. It's a unique thrill. It was a great day for all of us.

HEADLINE: Strangers as Allies

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Mont. 

 BODY:
Richard D. Liebert turned his back against a hard wind the other day, adjusted his black cap and gazed across golden fields of hay. Explaining why he is against construction of a big coal-burning power plant east of town, Liebert sounded like one more voice from the green movement.
 ''The more I learn about global warming and watch the drought affect ranchers and farmers, I see that it's wind energy, not coal plants, that can help with rural economic development. Besides, do we want to roll the dice with the one planet we've got?''
 But Mr. Liebert, despite his sentiments, fits nobody's stereotype of an environmentalist. He is a Republican, a cattle rancher and a retired Army lieutenant colonel who travels to South Korea to train soldiers to fight in Iraq. 
 He is also an example of a rising phenomenon in the West. An increasingly vocal, potent and widespread anti-coal movement is developing here. Environmental groups that have long opposed new power plants are being joined by ranchers, farmers, retired homeowners, ski resort operators and even religious groups.
 Activists say the increasing diversity of these coalitions is making them more effective.
 ''You're seeing a convergence of people who previously never worked together or even talked to each other,'' said Anne Hedges, program director of the Montana Environmental Information Center, which is spearheading three lawsuits aimed at blocking construction of the power plant near Great Falls. ''They're saying these coal plants don't make any sense, whether from an economic or environmental or property-rights standpoint.''
 Power companies concede that anti-coal coalitions are indeed becoming more effective -- and they describe that as a threat to the reliability of the nation's electric grid. In their view, building more coal-burning power plants is the most realistic way to meet the rising demand for electric power.
 ''It's clear new coal-fired generation is running into roadblocks,'' said Rick Sergel, president and chief executive of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. ''I don't believe we can allow coal-fired generation to become an endangered species. We simply must use all the resources we have.''
 Natural gas is an alternative to coal for electricity generation. But Mr. Sergel said the industry worries about relying too heavily on gas because it is far more expensive, prices have become volatile and a share of the gas supply has to be imported. 
 New nuclear power plants are on the drawing board, but they are many years from completion. And although energy conservation and efficiency, as well as renewable energy, will play larger roles in the future, they are not enough to meet the nation's growing appetite for electricity, Mr. Sergel said. 
 The collaboration of former strangers -- even enemies in some cases -- to fight coal development is largely a Western phenomenon. While medical groups, city officials, environmental groups and others have banded together to fight coal plants near cities east of the Mississippi, the power plants in the West are largely in rural areas and thus directly affect farmers and ranchers living on the plains, the prairies and near the Rocky Mountains. 
 Government projections suggest that coal, which provides 50 percent of the nation's electricity and a quarter of its total energy, will continue to dominate the nation's energy mix, despite its environmental problems. As of last May, the Energy Department projected that 151 coal-fired plants could be built by 2030 to meet a 40 percent rise in demand for electricity, largely from soaring populations in Western states. 
 ''Coal is still very much alive,'' said Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an industry group.
 But opponents of coal plants are winning some battles. Reports from the government, the industry and environmental groups show that at least three dozen coal plants have been canceled or scaled back in the last two years.
 Bruce E. Nilles, a lawyer who directs the Sierra Club's national coal campaign, said his organization and collaborating groups had filed 29 lawsuits and administrative appeals against proposed coal plants. Aside from legal battles, the power industry said rising construction and labor costs and regulatory pressure were contributing to the cancellations.
 Ranchers and farmers have featured prominently in several recent battles over power plants. In Jerome County, Idaho, for instance, Sempra Energy of San Diego had planned to build a large plant to burn pulverized coal. A coalition that included the Jerome County Farm Bureau, a dairy association, ski resort owners, other landowners, local politicians and environmental activists defeated Sempra. They also prompted a two-year statewide moratorium on such coal plants. 
 And in Iowa, a 77-year-old retired farmer living on the land his great-grandfather settled in 1879 has galvanized ranchers, farmers and environmentalists to fight plans by the LS Power Group of New Jersey to build a coal plant on his property.
 In 2003, the farmer, Merle Bell, sold LS Power an option to buy his land. He said that even though he had doubts about the wisdom of coal plants, he thought he had little choice because the company was also purchasing an option on his neighbor's land and said it would build the plant anyway. Mr. Bell later changed his mind. His coalition is pressing the Iowa Utilities Board to kill the plant, which also faces larger permitting hurdles. 
 ''I grew up here,'' Mr. Bell said from his home just east of Waterloo. ''I rode ponies here. I farmed and raised cows, chicken and hogs here. A coal plant would be bad for the environment, and I don't want to see it harm people living here and future generations.'' 
 For many farmers and ranchers, protecting the land they till hardly means that they have become environmentalists. In fact, seeing environmentalists as potential allies and not enemies has been awkward for many of them. 
 C. J. Kantorowicz grows winter wheat on 6,000 acres near the proposed Highwood coal plant east of Great Falls. Last fall he joined other farmers in a zoning lawsuit against Cascade County commissioners to stop the plant. Until he went to an organizing meeting that another farmer, Robert Lassila, held at his house, Mr. Kantorowicz loathed environmentalists. So he winced when he was introduced to a pathologist who had started a local environmental group to fight the proposed plant. She came to talk about the public health and environmental risks.
 ''I think global warming is a hoax, and I hate to hitch my wagon to environmentalists,'' Mr. Kantorowicz said recently in his living room after a hard day planting winter wheat. ''I went to the meeting with the mind that I'd shoot holes in her story, her environmentalist's view. But she and others convinced me they were right by being honest and answering our questions in detail about pollution and such.''
 Robert Lassila's son, Daryl, lives next door to his parents. He recalled some of the neighbors bristling when the meeting started.
 ''Many were looking at each other nervously and wondering who brought the environmentalists here and is there a back door to this place,'' he said. ''But they stayed put and here we are, together in this fight.''
 For many farmers and ranchers, their aversion to coal is more pragmatic than philosophical. Their crops and livestock have been plagued by severe droughts and storms lately, and some wonder whether those are linked to global warming. Whether that proves to be the case, the strain on their finances has made them more interested in renewable-energy projects, like wind turbines, on their land.
 Janyce and Leonard Harms, who grow wheat and millet in Hereford, Colo., near the Wyoming and Nebraska borders, last year agreed to allow eight towering wind turbines on their land. The turbines are part of the new 274-turbine Cedar Creek wind farm owned by BP, the huge energy company, and Babcock & Brown. The project is expected to churn out electricity for some 90,000 homes, mostly near Denver. 
 The Harmses, though a bit skeptical about coal plants, have not become involved in any battles. But they typify the fascination with wind energy that is sweeping rural America. They have received about $5,000 from the wind farm's owners for leasing their land, and once the wind farm is fully operational by year's end, they will receive at least $3,500 a year per turbine.
 ''We're not environmentalists by any means,'' Ms. Harms said as she gazed through her sliding glass door at the huge turbines spinning in the distance. ''I see this as supplemental income. We're getting older and we'd like to retire. This is a great deal, and the fact that it's clean energy makes it even better.''

HEADLINE: The Prize That Even Some Laureates Question

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Carping from time to time over the unworthiness or politics of a particular Nobel peace or literature laureate is expected. But when it comes to economics, it's the award itself that sometimes comes in for sneers; even a couple of its winners have suggested it be abolished. 
 Unlike the original five prizes named in Alfred Nobel's will more than a century ago, the economics award -- formally called the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel -- was created in 1968 by the nation's central bank in honor of its 300th anniversary. But it isn't so much bloodlines that have stirred up dismay as the kind of work that has often been honored.
 ''They're not engaged in the problems of the actual world,'' said James K. Galbraith, an economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin, voicing an all-too-common complaint that much of the Nobel-anointed economic work seems out of touch with reality. 
 Complaints about prize winners generally fall into one of three categories: too ideological; too preoccupied with theory and mathematics; or too narrowly focused on problems facing Wall Street instead of on pressing global issues like inequality, poverty and the environment. 
 ''Historically, there was a lot of justification to the critique that it was somewhat ideological in nature,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, who won the prize in 2001 along with George A. Akerlof and A. Michael Spence for their analyses of markets in which people are informed to different degrees.
 He referred to a six-year period in the 1990s when economists from the University of Chicago -- Milton Friedman's headquarters and the temple of laissez-faire economics -- won five of the prizes. Some of that work, he complained, ''was clearly not breakthrough in any fundamental sense.''
 That is no longer the case, he said; indeed, he said, the trouble now stems from the committee going to the opposite extreme.
 ''The main criticism right now is, if anything, they're slanted more to mechanical modeling and technical advances,'' he said. ''One can understand that as part of a response to criticisms that they were too ideological,'' he explained, but the problem is that not enough thought has been given to ''how substantial the work is.''
 That's not how Gary S. Becker -- an economist at the University of Chicago who won the 1992 prize for applying economic theory to a wide range of human behavior, including crime and racial discrimination -- sees it.
 ''People have different judgments about what constitutes the biggest contribution,'' he said, but he maintains that the winners ''do reflect the most important work in economics'' and that the work being honored is ''useful in understanding how societies work.''
 Amartya Sen, one of the few winners whose work focuses on social welfare, said he, too, thought the winners were ''very worthy'' of the honor. He was particularly pleased that this week the prize went to Leonid Hurwicz, 90, and Roger B. Myerson and Eric S. Maskin, both 56 -- three American economists who helped create and develop a sophisticated explanation of the interaction among individuals, markets and institutions.
 While ''there was a fair amount of criticism'' about ideological bias more than a decade ago, he said, that has not been the case recently. A lot of work has been ''connected to technical reasoning,'' Mr. Sen said, but that is ''related to the nature of the subject.''
 Mr. Becker compared the field of economics with chemistry or physics, in which there is ''more of an orientation towards theory'' to get at more fundamental questions. He also dismissed the idea that the string of University of Chicago awards showed a political bias, saying the work for which those academics were honored had ''nothing to do with ideology.'' 
 The hard-science prizes were certainly the model for the newest Nobel. As Burton Feldman explains in his book ''The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy and Prestige,'' the economics award was created at a time of exuberant affluence, when mathematics and statistics had colonized economics and practitioners were claiming their field was more akin to physics than to sociology. 
 Yet the notion that economics is scientific, said Jeff Madrick, the director of policy research at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School in New York, is ''highly exaggerated.'' 
 Mr. Madrick not only doubts that significant contributions in the field can be limited to those based on econometrics but also questions whether that type of work is as unbiased as is often claimed. ''The Nobel prize has become quite a political animal,'' he said, ''in the disguise of being scientifically pure.'' 
 This was the heart of the complaint from the Nobel winner Gunnar Myrdal. In a 1977 letter to a Swedish newspaper, he rejected the idea that the field of economics could claim a Nobel on the basis of its scientific rigor. Economics should concern itself with political and social needs, he argued, and he called for an end to the prize in economics.
 The free-market conservative Friedrich von Hayek, who shared the Nobel in economics with Myrdal in 1974 despite being his ideological opposite, agreed on that point. If he had been asked, Hayek said, he would have ''decidedly advised against'' creating an economics prize. 
 Barbara Bergmann, an emerita professor at American University and the University of Maryland, said the same problem that afflicts the award afflicts the profession as a whole: too much theorizing and not enough actual research.
 For all its prestige, the award's biggest failing, Mr. Galbraith complained, is that ''certain branches of economics have been more or less excluded,'' citing as examples work on poverty, inequality, the economics of climate change, the collapse of communist economic systems and debt crises.
 Mr. Galbraith needed to look no farther than his own dinner table for evidence. His father, John Kenneth Galbraith, one of the most influential economists of the 20th century but always an outsider to the academic ranks of the profession, never won the prize. 
 Mr. Sen also mentioned John Kenneth Galbraith as someone who could have been honored but was overlooked. Work dealing with unemployment, inequality and poverty, Mr. Sen agreed, has not been cited in Stockholm very frequently.
 ''Those require recognition, too,'' Mr. Sen said, ''but that doesn't mean those who were recognized don't deserve it.''

HEADLINE: How Green Is My Garden?

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. COOPER. 
Thomas C. Cooper, a former editor of Horticulture magazine, is a garden designer.

 BODY:
Watertown, Mass.
 IF the government wants to reduce its dependency on imported oil and, in the words of the Department of Energy, ''foster the domestic biomass industry,'' it has only to stop by my backyard with a pickup. The place is an unlikely but active biomass production center -- especially at this season with countless autumn leaves eddying in every nook and cranny -- and I'll happily donate my production to the cause.
 Biomass, as the word inelegantly suggests, refers to all the biological material in an area, from trees to algae. The subject is on people's minds these days because it offers an available and renewable local source of energy. In the process of growing, plants gather energy from the sun through photosynthesis. That energy can be released as gas (through fermentation or other types of decay) or through heat (various forms of burning). 
 Although a number of technologies are being employed and more are being tested, most large-scale biomass refining involves some form of incineration to produce electricity, or fermentation to make ethanol fuels. Biomass fuels today generate roughly 3 percent of the energy we consume in this country and, since 2000, have been the largest renewable energy source. My garden is a case in point.
 We have a modest lot, slightly more than a third of an acre, on the outskirts of Boston. The house, garage and a sliver of lawn take up a fair amount of the space. The rest is covered in densely planted ornamental gardens. At first I tried to handle the seasonal winnowings with a large three-bin compost device. But it quickly became clear that unless I gave up gardening and devoted myself to turning the pile so as to accelerate its decomposition, the accumulation would shortly overtake the creation of compost. 
 So I joined the town's yard waste recycling program, filling brown paper bags with spent flowers of phlox, rudbeckias and day lilies, overripe eggplants, tomatoes and zucchini, and tying up bundles of woody stalks and stems -- roses, crab apples, peaches, ornamental grasses, grapes, viburnums, willows, butterfly bush and hollies. Three or four times during the growing year the lawn blooms with piles of biomass, ripe for lighting someone's house or powering someone's air conditioner. Think of it as the energy equivalent of the eat-local campaign.
 Gardeners are especially well suited to biomass production as they are relentlessly adding plants to the landscape. Without knowing it I planted a number of the plants that the government's biomass program includes on its list of desirables: black locust, willows and fescues among them. As anyone who has grown any of these knows, they are vigorously self-perpetuating plants. I have others in the garden I could recommend for the government's consideration: summer sweet, sumac, the Lemon Queen sunflower and Heptacodium (a fragrant relative of honeysuckle) come to mind, to say nothing of the apple trees, whose frequent pruning generates stacks of debris, or the hedges that need twice annual clipping. A single wisteria, well tended, could probably power a small village all on its own. 
 Pruning trees and shrubs spurs new growth. This was the theory behind the European practice of coppicing woodlands -- cyclically cutting trees to the ground, after which they send forth a thicket of new shoots. In the same way, a well-tended garden produces more biomass, not less, even as it matures. 
 The entire Northeast is similarly an expanding store of biomass that could provide self-sustaining, local energy on a considerable scale. In its agricultural heyday 150 years ago, our region was only 20 percent forested. Today it is 75 percent wooded, a dense, largely uninterrupted forest created by natural regeneration. A similar surplus exists across much of the country. 
 Harvesting this biomass does not imply clear-cutting or otherwise vacuuming the woods. Indeed, biomass programs provide a market for low-grade timber that otherwise is left to crowd out more desirable species and, ultimately, to rot. The result of biomass harvesting is a more diverse woodland, a more diverse local economy and a more diverse supply of energy. 
 As our demands for energy grow we should enhance the technologies for converting biomass and expand the programs to utilize this renewable source in our collective backyard. This is beginning to happen. Companies like National Grid, which provides electricity to more than 3.4 million customers in the Northeast, offer customers the option to purchase energy generated from renewable sources. These programs create demand for biomass and, ultimately, for the castings from my garden. 
 Pilot projects are under way in at least six states to produce ethanol from biomass, including home yard waste. In Burlington, Vt., the McNeil Generating Station produces 40 percent of the city's electricity using local biomass and encourages homeowners to contribute yard waste to its fuel stockpiles. So a white rose lights up the summer garden, then helps brighten the house in winter.
 But biomass still contributes a disproportionately small share of the energy being generated. Backyard biomass producers need to prod their communities and utilities to use our biomass rather than allow it to molder in landfills. With all that biomass decaying, we are guilty, as our parents used to harangue us, of heating the great outdoors when we could be heating our homes.

HEADLINE: Exotic I.R.A.'s: Leaving Stocks and Bonds Behind

BYLINE: By DALIA FAHMY

 BODY:
BRIAN HARRIS makes a 30 percent annual return on his Roth individual retirement account, but his money is not invested in a soaring biotechnology stock or a hot currency fund. 
 Instead, Mr. Harris, a music teacher from Tucson, owns about 25 marimbas, xylophones and timpani. Using the money in his retirement account, Mr. Harris buys the instruments for less than $1,000 each. He then rents them to his students for up to $60 a month. The rental income flows straight back into the I.R.A.
 ''It's a good way for me to have income without paying tax on it,'' said Mr. Harris, 38, who played with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra for 12 years before turning to full-time teaching seven years ago. 
 It may be surprising, but it is true: No law dictates that retirement plans be invested in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. In fact, the government allows investors to put the money in their I.R.A.'s and Roth I.R.A.'s into almost anything, be it condominiums or airplanes. A growing number of Americans are doing just that, through so-called self-directed I.R.A.'s that steer clear of mainstream investments. 
 There are no official numbers on how much of the country's $4.2 trillion in I.R.A. funds is invested in nontraditional assets, but four of the largest custodians of self-directed I.R.A.'s -- Fiserv, Sterling Trust, Equity Trust and Entrust Administration -- together manage about $15 billion in such accounts. They say the volume has soared in the last five years. 
 Growth is driven by two factors, said Jeff Desich, vice president of Equity Trust. Americans increasingly want to manage their own investments, and they are becoming more comfortable investing outside of stock and bond markets. 
 ''After the tech bubble burst, many Americans saw a large portion of their retirement savings evaporate,'' he said. ''Many of them are saying, 'I don't want to be in this kind of situation, I want to know what my account is being invested in.'''
 And, by middle age, many have amassed enough money in their retirement accounts to permit some experimentation.
 Most self-directed I.R.A.'s are invested in real estate, like apartment buildings or warehouses, officials at the trust companies say. The rest end up as equity or debt investments in private companies, or in off-beat ways of generating rental income, like Mr. Harris's musical instruments. Custodians say clients have invested in such diverse properties as private jets that can be leased out, race horses that generate prize income and bulls that are in demand among cattle breeders. 
 In addition to giving investors more control over their retirement savings, self-directed I.R.A.'s also carry the usual tax advantages that come with government-authorized retirement plans: traditional I.R.A. holders can defer tax payments on their profits until retirement, while Roth I.R.A. holders do not owe any tax on gains. Mr. Harris, for example, who set up his Roth I.R.A. with post-tax dollars, is not taxed on his rental income or any profits he makes if he sells an instrument. 
 But self-directed I.R.A.'s also pose significant risks. Investing in a marimba requires much more savvy than signing up for a mutual fund and letting professional money managers do their job.
 ''This is best for people who know what they're doing,'' said Ed Slott, a tax adviser and author of several books on retirement. ''If you know real estate and you can treat it as a business, then that's fine.''
 Some financial advisers warn that self-directed I.R.A.'s make it difficult for investors to diversify well, arguing that it is safer, for example, to invest in real estate through a real estate investment trust rather than by buying a single condominium. 
 Most people manage that risk by putting only a portion of their retirement savings into self-directed I.R.A.'s. Mr. Harris, for example, invests 25 percent of his nest egg in musical instruments.
 The biggest risk, however, is breaking the law. No single set of rules governs I.R.A.'s, as the Internal Revenue Service publishes new guidelines whenever a contentious tax case comes up. Individual investors may find it difficult to sort through years of rulings, which makes it especially crucial to hire a specialized accountant or lawyer. 
 Generally speaking, I.R.A.'s may not be invested in collectibles and life insurance. In addition, accountholders may not personally benefit from their investment in any way other than making legal withdrawals after the age of 59 1/2. This means that you may not live in a house you bought with your I.R.A., or put rental income anywhere but back into the I.R.A. Finally, any transactions with a lineal family -- like children, parents and grandparents -- are prohibited. This means a couple cannot invest in a start-up owned by their son.
 When the I.R.S. spots a violation, it shows little mercy, disqualifying the entire I.R.A., taxing it retroactively and imposing a 10 percent withdrawal penalty on account holders under the age of 59 1/2.
 Hugh Bromma, the chief executive of Entrust, says one client allowed her daughter to live in a condominium owned through her I.R.A. The government forced the client to liquidate the entire $750,000 account and charged her over $1 million in taxes and fines. 
 Those who know what they are doing, however, can handsomely bolster their retirement savings.
 Neil Paulson, a retired lawyer from Orlando, Fla., with a multimillion-dollar I.R.A., says he makes a 15 percent annual return by renting out homes and issuing mortgages to homeowners in his community. Mr. Paulson said he opened a self-directed I.R.A. account after the Internet bubble burst. 
 ''I felt I had to start taking control of my own future,'' he said.
 Anyone interested in self-directed I.R.A.'s should be prepared to spend time actively managing the investment, because the trust companies that administer the accounts offer few services beyond educating their clients about the rules and then managing cash flow. 
 Setting up an account is fairly easy. Investors fill out standard forms, transfer funds from an existing I.R.A. account, and then direct the custodian to wire money into various investments. Recurring income, like dividends or rent, flows into the I.R.A. automatically. Annual fees typically are $100 to $2,000, depending on the size of the account and the number of transactions processed.

HEADLINE: Markets Slide As Wall St. Sees Signs of Trouble

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Call it Gray Friday.
 Stocks plunged to their lowest level in a month yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrials dropping more than 360 points. 
 The steep drop happened on the 20th anniversary of the one-day plunge that came to be known as Black Monday. And it capped a week in which the market was hit with a battery of poor earnings reports, particularly from large banks. 
 It also served to remind investors of the economy's broader problems: the housing slowdown and the tight credit markets. 
 Yesterday's slide began with reports of disappointing performances from Wachovia Bank and Caterpillar, the machinery manufacturer. Wachovia's report of a 10 percent drop in income and $1.3 billion in losses and write-downs followed similar announcements this week from Citigroup and Bank of America.
 The Dow, which had its worst week since late July, has fallen more than 4 percent from the record high it set 10 days ago. It closed at 13,522.02, down 366.94 for the day, or 2.6 percent. 
 ''We're like a bunch of adolescents right now,'' Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said of investors. ''Last week we got some good news, and we're happy. Now we're all sullen and down in the dumps.''
 It was the worst one-day loss for the Dow since Aug. 9, when it lost 387.18 point, though the average remains up 8.5 percent for the year.
 The Dow's decline yesterday was mirrored in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite. 
 Crude oil prices also retreated, falling from the record they reached Thursday. Oil closed down 87 cents, at $88.60. And the dollar hit record lows against the euro. 
 David Kelly, an economist at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company in Boston, warned against seeing the market plunge as a bellwether. ''What may seem like tough times on Wall Street isn't so tough for the economy as a whole,'' he said.
 But a prominent figure in the hedge fund industry, Julian H. Robertson Jr., said yesterday that the economy was heading for a ''doozy of a recession.''
 ''I think the credit situation is worse than anybody realizes,'' he said on CNBC. ''I don't think any of the normal indicators you would look at in the economy are really very strong. As a matter of fact, they are weak, and not really getting any better.''
 Yesterday's steep sell-off was reminiscent of the Oct. 19, 1987, decline, though not nearly as harsh. That day brought the Dow's worst single-session decline ever, a loss of 508 points, or 22.6 percent. 
 Still, yesterday's losses were unnerving to investors shaken by a week of write-offs at major banks and the surging price of crude oil.
 Wachovia's report came after Bank of America's announcement on Thursday that its third-quarter earnings plunged 32 percent, in part because of heavy losses in consumer banking. 
 ''All these financial companies reporting on their earnings is contributing to the sourness of the mood,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''It's putting a big focus on a big problem, and I think that's scaring people on Wall Street who are close to all of these problems.''
 Bank of America joined Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase this week in planning an ambitious fund to stave off further problems in the credit markets, though investors seem ambivalent about the safety net. The plan is intended to relieve the pricing pressure on mortgage-backed securities held by institutions and known as structured investment vehicles. 
 Two such entities in Europe --run by Cheyne Capital Management of London and IKB Deutsche Industriebank of Dusseldorf, Germany -- defaulted yesterday on more than $7 billion of debt.
 But in the United States, it was clear that investors' concerns went beyond the financial sector. Earnings reports from Caterpillar and Honeywell International, both part of the Dow industrials, did not meet expectations, and that was seen as a sign that the credit troubles were clouding the broader economy. 
 Caterpillar posted a 21 percent gain in quarterly profit but fell short of analysts' estimates. The company cut its full-year profit forecast, sending its stock down 5.3 percent, to $73.57. 
 Net income at Honeywell, the manufacturer based in New Jersey, climbed 14 percent, and the company raised its yearly sales expectations. But the stock still fell nearly 4 percent, to $58.32. 
 Shares of 3M, another Dow component, plunged 8.6 percent, to $86.62, even after the company raised its profit forecast and posted a 7.4 percent increase in third-quarter profit. 3M lowered revenue expectations and said it would be forced to cut prices.
 The disappointing reports, coupled with a week of mixed economic data, underscore investors' concerns over the fourth-quarter outlook. 
 The Fed's beige book, a report based on surveys of business leaders across the country, said companies expected a ''modest'' and ''mixed'' economy in coming months, as prices start to rise and the labor sector weakens. 
 Yesterday was the 44th day in 2007 when the market moved more than 1 percent, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. In 2006, the market had only 29 such days, he said, suggesting increased jitters among investors.
 ''What the market hates more than anything else is uncertainty,'' said William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics. Yet Mr. Rhodes himself sounded rather uncertain.
 ''Is this the beginning of a bear market?'' he asked. ''I have to say right now, I don't think it is. Ask me in another week, and I might have a different opinion.''

HEADLINE: Health Plan Used by U.S. Is Debated As a Model

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
It makes for a compelling stump speech. And the leading Democratic candidates for president are all saying pretty much the same thing: adapt the health care program that covers Congress and offer it to the 47 million Americans currently without insurance.
 ''The American people should have access to the same array of health care choices and benefits as the senators and representatives they elect,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said as she introduced her health care plan last month.
 Mrs. Clinton's main rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senator Barack Obama and former Senator John Edwards, have made similar proposals to expand the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
 The program gives members of Congress, along with about four million other active and retired government workers, a wide array of private insurance offerings with fairly generous benefits. But if this would be health care reform, it is reform with a small ''r,'' according to many nonpartisan experts. 
 While health policy experts acknowledge that the federal employees' program could be a workable way to reach some of the uninsured, they also say there is nothing about it that would help address what they see as an underlying reason for the growing numbers of uninsured: the nation's runaway medical costs. And without major changes, they say, the model would be sharply limited in achieving the goal of universal coverage for all Americans.
 ''It would be a very expensive system that would not necessarily be on the cutting edge,'' said Peter V. Lee, the chief executive of the Pacific Business Group on Health, a California group of employers that offer insurance to their workers.
 ''You don't control costs by being big,'' Mr. Lee said. True health reform is not a matter of simply covering more people, he said. Instead, it would require more fundamental changes in how care is delivered, he said, like making sure every diabetic gets the appropriate treatment. 
 To begin with, not everyone makes the $165,000 a year or so that members of Congress do. In fact, at least 100,000 federal workers -- at least 5 percent of the active work force -- do not have health insurance. In many cases, according to the union that represents the workers, they consider even the cheapest options within the federal plan unaffordable. The lowest-priced family coverage offered by Blue Cross, for example, costs the employee about $2,400 a year. 
 And despite the program's federal imprimatur, the government currently plays only a limited role, preferring to let commercial insurers take the lead. Under an expansion of the program, the government's main contribution might be the billions of dollars in subsidies necessary to pay for additional coverage. 
 ''This is a private-based solution, with all of its foibles,'' said Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is advising various Democrats about the federal program as a possible model. It would probably have higher administrative costs and pose more of a risk of private insurers trying to enroll only the healthiest people, Mr. Gruber said, than if the government were to provide the insurance directly. 
 But a market-based solution is much more palatable politically than a government-run program, he said. Any government-run program proposed by a Democratic presidential candidate might be quickly tarred by conservatives as ''socialized medicine.''
 Still, for all its limitations, policy experts say, using a model like the federal employees system would probably give many people better and more affordable insurance than they could find on their own. While many individuals currently cannot get coverage because of their medical status, under the Democrats' proposals insurers would not be allowed to turn anyone down.
 ''It's a good option for the individual, the self-employed and small business,'' said Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit group in New York that specializes in health care policy issues. Individuals and small businesses would benefit from the creation of large insurance pools in which the risks of paying for expensive medical care could be spread over a large population of both the sick and the healthy, she said.
 Under the program, the government negotiates with insurers to offer its employees a wide range of health plans. While there is no set benefits package, the government has the final say over whether the coverage is adequate and priced fairly. In most cases, the insurers are limited in how much profit they can make under the program; anything above those amounts is put in reserves used to keep average premium increases lower than they would otherwise be.
 As with a big employer like General Electric or Intel, the government relies on Blue Cross and other brand-name insurers to handle claims and determine how much to pay hospitals and doctors. 
 And the officials running the federal program emphasize that theirs is not a government-run plan like Medicare, in which the government is the main buyer of health care and can effect broad changes in public health. 
 ''We want to behave like another employer -- that's by design,'' said Nancy H. Kichak, associate director at the United States Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the program. ''We're not in the public health arena.'' The program is as innovative as those typically offered by corporations, she said.
 Neera Tanden, the policy director for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, acknowledges that adapting the federal employees' program would not be a cure-all for the nation's health care system. She stressed that the proposal was only one of several aimed at overhauling health care. Others, she said, included offering people younger than 65 a Medicare-like option in addition to private insurance plans. Mrs. Clinton's plan would also require insurers to cover more preventive medical care.
 The idea of using the federal plan as a model for the larger population is hardly new, having been floated periodically for well over a decade by politicians from both parties.
 While the Democrats have latched onto it this season, what they describe is not much different from what Mitt Romney championed when he was the Republican governor of Massachusetts. That state now oversees an insurance exchange of offerings from private insurers meant to give individuals affordable coverage. 
 Mr. Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate, has said he does not favor the same federal approach the Democratic candidates are proposing. He prefers to let the states experiment with different ways of expanding coverage, Mr. Romney has said, because the states have different needs. 
 To achieve universal coverage, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards would borrow from the Massachusetts model by making it mandatory for each person to have health insurance and then providing government subsidies to ensure that everyone can afford it. Affordability is already a challenge for some federal employees, who pay about a quarter of the cost of their coverage and sometimes much more. And in at least one case, for a Vermont plan offered by MVP Health Care, a regional insurer in Schenectady, N.Y., the employee premium is $12,400 a year for family coverage.
 Timothy Byrnes, a union local president with the Army Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, says the premium deducted from his paycheck in 2008 will nearly double from two years ago. He will now pay about $360 a month -- more than $4,200 a year -- for family coverage from Univera Healthcare, an insurer in Buffalo. 
 Not all his union local's members can afford coverage, Mr. Byrnes said, recalling that one member told him, '' 'I'm making choices between medicine and gas.' '' 
 In order to make insurance affordable to a greater number of the 47 million who currently have none, experts say, the coverage might have to be much more limited than even the most basic federal employees option, and be designed to protect mainly against catastrophically high doctor or hospital bills.
 ''You don't want to take them from nothing to a Cadillac,'' said Professor Gruber, who noted that affordability was a vital component of the Massachusetts plan, which he helped develop. The lowest-priced options in that state are as much as one-third cheaper than what is currently available through the federal employees' program, he said.
 To make the federal employee system work on a national scale, the government would almost certainly have to tweak it significantly. 
 One major concern would be preventing any federal program from becoming a dumping ground for states and corporate employers intent on getting the oldest and sickest people off their insurance rolls. Such protection might require changing the existing rules, which now let insurers refuse to cover certain people, like those with pre-existing heart conditions. 
 And expanding the federal program to cover about six times the number enrolled in it now -- currently about eight million, including dependents -- would probably require setting up a new federal administrative apparatus. 
 After all the adjustments, the end result is likely to be something very different from the current program for members of Congress and other federal workers, according to Mark Merlis, a health policy consultant who has analyzed the program. Because the expanded program would play such a big role in the insurance market, it would probably become less flexible and require greater regulation than it does now, he said. 
 ''What you would have is not the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,'' Mr. Merlis said.

HEADLINE: Bush Imposes New Sanctions on Myanmar

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush imposed new financial sanctions against Myanmar on Friday, freezing the United States assets of 11 additional members of the military government that brutally cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators late last month. 
 The new sanctions also included restrictions against a dozen other individuals and entities associated with the regime, which has failed to end its repression of the opposition despite condemnation of its use of troops against demonstrators, Mr. Bush said.
 But in a sign of how limited Washington's leverage is against the government of Myanmar, long the target of American sanctions, Mr. Bush called pointedly on India, China and its other neighbors to intensify their pressure on the regime.
 ''Burma's rulers continue to defy the world's just demands to stop their vicious persecution.'' he said, using the country's former name. ''The people of Burma are showing great courage in the face of immense repression. They are appealing for our help. We must not turn a deaf ear to their cries.''
 The White House move followed weeks of mostly unsuccessful international pressure on Myanmar's government to open a dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained pro-democracy advocate. 
 The sanctions are the second set that Mr. Bush has imposed on Myanmar since security forces clubbed and shot at demonstrators, raided monasteries and arrested Buddhist monks who led the protests. The uprising began in August, when the government doubled some fuel prices. The official news media said 10 people died, though outside experts said the toll was probably far higher.
 Among the 14 officials whose assets in the United States were frozen in the initial sanctions were the junta leader, Senior Gen. Than Shwe, and Deputy Senior Gen. Maung Aye, the No. 2 leader. Those singled out on Friday include the ministers of finance, commerce, construction, industry, science and technology, electric power and health.
 The White House said the Commerce Department would also tighten controls to prevent the export of computers and other goods with military uses to Myanmar. Mr. Bush also signed an executive order allowing the Treasury Department to freeze assets of ''individuals and entities who provide material or financial support to designated individuals or to the government of Burma.''
 Five Myanmar business executives and seven companies were hit with sanctions on Friday under that authority.
 Mr. Bush applauded the European Union, Australia, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia for taking steps against Myanmar or condemning the crackdown. But administration officials said that persuading China and Myanmar's other major economic partners to cut off lending, investment and trade was vital to putting effective pressure on the regime.
 The European Union said this week that it planned to tighten its existing embargo on arms sales and visa restrictions, and may extend a ban on imports from Myanmar as well as block new investment there.
 Laura Bush, who joined Mr. Bush at the announcements, has been one of the administration's most forceful critics of the junta. 
 Mr. Bush called on the regime to give humanitarian groups access to political prisoners and to let Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi communicate with other pro-democracy leaders. He added that Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations envoy to Myanmar, should be provided access to the country.
 Economic sanctions were first imposed in 1997 by the Clinton administration.

HEADLINE: A Global Tax Credit

BYLINE: By JUSTIN MUZINICH and ERIC WERKER. 
Justin Muzinich works for a hedge fund in Connecticut. Eric Werker is an assistant professor at Harvard Business School.

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA has proposed that the United States double the amount it spends on foreign aid to $50 billion each year. But before promising to spend more taxpayer money, Mr. Obama and the other presidential candidates should look to reform our system of foreign aid by modeling it on the successful programs the United States has used to reduce domestic poverty. 
 While foreign aid works in some situations, it has two huge problems. First, there is never enough money to go around. Last year, the United States provided $23 billion of development aid to foreign countries. This was more than any other donor, but it still resulted in very little for the billion people who live on less than $1 per day. 
 The second problem is that the money that does get distributed doesn't always reach the people who need it. As the economist Jeffrey Sachs has noted, of every dollar given to sub-Saharan Africa, only about 40 cents is actually directed toward economic development. The rest goes to debt service, consultants and humanitarian emergencies. And after those expenses are subtracted, the remaining money is further reduced by mismanagement and corruption. 
 A solution to both problems would be to give tax credits to American companies that invest in qualified developing countries. A similar program that focuses on domestic poverty has been a resounding success. In 2000, Congress created a program giving businesses that invest in poor communities within the United States a tax credit equal to 39 percent of the cost of the investment. The theory was that poverty and joblessness in poor communities could be ended only by developing local businesses, not by an aid check. Seven years later, so many businesses want to invest in poor areas that only a quarter of the companies that applied for tax credits in 2006 received them.
 Using the domestic program as a template, Congress should provide a 39-cent tax credit for every dollar of American investment in developing countries. If Company X were to build a $100 million factory in Madagascar, its tax bill would be reduced by $39 million. The lost tax revenue would be offset by reducing direct foreign aid by the same amount. 
 The power of substituting tax credits for lump sums of cash is that while the cash would bring at most $39 million to Madagascar, the tax credit results in a $100 million investment. For the same cost to the federal government, Madagascar receives far more resources. And by leveraging its foreign aid dollars, the United States is better off too, for reasons from the creation of new markets to alleviating conditions that may aid terrorist recruitment.
 Using tax credits instead of traditional foreign aid also means that the money will be spent more prudently. Because for-profit companies are focused on the bottom line, they will be more protective than government agencies of the money they invest in developing countries. 
 Moving from inefficient direct aid to investment tax credits could lead to a fivefold increase in the capital that is deployed in developing countries. Of the $23 billion the United States spends on foreign aid, less than half reaches the ground. Providing $23 billion in tax credits, on the other hand, would lead to $59 billion of investment, if the domestic formula is applied abroad. 
 Of course, the private sector is not always efficient, and not all of the money allocated to foreign aid should be converted to tax credits. But by involving the private sector, the United States could significantly increase the amount of money it spends in poor countries, without using any more taxpayer dollars.
 This tax credit program could reinforce goals other than economic growth. Credits could be awarded to countries that embrace ''green'' development or good governance. Eligibility could be restricted to new investment that creates jobs and transfers know-how to the poorest countries that do not compete directly with American workers. 
 If Mr. Obama and the other presidential candidates in both parties think as creatively about helping the developing world as Congress did about alleviating domestic poverty, then foreign aid can be transformed from a faltering effort into one that brings the fruits of globalization to poor countries.

HEADLINE: In Their Own Words

 BODY:
In remarks before the Family Research Council meeting yesterday in Washington, three leading Republican presidential candidates courted Christian conservatives.
 Fred D. Thompson
 ''Every once in a while, I'm asked, as others are, you know, what would you do in your first 100 days as president? What are the circumstances going to be over a year from now? You know, with the changing world we live in and all, you know, it's pure speculation as to the nature of the confrontation, the challenges, both from a security standpoint and from an economic standpoint.
 ''But I shared with my wife something after I was asked that question about the second or third time. I said I don't really know what I would do in my first 100 days. It depends on the circumstances. I know what my priorities are, and I'm talking a lot about them. But I know the first -- what I would do -- I know what I would do the first hour that I was president. I would go into the Oval Office and close the door and pray for the wisdom to know what was right. And I would pray for the strength to do what is right.'' 
 John McCain
 ''Wisdom suggests that we should be willing to give an unborn child the same chance that our parents gave us, but it takes courage in this political climate to insist on the protection of unborn children who can't vote, have no choice --and can't --and can't reward you with support and donations.
 ''Wisdom suggests that when activist federal judges impose their social views on the citizens of every state, the result is going to distort our politics in terrible ways, but it takes courage to insist that the courts have to return to their proper role. I will appoint strict constructionist judges that won't legislate from the bench. My friends, I have been pro-life my entire public career. I believe I am the only major candidate in either party who can make that claim.
 ''I am pro-life. I am pro-life because I know what it is like to live without human rights, where human life is accorded no inherent value. And I know that I have a personal obligation to advocate human rights wherever they are denied, in Burma, in Bosnia, in Cuba or the Middle East, and in our own country, when we fail to respect the inherent dignity of all human life, born or unborn.''
 Mitt Romney
 ''Family is the building block of the nation. It is the economic unit of our society. This isn't just rhetoric. We talk from the standpoint of reality, from economic reality.
 ''A mother and father who love each other and are devoted to their children will have children that are better educated, better adjusted, healthier, less likely to be raised in poverty, less inclined to crime and drugs.
 ''With two parents, there are more financial resources and more time to devote to the next generation -- and there is someone around to take over when one parent is at their wit's end.
 ''Family also means that there is a compassionate caregiver when the inevitable sickness or infirmity strikes a family member.
 ''And when you consider the source of most of our societal problems, from teenage pregnancy to drug use to crime, you will find that they stem from the breakdown of the family.''

HEADLINE: One World, Taking Risks Together

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
HUGE financial losses in the United States spark fears in Europe. A credit crisis ensues. Soon the fear spreads to Wall Street, where the biggest banks fight off rumors of insolvency amid a broader economic panic, and Washington is forced to step in. The market swoons. If this sounds familiar, it should. Except we're not talking about the subprime mortgage crisis, or the deal brokered by the Treasury Department last week with three American banking giants to cough up $75 billion for a fund aimed at stabilizing the global credit market, or Friday's 366-point drop in the stock market. 
 In fact, it's a brief history of the Panic of 1907, which culminated exactly 100 years ago today. 
 Back then, losses stemming from the San Francisco earthquake the year before hammered British insurers and eventually forced government officials on this side of the Atlantic and none other than J. P. Morgan himself to come to the rescue. On the night of Oct. 21, 1907, the legendary tycoon summoned the country's leading financiers to his Murray Hill mansion to help finance a bailout. 
 ''This is where the trouble stops,'' Mr. Morgan famously declared. He succeeded. By early 1908, the panic had passed.
 Today, it's J. P. Morgan again -- the firm, not the man -- along with Citigroup and Bank of America that are trying to fix things, with prodding from Henry M. Paulson Jr., the secretary of the Treasury, and, as the former head of Goldman Sachs, something of a latter-day tycoon.
 Given the historical echo -- as well as the 20th anniversary of the crash of Oct. 19, 1987 -- it's appropriate that the plan to ease the credit crunch is high on the agenda this weekend as the finance ministers of the Group of 7 leading industrial countries confer in Washington. 
 But this time around, it may take much longer to repair the damage and restore confidence than it did a century ago. It's not only that the sums are larger now: even adjusting for a century of inflation, losses from the San Francisco earthquake totaled only about $18 billion in today's dollars, according to Marc Weidenmier, an associate professor of economics at Claremont McKenna College, compared with the likely loss of hundreds of billions dollars related to subprime mortgages.
 It's also that the breadth and complexity of today's global markets create risks so great that no group of business leaders -- or even a single country -- can control them. 
 When it comes to the valuing of the mortgage-backed securities that are at the heart of the subprime meltdown, no less an expert that Benjamin S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, admits he's at a loss. ''I'd like to know what those damn things are worth,'' Mr. Bernanke said during the question-and-answer period after a speech in New York Monday night.
 So would many ordinary homeowners who normally don't concern themselves with the inner workings of the Fed. Unlike past panics, or even the crash of 1987, the current credit turmoil has affected ordinary consumers who merely want to secure a mortgage or refinance a loan. Rates have spiked for even the best-qualified borrowers, and home buyers with less than stellar credit histories now find themselves locked out.
 This phenomenon goes both ways. Not only are people without a dime in stocks affected by market gyrations, but in an era when United States mortgage defaults can move markets from London to Mumbai to Shanghai, it seems as if bad decisions by a lender in Cleveland or a borrower in Miami can have worldwide implications. 
 On a trip last week to New Zealand to meet with investors, Byron R. Wien, chief investment strategist of Pequot Capital and a 40-year Wall Street veteran, noted, ''every place I go they ask about subprime and climate change -- those are the two big issues.'' 
 It wasn't supposed to work this way. Interconnected global markets should make the world economy more stable, according to traditional economic theory, with risk spread more widely and strength in one region offsetting weakness in another.
 ''In practice, we're not seeing that happening,'' says Richard Bookstaber, a veteran hedge fund manager and author of a new book, ''A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds and the Perils of Financial Innovation.''
 Although international financial links are nothing new, as the Panic of 1907 shows, what's different now is how closely international markets are correlated with one another. ''Everybody tends to invest in the same assets and employ the same strategies,'' Mr. Bookstaber says, noting how just as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch suffered billions in losses from subprime loans, so did banks in France, Germany and Britain. 
 Indeed, Northern Rock, a British bank, suffered a run by depositors last month before the Bank of England effectively bailed it out. 
 The trend extends into stock exchanges in Asia, where shares in India and China are experiencing a parabolic rise. ''You have speculative American money invested in India, just as you have speculative Indian money invested in India,'' he says. ''As markets become more linked, diversification doesn't work as well.''
 As a result, Mr. Bookstaber argues that today's global financial markets may actually be more risky than in the past. That's because the same types of investors are taking on the risky bets and then simultaneously heading for the exits when trouble comes, even if they're on opposite sides of the world. 
 ''If they're more speculatively oriented, at the very time you have a problem they're going to dump because they have so much leverage,'' he says.
 Historically, adds Mr. Bookstaber, there are two characteristics that precipitate financial crises: complexity and leverage. And the current subprime mess, in which risky mortgages were bundled together by Wall Street and then sold to investors who borrowed heavily to buy them and who may not have understood exactly what they were getting, pretty much fits this pattern. 
 This, too, has implications for ordinary consumers as well as the Masters of the Universe. Homeowners having trouble coming up with their mortgage payment can no longer call their local bank to renegotiate because their mortgage is being held by an investor thousands of miles away.
 At the same time, foreigners seem to be emulating the American appetite for risk-taking and speculation, rather than learning from its dangers. 
 ''We're still the big spenders, but there's evidence that's starting to change,'' says Mr. Weidenmier, citing China as one example. Not only is consumer spending there booming, but local investors have bid up shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange by 432 percent over the last two years -- many going into debt to get a piece of the action.
 Now, just as problems in the United States have caused ripples in Europe, there are fears that a bursting of the Asian bubble could soon be felt in New York. A brief sell-off in Shanghai prompted a 400-point decline in the Dow last February, but both markets quickly bounced back. A prolonged plunge now in Chinese stocks might not be so easy to shake off, especially given the turmoil in credit markets in the United States and Europe, says David Malpass, chief economist at Bear Stearns. Of course, taking risks, even speculative ones, has always been a driving force behind economic growth and the dynamism of the capitalist system. John Maynard Keynes called these urges ''animal spirits,'' and experts like Mr. Wien disagree with the notion that globalization has made things more risky. 
 He argues that the newly rich in places like the Middle East can actually smooth things out by having the money to buy when everyone else is selling. That's one reason his next stop after leaving New Zealand was Dubai.
 Regardless of who's right, Mr. Weidenmier argues that financial crises ultimately make the entire system stronger. Indeed, the Panic of 1907 led to the creation of the Federal Reserve, which has set monetary policy for the United States ever since. ''Sometimes financial crises are actually good,'' he says, ''because they cleanse the system.''

HEADLINE: When the Military Needs It Yesterday

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Pentagon has long indulged in highly polished technological systems that are the product of many years of bureaucratic wheel-spinning, grinding meetings and wish-list overkill. But those soul-deadening procedures have come under intense criticism for turning creative people away from innovation for national security. 
 ''Innovations threaten the establishment, and the reaction is often to get rid of the person promoting the innovation,'' said Jay M. Cohen, the under secretary for research and development in the Department of Homeland Security. Even when a military official advocates a new technological system, added Mr. Cohen, formerly chief of the Office of Naval Research, he or she runs the risk of being punished by resentful officers, protective of their turf. 
 The military's appetite for expensive, gold-plated systems still exists, but soldiers increasingly want their civilian technology partners to deliver solutions quickly to the field, even if the devices are far from perfected. That is partly because changing conditions in the Iraq war have raised demand for new gadgets and gizmos, even in tiny batches.
 ''This is a major shift in outlook, and I believe it is a permanent shift,'' said Mark Sherman, who oversees efforts by BBN Technologies of Cambridge, Mass., a supplier of new technologies to the military since 1948. His advice to civilian innovators seeking military sales is this: ''Do it quick, and make it cheap because conditions change.''
 Consider the experience of BBN's shooter detection program, conceived in a rush four years ago. Asked by the Army to quickly help soldiers in Iraq who found themselves under sniper fire, BBN delivered 50 early versions of a system it called Boomerang in a mere 66 days. Using an array of microphones in a small box, the system tracks the location, elevation and distance of a shot fired at either a stationary soldier or a moving vehicle.
 In 2005, the Army asked for improvements, and BBN fully commercialized the product. This year, BBN released a new version: at 20 pounds, it's one-third the weight of the original Boomerang and much more accurate at tracking shooters. The Army has a thousand of them in the field and is ordering more. 
 More recently, BBN built a two-way translator, a hand-held device that allows an American soldier to understand an Arabic speaker, sort of. It is not perfect, Mr. Sherman acknowledges, but at 50 percent accuracy, the digital translator may indeed improve security and save lives because human translators in Iraq often spy for the other side or are targets for assassination by insurgents. 
 In late 2006, Mr. Sherman had a chance meeting with some Army officers at Harvard. Because BBN had been researching language translation for decades, a team was able to produce a single hand-held translator in just 42 days. It is now being tested in Iraq. 
 The idea of bringing inventions quickly to the battlefield has roots stretching to World War II and the Korean War. Faced with military setbacks in Korea in the early 1950s, Vannevar Bush, a science adviser to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, argued that the best way to create breakthrough technologies for the military was to quickly put new inventions into the hands of soldiers, even if the products could not yet be mass produced. But Mr. Bush's ''few quick'' notion fell out of favor after the Korean War, and the military's process of acquiring new technologies became highly bureaucratic, politicized and out of touch with the civilian technology scene. 
 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are driving the military's new sense of urgency about technologies. But the need for suppliers to move faster is likely to persist well into the future.
 For the battlefield, such speed requires an early adopter, or champion, and the willingness of engineers and product designers to work alongside soldiers. 
 ''Our message to soldiers is: 'We don't know how to improve this product, and we think you do. So tell us,''' said Daniel Kaufman, a program officer at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, and part of the Defense Department. In recent years, the agency has helped companies insert dozens of beta technologies into the battlefield, with promising results. 
 Mr. Kaufman, who formerly worked at Microsoft, helped BBN and Total Immersion Software, a simulation-software company in Alameda, Calif., quickly deliver to soldiers in Iraq a computer simulation that helps prepare them against ambushes. While learning about the real conditions facing soldiers is usually more challenging than, say, figuring out the needs of a word-processing customer, the feedback from military users of new technologies is ultimately more rewarding. 
 ''Soldiers are so appreciative,'' he said. His work, he added, often leaves him with the notion that ''Maybe I helped some guy come home.''
 TO bring novelties successfully to the battlefield, engineers recognize that they need champions within the military to ensure timely field tests. Impatient military officials sometimes reach out to civilians, encouraging them to work quickly in the lab and promising that their troops will try out the new gadgets and offer feedback about possible improvements. 
 When an Army officer complained that sniper rifles were too heavy and that shots were often thrown off course by slight changes in wind speed, Deepak Varshneya, a manager also with Darpa, visited a sniper training school in California and talked with soldiers back from Iraq. Dr. Varshneya then helped the maker of a standard sniper rifle, the Iron Brigade Armory, a closely held company in Jacksonville, N.C., reduce the weight of its XM-3 rifle. Now, he's working on the accuracy. 
 As of August, 52 of the beta-version rifles were in use by snipers in Iraq 
 ''We cut every possible obstacle,'' Dr. Varshneya said. ''The lesson here is that you can get rapid use if you try.''

HEADLINE: Save The Planet: Vote Smart

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
People often ask: I want to get greener, what should I do? New light bulbs? A hybrid? A solar roof? Well, all of those things are helpful. But actually, the greenest thing you can do is this: Choose the right leaders. It is so much more important to change your leaders than change your light bulbs.
 Why? Because leaders write the rules, set the standards and offer the tax incentives that drive market behavior across a whole city, state or country. Whatever any of us does individually matters a tiny bit. But when leaders change the rules, you get scale change across the whole marketplace. And the energy-climate challenge we face today is a huge scale problem. Without scale, all you have is a green hobby. 
 Have no illusions, everything George Bush wouldn't do on energy after 9/11 -- his resisting improved mileage for cars and actually trying to weaken air-conditioner standards -- swamped any good works you did. Fortunately, the vacuum in the White House is being filled by leaders from below. 
 Take the New York City taxi story. Two years ago, David Yassky, a City Council member, sat down with one of his backers, Jack Hidary, a technology entrepreneur, to brainstorm about how to make New York City greener -- at scale. For starters, they checked with the Taxi and Limousine Commission to see what it would take to replace the old gas-guzzling Crown Victoria yellow cabs, which get around 10 miles a gallon, with better-mileage, low-emission hybrids. Great idea, only it turned out to be illegal, thanks to some old size regulations designed to favor Crown Vics.
 Recalled Mr. Hidary: ''When they first told me, I said, 'Are you serious? Illegal?''' So he formed a nonprofit called SmartTransportation.org to help Mr. Yassky lobby the City Council to change the laws to permit hybrid taxis. They also reframed it as a health issue, with the help of Louise Vetter, president of the American Lung Association of the City of New York.
 ''New York City has among the dirtiest air in the U.S.,'' Ms. Vetter said. ''When it comes to ozone and particulate matter, New Yorkers are breathing very unhealthy air. Most of it is tailpipe emissions. And in New York City, where asthma rates are among the highest in the nation, the high ozone levels create very serious threats, especially for kids who spend a lot of time outdoors. Converting cabs from yellow to green would be a great gift to the city's children.''
 Matt Daus, who heads the taxi commission, which is independent of the mayor, was initially reluctant, but once he learned of the health and other benefits, he joined forces with Messrs. Yassky and Hidary, and the measure passed the City Council by 50 to 0 on June 30, 2005. Since then, more than 500 taxi drivers have converted to hybrids -- mostly Ford Escapes, but also Toyota Highlanders and Priuses, and others. 
 On May 22, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the greenest mayors in America, decided to push even further, insisting on a new rule, which the taxi commission has to approve, that will not just permit but require all cabs -- 13,000 in all -- to be hybrids or other low-emission vehicles that get at least 30 miles a gallon, within five years.
 ''When it comes to health and safety and environmental issues, government should be setting standards,'' the mayor said. ''What you need are leaders who are willing to push for standards that are in society's long-term interest.'' When the citizens see the progress, Mr. Bloomberg added, ''then they start to lead.'' And this encourages leaders to seek even higher standards.
 I asked Evgeny Freidman, a top New York City fleet operator, how he liked the hybrids: ''Absolutely fabulous! We started out with 18, and now we have over 200, mostly Ford Escapes. Now we only put hybrids out there. The drivers are demanding them and the public is demanding them. It has been great economically. With gas prices as they are, the drivers are saving $30 dollars a shift.'' He said drivers who were getting 7 to 10 miles a gallon from their Crown Vics were getting 25 to 30 from their hybrids. The cost of shifting to these hybrids, he added, has not been onerous.
 Now Mr. Hidary is trying to get law firms and investment banks, which use gas-guzzling Town Cars -- 12,000 in the city -- to demand hybrid sedans only.
 This is how scale change happens. When the Big Apple becomes the Green Apple, and 40 million tourists come through every year and take at least one hybrid cab ride, they'll go back home and ask their leaders, ''Why don't we have hybrid cabs?''
 So if you want to be a green college kid or a green adult, don't fool yourself: You can change lights. You can change cars. But if you don't change leaders, your actions are nothing more than an expression of, as Dick Cheney would say, ''personal virtue.''

HEADLINE: Malefactors of Megawealth

BYLINE: By DAVID M. KENNEDY. 
David M. Kennedy, who teaches history at Stanford University, won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945.''

 BODY:
THE CONSCIENCE OF A LIBERAL 
 By Paul Krugman. 
 296 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95. 
 Paul Krugman is a justly renowned professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University. His abundant accolades include the John Bates Clark Medal, awarded biannually to an outstanding economist under the age of 40 -- a distinction said to be predictive of, and perhaps even more prestigious than, receipt of the Nobel in economic science. His twice-weekly column in The New York Times routinely and authoritatively demystifies complex economic arcana. 
 And yet maybe Krugman is not really an economist -- at least not according to the definition offered more than a century ago by Francis Amasa Walker, the first president of the American Economic Association, who wrote that laissez-faire ''was not made the test of economic orthodoxy, merely. It was used to decide whether a man were an economist at all.''
 Most modern economists continue to celebrate Walker's orthodoxy, and behind it, the classical doctrines of Adam Smith, whose fabled ''invisible hand'' regularly works wonders of production, distribution, innovation and efficiency, provided it is kept free of the meddlesome ''nanny state.'' Against the constant threat of encroachment from that benighted quarter the free-market faithful are ever vigilant. 
 Krugman will have none of this -- well, very little of it (he won the Clark Medal for work demonstrating the limitations, but not the total illogic, of free trade). Where the orthodox see nothing but market miracles, he sees many a market failure. And where they detect the invisible hand, he finds manipulation by the richest Americans to rig the game in their favor. 
 In our time, Krugman argues, the malefactors of megawealth have triumphed. He recites the now-familiar data that the wealthiest 0.01 percent of Americans are seven times richer than they were three decades ago, while the inflation-adjusted income of most American households has barely nudged upward. Chief executives who typically earned 30 times more than their average employee in the 1970s now take home more than 300 times as much. The American plutocracy, Krugman concludes, ''have become rich enough to buy themselves a party'' -- and readers are left in no doubt which party we're talking about.
 But Krugman the anti-economist does not believe that growing economic inequality incubated modern political conservatism. In his view, the ''arrow of causation'' points the other way: political change, cunningly engineered by ''radicals of the right,'' has spawned egregious economic disparity, as well as a toxic level of partisanship. Ever the iconoclast, Krugman says ''this strongly suggests that institutions, norms and the political environment matter a lot more for the distribution of income -- and that the impersonal market forces matter less -- than Economics 101 might lead you to believe.'' In short, it's the politics, stupid. 
 The bulk of this book consists of a historical explanation for how this sorry state of affairs came to be. It's a story that is as factually shaky as it is narratively simplified. (Kansas, whatever its other crimes and misdemeanors, is not customarily regarded as the birthplace of Prohibition; the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, not 1964.) History according to Krugman goes something like this: the nation suffered through a ''Long Gilded Age'' of let-'er-rip, dog-eat-dog capitalism until the New Deal created a new social order characterized by income-leveling taxes, job security, strong labor unions, a prosperous middle class, bipartisan solidarity and general social bliss. Krugman invokes that post-World War II ''paradise lost'' in his first paragraph, and his yearning to restore that Edenic moment informs all the pages that follow. 
 But as the story unfolds, serpents slither into the garden, in the form of pesky ''movement conservatives.'' Those upstarts set out in the 1960s to exploit racial tensions, national security anxieties and volatile value-laden matters like abortion, school prayer and gay rights ''to change the subject away from bread and butter issues.'' By century's end they had managed to fasten upon their hapless fellow citizens ''a second Gilded Age'' in which inequality is on the rise and even the modest American version of the welfare state that the New Deal put in place is in danger of being dismantled. 
 For this dismal state of affairs the Democratic Party is held to be blameless. Never mind the Democrats' embrace of inherently divisive identity politics, or Democratic condescension toward the ungrammatical yokels who consider their spiritual and moral commitments no less important than the minimum wage or the Endangered Species Act, nor even the Democrats' vulnerable post-Vietnam record on national security. As Krugman sees it, the modern Republican Party has been taken over by radicals. ''There hasn't been any corresponding radicalization of the Democratic Party, so the right-wing takeover of the G.O.P. is the underlying cause of today's bitter partisanship.'' No two to tango for him. The ascendancy of modern conservatism is ''an almost embarrassingly simple story,'' he says, and race is the key. ''Much of the whole phenomenon can be summed up in just five words: Southern whites started voting Republican. ... End of story.'' 
 A fuller and more nuanced story might at least gesture toward the role that environmental and natural-resource issues have played in making red-state country out of the interior West, not to mention the unsettling effects of the ''value issues'' on voters well beyond Dixie. And as for national security -- well, as Krugman sees things, it was not Democratic bungling in the Iranian hostage crisis or humiliation in Somalia or feeble responses to the first bombing attack on the World Trade Center or the assault on the U.S.S. Cole, but the runaway popularity of the Rambo films (I'm not making this up) that hoodwinked the public into believing that the party of Carter and Clinton (not to mention McGovern and Kucinich) might not be the most steadfast guardian of the Republic's safety.
 For all that he inveighs against the evils of partisanship, Krugman astonishingly concludes by repudiating the chimera of ''bipartisan compromise'' and declaring that ''to be a progressive, then, means being a partisan -- at least for now.'' Indeed, at times he seems more intent on settling his neocon adversaries' hash than on advancing solutions to vexed policy issues. ''Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' he writes, a sentence that both stylistically and substantively says much about the shortcomings of this book.
 That assorted wing nuts have pretty much managed to hijack the Republican Party in recent years is scarcely in doubt. That the market is at least occasionally fallible is also not at issue. Nor is it deniable that the New Deal rendered the lives of millions of Americans more secure, and that they have become markedly less so in recent decades. A tidal wave of risk-shifting -- from defined-benefit to defined-contribution retirement plans, and from employer-financed to individually-paid health care insurance, to cite but two examples -- has set millions of American families anxiously adrift on a sea of uncertainty. Krugman's chapter on the imperative need for health care reform is the best in this book, a rueful reminder of the kind of skilled and accessible economic analysis of which he is capable, and how little of it is on display here. Like the rants of Rush Limbaugh or the films of Michael Moore, Krugman's shrill polemic may hearten the faithful, but it will do little to persuade the unconvinced or to advance the national discussion of the important issues it addresses. It may even deepen the very partisan divide he denounces. Where is the distinguished economist when we need him?

HEADLINE: Mixed Scorecard for Immigrants' Children

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
A NEW JERSEY child welfare group concluded in its first report on children in immigrant families last week that most are English-speaking and American-born but at a competitive disadvantage in school because their parents are working harder, making less and struggling with English.
 Nearly one in three children in the state comes from a family with at least one immigrant member, the report from the Association for Children of New Jersey said, and they will be a substantial part of the state's future economic prospects. 
 The group's findings come as Asian and Hispanic students are swelling suburban schools: Statewide, their numbers have risen to more than one million, up from 840,000 in 2000, according to state figures.
 The report is an attempt to put children on the agenda of Gov. Jon S. Corzine's Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel on Immigrant Policy, a 15-member task force appointed in August to figure out how to make sure immigrants are not marginalized, said Cecilia Zalkind, executive director of the nonprofit association. ''As we look at what New Jersey has to do to prepare our future workforce, these kids will be a big part of that,'' said Ms. Zalkind, whose group regularly issues reports on the welfare of children in the state but has never focused on immigrant children before. ''Their opportunities for success will to a great degree determine the state's prosperity.''
 Along with California and New York, New Jersey has become a leading immigrant gateway. With 1.6 million immigrants, it ranks third in the proportion of its population, 20 percent, that is foreign born. There were 646,000 children in New Jersey families with at least one immigrant member in 2005, up from 552,000 in 2000.
 Using census data, the group concluded that children in immigrant families are better off economically in New Jersey (with median income of $65,400) than in most of the rest of the country ($46,500 nationwide). 
 But though they are more likely to have at least one parent working than native-born families in the state, immigrant families make substantially less money, according to the report; the native-born families have a median income of $78,700. 
 The immigrant families are also less likely to have medical insurance. About 59 percent own their own homes, far below the 74 percent of native-born families.
 While the number of children with limited English ability is low, the report says, the language ability of their parents is another matter. One in five immigrant children lives in a home in which no adult speaks English well, the report says. Children with working parents who do not speak English well are less likely to get academic support at home and thus are ''at a significant disadvantage compared to families with English-speaking adults,'' the report says.
 The report mostly treats immigrants as a monolithic group, but it points out that they come from widely different ethnic and economic backgrounds. For instance, immigrants are both more likely to have a college degree and more likely to lack even a high school degree when compared with native-born residents.
 That is because the immigrant wave is split, with many educated workers in the region's technology and financial-services industries, and many unskilled laborers in the landscaping, construction and restaurant industries. 
 But what most children in immigrant families have in common, Ms. Zalkind said, is that they are Americans, even if their parents are not.
 ''A surprising statistic to us is that 87 percent of the children are citizens,'' she said, ''and that suggests they're here and part of the United States, and will be part of New Jersey in the future.''

HEADLINE: Benefits of Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Today's Harvest of Shame'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 15): 
 Dean Kleckner is right to point out that American farmers depend upon the export market. Here in California, we export 22 percent of our annual output, and current trends in currencies and commodities indicate that those exports are likely to grow substantially. That is, of course, unless Congress turns protectionist and takes actions likely to provoke other governments to impose tariffs on American products.
 We must recognize that global trade is largely beneficial but that its benefits are uneven and there can be real downsides for some of our workers. The answer isn't to shut the door, for even if that closure were to help some of our workers, it would do so at a much greater cost to American workers in other fields as well as consumers as a whole. 
 Instead, the answer is to negotiate and ratify fair treaties and to improve our infrastructure, education and training so that American workers can successfully compete and earn higher wages.

HEADLINE: Family Exploring Sale of Garden City Hotel

BYLINE: By DAVID K. RANDALL

 BODY:
FOR almost a quarter of a century, the modern incarnation of the Garden City Hotel has served as a center of luxury on Long Island, playing host to world leaders, rock bands and wedding parties. 
 Now, three months after the death of Myron Nelkin, the developer who rebuilt the historic hotel, its owners are considering putting it on the market, leaving residents of Garden City to wonder what changes may be in store for a hotel that doubles as the centerpiece of the village. 
 ''The Nelkin family has been exploring and making plans for their future, and part of these plans have been to explore a number of ownership scenarios for the hotel,'' said Patrick S. Smalley, the executive vice president of Fairhaven Properties, which owns the nine-story hotel. 
 These ownership possibilities could range from a joint ownership agreement to the outright sale of the property, he said. 
 No family members were available for comment, Mr. Smalley said, and the family has set no timetable for a possible sale, which was first reported in Newsday.
 Mark Gordon, the broker handling the sale for Cushman & Wakefield, said he was not authorized to provide any information about sales expectations. 
 The original Garden City Hotel opened in 1874, five years after the founding of the village. It quickly became a magnet for the visiting upper crust of New York City. In 1895, a new building designed by Stanford White opened and kept the Garden City Hotel name. 
 When that building burned in 1899, White designed the third, and most famous, incarnation of the hotel. It was there that Charles A. Lindbergh stayed the night before he embarked on his first trans-Atlantic flight.
 That structure was torn down in 1973 and rebuilt by Mr. Nelkin, who reopened it as a 280-room hotel a decade later.
 The possibility of a sale comes a year after the hotel filed paperwork with the village to convert some rooms into private condominiums, a process Mr. Smalley said would not be hampered by a change in ownership.
 Paul F. Amoruso, the managing director of Oxford & Simpson, a commercial brokerage in Jericho, worked with Mr. Nelkin to sell some of the hotel's property in 1984, and he said he was not surprised the family would explore selling the hotel now. ''One, the values in the hospitality industry are hitting record levels in Long Island, and two, the person who was responsible for building and developing the property has passed away,'' Mr. Amoruso said. 
 Mayor Peter A. Bee noted the hotel's distinctive role in the village. ''The hotel is an institution that is at the heart of our village commercial area, and it's become a special place for Garden City residents,'' Mr. Bee said. 
 The hotel's reopening in 1983 also helped bolster the village economy and improved local property values, he said. 
 John Ellis Kordes, the village historian, agreed. ''It really meant a lot to our village to see a hotel rise from that empty pit and to see a new modern hotel there,'' he said. ''This was much more of a Manhattan hotel in the suburbs.''

HEADLINE: Planned Freight Yard Faces Growing Opposition

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
Brentwood
 STATE transportation officials want to build a $100 million freight yard on the sprawling grounds of the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center that they say would relieve traffic congestion, as well as reduce truck emissions throughout Long Island.
 But the proposal is running into strong and growing opposition from residents and now local officials who say they are concerned that the estimated 600 diesel trucks expected to travel every day to the yard would increase traffic congestion and truck emissions, on and around their roads. 
 The state first proposed what is called the Long Island Truck-Rail Intermodal Facility Project in the late 1990s, saying that mobilizing freight rail traffic to one site from which trucks would fan out with various goods would be an environmental and economic boon for the Island. 
 At the same time, environmental advocates say it will endanger groundwater because the site is in a special groundwater protection area. Paving it over, they say, will reduce crucially important areas where underground aquifers are refilled by rainwater.
 ''Constructing a truck-rail facility is critical to meet our growing transportation needs,'' said Maureen Dolan Murphy, the executive program manager of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, an advocacy group. ''However, we must balance this need with the management and protection of our regional drinking-water protection plans.''
 At a four-hour public hearing on the proposal last month, more than 40 people spoke out against the project, with only one person publicly favoring the plan. 
 James Ptucha, vice president of the Four Towns Civic Association, said that more than one site should be selected for the transfer station to avoid overburdening one neighborhood. 
 State transportation officials said 18 other sites had been examined but they had decided that using 105 state-owned acres on the Pilgrim property made the most sense because of its distance from homes and its proximity to the Long Island Rail Road and to the Long Island Expressway.
 Eileen W. Peters, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Transportation, and Mark Bocamazo, a department design engineer, said that the department's goal was to ''provide alternatives for movement of people and goods throughout New York and particularly on Long Island.'' 
 The officials said the department was considering ways to address air pollution at the site, including a requirement that equipment at the transfer station -- like cranes and forklifts -- use ultra-low-sulfur fuel. The center would also use an electric hybrid locomotive in the yard to further reduce emissions, the officials said.
 Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said that he agreed with the concept of the freight yard and the need to reduce the number of trucks traveling on the Long Island Expressway. But he said he did not think an adequate plan was in place to handle the influx of trucks into the area.
 He said that he and the supervisors of the four towns in this area of Long Island -- Huntington, Islip, Babylon and Smithtown -- have recommended that a road be built parallel to the Sagtikos State Parkway between the Long Island Expressway and Long Island Avenue. But Mr. Levy said there did not appear to be available state financing for the idea.
 ''They better take another look at this because the way it looks now this project is going down,'' Mr. Levy added. ''Their lack of planning for the infrastructure has alienated any official who might have given the project a second look.''
 The transfer station, which would be built on allocated land owned by the state, is just one of the proposed changes to the land that surrounds the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, which continues to provide mental health services. 
 In 2001, Gerald Wolkoff, a developer, bought 452 acres of land that belonged to the psychiatric center for $20.1 million. He is proposing to build a $4 billion residential, office and retail complex with up to 9,000 apartment units and three million square feet of office space. 
 Mr. Wolkoff declined to comment about the proposed freight yard, which would be situated between his proposed development and his nearby 400-acre Heartland Business Center. The business center is just north of the Deer Park train station. 
 Mr. Wolkoff said the proposed residential units in Heartland Town Square would be one-half mile from the proposed freight yard. He said he planned to install landscaping between the two projects to help muffle the noise. 
 The state said that by 2020 the proposed center could expect three trains a day carrying about 4,000 tons of freight. 
 Three Republican state senators -- John J. Flanagan of East Northport, Owen H. Johnson of West Babylon and Caesar Trunzo of Brentwood -- have sent a letter to Astrid C. Glynn, the state transportation commissioner, calling the project ''ill advised.''
 They cited its probable effects, in addition to traffic from recently approved construction projects for major shopping centers and big-box stores by the county and the towns of Babylon, Islip and Smithtown.

HEADLINE: What's Russian for 'Hacker'?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
MOSCOW
 PERHAPS the most famous con artist of the Soviet era was a fast-talking, eye-winking, nimble-fingered, double-dealing journeyman named Ostap Bender. He was fictional, the antihero of a satirical novel about a quest for lost jewels called ''The 12 Chairs,'' but his casual disdain for the law reflected a widely held cynicism here.
 ''This misdeed, though it does come under the penal code, is as innocent as a children's game,'' Bender says of a scheme to use a purloined document to steal another man's identity.
 Were Bender to ply his trade these days, he would undoubtedly be sitting in front of a computer, spewing out e-mails that slyly ask for credit card information or hawk sexual aids and other flimflam. Russia has become a leading source of Internet ills, home to legions of high-tech rogues who operate with seeming impunity from the anonymous living rooms of Novosibirsk or the shadowy cybercafes of St. Petersburg. 
 The hackers go by names like ZOMBiE and the Hell Knights Crew, and they inhabit such a robust netherworld that Internet-security firms in places like Silicon Valley have had to acquire an expertise in Russian hacking culture half a world away. The security firms have not received much assistance from the Russian government, which seems to show little interest in a crackdown, as if officials privately take some pleasure in knowing that their compatriots are tormenting millions of people in the West.
 In fact, Russian hackers became something akin to national heroes last spring when a wave of Internet attacks was launched from Russia against Web sites in Estonia, the former Soviet republic. The incidents began after the Estonians angered the Kremlin by moving a Soviet-era war monument.
 The motive for most wrongdoing, though, tends to be greed. In 2005, Russians broke into the State of Rhode Island Web site and then brazenly proclaimed that they had swiped credit card information from 53,000 transactions. Officials acknowledged the theft, though they said the scope was smaller.
 The perpetrators in these affairs are rarely if ever caught, but it is not hard to deduce their backgrounds. Russia has long had a strong system of math and science education, and until the relatively recent upturn in the economy, the multitudes of whiz kids who graduated from its schools often had poor job prospects.
 At the same time, they were entering a society that for decades had built up a deep skepticism about the virtues of following the rules. Under Communism, the thicket of strictures that governed almost every aspect of life was considered so inane that only fools were thought to abide by them.
 ''The law in Soviet times had a different function,'' said Georgy Satarov, president of the Indem Foundation, an independent watchdog group in Moscow. ''The law was not oriented toward protecting the interests of citizens. It's the party that protects the citizens, and that's all.''
 One result was that corruption was rampant in Soviet times, and has endured, if not gotten worse. Russia ranked 143 out of 180 countries and territories -- on a level with Gambia, Togo and Indonesia -- in a recent survey of government corruption conducted by Transparency International, a nonprofit group. (The higher the number, the more corrupt.)
 The ethos has often been that if provincial governors and traffic cops and everyone else have their hands out, why should I play it straight?
 This penchant has not stayed rooted to Russian soil. In the United States, a center for health care fraud is Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, which has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Russian immigrants. In other words, the neighborhood has a number of people who grew up in a society where everyone finagled to get by, and few saw anything wrong with putting one over on a callous government. 
 ''This is a country where everybody used to moonlight,'' said Gary Shteyngart, the Russian-American author. ''It's a country where there was never enough money, the money that the government paid was kind of a token, and you had to make your way by hook or by crook. There was always a great entrepreneurial spirit in Russia, but it has always been directed at things that not only help people, but also hurt people.''
 Of course, Russia is not the only generator of Internet havoc. For similar historical and social reasons, such problems have cropped up across the sphere of Soviet influence, from the Czech Republic to Ukraine to Kazakhstan.
 Internet security experts say that only the United States and China rival Russia in hacker activity. But Russia has only 28 million Internet users, according to rough estimates, compared with 210 million in the United States and 150 million in China, meaning that Russia has a higher percentage of scammers. 
 VeriSign, the Internet services company, considers Russian hackers to be the worst, in part because they tend to have ties to organized crime outfits that embezzle money with stolen bank and credit card information. 
 While the West has complained about Russian laws and enforcement, some Russian officials take issue with the criticism. Aleksei Likhachev, a member of Parliament, acknowledged that there had been fewer criminal cases in Russia than elsewhere, but said officials were still learning how to conduct such inquiries. ''It is just that this work is much younger and much less developed in Russia,'' he said.
 Still, executives at technology companies in Russia said the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin has demonstrated that when it wants action, it gets it. ''The problem is that you have got a very educated mass of a population, but you have got completely ignorant, stupid lawmakers,'' said Anton Nossik, a senior executive in Moscow at the company that oversees Livejournal.ru, the Russian version of the blogging and discussion portal.
 ''Law enforcement has no incentive and no motivation to prosecute,'' he said. ''They say, 'We are not receiving complaints,' or 'The complaints that we are seeing are not well formed.' They find pretexts not to prosecute.'' Russian Livejournal blogs are regularly hijacked, typically by people who have stolen passwords. 
 Even so, there remains a sense here that Russian hackers afflict the West far more than Russia, so why bother with them.
 On a Livejournal Russian forum last week, The New York Times asked participants why Russians have a reputation for Internet crime.
 ''I don't see in this a big tragedy,'' said a respondent who used the name Lightwatch. ''Western countries played not the smallest role in the fall of the Soviet Union. But the Russians have a very amusing feature -- they are able to get up from their knees, under any conditions or under any circumstances.''
 As for the West? ''You are getting what you deserve.''

HEADLINE: Blessed Silence Is the Newest Amenity

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
JUST about every traveler has a story about noisy hotel guests. The loud snorer next door. The blaring television down the hallway. The amorous couple. 
 Then there are the culprits inside the room itself. The rush of water through clanking pipes. The rattling air-conditioner ducts. The humming of the minifridge that seems only to get louder when you're about to fall asleep. 
 And then, just when you've hit REM sleep, the alarm clock in the empty room next door goes off. It's enough to negate the super-plush bed and hypoallergenic pillow menu that hotels have been offering to help you get some shut-eye. Indeed, of all the complaints that guests have about hotels, noise continues to top the list, according to a recent guest satisfaction survey by J. D. Power and Associates. 
 But you won't find those guests at AmericInn. That's the hope anyway of the mid-range hotel company based in Chanhassen, Minn. Last month, the fast-growing chain began advertising a new sleeping amenity called SoundGuard at its 213 hotels. It's not an electronic gadget or a bedding accessory, but a construction material. Instead of wood-frame construction, the hotel uses masonry blocks filled with sound-deadening foam, in addition to drywall that is 5/8-inch thick, instead of 1/2-inch, to muffle noise.
 While some hotel chains avoid drawing attention to their cookie-cutter design, AmericInn has turned it into a promotional asset. ''We think it's a real point of differentiation,'' said Arnold A. Angeloni, chief executive of AmericInn. 
 Hotels have tried to one-up one another with everything from custom-branded mattresses to aromatherapy candles to feather-soft sheets to help guests sleep -- everything short of dispensing Ambien in the minibar. So why not sound-proof hotels? 
 Spotting an untapped marketing opportunity, hotels are increasingly installing double-paned windows, noise-deadening door gaskets, thicker walls and even listening to heating and cooling systems to find the quietest model. 
 Take, for example, the Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel, which recently created a ''quiet zone'' on its sixth floor for daytime sleepers. Between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., housekeepers are barred from noisy chores like vacuuming in that zone and bellhops can't use unwieldy carts to carry luggage. The hotel now bills itself as ''the only sound proofed luxury hotel and spa within the Vancouver International Airport.''
 To help drown out distracting noises, Loews Hotels, a luxury hotel brand based in New York, has been offering free sound-masking machines that emit white noise for light-sleeping guests. 
 And, in an example of how noise complaints are redrawing traditional hotel layouts, luxury hotels like Le Parker Meridien New York have eliminated most of the internal doors that once connected two guest rooms. 
 ''They are the culprit many times of people complaining about noise from room to room,'' said Steven Pipes, vice president at the Jack Parker Corporation, which owns the Parker Meridien. The move was so successful in reducing noise complaints, the same tactic was taken at its sister property, the Parker Palm Springs in Palm Springs, Calif., when it was overhauled in 2004.
 Other hotels are incorporating noise-muffling construction into their hotels. Kimpton Hotels is installing double layers of sheet rock for added sound insulation, and is staggering electrical sockets to prevent noise from seeping between rooms. And AmericInn is so obsessed with sound it's even installing gaskets and door sweeps to minimize hallway noise, as well as placing flat-screen television sets on tables instead of mounting them on walls. 
 The company is so intent on promoting its noise-canceling efforts that it submitted its hotel rooms to a Sound Transmission Class test -- a widely used measure that rates how well walls, floors, windows and doors block sound. A score of 25 means that normal speech can be distinctly heard through walls, while a 45 means that yelling is rendered inaudible. An acoustics expert hired by the hotel chain found that its rooms rated 50 or higher -- even a blaring alarm clock would be muffled. 
 So besides asking a hotel its Sound Transmission Class score, how else can hotel guests arm themselves against noisy neighbors? David Braslau, the acoustics expert hired by AmericInn, said it was impossible to know just by looking at the hotel. Luxury buildings, he said, usually shoot for a Sound Transmission Class of 60 or 65. But higher hotel rates don't always mean a quieter room. Mr. Braslau once stayed at the Plaza Hotel in New York, which is currently being converted into a smaller hotel with private residences, and had to change rooms because the elevator near his room was so loud. 
 Mr. Braslau offered some advice from his own travels. 
 Ask for a room at the end of a hallway, away from high-traffic (and noisy) areas like elevators and lobbies. If you're easily bothered by humming machines, ask the front desk for a room away from the hotel's cooling system, which can be on rooftops or hidden behind shrubbery. 
 Rolling up a towel and shoving it up against the door won't keep out much sound, Mr. Braslau said. ''If there's a gap under the door, you can almost hear anything going on.''
 Paradoxically, he pointed out, airport hotels tend to be the quietest -- at least in terms of exterior noise -- since they go to great lengths to block out the sound of roaring jets with double-paned windows and thick exterior walls. And in noisy cities, he said, the quietest rooms are often the ones that face an inner courtyard, rather than the street.
 If all else fails, of course, there are always earplugs.

HEADLINE: Suicide Is Not Painless

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT was one of those stories lost in the newspaper's inside pages. Last week a man you've never heard of -- Charles D. Riechers, 47, the second-highest-ranking procurement officer in the United States Air Force -- killed himself by running his car's engine in his suburban Virginia garage. 
 Mr. Riechers's suicide occurred just two weeks after his appearance in a front-page expose in The Washington Post. The Post reported that the Air Force had asked a defense contractor, Commonwealth Research Institute, to give him a job with no known duties while he waited for official clearance for his new Pentagon assignment. Mr. Riechers, a decorated Air Force officer earlier in his career, told The Post: ''I really didn't do anything for C.R.I. I got a paycheck from them.'' The question, of course, was whether the contractor might expect favors in return once he arrived at the Pentagon last January. 
 Set against the epic corruption that has defined the war in Iraq, Mr. Riechers's tragic tale is but a passing anecdote, his infraction at most a misdemeanor. The $26,788 he received for two months in a non-job doesn't rise even to a rounding error in the Iraq-Afghanistan money pit. So far some $6 billion worth of contracts are being investigated for waste and fraud, however slowly, by the Pentagon and the Justice Department. That doesn't include the unaccounted-for piles of cash, some $9 billion in Iraqi funds, that vanished during L. Paul Bremer's short but disastrous reign in the Green Zone. Yet Mr. Riechers, not the first suicide connected to the war's corruption scandals, is a window into the culture of the whole debacle. 
 Through his story you can see how America has routinely betrayed the very values of democratic governance that it hoped to export to Iraq. Look deeper and you can see how the wholesale corruption of government contracting sabotaged the crucial mission that might have enabled us to secure the country: the rebuilding of the Iraqi infrastructure, from electricity to hospitals. You can also see just why the heretofore press-shy Erik Prince, the owner of Blackwater USA, staged a rapid-fire media blitz a week ago, sitting down with Charlie Rose, Lara Logan, Lisa Myers and Wolf Blitzer. 
 Mr. Prince wasn't trying to save his employees from legal culpability in the deaths of 17 innocent Iraqis mowed down on Sept. 16 in Baghdad. He knows that the legal loopholes granted contractors by Mr. Bremer back in 2004 amount to a get-out-of-jail-free card. He knows that Americans will forget about another 17 Iraqi casualties as soon as Blackwater gets some wrist-slapping punishment.
 Instead, Mr. Prince is moving on, salivating over the next payday. As he told The Wall Street Journal last week, Blackwater no longer cares much about its security business; it is expanding into a ''full spectrum'' defense contractor offering a ''one-stop shop'' for everything from remotely piloted blimps to armored trucks. The point of his P.R. offensive was to smooth his quest for more billions of Pentagon loot. 
 Which brings us back to Mr. Riechers. As it happens, he was only about three degrees of separation from Blackwater. His Pentagon job, managing a $30 billion Air Force procurement budget, had been previously held by an officer named Darleen Druyun, who in 2004 was sentenced to nine months in prison for securing jobs for herself, her daughter and her son-in-law at Boeing while favoring the company with billions of dollars of contracts. Ms. Druyun's Pentagon post remained vacant until Mr. Riechers was appointed. He was brought in to clean up the corruption.
 Yet the full story of the corruption during Ms. Druyun's tenure is even now still unknown. The Bush-appointed Pentagon inspector general delivered a report to Congress full of holes in 2005. Specifically, black holes: dozens of the report's passages were redacted, as were the names of many White House officials in the report's e-mail evidence on the Boeing machinations. 
 The inspector general also assured Congress that neither Donald Rumsfeld nor Paul Wolfowitz knew anything about the crimes. Senators on the Armed Services Committee were incredulous. John Warner, the Virginia Republican, could not believe that the Pentagon's top two officials had no information about ''the most significant defense procurement mismanagement in contemporary history.''
 But the inspector general who vouched for their ignorance, Joseph Schmitz, was already heading for the exit when he delivered his redacted report. His new job would be as the chief operating officer of the Prince Group, Blackwater's parent company.
 Much has been made of Erik Prince and his family's six-digit contributions to Republican candidates and lifelong connections to religious-right power brokers like James Dobson and Gary Bauer. Mr. Prince maintains that these contacts had nothing to do with Blackwater's growth from tiny start-up to billion-dollar federal contractor in the Bush years. But far more revealing, though far less noticed, is the pedigree of the Washington players on his payroll. 
 Blackwater's lobbyist and sometime spokesman, for instance, is Paul Behrends, who first represented the company as a partner in the now-defunct Alexander Strategy Group. That firm, founded by a former Tom DeLay chief of staff, proved ground zero in the Jack Abramoff scandals. Alexander may be no more, but since then, in addition to Blackwater, Mr. Behrends's clients have includeda company called the First Kuwaiti General Trading and Contracting Company, the builder of the new American embassy in Iraq.
 That Vatican-sized complex is the largest American embassy in the world. Now running some $144 million over its $592 million budget and months behind schedule, the project is notorious for its deficient, unsafe construction, some of which has come under criminal investigation. First Kuwaiti has also been accused of engaging in human trafficking to supply the labor force. But the current Bush-appointed State Department inspector general -- guess what -- has found no evidence of any wrongdoing. 
 Both that inspector general, Howard Krongard, and First Kuwaiti are now in the cross hairs of Henry Waxman's House oversight committee. Some of Mr. Krongard's deputies have accused him of repeatedly halting or impeding investigations in a variety of fraud cases. 
 Representative Waxman is also trying to overcome State Department stonewalling to investigate corruption in the Iraqi government. In perverse mimicry of his American patrons, Nuri al-Maliki's office has repeatedly tried to limit the scope of inquiries conducted by Iraq's own Commission on Public Integrity. The judge in charge of that commission, Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, has now sought asylum in America. Thirty-one of his staff members and a dozen of their relatives have been assassinated, sometimes after being tortured. 
 The Waxman investigations notwithstanding, the culture of corruption, Iraq war division, remains firmly entrenched. Though some American bribe-takers have been caught -- including Gloria Davis, an Army major who committed suicide in Kuwait after admitting her crimes last year -- we are asked to believe they are isolated incidents. The higher reaches of the chain of command have been spared, much as they were at Abu Ghraib. 
 Even a turnover in administrations doesn't guarantee reform. J. Cofer Black, the longtime C.I.A. hand who is now Blackwater's vice chairman, has signed on as a Mitt Romney adviser. Hillary Clinton's Karl Rove, Mark Penn, doubles as the chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, the P.R. giant whose subsidiary helped prepare Mr. Prince for his Congressional testimony. Mr. Penn said the Blackwater association was ''temporary.''
 War profiteering happens even in ''good'' wars. Arthur Miller made his name in 1947 with ''All My Sons,'' which ends with the suicide of a corrupt World War II contractor whose defective airplane parts cost 21 pilots their lives. But in the case of Iraq, this corruption has been at the center of the entire mission, from war-waging to nation-building. As the investigative reporters Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele observed in the October Vanity Fair, America has to date ''spent twice as much in inflation-adjusted dollars to rebuild Iraq as it did to rebuild Japan -- an industrialized country three times Iraq's size, two of whose cities had been incinerated by atomic bombs.'' (And still Iraq lacks reliable electric power.)
 The cost cannot be measured only in lost opportunities, lives and money. There will be a long hangover of shame. Its essence was summed up by Col. Ted Westhusing, an Army scholar of military ethics who was an innocent witness to corruption, not a participant, when he died at age 44 of a gunshot wound to the head while working for Gen. David Petraeus training Iraqi security forces in Baghdad in 2005. He was at the time the highest-ranking officer to die in Iraq.
 Colonel Westhusing's death was ruled a suicide, though some believe he was murdered by contractors fearing a whistle-blower, according to T. Christian Miller, the Los Angeles Times reporter who documents the case in his book ''Blood Money.'' Either way, the angry four-page letter the officer left behind for General Petraeus and his other commander, Gen. Joseph Fil, is as much an epitaph for America's engagement in Iraq as a suicide note. 
 ''I cannot support a msn that leads to corruption, human rights abuse and liars,'' Colonel Westhusing wrote, abbreviating the word mission. ''I am sullied.''

HEADLINE: A Canadian Condo Boom

BYLINE: By LINDA BAKER

 BODY:
Vancouver, British Columbia
 ON a recent Wednesday evening at the downtown Gotham Steakhouse here, about 100 people gathered around an open bar for a party given by Ian Watt, a Century 21 broker, who had invited clients to thank them for buying property in the city.
 One of the guests was Annu Gill. With her fiance, Rick Gill, who coincidentally has the same last name, she bought a 1,200-square-foot condominium at the Sheraton Wall Centre, a 42-story hotel with 74 units in downtown Vancouver. The condo cost one million Canadian dollars, currently worth about $1.03 million. 
 ''When I try to explain to friends in the States how much it costs here, they don't believe me,'' Ms. Gill, 29, who is a real estate broker, said of the city's high prices. ''They say, 'You're lying.''' 
 But $840 a square foot -- which is how much the couple paid for their condo -- is not unusual these days. 
 Downtown Vancouver is the most expensive housing market in Canada, according to a survey of 21 cities worldwide released last April by Century 21. The average sales price for a condo in Vancouver was around $419,750 in 2007, up 14.6 percent from last year, according to Royal Le Page Real Estate Services. The average sales price in Toronto, Canada's largest city, was about $241,818, up 15.7 percent from last year, and in Montreal, $201,818, up 4.6 percent.
 The number of homes in Vancouver selling for more than $2 million also rose this year, by 48 percent, according to Re/Max Associates. The higher prices reflect years of price gains of 15 to 20 percent, according to Helmut Pastrick, the chief economist for the Credit Union Central of British Columbia.
 Fueling the high-end market are foreign and second-home buyers, he said, though not necessarily from the United States. The weak American dollar, which for the first time in decades is worth less than the Canadian dollar, has been making real estate in Canada more expensive for Americans.
 Other foreign buyers make up a significant percentage of the market, according to Ian Gillespie, the president of Westbank Projects. The company is building several residential towers downtown, including the 60-story Living Shangri-La, which will be Vancouver's tallest building after it is completed in 2009.
 ''This is a very multicultural city,'' said Mr. Gillespie, who cited as an example a pharmaceutical executive from the Middle East, who recently bought a 1,700-square-foot $3.65 million condo at the Fairmont Pacific Rim.
 The city's population has grown substantially as a result. In 2006, there were 36,321 more people living in Vancouver than in 2005, according to Statistics Canada, and 72 percent of the newcomers were immigrants. 
 It's not hard to imagine why the city is so appealing: Vancouver has been described as Canada's version of San Francisco. It has a cosmopolitan feel, yet it is surrounded by mountains and water. The temperate climate attracts retirees, while the vibrant urban lifestyle draws young singles. The economy, supported by forest products, mining and an active film industry, is also growing, thanks in part to the development associated with serving as host of the 2010 winter Olympic Games. 
 The most expensive condo on the market in downtown Vancouver right now is a 7,000-square-foot waterfront penthouse listed for $18.2 million. The 38-year-old owner, an entrepreneur, said he bought the condo for $3 million four years ago, then sunk millions more into renovations.
 Jamie MacDougall, an agent with Sotheby's International Realty, said that the condo was still considered ''cheap'' compared with comparable properties in New York or San Francisco. It has been on the market since July.
 Although price increases have slowed this year, Vancouver's housing market is not experiencing a bubble, Mr. Pastrick said. Less aggressive mortgage underwriting practices have helped shield Canada from the credit squeeze that swept through the subprime mortgage market in the United States after the fallout in housing.
 Bob Rennie, the president of Rennie Marketing Systems, a real estate marketing company, said Canadians typically put down 20 percent in nonrefundable deposits.
 Every crane downtown is sitting over a building that is 75 to 100 percent sold out, with large deposits in place, Mr. Rennie said. ''So the consumer is committed, and the developer is not at risk with construction,'' he noted. There are about 50 condo towers under construction in the downtown area. 
 In 2006, Diana Becker, the owner of a culinary tourism company, paid $900,000 for a two-bedroom in the 37-story Jameson House, which is scheduled to open in 2009. Ms. Becker, who now lives on the outskirts of downtown, said she had been attracted to the development's design. ''It feels very Spanish Moroccan,'' she said. Ms. Becker says she is also looking forward to being able to walk to her favorite downtown restaurants like Le Crocodile. 
 Not everybody is enthusiastic about Vancouver's growth. To make room for some projects, hundreds of single-room-occupancy hotel rooms for low-income residents have been lost, said David Eby, a lawyer with the Pivot Legal Society, a legal advocacy group. High prices are pushing out middle-income renters and buyers, he added. 
 Gordon Price, the director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University, said the city erred by abandoning its commitment to maintain a 33 percent low-income housing mix in the Southeast False Creek site. The development is being built initially to house athletes during the Olympics. Later, it is to be converted into condominiums and town houses selling for $600,000 to $6 million.
 The city reverted to a 20 percent low-income housing mix because of concerns about cost, said Jennifer Young, a city spokeswoman, explaining that there had been a drop in government financing for low-income housing.
 Darek Cole, for one, says he feels lucky to afford a home in the city. ''Vancouver is a difficult place to get into compared to other cities,'' said Mr. Cole, 26, who works for a marketing company. He paid $270,000 for a 600-square-foot condo in the city's Downtown Eastside neighborhood. 
 ''I knew it would be a good investment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The United Nations of Brooklyn

BYLINE: By GABRIEL THOMPSON. 
Gabriel Thompson is the author of ''There's No Jose Here: Following the Hidden Lives of Mexican Immigrants.'' His most recent book is ''Calling All Radicals.''

 BODY:
HUDOYKUL HAFIZOV, a soft-spoken, slightly built immigrant from Uzbekistan, works as inventory manager at Silver Rod Pharmacy in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and he has a favorite joke:
 ''A person who knows three languages is trilingual. 
 ''Someone who knows two languages is bilingual. 
 ''But do you know what they call a person who speaks only one language?'' 
 Pausing for a beat, Mr. Hafizov replied triumphantly to his own question, ''American!'' 
 Smiling broadly, he adjusted his reading glasses and returned to his typing. 
 Mr. Hafizov, who is 36 years old and emigrated in 2000 from the ancient city of Samarkand, himself speaks five languages: English, Uzbek, Russian, Tajik and Turkish. Despite his official title at the pharmacy, he, like most of the 40 employees, is frequently summoned to play interpreter, to explain medication instructions or shipping options to immigrant customers who use the store's Western Union services to send remittance checks back home. 
 In microcosm, the little drugstore and its customers tell a striking and in some respects unfamiliar story of ethnic change. Bensonhurst, which sits snugly south of Borough Park and east of Bay Ridge, is in nearly every respect not what it used to be.
 As recently as the 1980s, nearly everyone who worked at the pharmacy had been born in Italy, or at least in Brooklyn. Over the last decade or so, this has changed. The pharmacy's work force now includes people from around the globe -- from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Georgia and Russia, from Mexico and Panama, China and Korea, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A total of 16 languages are spoken in this single storefront on 18th Avenue near 65th Street.
 The diversity of the pharmacy's staff has both mirrored and been a response to the growing diversity of the neighborhood. People often talk about the melting pot that is 21st-century Queens. Yet over the past decade, and with little fanfare, Bensonhurst has evolved into one of the city's largest and most diverse immigrant communities.
 Its two primary ZIP codes are home to more immigrants than any other neighborhood of Brooklyn -- about 76,000 of the neighborhood's 158,000 residents are foreign-born -- more, even, than better-known immigrant destinations like Jackson Heights or Elmhurst. 
 Census data show that Bensonhurst has as many Russians as Brighton Beach, and as many Chinese as Sunset Park. About 10,000 Ukrainians call it home, along with 2,500 Latin Americans and almost as many Pakistanis. Two-thirds of Bensonhurst households speak a language other than English at home. 
 All of this might be surprising to many people, given that in 1989, less than two decades ago, Bensonhurst's reputation as an insular and sometimes bigoted neighborhood was cemented with the murder of Yusuf Hawkins. A 16-year-old African-American from East New York, Brooklyn, Yusuf had been visiting the area to inquire about a used car when he was surrounded by a gang of white youths wielding baseball bats and shot to death. 
 Barely a generation later, the neighborhood that came to personify racial hostility has emerged to become the new face of the city's diversity. (The one exception remains African-Americans and African immigrants, excluding Egyptians, who continue to make up fewer than 1 percent of the residents, although whether this is due to the lingering effect of the Yusuf Hawkins shooting is difficult to determine.)
 ''You have all types of people here,'' Mr. Hafizov said as he sat in the pharmacy's basement, surrounded by boxes of medication, and entered price codes into a computer database. ''It makes you feel like a small fish in a big ocean.'' 
 'Unlike Anywhere Else'
 It is a testament to the insular nature of neighborhoods that when New Yorkers think of Bensonhurst, many still think only of Italians or perhaps Jews. Its very name suggests a place where the faces are wrinkled and white, where women trade recipes from the old country and men with names like Mancini and Scotto wax nostalgic about life on the docks. 
 But as the 2005 hit documentary ''Mad Hot Ballroom'' showed, the fifth-grade dancers from Bensonhurst's Public School 112 represented a rainbow of ethnicities. Today, more than half of the school's 465 students are Asian and nearly a fifth are Latino. One in five speaks limited English. 
 Not that Italians have disappeared. When Italy won the World Cup last year, it seemed as if ''the entire country of Italy had come out to celebrate,'' one local merchant commented. Elderly men still sit outside social clubs sipping espresso and chattering in Italian. 
 But the neighborhood that was the setting for the 1970s television series ''Welcome Back, Kotter,'' giving a young John Travolta his star-making role as the high school ringleader Vinnie Barbarino, has since hemorrhaged Italians. From 1980 to 2000, half the residents of Italian descent left, and the number now is just under 60,000. 
 ''Italians are moving to Long Island, New Jersey and Staten Island,'' lamented Salvatore Fronterre, vice president of the Federation of Italian-American Organizations of Brooklyn. ''Young people move away, and then their parents follow.'' Though the neighborhood still has what Mr. Fronterre calls ''good Italian flavor,'' he is not sure how much longer that will last. ''It depends,'' he said, ''on how long we're going to live.''
 Isabel Moccia, who has worked at Silver Rod for 15 years, is one of the pharmacy's few remaining employees from Italy. She immigrated to Brooklyn in 1970, when she was 9, and she still lives in the three-family brick house on 71st Street that her parents purchased for $60,000 in 1975. 
 ''The small group of Italians that are still here, they're not happy,'' Ms. Moccia said. It is not that the neighborhood's indigenous Italians object to the newer arrivals, she said. ''They're angry at all the Italians who have left. They say that they're greedy, that they just took the money and ran.'' 
 The economics driving the departing Italians are easy to understand. A recent estimate put the price of Ms. Moccia's house at nearly $1 million; with that kind of money, Italians can retire comfortably to the suburbs.
 By flocking to Bensonhurst in the early 1900s, Italians transformed the neighborhood. Their departure is having an equally profound effect. 
 ''It's unlike anywhere else in the city,'' said Joseph Salvo, director of the population division at the Department of City Planning. ''The key is that the Italian community was just so large and tight, and now that they're leaving, it's created the largest vacuum of housing availability in the city. And immigrants are the ones quickly filling the vacuum.'' 
 A wide array of immigrants rushed to replace the departing Italians, beginning in the late 1980s with the Chinese, who were eager to live in a neighborhood convenient to Chinatown by subway. As Sunset Park filled up, a logical next step was Bensonhurst, where the N train runs directly to Sunset Park and the D train to Grand Street.
 According to the 2000 Census, about 20,000 Chinese lived in Bensonhurst, and that number has risen; Steve Chung, president of the United Chinese Association of Brooklyn, estimates that the community has since doubled in size. According to the city planning agency, the census tracts with the fastest-growing Chinese population in the city are in Bensonhurst.
 As the Chinese and, to a lesser extent, Mexicans move east fromSunset Park, Russians and immigrants from the former Soviet Union are moving north from Brighton Beach, sometimes not even stopping in what for decades was the city's most Russian neighborhood. 
 ''They're increasingly heading straight from Russia to Bensonhurst,'' Mr. Salvo said. ''These families are younger and don't necessarily see the housing at Brighton Beach as desirable. They want something with more space and a bit more upscale.'' 
 Another stream of immigrants, largely South Asian, is heading into Bensonhurst from Ditmas Park and Midwood, or directly from their home countries. That is the path taken by Muhammad Alam, a slender 39-year-old who made the journey from Pakistan to Bensonhurst in 2001 and runs the 24/Seven News Cafe next door to Silver Rod. Last year, Mr. Alam was joined by his wife and young son and daughter.
 Flocks With Fresh Faces
 Milestone Park, a concrete recreation area with concrete chessboard tables, sits at the southern end of Bensonhurst, on 18th Avenue and 81st Street. One late summer afternoon, Russian and Chinese men could be seen waging fierce battles over the chessboards, at times observed by crowds three people deep.
 Muslim women in headscarves pushed children in strollers, heading to a playground across the street. A group of Pakistani teenagers relaxed on a bench, their backpacks at their feet, talking in Urdu about their efforts to form a cricket team at nearby New Utrecht High School. A Guatemalan woman watched as Mexicans loaded bread into a delivery truck and shouted instructions to one another in Spanish. 
 Across the street from the park sits the oldest institution in Bensonhurst, the New Utrecht Reformed Church, which has witnessed wave after wave of immigrants pass through its doors. Founded in 1677 by Dutch immigrants, the church was once visited by George Washington, and it was designated a city landmark in 1966.
 Louise Fabiszak, a 73-year-old retired secretary of Italian, Armenian and Syrian descent, has been a loyal member of the church nearly her entire life. She fondly remembers the Easter Sundays of her childhood, when she used to scramble to find an empty pew. But attendance at the English-speaking services has dwindled; today, as few as a dozen people might show up.
 Not that the church isn't well used.
 In 1989, six Chinese immigrants, led by the Rev. Peter Loew, approached New Utrecht about using the 1892 parish house next to the sanctuary for Sunday morning services. A Russian contingent was next, taking the Sunday evening slot. Then the church was approached by a group of Koreans, who now worship there on Sunday afternoons. 
 Before long, the church swirled with activity. The Chinese congregation grew quickly to about 100; the Russians had nearly as many, the Koreans about 50. All the while, the original congregation continued to shrink. 
 In the mid-1990s, Pastor Loew raised the possibility of purchasing the parish house. Two hours a week wasn't enough time to minister to his growing congregation's needs; they needed a place they could use daily. 
 In part to stave off such a move, a retired Bensonhurst carpenter named Robert Buonvino helped form an organization called Friends of Historic New Utrecht, with the goal of getting the parish house designated as an official city landmark. 
 Pastor Loew eventually gave up on the idea of buying the parish house, and though he remained on good terms with most of the church's original members, he sometimes felt an undercurrent of discrimination. ''People didn't have to say it outright,'' he said. ''But we would sometimes hear comments like 'Maybe you should go, since you're getting too big.'''
 In 1998, the parish house was designated a landmark, and soon afterward the Chinese congregation purchased a building farther south on 18th Avenue.
 Now it's the Russians who may outgrow the parish hall. And though Ms. Fabiszak hopes the church can attract the neighborhood's new immigrants to its services, that hasn't yet happened.
 ''Our minister tells us that immigrants will be our salvation,'' she said. ''The writing is on the wall -- Bensonhurst is changing. But they all want to do things in their own language, which I can understand.''
 Little Crossroads of the World
 On a recent September afternoon, a visitor to Silver Rod would have had a front-row seat from which to observe the neighborhood's increasingly heterogeneous character.
 In Aisle 2, a Mexican mother and her young son were searching for back-to-school supplies; Januario Perez, the pharmacy's head stocker, who came from Mexico in 1988 and has worked at the store for 10 years, chatted briefly with the mother in Spanish, after which the elusive binder was located.
 In Aisle 5, Ana Pui helped an older Italian woman find an anti-wrinkle cream. Ms. Pui spent the first 13 years of her life in Panama, where her parents had relocated from China to open a restaurant, and she speaks Spanish in addition to Mandarin and Cantonese. 
 After a few moments of digging, Ms. Pui found the item the customer was looking for. But that was not the end of the transaction. 
 ''Twelve dollars!'' the woman said, gasping. ''Why so expensive?''
 ''I don't know what to tell you,'' Ms. Pui replied. ''I don't make the prices here.''
 Next door, Mike Petratos and Brian Flynn, the owners of Silver Rod since 1990, monitored the final touches being applied to the newly renovated 24/Seven cafe. Last fall they took over management of what was then a sleepy newsstand, and they hope to transform it into a neighborhood destination by adding a deli, foreign-language newspapers and magazines, and eventually outdoor seating. 
 A key part of their business strategy has been to keep abreast of their customers' evolving tastes. They know, for example, which Polish papers to stock (Nowy Dziennik and Super Express) and which brand of frozen desserts their Asian customers prefer (Yolato). 
 And of course the cafe sells one product that appeals to everyone. 
 ''No matter what nationality you are,'' Mr. Petratos said, ''you drink coffee.''
