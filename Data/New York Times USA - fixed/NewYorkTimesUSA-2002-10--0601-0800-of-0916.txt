Labor Deal Is Nice, but Peace Deal Is Needed

BYLINE:  By DAVE WINFIELD; Dave Winfield was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2001. He finished with 3,110 hits and 465 home runs.

 BODY:
As a kid, I played the big three sports: baseball, basketball and football. I was drafted in all of them, and as I said in my induction speech in Cooperstown, "Baseball is the best game of all." 
 Players, owners and agents should act now to restore some of the luster and regain some of the respect, admiration and following that we have historically enjoyed and recently lost. It is time for America's pastime to look forward to the future. 
 With the World Series starting last night, it is easy to forget there is trouble in paradise. I'm excited because, of the eight teams that started in the playoffs, I played for three -- the Yankees, the Angels and the Twins. I know the exhilaration of the players, the teams and the cities.
It has been two months since collective bargaining was resolved, when, for the first time, baseball fans were heard loud and clear, helping the sides find common ground. Players and owners listened, and they should keep on listening.
Bargaining opened new doors this time, and we will see if revenue sharing is part of the solution to some of the game's woes. But, until this system is tested, and until trust develops between players and owners who work together in other key areas, there will be no long-term growth or development in Major League Baseball. This mistrust needs to be dealt with or it is just going to fester. 
Without that trust, baseball will not move forward -- it will go nowhere. 
Collective bargaining alone will not lead the way. Any piecemeal strategy to address the problems is only a temporary solution. A comprehensive, long-term strategy is needed. It would be new ground for the two sides, but it is imperative. While many people make valuable suggestions that amount to pieces of the puzzle, few address the underlying element that has kept the sides apart for what seems like forever: basic labor-management mistrust. 
While there has been some thaw in relations, the game is still in trouble. You hear that collective bargaining produced incremental improvements for each side. But I know they have not found the long-term answer. Even before I talked to players, owners and agents, I could tell from the settlement and the body language that the sides (still) do not like or trust each other. Without a major change, we will be looking at (bad) business as usual in four more years.
Despite my position working in baseball management for the San Diego Padres, I am not taking sides. I spent my entire playing career considering the relationship with fans and the community. Now I want to provide some vision and tangible concepts everyone can work with. Call it challenging the status quo, because things are still not right. I want management and the players to build a new team, a winning team where all parties work together, have joint goals and objectives and follow committed leadership.
Without characterizing the leadership on either side, a change in everyone's thinking is overdue. Many feel the players association has done an excellent job representing and advising the players on issues regarding their baseball careers. Major league baseball players today may have the best working environment and opportunities of any organized labor group in the world, but at what cost? 
Many question the efficacy of Commissioner Bud Selig, who is a de facto owner and therefore not an independent and unbiased leader. Their point is valid. And should they commission another blue-ribbon panel to consider the future of baseball marketing, it must be more inclusive; it can't be picked just by the commissioner. If the financial future of the game remains in peril even with these changes, then persuade the players association behind closed doors, but also talk about growing the game together.
Baseball needs a breakthrough, a complete paradigm shift from business as usual. Is everyone willing to make these changes? Are both sides truly prepared to improve baseball for present and future generations? If so, these are the key elements: 1) Trust that will encourage each side to work together. 2) Agreement on a continuing campaign to unify baseball with specific goals and objectives. 3) A meaningful working relationship between the players and the owners. 4) Leadership with the willingness to break free from a deep-seated mistrust and an antagonistic history.
I urge everyone to see the bigger picture and take steps to change the environment. Develop a long-term strategy. Leave a positive legacy, one that really is about changing the game. The future won't boil down to strictly economic issues or winning or losing. It is about each side doing what is necessary for its own sake, for the sake of the still loyal fans and the fans we want and need in the future.
By working together, management and the players can rise to the challenge of keeping games fun, affordable and safe. Management, spend more time promoting the great players, the good guys, the teams and the matchups. It will go far. Players, accept your roles as public figures and role models. Interact with the kids, the fans and your community so that baseball once again becomes preferred family entertainment. Make it something our kids want to grow up with.

Office Furniture Stocks Take a Seat and Wait

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO 

 BODY:
THE market for new office furniture has fallen sharply over the last two years, as waves of corporate layoffs have left many companies with more furnishings than employees.
 After peaking at $13.3 billion in 2000, sales of office furniture in the United States declined 17.4 percent in 2001, and Merrill Lynch estimates that they will decline an additional 19 percent this year, to less than $9 billion. 
 Even so, shares of the two largest office furniture makers -- Herman Miller and Steelcase -- have suffered disproportionately, some value-oriented investors say. Shares of both are down more than 40 percent from their two-year highs. 
John W. Rogers Jr., manager of the Ariel and Ariel Appreciation funds, said he thinks that the industry will "come back very strongly as the economy recovers."
The Ariel fund family, which specializes in socially screened investments, focuses on small- to mid-capitalization value stocks. The Ariel Fund has about 4 percent of its assets divided roughly equally between Herman Miller and Steelcase, while Ariel Appreciation has 1.7 percent of its assets in Herman Miller.
Analysts at the Ariel fund family estimate that the share prices of both companies may roughly double when market conditions pick up, though they are not predicting when that will happen. Herman Miller, which closed at $16.88 on Friday, could trade as high as $33, and Steelcase, which closed at $9.25, could trade at up to $22 once the business environment improves, said Sabrina L. Carollo, a stock analyst for the funds.
Of the two companies, Herman Miller was quicker to initiate big cost cuts. "Steelcase is still in the process of cost cutting," said Pamela Singleton, an equity analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Recently they talked about eliminating another 500 to 800 staff. I think Herman Miller has made the adjustments." 
The bulk of the office furniture industry is divided among small, privately held companies. Steelcase, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., has a 20 percent share of the domestic market, and Herman Miller has 13 percent. The only other major competitor is Hon Industries of Muscatine, Iowa, at 12 percent. But many value investors aren't as excited about Hon because its shares have risen over the last year; they now trade at $22.63, up 16.4 percent in the last 12 months.
Hon is also more diversified than the competition. About 15 percent of its revenue comes from a division that makes fireplaces. But Hon's main advantage is that it mostly makes cheaper, ready-to-order products. That segment of the market has weathered the downturn much better than that for big new offices, the focus of both Herman Miller and Steelcase.
Revenue at Herman Miller, which is based in Zeeland, Mich., was $347 million for its first quarter ended in August, down 15.5 percent from the period a year earlier. But aggressive cost cutting helped generate a profit of 13 cents a share. That is up from 4 cents a share, excluding one-time restructuring charges, from the prior year.
Unless the economy sinks into another recession, Ms. Singleton predicts annual earnings of 56 to 62 cents a share for the company's fiscal year ending May 2003, versus 2 cents a share for the year ended in May 2002.
In addition to layoffs and plant closures, Herman Miller has discontinued two product lines, SQA and Red, that were started in the summer of 2000 to cater to the small-business market. This restructuring could save the company $80 million a year, said Curt Organt, an equity analyst at T. Rowe Price, which owns more than two million shares of Herman Miller in seven funds.
BUT cost savings alone don't justify Wall Street's preference for Herman Miller, said James Norris, manager of the C&B Mid Cap Value fund. Herman Miller currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.9, versus a ratio of 0.51 for Steelcase. "We think that Herman Miller deserves a slight premium to Steelcase, but not as much as it has now," he said.
There could be another reason for unequal treatment, Mr. Norris said. Shares of both Herman Miller and Steelcase peaked in 2000, just a few months after Steelcase's initial public offering. "There's nothing the Street hates more than a burned I.P.O.," Mr. Norris said. Steelcase makes up about 4.3 percent of his fund.
Typically, demand for new office furniture picks up about six months into an economic recovery, but Roz Bryant, a stock analyst at Morningstar Inc., said the turnaround in demand could take longer this time because of the huge supply of second-hand office furniture sitting in closets.
"Though large corporations won't be scavenger hunting," she said, "that's a secondary market that could take some business away from the manufacturers."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 20 about investing in office furniture makers misstated the year when the stock prices of two such companies, Steelcase and Herman Miller, reached their peaks, and when Steelcase had its initial public offering. It was 1998, not 2000.

HEADLINE: Drilling For Freedom 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
A funny thing happened in Iran the other day. The official Iranian news agency, IRNA, published a poll on Iranian attitudes toward America, conducted by Iran's National Institute for Research Studies and Opinion Polls. The poll asked 1,500 Iranians whether they favored opening talks with America, and 75 percent said "yes." More interesting, 46 percent said U.S. policies on Iran -- which include an economic boycott and labeling Iran part of an "axis of evil" -- were "to some extent correct."
 Oops! 
 You can imagine what happened next. Iran's hard-liners shut down the polling institute and threatened the IRNA official who published the results. Never mind. The fact that the hard-liners had to do such a thing shows how out of touch they are with Iran's courageous mainstream. 
I relate this incident because it is very useful in thinking about the task of democratic transition in the Middle East. The Arab and Muslim worlds today are largely dominated by autocratic regimes. If you want to know what it would look like for them to move from autocracy to democracy, check out Iran. In many countries it will involve an Iranian-like mixture of theocracy and democracy, in which the Islamists initially win power by the ballot box, but then can't deliver the jobs and rising living standards that their young people desire, so they come under popular pressure and can only hold on to power by force.
But eventually they will lose, because the young generation in Iran today knows two things: (1) They've had enough democracy to know they want more of it. (2) They've had enough theocracy crammed down their throats to know they want less of it. Eventually, they will force a new balance in Iran, involving real democracy and an honored place for Islam, but not an imposed one.
But why is it taking so long? Why isn't Iran like Poland or Hungary after the fall of the Berlin Wall? And why might Iraq not be like them after the fall of Saddam? The answer is spelled O-I-L.
The transition from autocracy to real democracy in Iran is dragged out much longer than in Europe for many reasons, but the most important is because the hard-line mullahs control Iran's oil wealth. What that means is that they have a pool of money that they can use to monopolize all the instruments of coercion -- the army, police and intelligence services. And their pool of money is not dependent on their opening Iran's economy or political system or being truly responsive to their people's aspirations.
Think of it like this: There are two ways for a government to get rich in the Middle East. One is by drilling a sand dune and the other is by drilling the talents, intelligence, creativity and energy of its men and women. As long as the autocratic leaders of Iran, Iraq or Saudi Arabia can get rich by drilling their natural resources, they can stay in power a long, long time. All they have to do is capture control of the oil tap. Only when a government has to drill its human resources will it organize itself in a way that enables it to extract those talents -- with modern education, open trade, and freedom of thought, of scientific enquiry and of the press.
For all these reasons, if we really want to hasten the transition from autocracy to something more democratic in places like Iraq or Iran, the most important thing we can do is gradually, but steadily, bring down the price of oil -- through conservation and alternative energies.
I know that Dick Cheney thinks conservation is for sissies. Real men send B-52's. But he's dead wrong. In the Middle East, conservation and alternative energies are strategic tools. Ronald Reagan helped bring down the Soviet Union by using two tactics: he delegitimized the Soviets and he defueled them. He delegitimized them by branding the Soviet Union an "Evil Empire," and by exposing its youth to what was going on elsewhere in the world, and he defueled them by so outspending them on Star Wars that the Soviet Union went bankrupt. In the Middle East today, the Bush team is delegitimizing the worst regimes as an "axis of evil," but it is doing nothing to defuel them. Just the opposite. We refuel them with our big cars.
Which was the first and only real Arab democracy? Lebanon. Which Arab country had no oil? Lebanon. Which is the first Arab oil state to turn itself into a constitutional monarchy? Bahrain. Which is the first Arab oil state to run out of oil? Bahrain.
Ousting Saddam is necessary for promoting the spread of democracy in the Middle East, but it won't be sufficient, it won't stick, without the Mideast states kicking their oil dependency and without us kicking ours.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Bleak Earnings; 
Is Bankruptcy Good for the Airlines?

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
THE chief executives of the nation's largest airlines have been engaging in their version of the soup kitchen shuffle. Tin bowls in hand, they have marched up to Capitol Hill in the last few weeks seeking more financial aid for an industry expected to lose at least $7 billion this year. They offer what seems a compelling rationale: Multiple airline bankruptcies could leave a huge dent in the already fragile economy.
 "Aviation is a fundamental prop to the economy," said Leo F. Mullin, chief executive of Delta Air Lines. "Aviation affects 10 percent of our national income, and affects travel and tourism. Suppliers are dependent on it. Enormous industries are dependent on it." 
 But many economists and industry experts say the executives are being alarmist, with some insisting that multiple bankruptcies might even make the industry -- if not the overall economy -- stronger in the long run. 
Certainly, bankruptcies would damage investor confidence in the industry, as well as hurt specific regions, especially if air service to smaller cities is curtailed and workers laid off. Also, carriers that have limped to their deaths under Chapter 11 have left a temporary gap in service. Yet the market could quickly adapt to alleviate those changes, economists argue, and experience has shown that carriers can emerge healthier from bankruptcy.
"Going bankrupt just means reorganizing and getting costs in line," said Steven A. Morrison, an economics professor at Northeastern University. "I don't think 100 percent of those companies would go away. I don't look forward to carriers going bankrupt, but to predict chaos is overstating it."
Bleak earnings reports from the airlines last week make this discussion more than theoretical. The industry lost at least $2.2 billion in the third quarter, with American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, leading with a $924 million net loss. United Airlines continues to say it could join US Airways in Chapter 11.
The immediate effects of multiple bankruptcies would be painfully felt, from the airlines' major hubs to the smaller, low-profit regions they service. Large numbers of workers could be laid off at the hubs, adding to the tens of thousands that major carriers began cutting after the Sept. 11 attacks. The airlines could also ask a bankruptcy court to nullify costly labor contracts. Lower pay would mean less money in the cities where the workers live, and would pressure rival carriers to cut labor costs to remain competitive. Travel-dependent businesses like hotels and car rental agencies would be hit hard.
In addition, shareholders, creditors and suppliers of the bankrupt airlines would suffer financial losses. Most notable in that group is the Boeing Company, one of the nation's largest manufacturers. 
Beyond that, though, multiple bankruptcies would have few ripples. Economists point out that several airlines, including Continental, now the nation's fifth-largest carrier, went into bankruptcy in the early 90's with little effect on the broader economy. Much like US Airways now, Continental kept flying under bankruptcy protection, and eventually emerged from Chapter 11 as a relatively healthy company.
Some industry experts even contend that bankrupt airlines could stimulate travel because deep cost-cutting could lead to lower fares. There is some debate over this, however. Several economists say there is no evidence that airlines in Chapter 11 become more price competitive. And if the number of seats is cut, fares would probably rise if demand remains the same.
IT may prove true that short-term disruption to air travel would result if bankrupt airlines have to sell assets because of unsuccessful restructuring. But even then, financially robust rivals would probably step in -- as long as there are profits to be made.
"The healthier carriers will pick up slack," said Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution and author, with Professor Morrison and others, of "The Evolution of the Airline Industry." "They would just fill up more seats."
Overall, many experts say, bankruptcy would force a bloated industry to swallow some bitter, but essential, medicine. They argue that airlines cannot raise prices now because of an oversupply of seats. Generous labor contracts also create unsustainable operating costs. 
"If you buy into the rhetoric and you put more government money into this industry to freeze the current system, there's no end in sight," said Sam Peltzman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. "This is no different than the situation in the early 1970's, when the northeastern railroads all went into bankruptcy. The government reaction was to freeze the system. The bailout was growing at 20 percent per year. At some point in the mid-70's, Congress looked around and said, 'Is this the best we can do with our money?' "
Today, politicians in Washington seem as skeptical as economists about the dire claims of airlines. The House aviation subcommittee has proposed a bill that would give only limited financial aid. 
Yet that bill is seen as inadequate even by some economists who play down the negatives of bankruptcy. They argue the government should assume the costs of new security measures mandated by federal officials after the Sept. 11 attacks. No other industry, they say, has been asked to take on this extra financial burden while grappling with many continuing economic woes. 
"If you have multiple major airline bankruptcies, you're going to have a smaller, less vibrant system, and that will support a whole lot less economic activity in the U.S.," said Robert L. Crandall, former chief executive of American Airlines. 
That may be true, but history has shown that a wounded economy -- and a wounded airline industry -- have more resilience than people realize.

Cheap Mortgages, Expensive Debt

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FIRST it was the stock market. Now the question is whether the housing market, the primary generator and repository of wealth for most people, is a bubble.
 At a time when the recovery from the recession last year is sputtering, the outlook depends heavily on how much longer the economy can rely on surging home prices, low interest rates and the willingness of consumers to keep borrowing and spending. The direction of housing values could also help determine whether the American economy will bounce back gradually or risk a long slide, like the one afflicting Japan, where a downward spiral in stock and real estate values has depressed the world's No. 2 economy for more than a decade. 
 In retrospect, economists from Alan Greenspan on down agree that the run-up in stock prices in the late 1990's was unsustainable. But even as Wall Street has wiped out trillions of dollars of wealth, the economy has been kept afloat partly by what some analysts consider another example of ephemeral financial levitation: a continued sharp rise in home prices, even in the face of the stock slump, fueled by low interest rates. 
The median price of a single family home in August, the most recent month for which figures are available, was $163,600, up 6.4 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. In many regions, the increases have been considerably higher, and in some places, the prices have been breathtakingly high. 
In Orange County, Calif., the median price of $411,000 this summer was 16.6 percent higher than a year earlier. In the Washington region, the median price of $249,700 was up 20.8 percent. In Bergen and Passaic counties in New Jersey, the increase was 24.7 percent, to $338,800.
At the same time, consumer debt levels -- fueled in part by the ability of homeowners to borrow against the rising value of their houses -- have risen to worrisome levels. 
Mortgage foreclosures hit a record 1.23 percent of all home loans in the second quarter, up from 1.10 percent in the previous quarter and exceeding the previous record of 1.14 percent in the first quarter of 1999, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Total household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income has risen to 107 percent from 96 percent in 1996, according to the Federal Reserve.
The housing market is "bubble-like," argues Allen Sinai, chief economist of Decision Economics, a consulting firm. "Real estate hangs out there now as the only asset that hasn't yet been hit," he said. "History tells us things don't usually turn out that way."
So far, the combination of low interest rates and rising housing values has been invaluable in offsetting a deep slump in spending by companies, which remain reluctant to invest in new plants and equipment when they are plagued by overcapacity and worried about terrorism and a possible war with Iraq.
Taking advantage of bargain financing deals, consumers have snapped up automobiles, keeping a big industry humming. Most of all, low mortgage rates have set off waves of refinancing, allowing homeowners to put more money in their pockets by reducing their monthly payments or borrowing more against the increased value of their houses.
Mr. Greenspan and many other economists see no evidence that consumers are staggering under their debt loads at the moment or that housing prices have reached irrational levels. 
"We've looked at the bubble question, and we've concluded that it is most unlikely," Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee last summer, adding that plenty of reasons exist for home prices to be rising, from low rates to a lack of land in many regions.
"This isn't Japan, and this isn't like the stock market," said Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor and Clinton administration official. Although total debt burdens are high, low interest rates have kept monthly debt payments within reason. Debt-service payments as a percentage of disposable income stood at a little over 14 percent in the second quarter, about where they have been for the last several years, though higher than they were in the mid-1980's.
"Is the consumer extended? Absolutely," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management, an investment firm. "Is there a risk? Absolutely. But it's nothing new. All through the 90's we pushed the problem of low savings and high debt out into the future somewhere."
BUT some economists say it is easy to envision a downward cycle in which falling real estate values and heavy consumer debt drag the economy into a morass, especially if unemployment shoots up and the stock market stays down.
"We were in a euphoric or at least confident time in the 90's," said Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale University who was one of the first to spot the stock market bubble. "Now we're in an annoyed, angry, betrayed mood. When bad things happen, they can get a lot of attention."

HEADLINE: Mexico Fears Migrant Deaths Will Increase With Despair 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Mexico's government, after tentatively identifying 2 of the 11 migrants found dead in a locked boxcar in Iowa this week, says it fears the deaths are a harbinger of many more to come.
 Roberto Esparza, 23, and his cousin, Omar Esparza, 17, left their hometown of Los Conos, Aguascalientes, in central Mexico in June. The two men paid a smuggler $1,500 to bring them to Sarasota, Fla., where they planned to seek landscaping and construction jobs, their family said. 
 Mexican consular officials found identification cards for the two men in a locked boxcar, among the remains of seven men and four women. The boxcar had been sitting in a rail yard in Denison, Iowa, since leaving the Mexican border town of Matamoros and crossing into Texas four months ago.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans cross the border every month looking for work in the United States. They die, on average, at a rate of about one a day. Typically, they die of exposure and dehydration in the deserts and scrublands near the borders of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.
The particularly gruesome deaths of the 11 migrants found in Iowa underscored the desperation driving the migrants from poor farming villages like Los Conos.
Over the past year, illegal immigration appears to have diminished because of the weakened United States economy and strengthened border surveillance.
But Mexican officials say they fear that the desperation will grow next year.
Throughout central Mexico, hundreds of farming villages like Los Conos, the Esparzas' hometown, are already all but empty of able-bodied men who have gone to seek their fortunes in the United States, where they can earn wages 10 times greater than in Mexico.
On Jan. 1, the North American Free Trade Agreement will eliminate duties on heavily subsidized American wheat, rice, barley, potatoes, dairy products, poultry, pork and beef. That will allow the importation of those products to Mexico at much cheaper prices.
Mexican officials, including Foreign Minister Jorge G. Castaneda, are warning that the end of tariffs may crush the ability of millions of Mexican farmers to survive, and drive them north seeking money to feed their families.
Mr. Castaneda and Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, will raise the issue next week with President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell at a meeting of world leaders in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

HEADLINE: Hathaway Closes Maine Factory, Last Major U.S. Shirt Plant 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WATERVILLE, Me., Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The sewing machines have stopped at the nation's last major shirt factory, which supplied shirts for Union soldiers in the Civil War.
 Its shirts were later promoted in a classic advertising campaign featuring a man with an eye patch. 
 Like Arrow and Van Heusen, C. F. Hathaway shirts will live on, but they will no longer carry the "Made in the USA" label. The plant here closed on Friday. 
After 165 years of making shirts in Maine, the factory kept only a few workers to box and fold the shirts. Distribution of the remaining shirts will keep 25 people employed through December, but the closing will put 235 people out of work.
A few workers lingered in the parking lot on Friday to say their goodbyes.
"It's losing your family," said Sherry Laliberty, 59, who worked in the plant for 35 years. "My God, we've been through divorces and deaths and children growing up and grandchildren. We've been though everything in there, and we are family." 
The factory's demise became inevitable after it failed to win a crucial contract to make shirts for the Air Force and the nonprofit Made in the USA Foundation could not line up investors to take over the plant.
"A lot of people saw the writing on the wall five or six years ago," said Ron Fingel, the Waterville city administrator. "It was expected for so long it wasn't like a shoe dropping in a quiet room."
Hathaway began production in 1837. Windsong Allegiance Group, which operated the factory, was willing to donate the equipment to anyone with the financial backing to keep it going, but nothing worked out, said Colette Sipperly, spokeswoman for the company.
Hathaway is among a growing number of apparel and shoe companies that have moved production out of the country. G.H. Bass and Cole Haan closed their Maine shoe factories in 1998 and 1999, while the Dexter shoe plant closed last year, putting 475 people out of work.
Hathaway was on the verge of closing five years ago. A local investment group financed a bailout. It was again on the verge of collapse last fall when Windsong bought the company. Less than six months later, Windsong announced plans to close the factory in June. A last-minute $5 million contract from Wal-Mart kept it running.
Donald Sappington, president of Hathaway, said it was hard to compete when products can be made elsewhere at vastly lower cost.
The advertisements featuring a man with an eye patch are imprinted in the memories of many men who also remember fathers and grandfathers who wore Hathaway shirts.
Richard Hewes, who bought 10 shirts from the factory store on Friday, recalled that his grandfather gave him Hathaway shirts. Mr. Hewes said he had been wearing them since 1975.
"I'm not saying it's a family tradition," said Mr. Hewes, a lawyer in Augusta. "It's just a good quality shirt."
Windsong, a Westport, Conn., company, has already started a Hathaway sportswear line made abroad, and it will line up plants to continue the Hathaway label for men's shirts, Ms. Sipperly said.
"Basically we think the future looks bright because it's a great brand and there's great recognition," she said.
The company may even bring back the man-with-the-eye patch advertising.
"It really needs to be reintroduced to a new generation," Ms. Sipperly said.

HEADLINE: Utah County's Toxic Tradition Is Under Threat 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: TOOELE, Utah, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
As other places in the United States have struggled to keep dangerous materials away, Tooele County has welcomed some of the deadliest things ever made: radioactive waste, ammunition, chemical and biological weapons.
 For nearly 60 years, government and private facilities here in the vast desert west of Salt Lake City have stored and processed hazardous wastes of all stripes, winning the county a reputation as one of America's foremost dumping grounds. 
 But now, even as some lethal substances are being destroyed under terms of federal mandates and international agreements, efforts to bring new toxic materials into the county have set off bruising political fights, leading to an unusual state ballot initiative next month in one case and a plea to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in another.
Caught in the breach are Tooele County residents who speak proudly of their toxic traditions and insist that the county and the country have benefited from stockpiling the material here. Since the first federal installations opened in the early days of World War II, Tooele County (pronounced Too-WILL-uh) has tripled in population, reaching almost 41,000 by the last census. 
"We have taken on a huge share of the defense of America," said Gene D. White, a Tooele County commissioner, referring to nearly a dozen federal and private operations in the county that deal with things few other places want. "Instead of getting credit, all we do is get criticized for it."
Tooele County is Utah's second-largest, at 6,930 square miles, about 84 percent of which belongs to the federal and state governments. The gathering of dangerous material here began shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when Washington designated 200 square miles of its Tooele land for weapons testing. Over the next six decades, county residents have lived alongside Air Force bombing ranges, testing and storage sites for chemical and biological weapons, mineral processing plants, toxic landfills and large incinerators now used to destroy stored weapons. Almost half the nation's supply of chemical weapons is kept at the eastern end of the county.
All the while, the county's largest towns, Tooele and Grantsville, have become thriving bedroom communities to Salt Lake City, an easy commute 30 miles to the east. The towns have affordable housing, scenic mountains, quiet neighborhoods, safe distances from bombing runs and storage sites and no evidence of uncommon health risks. 
But now, as the county waits to open its arms again, strong resistance is building to new toxic imports, although it is far from clear whether the opposition will actually stop the flow or merely delay it.
The disputes have coalesced around two entities with strong ties to the county -- Envirocare of Utah, the nation's largest private disposal company for low-level radioactive waste, and the Skull Valley Goshutes, a small Indian tribe proposing to build temporary storage for spent nuclear fuels headed to permanent entombment at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
After a dozen years of processing low-level radioactive waste, like dirt and rubble from cleanups at former weapons plants, Envirocare won federal and state permits to take materials with higher levels of radioactivity, like medical waste. But as the Goshutes' proposal began drawing more controversy, Envirocare suspended plans to seek final approval from the Legislature and governor.
"Maybe not forever and all time," said Betty Arial, a spokeswoman for Envirocare. "But for now, plans are not being discussed."
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a third-term Republican, applauded Envirocare's decision to back off, saying he would have denied any permit for higher-grade imports, but opponents to Envirocare were not taking any chances. Led by Doug Foxley, a powerful state lobbyist, they collected enough signatures to get a complex measure before voters, using the promise of desperately needed new tax money for public education as its strongest selling point.
If passed, the measure would bar all higher level radioactive materials from the state and raise taxes fourfold on revenues generated by low-grade material.
As both sides interpret the measure, it would affect only Envirocare, but critics say it would require changes to more than 100 state laws, and "that's not the way to run a democracy," Mr. Leavitt said in an interview this week. Officials in Tooele also objected on economic grounds, insisting passage would put Envirocare out of business, costing more than 250 county residents their jobs and the county a quarter of its annual income, about $5 million.
"This is a scam on state government," said Teryl Hunsaker, another county commissioner. "It will wind up hurting the state of Utah."
Mr. Foxley said, "That's nonsense and absurd, nothing but a malicious scare tactic." Insisting that "monopolies like Envirocare" do not go out of business, he added, "No one in his right mind spends the money to go through the permitting process, to stop short of going through the legislative process."
The Goshutes' effort has been no less emotional. With gaming unlawful in Utah, a band of several dozen Goshutes in Tooele County has turned to nuclear waste as a potential revenue source. A proposed deal between the Goshutes and a group of out-of-state utilities that needs to remove 40,000 tons of spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants is now awaiting federal approval.
The licensing board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to announce in December if the technical standards for the proposed site have been met. If so, commission staff members would consider recommending the project to proceed.
The deal would mean millions of dollars for the Goshutes. But court challenges are sure to follow any federal approval, and Mr. Leavitt has vowed to block the plan.
Mr. Leavitt said he was especially concerned about the safety of storing large quantities of nuclear material in one place, where they might be vulnerable to terrorist attack. He said he also worries about fighter jets that train over the area, and the occasional accidents, like cruise missiles that veer off course, striking unintended targets, as one did recently, hitting an abandoned trailer.
From the county's perspective, years of partnerships with the federal government and private disposal companies have brought none of the problems that opponents say are lurking, including health risks. Sherrie Ahlstrom, the community health supervisor, said studies by state officials had never found any links to illness or disease from toxic substances in the county.
Nicole Cline, a county planner who is writing a history of Tooele's experience with waste, conceded that people often poked fun at Tooele County as the nation's dumping ground. Her response is always the same, mindful that every community grapples with toxic waste of some sort.
"I always tell them, 'I know where mine is,' " she said. " 'Do you know where yours is?' "

HEADLINE: BackTalk; 
A Conference Extends the Sun Belt to Logan, Utah

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE

DATELINE: LOGAN, Utah 

 BODY:
Up here in the mountains of northern Utah near the Idaho border, friends of the Aggies characterize Utah State University as a middle-class striver on the brink of national recognition. Down in New Orleans, pals of the Sun Belt Conference describe it as a good-hearted "league of convenience." So when they took their vows here two days ago there was as much relief as celebration.
 "We arranged the best possible marriage," said the Utah State president, Kermit L. Hall. "This is a good business deal." 
 Utah State and the Sun Belt needed each other and both felt disrespected by their trade association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association. It was a deal forced by the economics of college sports and made urgent by new N.C.A.A. rules that will widen the gap between the big-time college teams ("the oligopoly within the monopoly," Hall calls them) and all those others who will never play in a major bowl game. Under new requirements that cover conference membership, number of sports, home-game attendance and athletic scholarships, Utah State and the Sun Belt were each in danger of being dropped from Division I-A, the premier N.C.A.A. classification. 
Utah State needed a conference for its football team, an independent since the Big West Conference dropped football after the 2000 season. The Sun Belt needed another football team to retain accreditation. So, they hooked up. 
Ask Hall, a noted legal historian, why it's so important to be classified I-A, and somewhere in the hours and days ahead (we've been talking about this since we met last January at the N.C.A.A. convention), he will imagine the future Nobel Prize winner lured to Logan by an environment of possibility that includes an airport that has yet to be built and a ski resort that has yet to be developed, as well as good music and football. 
Sometime before that, however, he will talk about what it means financially to have an independent football team that isn't Notre Dame. While the Sun Belt is a low-rent league weak in football, members share about $800,000 a year in N.C.A.A. largess (the high-rent leagues share $16 million and more among their members). In recent seasons, Utah State has been paying about $1 million a year to bring good opponents to Logan. Not great opponents, who won't come; the likes of Nebraska pay Utah State about $400,000 to come to Lincoln and lose by 30 points.
"Some might say we're being prostituted," said Coach Mick Dennehy, whose team is 2-5 after beating New Mexico, 45-44, in overtime yesterday. "But I can use those games to measure our progress. We need to get to a point where we can beat them on occasion. Our kids like to test themselves against the best. They like to go to Nebraska, go to Texas Tech, see the rabidity of fans, see the national importance of college football. 
"We'll still play one of those games a year to make money, but our goal will be to win the Sun Belt Conference. Every kid growing up has the goal of wanting to win the championship, be the M.V.P. Our society is geared to this. It supersedes the reason we play the game, which is for the love of it." 
According to Hall, the coach most negatively affected by the marriage of convenience will be Stew Morrill, the men's basketball coach, who will miss the exposure in California, his recruiting base. All Utah State teams except football, which moves to the Sun Belt next season, will spend three more seasons in the Big West. 
"I hope it's a short-term solution," said Morrill, a big, affable 50-year-old with a 71-25 record and a 10-year-contract. "It's illogical playing in the South, but I'm glad someone wants us. We need I-A football. Utah is a basketball state and this was always a good basketball school, but football rules the N.C.A.A. Life is always changing and I may never have to play in the Sun Belt."
He lifted crossed fingers. 
Meanwhile, he has a more immediate concern. Part of saving the football team was creating a women's basketball team. Morrill will have to share practice facilities. ("I will be stubborn but compromise," he said.) The new women's coach, Raegan Scott-Pebley, at 27, may be the youngest in Division I, but she has been a Utah high school and University of Colorado star, and played two seasons in the W.N.B.A. She seems likable but nobody's patsy. 
"I hired a male assistant coach because you want a male role model and a woman assistant to be sure the players have someone to go to with personal problems," she said. "Often they don't want to go to the head coach with their dramas, and there are always dramas with women. Personal connections are so important; women are more likely than men to carry things off the court, to emotionalize. 
"I'm looking for selfless players with a 3.0 or higher. Discipline is a lifestyle and winning is a learned behavior. What can I offer them?" She laughed. "A lot of playing time."
She will field her first team next season, in the Big West, where women's basketball is less competitive than in the Sun Belt. Western Kentucky, Louisiana-Lafayette, Middle Tennessee and North Texas are among the Sun Belt members. 
Neither newlywed tried to pretend that the marriage was necessarily a till-death-do-us-part match. Both viewed themselves as victims of circumstance. The outgoing president of the N.C.A.A., Cedric Dempsey, has said that some teams don't deserve to be in I-A, which is reasonable if you aren't concerned about losing face, institutional identity and money. Utah State, a strong agricultural and engineering university of some 21,000 students, is considered third in the state behind Brigham Young and the University of Utah. Weber State and Southern Utah are well behind, but presidents hate to lose ground.
"We're not going to be pushed out," Hall thundered. 
But for all his straight-talking -- and he generally rates a I-A in that category -- Hall tends to fade when asked about the recently named new president of the N.C.A.A., Myles Brand. He will say only that it is a step in the right direction that Brand is a former university president, rather than a former athletic director, as were all his predecessors. Brand gained fame at Indiana University for firing Coach Bob Knight after several publicized incidents of abusive behavior. Skeptics noted that Brand had enabled Knight's abusive behavior for years. Utah State coaches and Sun Belt administrators are not so sure that someone with so little college sports experience should be in charge.
As if the N.C.A.A. was about college or sports, rather than TV and sneaker deals for the powerful schools, crippling rules for lesser schools and for the so-called student-athletes.
"When I went to the N.C.A.A. meetings, I might as well have been from Mars," Hall said in an e-mail message to me several weeks before the marriage was announced. "With no help from the N.C.A.A., we have managed to do just what they did not want us to do. Perhaps with a place in the Sun Belt, we'll be able to get a voice in the national discussion, since it is clear to me, as remote as we may be on the map, we are very much in the middle of what is happening in intercollegiate athletics."

Re "More Greens? A Red Light From Martha's Vineyard" (news article, Oct. 18):
 Most Martha's Vineyard residents, seasonal visitors and even day-trippers would agree that the last thing the Vineyard needs is "more greens," especially with a $150,000 to $200,000 price tag for membership. 
 The golf course proposal by Corey A. Kupersmith, a developer from Connecticut, has been rejected three times now, a process characterized by threats, intimidation and personal attacks on members of the Martha's Vineyard Commission. 
And now Mr. Kupersmith is quoted as saying of the commission members, "There's going to be retribution." He also said: "The only way to get a fair hearing is when they start seeing economic harm. Each member of the commission better get a lawyer." So this is how you get a "fair hearing"?
It's sad indeed when that combination of greed, ego and arrogance gets the better of a fellow.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DOMESTIC SECURITY; 
Possibility of Using Trucks For Terror Remains Concern

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
After the terrorist attacks last year, intelligence agencies and experts warned that America's vast fleet of trucks, particularly rigs hauling loads of explosive fuel or toxic chemicals, would be ideal terrorist weapons.
 Fresh threats against economic targets and three attacks overseas this year using fuel trucks have convinced security officials that America's trucks pose a greater risk than ever, particularly with aviation security tightened. But little has been done to make trucks safer. 
 Truck security systems already widely used elsewhere in the world remain novelties here. Truck inspections, although there are more of them, remain rare. Industry groups have started training drivers how to spot possible terrorists but have reached only a few thousand of the country's three million licensed drivers. At many truck stops, idling rigs still sit unattended in unguarded lots. 
"We have to consider the trucking industry as a potential target to be misused in a terrorist attack," said George A. Rodriguez, director of cargo security for the Transportation Security Administration. 
Congress set tough deadlines and provided billions of dollars to enhance airline security, but except for $500,000 a year for the industry's driver-training course, little money has flowed so far to secure the most dangerous trucks, even though nearly 800,000 loads of hazardous cargo move on American highways each day.
Some trucking companies, operating on tightening margins, say they have held off investing in new security technologies, like tracking devices in use in South America, while they wait for federal rules or money.
Federal action has also been delayed by bureaucratic tangles at the Transportation Department, which has been trying to impose domestic-security duties on divisions dealing with truck safety and hazardous materials management, department officials say. 
Regulations on truck safety and security equipment are many months away, they say.
Mr. Rodriguez said the size and diversity of the trucking business hampered the effort. "You've got a half-million trucking operations out there," he said. "To come up with some systems that cover all the bases is difficult."
As a result, an array of experts and industry people, including some truckers who haul the hazardous loads, say it is just a matter of time before a deadly load is snatched and put to devastating use.
"A tractor-trailer with the right cargo offers a horrendous weapon," said Richard W. Carr, the vice president for safety and risk management at Quality Distribution Inc., a Tampa, Fla., company. 
The company has the country's largest tank-truck fleet, more than 3,200 vehicles in all.
Recent events overseas have raised fresh concerns.
Two taped warnings attributed to Al Qaeda both specified that attacks would target America's economic lifeline. Intelligence officials say this most likely means transportation or finance.
A more ominous sign, experts say, is that fuel-laden trucks have been used three times this year in terrorist attacks. On April 11, a terrorist driving a truck carrying liquefied natural gas ignited his cargo in front of a synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba, killing 21 people, mainly German and French tourists. Germany blames Al Qaeda.
In May and August, terrorists remotely triggered bombs attached to Israeli fuel tankers. Neither bomb caused substantial damage, but the incidents signaled a new tactic. 
A senior terrorism analyst for the federal government said American truckers needed to be alert to the heightened risk. "Information sharing is particularly important when a technique has been looked at or tried overseas," he said.
This month, Mr. Rodriguez has met repeatedly with industry groups, and counterterrorism teams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation have provided fresh updates to local officials and trucking businesses. At one briefing, federal authorities said truck inspectors should watch for drums laid out in a V shape, the configuration used by Timothy J. McVeigh in 1995 to focus the blast of his truck bomb at the Oklahoma City federal building that was his target, meeting participants said.
Still, federal terrorism analysts and other officials concede that a bomb is not necessary because the nation's hazardous cargo offers the same opportunity that airliners provided 13 months ago -- the chance to transform ubiquitous vehicles into mobile weapons of war.
About 50,000 trips are made each day by gasoline tankers, many of which hold as much fuel as a Boeing 757. Many of the depots where they fill up are unattended, dispensing fuel with the stroke of a driver's card. The trips often end with a late-night delivery to a deserted gas station. Experts say that chemicals present an even greater risk, particularly those like chlorine or cyanide, which can form clouds of deadly fumes. 
Across North America, terrorism officials were alerted in May when a truck hauling 96 drums of sodium cyanide was stolen north of Mexico City. Most of the 55-gallon drums were quickly recovered, but the hijacking showed the ease with which terrorists could appropriate a potential chemical weapon.
The very placards that trucks must carry to inform firefighters of toxic contents could also direct terrorists to particularly deadly cargo, experts say.
"Gasoline and propane are very spectacular, but realistically they pale in potential damage or injuries compared to a lot of other products that move by truck," said a senior official at a chemical-hauling company. "And the placards pretty much advertise exactly what's inside."
As officials and the trucking industry focus on security, two strategies are foremost: finding technology that can deter hijackings and changing habits of drivers that expose them to risks.
Technological solutions may eventually help, but the government has only begun to assess them.
Last month, the Transportation Department announced a two-year project to test satellite-tracking systems, coded switches that disable a truck if an unauthorized driver takes control, and other security devices.
Industry groups are helping pay for the $5 million project, which will equip 100 trucks as rolling test beds.
But some companies that make such equipment say it should already be in use, pointing to its popularity in places like Brazil, where hijackings are common. 
One system, sold by QualComm, a San Diego company, allows a fleet manager to disable a truck by remote control if it strays from its route. For nearly a decade, it has been used on 25,000 trucks in Brazil, helping companies recover $500 million in stolen freight, QualComm officials said. Some industry officials have concerns about such systems, which could pose a safety risk if a truck was disabled while moving on a highway.
Drew Robertson, the head of the Freight Transport Security Consortium, a new group representing manufacturers of truck security systems, says the impediment to wider use is disagreement over who pays -- the truck owners, the oil and chemical companies that hire them or the government.
Other experts and industry officials say technology is only half the battle. "Truckers really have to look at how they operate and do basic things like put padlocks on trailers, don't leave tractors running, lock their tractors, be observant," Mr. Rodriguez said.
The clearest vulnerability, experts agree, comes when trucks are stopped. To avoid long layovers, some companies have begun using crews of two drivers or setting up relays in which one driver turns a load over to another without pause.
In May, the Trucking Security Working Group, representing everything from moving companies to the country's 1,100 private truck stops, began a campaign to train drivers how to recognize the rehearsals or reconnaissance that terrorists undertake before an attack. 
Drivers are advised to report people photographing truck depots, following trucks on routes or asking questions.
Sessions for 40 or 50 drivers and managers at a time have been held in 18 states since May, with the goal being raising the awareness of all 3.1 million licensed truck drivers, said officials at the American Trucking Association, a trade group.
But glaring vulnerabilities remain all along transportation corridors. A paucity of secure parking areas causes many drivers to seek quiet side streets, vacant mall lots or highway ramps as a place to rest.
The vulnerability is illustrated by a continuing crime wave. Truck and cargo theft results in more than $10 billion in annual losses, according to industry officials, and some 1,800 large trucks are stolen each year just in New Jersey.
In the absence of quick federal action, some states are intensifying efforts to cut risks of a terrorist truck attack. 
The California Highway Patrol has hired 150 new officers to bolster patrols, said Dwight O. Helmick, the highway patrol commissioner. The state is also installing radiation detectors at weigh stations.
Florida has ordered two gamma ray systems to scan trucks. They are similar to systems being installed at ports to scrutinize cargo containers. State officials said the scanners can identify small details inside an 18-wheeler in 10 to 20 seconds -- including modifications hinting that a truck has been turned into a weapon.
Still, experts acknowledge that inspectors and detectors can screen only a tiny percentage of the endless flow of vehicles.
Mr. Carr, the security chief for the tank-truck company in Tampa, said that roadside inspections of Quality Distribution's trucks tripled over the last year but still involved only 3,600 stopped trucks out of the 300,000 deliveries.
This month, as state inspectors conducted a spot check along Interstate 84 in Promised Land, Pa., the parade of hissing giants spoke of the challenge facing antiterrorism officials. 
Many trucks carried innocuous cargo -- kitchen cabinets, french fries, garbage. But others hauled 40-ton loads of gasoline or toxic chemicals. On one low-slung gray tanker, the orange safety placards read simply: "blasting agents."
While focused on safety, such inspections provide chances to find trucks that might have been stolen or modified by terrorists.
Stan Madurski, one of the inspectors, said three kinds of vehicles were considered the highest terrorism risk: rented trucks, trucks toting the sealed metal containers that move from ship to rail to roads, and tankers. 
Without any cues from the industry or officials, some drivers have begun to change their habits, sensing that they are the last line of defense. 
At a rest stop an hour east of Promised Land, Ronnie Yliniemi, 58, a driver for 34 years, roused himself from a nap and conducted what has become a post-9/11 routine: a quick circuit of his gleaming tanker to check for tampering. 
Everywhere he goes, he said, he still sees trucks idling unattended and others with deadly chemicals but no locks on the valves.
In the wrong hands, he said, it would be simple to crash one into a building or open valves to release clouds of deadly gas. 
"It'll happen eventually," he said. "I've got that feeling."

HEADLINE: Casinos Revive a Town, but Poverty Persists 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: TUNICA, Miss., Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Awnings and young trees line Main Street, where a new town hall, firehouse, police station and town-financed post office have sprung. A new $28,000 carillon-mimicking clock in a new park downtown chimes every 15 minutes and plays hymns on the hour. The city is building and furnishing a supermarket for someone to lease. Residents pay no property taxes or sewer fees. They pay $3 to $5 a month for water. 
 "We have free garbage pickup," said Michael Tutor, manager of the Blue & White restaurant on Highway 61, along the town's eastern edge. "They come to the back of your house and get your garbage can and dump it and put it back." 
 Three streets have new squirrel crossing signs. "They cost $35," said Mayor Billy E. Williams, at the wheel of his city-issued white Buick with leather seats. "It's bad to have a squirrel run over." 
The Town of Tunica, in the otherwise impoverished Mississippi Delta, is the seat of Tunica County and eight miles south of the former cotton fields that have bloomed into the nation's third-largest gambling center, after Las Vegas and Atlantic City. The sluggish economy has driven most states and the federal government into deficits. But once-dilapidated Tunica, which had been best known for slave descendants' squalid shacks along an open sewer just two blocks from Main Street called Sugar Ditch, has money to burn. 
This year the town, which had a population of 1,132 in 2000, expects to collect $3.5 million in taxes from the nine casinos, just under half of its $7.3 million budget. Ten years ago, its budget was $830,000.
With so much money, this cotton-coated county of 9,227, about 40 miles south of Memphis, is building an airport big enough for Boeing 747's to haul in more gamblers and tourists. Next month, in one of many events marking the decade since the first casino opened, Mayor Williams is bringing Oliver North to speak at the unveiling of a $400,000 veterans memorial. Tunica will pay him $20,000.
Still, for all its gains, Tunica County remains poor. Per capita income rose from $8,370 in 1990 to $11,978 in 2000, still below the state's median of $15,853. The 1990 census deemed half of all families poor. Two years ago the figure was 28 percent. But that was still far more than double the national rate. 
Many of the poor have moved from welfare to casino jobs, but many, working or not, still live in shacks. Housing for low-income workers is scarce, and casino jobs are erratic, surging in holiday periods and shrinking in slow periods. In the soft economy, gambling has slowed, so casino revenues have ebbed. 
"But the casinos aren't going anywhere," Mayor Williams said. "I don't worry about it." This year, the town parked $2.4 million in a rainy-day fund. 
On Magnolia Street, just off Main Street, is Hosia Nickson's Package Store, with a small restaurant attached. People hang out on the benches outside. It is a stone's throw from Sugar Ditch, where apartments for the elderly poor have been built where the old shacks once stood. 
"All that stuff is gone," said Robert Leonard, 46, a custodian at the Tunica Institute of Learning, a largely white school. "I'm glad it's gone. Older people up in age, like their 60's, they've got jobs, jobs nobody thought a black person would get." 
Still, said another man, "there's a whole lot left to be done. They put in that million-dollar clock, and people are suffering in this town."
A woman outside the store added: "People got AIDS and no place to go. We need a hospital." She said she works the floor at the Horseshoe Casino for $6.68 an hour. "That's what I make, and I've been there a year," she said. "I have seven kids."
The statistics for the county show some stunning changes. Unemployment has dropped to less than 4 percent from 17 percent in 1990. Households receiving welfare have dropped to 2 percent from 20 percent. The 2000 census found that homes without toilets had dropped to less than 2 percent from 23 percent in 1990, and those without telephones to 11 percent from 30 percent. 
With wages instead of welfare, said Sister Angela Susalla, who works at a Catholic Social Services office in town, "people had some kind of income and could become homeowners." Typically, she said, a mother with one child got a $97 monthly welfare check here five years ago. A woman working 40 hours a week for $7 an hour at a casino earns $1,100. But lately, rents and house prices have risen with incomes, squeezing low-wage workers. 
To the nuns at the office, the notion of building an economy on gambling was once troubling. "It would not have been my choice of what came in," Sister Gus Griffin said. But the jobs and paychecks have stifled those apprehensions. "It's been so helpful that I see no problem."
Addictive gambling seems not to have struck Tunica's casino workers the way it has the casinos' out-of-town customers. "Some people lost a bunch when the casinos first came in," Sister Gus said, "but they learned very fast." 
The proliferation of paychecks has unsettled some merchants in unexpected ways. 
"Our business was built on government checks," said Mayor Williams, who owns a furniture store on Main Street. Welfare recipients borrowed to buy furniture, and Mr. Williams profited from the financing. But with the sharp decline in welfare recipients, he said: "A lot can pay cash for stuff. That has hurt us."
The casino jobs affect merchants in another way. During high seasons, said Linda Tutor, Michael's wife and the owner of the Blue & White, there are more jobs than workers. Her pool of workers is limited, she said, to "people who wouldn't pass a drug test at a casino and some who don't like the atmosphere of casinos."
Charlie Williams, a former Republican state legislator and the county's director of programs and projects, said the county was trying to bring in better-paying jobs. Most casino jobs pay less than $10 an hour, and few higher-paying jobs have been created. 
Education is the key, said Mr. Williams (who is not related to the mayor). Despite one of the state's highest levels of school spending, he said, "we still have a low educational level." The 2000 census found that 40 percent of adults over 25 lacked high school diplomas. "Your better jobs don't come until you have an educated work force," he said. 
While the rolls of people receiving welfare checks have plunged, the poor get other forms of aid. This month, the Main Street office of the federal Women's, Infants and Children program distributed food boxes to 587 pregnant women and women with children up to 5 years old. The number of women served is "basically the same" as it was before the casinos opened, Carolyn Tunsill, the manager of the office, said.
Some people stay poor because they do not qualify for casino jobs. To work for one, they must get a badge from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. To get a badge, they must pay $75, and three years must have elapsed since their last conviction for a felony or a drug misdemeanor. "There are quite a few who have convictions for drug misdemeanors or simple assaults," Jerry King, director of the commission's Tunica branch, said.
Other crimes new to the county have surged around the casinos. "We have credit card scams, slot machine scams, jackpot scams," Mr. King said. There has been a carjacking in a parking lot and a murder in a casino elevator. 
Not much of the crime has spread to the town, however. With nine police officers and a chief, Tunica has about one officer for every 100 residents.
The city has the luxury of dispatching a backup officer to the highway when another officer pulls a car over. Michael Nichols, a police officer having lunch at the Blue & White, said, "We get new cars whenever we need them." 
The spending goes on. All the streets have been paved. Every intersection has reflective blue street signs with recessed white letters.
"We never did have street signs," said Mr. Leonard, the school custodian. "You'd have to know them by knowledge."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the economic impact of casinos on Tunica, Miss., misstated the given name of Tunica's mayor. He is Bobby E. Williams, not Billy. The article also misstated the capacity of a planned airport. While it could accommodate Boeing 747's, it is being designed to handle 727's.

HEADLINE: HOME FRONT; 
Work at Last: Marketing Themselves

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
BEING unemployed is obviously a problem - but did you ever stop to ponder what kind of a problem? A financial problem, of course. An emotional problem, often. A political problem, maybe (or should be, for the politicans).
 In a weird kind of way, it's also a marketing problem - and if you are unemployed, you're the product that needs to be sold. Especially now. 
 Almost 250,000 people in New York City are looking for work right now, according to the state's Labor Department, about 60,000 more than two years ago. Meanwhile, companies have cut more than 123,000 positions. 
 How do you stand out from the herd - and get your resume in front of the handful of peole who might actually have jobs to give you?
 You advertise. That, at least, is the brain wave that swept over three unemployed marketers this summer, and prompted then to dream up WeWantWork. It's a marketing campaign for themselves and 40 other jobless New Yorkers.
 "It's difficult for employers to fidn the right candidate because there are so many out there," said Marc Seago, 33, a marketing manager who has been out of work for a year. "The more people we reach, the more likely it is that our resumes will get in front of the right eyes."
 An ad on prime-time television was obviously out of the question - and probably wouldn't have worked, anyway. The trio instead turned to "in your face guerrilla marketing, which emphasizes direct contact with whoever you're trying to reach," said Lisa Rosevear, 35, an unemployed publicist. 
 That means dressing in eye-catching costumes - business suits under placards saying "We Want Work' - and handing out fliers on street corners. Sometimes the group has tooled around in an old Checker cab blasting work-related music ("Carwash," say, or the Seven Dwarfs' theme song), hopping out to distribute fliers and then tearing off again.
 The fliers direct potential employers to WeWantWork.com, where all 43 members' resumes are posted. Referring other people to the site qualifies you for discount coupons at restaurants.
 The organizers try for an element of surprise, so to find out what the group's attention-grabber will be in their fourth foray into the streets to hand out fliers, you'll probably have to be in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning. A good spot would be near the ferry slip at West 38th Street.
 "People just seem much happier when they commute by water," said Emily Malatesta, 35, who most recently worked in marketing for the National Basketball Association.
 Guerrilla marketing in recent years has been associated with a certain powerful breath mint and with now-defunct Internet enterprises, but WeWantWork is not made up of "dot-com brats," Miss Rosevear said. The group includes people with experience in finance, human resources, sales, accounting, information technology and, obviously, marketing.
 While some, like Mr. Seago, had Internet experience, others, like Ms. Malatesta, are by no means Web-heads. What she is obviously very good at is organizing and at rounding up "supporters" to donate services like printing.
 Indeed, the group has run this effort like a real marketing campaign, down to the Power-Point presentations and Excel spread sheets. And the organizers are listing WeWantWork on their resumes, to show that they're doing more than watching TV and eating Doritos during their unemployed stints. Organizing the group is also giving them emotional satisfaction, the trio said. The group's members enjoy doing something active, rather than passively waiting for the phone to ring.
 "It takes a certain kind of personality to go out on the street," Mr. Seago said. "People sometimes say, 'You're that desperate?' We're not desperate, we're motivated."
 So far, the reaction from New Yorkers has been warm, and the campaign, which started Sept. 24, has produced interviews, if no actual jobs - yet. "Big companies don't usually hire that quickly," Ms. Malatesta said. "But we have two people who are very, very close."
 "Three," Miss Rosevear chinned in. "Keep you fingers crossed for me."
 The group has been hearing from people in cities like Washington and Los Angeles who want to set up similar efforts.
 "We tell them, 'Here's the concept, here's the Web site, go do it!' " Mr. Seago said. "We hope it inspires you."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Under the Lens: Southeast Asia Confronts Its Demons

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER

 BODY:
IT was quickly dubbed the second front in the war on terrorism. In the months following the Sept. 11 attacks, a series of arrests in Singapore and Malaysia and the Philippines seemed to imply that Al Qaeda had slipped down-continent and established itself from Bangkok to Manila and across the Indonesian archipelago.
 It made some sense. The region has the largest Muslim population in the world, and small Islamic militant groups with separatist aims - like Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah - were already in Southeast Asia long before Al Qaeda was routed from Afghanistan. Intelligence officials knew some groups had trained in Afghanistan or fought there alongside their Arab counterparts against the Soviet Union. Loose immigration rules in many parts of the region made movement easy, and the Asian financial crisis continued to sap vigor from local economies. 
 But finding direct ties to Al Qaeda - or even to a single, discernible agenda - among the many groups and splinter groups has proved remarkably difficult, even when investigations are stirred by deadly bombings like those in Indonesia and the Philippines last week. The Bali bombing in particular, both American and Indoesian officials said, surely had a helping hand from Al Qaeda, although the dots - and there are many dots - are still being connected.
 A third bombing, in Manila on Friday, may well prove to have Al Qaeda fingerprints as well. But it is also possible that it will have purely local roots, born of a hodgepodge of local ethnic, political and economic tensions that have little to do with a global holy war.

GRAPHIC: Photos: THAILAND (green) (symbols indicat primary groups)The predominantly buddhist nation has enjoyed a reputation as a safe haven from the Muslim Militant movements that vax its neighbors to the south. Still, small but persistent separatist organizations operate in the largely Muslim provinces along Thailand's southern border with Malaysia though the extent to which these movements are in contact with other Sutheast Asian groups - or with Al Qaeda operatives in the Middle East - is unclear. After the bombings in Bali a week ago, Thai officials expressed fears that their own tourist resorts could be targeted, and the group Jemaah Islamiyah, long considered a terrorist organization by the West, includes southern Thailand in its proposed Islamic state.; "I have ordered all agencies to put their security measures on full alert."

The country has arrested dozens of members of Jemaah Islamiyah since last year, including several in Kuala Lumpur last week as part of the investigation of the bombings in Bali; Malaysia is also the base of the Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia (KMM), which favors the overthrow of the government and the creation of an Islamic state comprising Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philipines.

It is here at our doorstep." Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (Associated Press) PHILIPPINES (orange, green)Local police tied last week's explosion in the southern Philipines to the country's primary terrorist group, Abu Sayyaf, which the United States has linked to Al Qaeda. The group first gained notice in the southern Philippines in the early 1990's with demands for an Islamic state, eventually acquiring worldwide notoriety with a series of kidnappings and beheadings. Earlier this month, an American soldier was killed by a bomb - one week after an Abu Sayyaf leader called on Muslims in the Philippines to attack enemies of Islam. Some intelligence experts have suggested that Jemaah Islamiyah is present in the Philippines as well.; "You must harden the targets. Do not be a soft target." President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (Retuers) INDONESIA (green, red)Before the Bali bombing, Indonesia's reluctance to acknowledge terrorism in its midst frustrated the West.

Indonesian-born Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi (top right) has been tied to several bomb plots int he Philippines as part of the group Jamaah Islamiyah. He is now in prison. And Indonesian officials investigating the Bali bombing ordered Jamaah Islamiyah's leader, Abu Bakar Bashir (bottom right), to appear for questioning.

HEADLINE: Deterring the Undeterrable 

BYLINE:  By Jack F. Matlock Jr.; Jack F. Matlock Jr., the United States ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991, is the author of "Autopsy on an Empire: The American Ambassador's Account of the Collapse of the Soviet Union."

 THE THREATENING STORM
The Case for Invading Iraq.
By Kenneth M. Pollack.
494 pp. New York:
Random House. $25.95.
 THIS book makes the best case possible for an invasion of Iraq. Few Americans are as qualified as Kenneth M. Pollack to present this argument. He worked in the Central Intelligence Agency analyzing military developments in the Persian Gulf area for seven years, including the period of the gulf war. During the Clinton administration he served as director for gulf affairs with the National Security Council. His immersion over more than a decade in the vast sea of information available to the United States government has enabled him to offer a comprehensive analysis of United States-Iraqi relations, conditions in Iraq, the nature of Saddam Hussein's rule and his aggressive goals.
In "The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq," Pollack clarifies many matters that seem confusing or contradictory to the casual observer. He gives a chilling portrayal of conditions within Iraq and a perceptive analysis of the attitude of other governments in the region: they all fear and hate Saddam Hussein and would welcome his overthrow, but are no longer willing to support half measures that do not lead to his prompt removal from power. In fact, many have important elements in their countries who profit from trade that violates the United Nations sanctions imposed to prevent Saddam Hussein from acquiring or retaining weapons of mass destruction.
After setting the stage with his description of the catastrophic damage Saddam Hussein's tyranny has inflicted on Iraq, Pollack offers his arguments in favor of invasion. He examines each of the choices he believes the United States has, including "containment" (sanctions, United Nations weapons inspectors and enforcement of no-flight zones), "deterrence" (credible threats of retaliation for aggressive acts) and "regime change" (removal of Saddam Hussein by force). 
Containment, he argues, is eroding rapidly, has not eliminated Iraq's nuclear weapons program or weakened Saddam Hussein's grip on the country, and cannot be sustained much longer. In fact, Saddam Hussein has managed to manipulate the sanctions to his benefit by rewarding supporters inside Iraq with scarce goods and bribing countries outside, like France, with lucrative oil contracts. Pollack sees no prospect that a program of "smart sanctions," directed at military-related items alone, would be more effective or sustainable.
Deterrence, in Pollack's view, will not work because Saddam Hussein, a risk taker with unbroken aspirations for weapons of mass destruction and regional hegemony, will not be deterred. He contrasts Saddam Hussein's reckless drive for power with what he calls the "conservatism" of Soviet leaders to argue that the success of deterrence during the cold war is not a useful precedent for dealing with Iraq.
Though he sees no realistic alternative to removing Saddam Hussein, he concedes that this will not be easy. Covert action, tried repeatedly in the past, has not worked and is unlikely to succeed in the future. The idea that opposition groups could lead an invasion and prevail with the support of American air strikes and some special forces, as happened in Afghanistan, is an illusion, he believes. No neighboring states would back such an effort and it would probably fail even if they did. The only sure course is a blitzkrieg by American ground troops.
Even though Pollack considers an invasion of Iraq the least risky of the options available to the United States, he would advise it only if certain conditions are met. It must involve overwhelming force, 200,000 to 300,000 troops at least. The invasion must have the support of key governments in the area (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and some states of the Gulf Cooperation Council), some support from European allies and ideally the express authority of the United Nations Security Council. The United States must make sure that there is no large-scale violence between Palestinians and Israelis when it invades. Additionally, Washington must be committed to the postwar reconstruction of Iraq and the establishment of a stable democracy, a task that will require a large occupation force for an extended period as well as a lot of money. 
Pollack offers a compelling argument that the United States must meet all these conditions if an invasion is to succeed without creating equal or greater dangers. He has set the bar very high, and it is doubtful that any United States administration could clear it. The idea that Congress would be willing to finance a long occupation of Iraq and appropriate billions of dollars for Iraq's reconstruction at a time of recession and rising budget deficits seems irresponsibly optimistic. So is the idea that the United States and its allies would be capable of creating a prosperous, free, democratic nation out of Iraq's fractured and critically injured society. 
As I was reading Pollack's dismissal of deterrence as a viable strategy, I could not help reflecting that in 1947 a stronger case than his could have been made that the least risky course for dealing with Stalin following World War II would have been to invade the Soviet Union and depose the tyrant before he could acquire nuclear weapons. Yet deterrence worked, even though the danger to the United States from a nuclear-armed Soviet Union was incomparably greater than the one that could be posed by a nuclear-armed Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein may be more inclined to risk taking than the Soviet leaders were, but his means for making mischief in the world are much more limited. His passion is to stay in power and, if possible, to dominate the region. If he had nuclear weapons, he would step up blackmail attempts against his neighbors. But his bluff could be called, since he would avoid using nuclear weapons or supplying them to terrorists unless he was attacked directly and was convinced that his end was imminent. Soviet leaders before Gorbachev also would probably have used nuclear weapons if they had faced military defeat. This is one of several reasons the United States avoided making "regime change" an avowed element of cold war deterrence. 
In sum, Pollack is not convincing when he argues that deterrence (or deterrence plus some vigorously enforced containment measures) is a more risky course in the long run than invasion. An invasion would be trumpeted by many in the Islamic world as an attack on Islam. Never mind that this would be a lie; it would be widely believed and might well increase the number of misguided youths placing themselves at the disposal of Al Qaeda or other instruments of suicidal terrorism. If many Muslims concluded that the attack was against Islam, Arab governments supporting the United States could be threatened by domestic violence.
Muslim outrage could also make it much more difficult to keep the nuclear materials now in Pakistan out of terrorist hands. The Pakistani public has been encouraged to consider its nuclear weapons "Islamic bombs." President Pervez Musharraf seems to be making a serious effort to bring Islamic fanatics under control, but most likely their sympathizers still infest his government. Even a successful invasion of Iraq could have the perverse effect of increasing the threat we had tried to eliminate. While Saddam Hussein can, with determined effort, be deterred, Osama bin Laden and his like cannot.
Most of Pollack's analysis is thoughtful and balanced, particularly that dealing with the Arab world. Therefore, it is unfortunate that in his final chapter Pollack damages his argument by rhetorical excess. He goes so far as to equate policies of containment and deterrence with the appeasement of Hitler in 1938. In fact, containment and deterrence are opposites of appeasement. Such misplaced comparisons smack of hysteria, and damage Pollack's credibility. 
"The Threatening Storm" is a timely and important contribution to the current debate. It deserves a wide readership, if only (but not only) because it demolishes certain myths that some proponents of invasion have cultivated. If the Bush administration proceeds to mount an invasion to remove Saddam Hussein without meeting all of the conditions Pollack specifies, only an improbable streak of luck will stave off a more serious terrorist threat to American lives and property. And even if Pollack's conditions are met, the risks of invasion may be greater than he believes.

Lowering Mortgage Barriers

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
RECENT changes in eligibility requirements for mortgage programs now being offered in several New York counties will make a greater number of prospective homeowners -- with incomes that can go as high as $150,810 -- eligible for low-interest-rate low-down-payment mortgages.
 The changes have occurred under separate initiatives offered by Fannie Mae, the government-created, shareholder-owned corporation that buys residential mortgages on the secondary market, and the State of New York Mortgage Agency, known as Sonyma, which provides mortgage loan programs aimed at low- and moderate-income borrowers. As a result, the maximum amount prospective homeowners can earn under Fannie Mae guidelines -- or spend for a home under Sonyma rules -- has been increased in a number of counties. 
 The initiatives will make available millions of dollars in low-interest-rate, low-down-payment mortgages to families that otherwise would be ineligible for them. 
"One of the biggest complaints I hear from constituents is about the cost of housing," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat.
Mr. Schumer said that since people in the New York City area pay so much for rental housing, they often have difficulty saving the down payment for a house. And since two-income families often earn too much money to qualify for low-down-payment mortgages available to low- and moderate-income families, a significant number of New Yorkers have more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage, but not enough to save for the down payment for a conventional mortgage.
To help address that problem, Senator Schumer recently asked Fannie Mae to adjust its eligibility requirements for the company's low-interest rate, low-down-payment Community Lending programs. "I told Fannie Mae they should be reaching out to the suburbs," Mr. Schumer said. 
Naomi Bayer, director of Fannie Mae's New York Partnership Office in Manhattan, said that in response to Mr. Schumer's request, the company last month increased the income limits for eligibility for a number of Fannie Mae's "flexible lending" programs in Westchester, Rockland, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Such programs, Ms. Bayer said, allow buyers to obtain mortgages with little or no down payment, and, in some cases, make qualifying for such mortgages easier. (While Fannie Mae does not provide mortgages directly to consumers, it does purchase mortgages made by approved lenders. To facilitate that, the company has created a number of different mortgage products -- each with its own underwriting requirements -- that can be offered by affiliated lenders.)
Under standard Fannie Mae guidelines, Ms. Bayer said, to be eligible for a Community Lending mortgage product, the buyer could not earn more than 100 percent of the median income for the area where the property is located. So, for example, a person buying a home in Nassau or Suffolk Counties could not earn more than $83,000, the median income in those areas, and still qualify for one of Fannie Mae's Community Lending loans.
Under the new guidelines, borrowers can earn up to 165 percent of the median income and still be eligible for the Community Lending loans. This means that borrowers in Nassau and Suffolk can now earn $136,950; in Rockland borrowers can earn up to $145,330; and borrowers in Westchester can earn as much as $150,810.
Ms. Bayer said that while prospective purchasers with good incomes might be able to afford the financing for a home, the high cost of housing prevents many from amassing a down payment.
"Many families who are interested in purchasing a home still have the perception that they need a 20 percent down payment," Ms. Bayer said. "But we're making a commitment to provide at least $100 million over the next two years to make low- and no-down-payment mortgages available to moderate-income borrowers."
In addition, she said, the Community Lending program allows lenders to use more relaxed criteria in determining a borrower's eligibility for a loan. For example, Ms. Bayer said, under traditional mortgage guidelines, a borrower's ability to qualify for a loan is determined, in part, by calculating both the "back end" and "front end" ratios of the borrower's expenses to income.
Thus, she said, a lender would first look at the proportion of a prospective borrower's income used for housing expenses -- that is, principal, interest, insurance and taxes -- to calculate a "front end" ratio. Then the lender would determine the proportion of the income needed to make monthly payments on all of the borrower's debt -- including credit cards, car loans and other recurring debt -- to calculate the "back end" ratio. Traditionally, Ms. Bayer said, borrowers would not qualify for a loan if either their front-end ratio exceeded 28 percent or their back-end ratio was over 36 percent. 
With Fannie Mae's Community Lending mortgages, however, the lender is permitted to look only at the back-end ratio -- that is, the proportion of the borrower's income needed for all debt. Moreover, she said, the allowable ratio can range from 41 to 45 percent, depending, in part, on the borrower's credit history. 
"That means that a family can spend nearly half of its income on total debt," Ms. Bayer said.
Wesley Wainwright, senior vice president of J. P. Morgan Chase, a lender that participates in Fannie Mae's Community Lending program, said the new guidelines for counties near New York City will enable more moderate-income families to qualify for mortgages.
"The average-priced house in Nassau County right now is in the $300,000 range," he said. Under the new rules, instead of having to make a down payment of $60,000 for such a house, a family with an annual income of as much as $136,950 could qualify for a loan with a down payment of $15,000 or even less.
And while Fannie Mae's changes will make low-down payment loans available to higher-income borrowers than had been previously permitted, a change this year in regulations by the State of New York Mortgage Agency has made it possible for New Yorkers to buy more expensive houses while still qualifying for so-called "affordable" mortgages.
Sally Crockett, a spokeswoman for Sonyma, said that in June the agency increased the maximum allowable purchase price for homes in New York City and in a number of counties to the north, including Westchester and Rockland. 
Before the change, Ms. Crockett said, the most that a Sonyma borrower could pay for an existing single-family home in New York City and Westchester and Rockland Counties was $180,200. Now, purchase prices in those areas can be as high as $239,500. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the maximum purchase price for Sonyma mortgages is $257,600. And in federally designated target areas -- including many in the New York City area -- the maximum purchase price for Sonyma mortgages is now $292,800 for New York City, Rockland and Westchester and $314,800 for Nassau and Suffolk.
Borrowers who qualify for a Sonyma mortgage, Ms. Crockett said, can currently obtain loans with 3 percent down payments at an interest rate as low as 5.5 percent with a one-time fee of 1.75 points. (A point is 1 percent of the loan amount.)
Information about Sonyma loans is available on the agency's Web site at www.nyhomes.org. Fannie Mae's site is at www.homepath.com.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
With Torricelli Pushed Aside, Corzine Steps Up to the Plate

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
People who notice these things have been seeing him three or four times a day lately as they scan the nightly news reports on television: Jon Corzine standing behind Frank Lautenberg on the State House steps; Jon Corzine smiling behind Representative Rush Holt in Princeton. Jon Corzine shaking hands in Bergen County with Anne Sumers, the Democratic candidate for Congress there.
 From nonentity and the butt of moneybags jokes two years ago, when he spent $60 million of his own money to win his Senate seat, Senator Corzine has remade himself into Mr. Indispensable for state Democrats this election season. He has campaigned tirelessly for other candidates, brokered back-office deals with the best of the old wheeler-dealers, contributed millions from his Wall Street fortune to candidates and filled a vacuum in the New Jersey Democratic politics left by Senator Robert G. Torricelli's forced withdrawal from the race and by James McGreevey's shrinking governorship under the weight of financial and other crises. 
 "In Washington, he has become a player as the Democratic spokesman on the financial crises and the Enrons of the world," said Harold Hodes, the Trenton lobbyist and former Clinton state campaign director. "He is in line to head up the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is an unusual appointment for a first-term senator. He played an important role in the selection of Lautenberg, and he not only has the financial wherewithal but the energy to get out and help all these candidates here at home."
Take last Tuesday: Mr. Corzine started the day with Representative Rush Holt, greeting commuters at the Princeton Junction train station. Then he and Mr. Holt gave their non-lawyerly views on constitutional issues and foreign policy to a class of seniors at the West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North.
After he and Mr. Holt called for more money for breast cancer research at the Princeton YWCA, the senator headed to Bridgewater to campaign at a retirement center with Tim Carden, who is trying to unseat Representative Michael Ferguson in the 7th District. Then it was off to Trenton, to stand with Mr. Lautenberg and the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey.
And he ended the day in New York city, attending a fund-raising event for Mr. Lautenberg.
A couple of thoughts: these are all jobs that Mr. Torricelli used to perform, so in a sense, Mr. Corzine is only stepping up to the role of senior senator that people would expect him to perform. 
But second -- and unlike so many pols -- Mr. Corzine actually seems to be enjoying himself. It was one of the open secrets of his 2000 election campaign that Mr. Corzine was a better campaigner than people who could not see beyond his money gave him credit for. Apparently he has not lost that zest for the campaign trail, and he also seems to have raised his game a bit.
"It's been very interesting to see," said Jeffrey Garcia, Dr. Sumers's campaign director in the 5th District race, who said that no other politician had been as active on her behalf since her nomination. "He's very different from the way people would imagine. There's none of the heavy-handed advice and that sort of thing."
Mr. Garcia later added: "I've been in campaigns all around the country, and he is unlike any other United States senator I've ever met. That's why he's the most popular man in New Jersey."
In a sense, Mr. Corzine appears to be extending the role that brought him to the top of Goldman-Sachs when he was co-chairman of the big banking house. Mr. Corzine, the Midwestern farm boy, was known as a conciliator and honest broker in the Wall Street jungle, and he appears to be doing the same thing here. 
Two years ago, state Republicans were in the unusual position of accusing a rich man of throwing his money around for his own political aims. Now the fortune that helped him win his seat is a weapon in the causes Mr. Corzine belives in.
He has five political action committees operating out of an office in Newark, and according to the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Corzine has contributed nearly $1 million from his own pocket in the current campaign cycle to Senate races as well as made smaller contributions to dozens of groups, including $5,000 each to the Progressive Majority's action committee, Emily's List, the group that supports candidates who back abortion rights, and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.
"One of the things that I tried to say in my campaign is that I believe in the Democratic ideals," Senator Corzine said in an interview. "I want to be putting my shoulder into protecting the Democratic majority in the Senate and, hopefully, helping candidates who are close to winning their seats in the House."
Mr. Corzine said he wanted to sharpen campaign skills that he will need as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, but also to bring attention where attention is due.
"It's pretty amazing, really, the effort that a lot of unsung heroes are making to make our communities better," the senator said. "And if I can give them a helping hand, or shine a light on their efforts, or give them a sense that their efforts are being recognized, that's what I'll do."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Beneath White House Optimism, Unease Lurks

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LIKE most Bush administration aides, R. Glenn Hubbard eagerly lists reasons to be optimistic about the economy. Incomes are rising, and consumer spending should follow, he says. The housing market is expected to avoid sharp price declines, thanks in part to low interest rates. The Federal Reserve, keenly aware of Japan's problems, will act forcefully if deflation threatens. 
 But Mr. Hubbard, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, also allows that one part of the economy makes him nervous: the executive suite. After two years of sharp cutbacks in their investment in new factories and equipment, many corporate executives remain reticent to raise spending again. 
 Some managers think that a war with Iraq may send oil prices spiraling and prompt a long-feared decline in consumer spending. Others wonder whether new accounting scandals are ahead and whether the stock market will have another sell-off.
"What worries me the most is the real entrails of an investment recovery," Mr. Hubbard said, sitting in his office across the street from the White House. "When I talk to businesspeople, I don't get the same sense of optimism" that he has.
"I suspect a lot of this has to do with uncertainties," he added.
Few other administration officials have expressed economic concerns lately. Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, predicted that the stock market would soon hit a record high. Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, released a memo this month with this subject line: "The Pessimists Are Ignoring Important Economic Vital Signs."
This cheerleading is hardly unusual. Though they enjoyed more respect than Mr. Bush's money men do, the Clinton administration's economic officials did nothing to prevent the 1990's bubble. The easy money created by that bubble led to billions of dollars of unnecessary investment and to executives' current reluctance to begin new projects -- a point that Mr. Hubbard, a Columbia University economist who served in the Treasury Department under Mr. Bush's father, and his colleagues like to emphasize.
"We grew so fast in the 90's," he said, "because, we know with the benefit of hindsight, we were making too much investment."
Business investment -- which includes spending on factories, office buildings, machines and computer software -- makes up only about 10 percent of the American economy. Consumer spending, by contrast, represents roughly 70 percent, and the government is responsible for about 20 percent.
But the economy cannot grow at a healthy pace without increases in business investment, also known as capital spending. The spending leads to new jobs, which creates consumer spending, and ultimately to an economy that can produce more income and profits for the same amount of work.
For now, many executives remain among the pessimists that Mr. Evans mentioned in his memo. They are concerned about rising health care costs, a widespread inability to raise prices and uncertainties in the Middle East and on Wall Street. In fact, while changes in consumer confidence receive more attention, executive confidence has been the missing ingredient for a solid recovery.
 TO spread the administration's optimism and get a better sense of corporate America's gloom, Mr. Hubbard said he has been traveling around the country, talking to managers. Beyond jawboning, however, the White House has no public plan for stimulating economic growth.
Over the summer, Mr. Bush began to talk about a new round of tax cuts, but he has largely stopped. Democrats in the Senate have proposed extending unemployment benefits to roughly the same length as in the 1990-91 recession, but Republicans are effectively ignoring the effort. (Mr. Hubbard offered a rare argument against extended benefits, saying that they gave workers an incentive not to look for a job and could lead to corporate tax increases.)
Instead, he and other aides expect consumer spending to remain strong, eventually convincing executives that the downturn has ended; they will then start building new factories and ordering more computers.
If Mr. Hubbard is right, the decision to avoid a new stimulus package, and add to the budget deficit, will look good. But if his fears prove more prescient than his hopes, a new debate about unemployment benefits and tax cuts is likely to occupy Washington before year-end.
"We are at a very challenging time in the recovery," Mr. Hubbard said. "A lot of it is just watching and waiting."

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: MANCHESTER; 
Rock and Night Life Revive a Mill Town

BYLINE:  By JAMES COLLARD 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, England 

 BODY:
WHAT you have to remember," Tony Wilson declared, "is just how bad things were here a few years back. It was as if the world was saying, O.K., you were the center of the universe during the Industrial Revolution, you made it all happen, and now thanks very much, you can go down the pan." 
 Mr. Wilson's sweeping gestures and ready charm are familiar to anyone who saw Steve Coogan portray him in the lead role of "24 Hour Party People," a recent movie that told the unlikely story of this Manchester-based television journalist who was a founder of Factory Records and became a postpunk impresario, encouraging bands like New Order and the Happy Mondays and helping invent Britain's rave scene. 
 By "here," Mr. Wilson means Manchester and Salford, twin cities that during the 19th-century reign of King Cotton led the world in technological and social change, but until recently seemed doomed to decline. 
Mr. Wilson was at the opening party of Aak, a furniture boutique on a boat moored at the old docks at Salford Quays, close by two spectacular new buildings: Daniel Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North and an arts center called the Lowry. Confusingly, Salford has two Lowrys, the other being a stylish new hotel. Both take their name from Salford's best-known artist, L. S. Lowry (1887-1976), who recorded the city's early 20th-century life on bleak canvases in which matchsticklike figures scurry between grim homes and what William Blake called "these dark Satanic mills," without a boutique hotel in sight. 
By 1976, when "24 Hour Party People" begins, the textile and other industries were on the way out, leaving a landscape of poor public housing, failing infrastructure and rising crime. Today Manchester is projecting itself imaginatively into the future. The city seems to have taken the energy inherent in the rock and dance culture celebrated in "24 Hour Party People" and turned it into something broader, more substantial: innovative architecture, design-driven urban renewal and a thriving arts community. 
In a country that for many years has had only a single capital of money, power and that elusive quality, cool -- namely London -- there is now a second city of hip, Manchester. 
It can be seen in the worldwide glamour of the Manchester United soccer star David Beckham, married to a former Spice Girl; in the recent arrival of the upscale London department store Selfridge's, soon to be joined by its rival Harvey Nichols; and in the success of the locally produced TV drama "Queer as Folk," remade for American cable audiences by Showtime.
Even the London-based press has acknowledged Manchester's revival in features with headlines parodying an old adage, "It's grim up north." "It's Cool up North," declared The Times of London. "It's Glam up North," The Observer chimed in. 
How did this dreary city reinvent itself as the northern Barcelona? There's probably no single answer. Certainly Manchester has made a spirited response to adversity, using the devastation caused by an Irish Republican Army bomb in 1996 as an opportunity to rebuild part of the old center. But much of what could be called rebranding began the same way that many individuals have found to escape poverty: through pop music and sports. The Manchester United team has become an international brand, its star players, including Beckham, who captained England's World Cup team, gracing billboards from Beijing to Bangkok.
When Manchester served as host of the Commonwealth Games last summer, the city used the occasion to spruce itself up. The games captured a wide public following in a summer that also featured national euphoria over the Queen's Jubilee and England's strong World Cup run. 
Union Jacks and the English flag of St. George flew from car antennas and were displayed everywhere from pubs to Chinese restaurants and Afro-Caribbean festivals. They seemed to express pride in the largely multiracial, multicultural nation that Britain has become, rather than an imperial past. Manchester took care to ensure that when the flags came down, the city had facilities it could use, like a new soccer stadium.
"24 Hour Party People" also showed Mancunians, as the locals are known, investing in the city's future. "The city fathers were very intelligent about their response" to the rave scene, said Mr. Wilson, whose profits from Factory Records were plowed back into building the famous Hacienda nightclub. Other clubs sprouted up, as did a vibrant gay neighborhood in what had been dangerous back streets.
Night life, said a Manchester City Council member, Richard Leese, helped make the inner core of the city attractive again and played a part in the renewal. 
It's arguably the night life that has been drawing Manchester's well-to-do back downtown. That, and the new apartment buildings and Manhattan-style lofts sprouting up in handsome Victorian industrial buildings. "Now the party's over . . ." announces the billboard on the site of the old Hacienda, which has become a residential building. "You can come home."
The area known as Castlefield in the historic center city looks as if some eccentric giant has been collecting bridges, ancient and modern, and plunking them down randomly. One such bridge carried the world's first passenger trains, but for years this was a no-go area. 
Now Castlefield is synonymous with a Manchester aesthetic -- futuristic, urban, confrontational -- that has been projected to audiences far and wide through the medium of locally produced TV dramas like "Cold Feet" and "Queer as Folk." 
Castlefield is home to businesses like Urban Splash, an innovative property developer whose latest project is redeveloping the run-down Cardroom district into a design-driven Millennium Village. Next door to Urban Splash, the gallery Comme Ca sells modernist art to Manchester's new gentry. "Posh and Becks go out for noodles . . . but spent oodles on a doodle," The Sun newspaper declared when the Beckhams (she was formerly known as Posh Spice) bought a Comme Ca artist's work right off the walls of an Asian restaurant.
True, the reality doesn't always match the hype. Manchester can't equal the economic influence and seemingly unstoppable growth of London and its suburbs. As Mr. Wilson said, influential graphic designers like Peter Savile who made Factory record sleeves collectors' items eventually had to move elsewhere to advance their careers. 
But there's also traffic in the other direction. The host at Aak is Maggie Hu, a London transplant who has also lived in Los Angeles and Taiwan. The caterer for the opening party was a well-known restaurateur, Gerry Yeung, originally from Hong Kong. Central figures in the city like Urban Splash's founder, Tom Bloxham, came to Manchester as students, and never left. 
In the lobby of Manchester's Town Hall, the motif is still the glory of the Industrial Revolution. There are depictions of cotton flowers and marble busts of the men who made the city great the last time around: dynamic men, radical even, bewhiskered historic figures, like the politician Richard Cobden. 
Britain doesn't make much any more, and it's interesting to speculate what a lineup of today's local worthies might include: a soccer player, a pop star, an Asian-born trader or two, an architect, some gay entrepreneurs, and last but not least, a bust of a TV anchor with a taste for rock 'n' roll.

HEADLINE: The World: Over There; 
A New Front Opens, but It's Still One War

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HOW many battles can the United States take on at one time?
 Even before North Korea's stunning admission last week that it had been cheating for years on its commitment to freeze its nuclear weapons program, that question was heard all over Washington. 
 For 12 days this month, as administration officials kept the wraps on North Korea's defiant declaration to American diplomats, one subtext of the meetings inside the White House situation room was "whether we are overloading the circuit boards," a participant said.
As they met, American diplomats were trying to cut deals with Russia and France on Iraq, Al Qaeda was emerging from the mist and unknown to the world, the Korean Peninsula had slipped into nuclear relapse. 
Some are tempted to say that the unexpected challenge from Korea demonstrates that the administration's current course -- confronting Iraq while Americans still face the daunting tasks of securing Afghanistan, pursuing terrorists across the globe and stopping them at home -- creates pressures that can lead to deadly mistakes.
"I am concerned about the overload on the intelligence side, human and the technological," Stephen W. Bosworth, a former ambassador to South Korea who is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said last week. "And the problem of a doctrine of pre-emptive defense is that it places a hell of burden on exact intelligence on where the next attack is coming from."
He may prove correct. But to the Bush inner circle, battling on many fronts may not be entirely unwelcome.
Mr. Bush's team sees this moment in history as a rip in time, a chance to re-order the world on American terms. It said as much in the national security strategy published last month, which talked not only of pre-emptive strikes to prevent future attacks, but of a global campaign to "defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants." This strategy finds opportunity even in simultaneous crises.
Even a political opponent like Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser to President Bill Clinton, agrees with at least part of the Bush logic. "The lesson you always learn in these jobs is that the world doesn't deal cards one at a time," he said. But the cards make up a hand that can be played.
Speaking of the twin crises in Iraq and North Korea, he said: "These could play off one another. If you get a strong Security Council resolution on Iraq, it conveys to North Korea that the international community will find a nuclear program unacceptable."
The administration argued last week that nothing in its strategy requires it to use the same tactics in different countries. Saddam Hussein is a unique threat, argued Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, requiring a uniquely aggressive response. Kim Jong Il, North Korea's leader, she suggested, runs a wounded, isolated nation that can be enveloped by troops and unhappy neighbors, and squeezed until its bleeding economy shatters.
History does suggest that moments of maximum stress like this can allow the most creative diplomacy. Remember the missile crisis that unfolded 40 years ago this week, when John F. Kennedy feared simultaneous wars in Cuba and Berlin, but emerged with a horse-trade and eventually with a nuclear test ban treaty. And remember 1945. 
Speaking of the Bush strategy, John Lewis Gaddis, a Yale historian, argues in a forthcoming article in Foreign Policy that "there's been nothing like this in boldness, sweep and vision since Americans took it upon themselves, more than half a century ago, to democratize Germany and Japan, thus setting in motion processes that stopped short of only a few places on earth, one of which was the Muslim Middle East."
Still, even some of Mr. Bush's own aides acknowledge that they have rarely seen the system so stressed.
One of them argued last week that a $365 billion annual Pentagon budget should be sufficient to take on Saddam Hussein's depleted forces and deal with periodic confrontations with Al Qaeda and other military priorties.
The problem, he said, lies in the worlds of intelligence and policy-making -- here he said the government is currently stretched to the limit. 
"We only have satellites in so many places at a time," said one senior official who took part in the recent discussions. "We only have a handful of senior policy makers who can reach out around the globe. And they know that, when you need help from friends and allies, they can't belly up to the bar too often. They tell us, 'If we stick our neck out on this one, we can't on that one.' "
In the North Korean crisis, White House officials said that the 12 days in which they were publicly silent was a period intended to give the national security team time to study its new hand and consult allies.
But in Congress and at the United Nations, critics of Mr. Bush's Iraq policy had other explanations.
How could Mr. Bush convince the United Nations that Iraq must be confronted with military force immediately while North Korea, a confessed nuclear power, should be treated with patient diplomacy? And how do you continue working with the Pakistanis, the Russians and the Chinese, all of whom you believe helped North Korea in its nuclear ambitions in the 1990's?
Some argue that the White House should have seen trouble brewing. "The surprise is that anyone in the Bush administration should be surprised," said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has argued for a tougher stance on North Korea. He said a letter he wrote the president asking about covert nuclear projects there got a brush-off.
The administration goal at this point is not to confront North Korea with a threat of force, as it is doing in Iraq, but to work with Russia, China, Japan and South Korea to send a parallel if less bellicose message to North Korea that it faces a stark choice: Disarmament or a total economic embargo, even by its old friends. "This is the model we should have applied to Iraq," said Representative Ellen Tauscher, a Democrat from California, who voted to support Mr. Bush on Iraq.
But it is unclear whether the allies will sign up, and that means this will inevitably test another part of Mr. Bush's grand strategy. 
The president has said that the Sept. 11 attacks opened the way for new, far more constructive relationships with Russia and China. He is about to find out how constructive those relationships are, because Russia seems poised to prove the most critical player on the Iraq front, even as China plays that role on the North Korea front.
If they help -- and the help will come for a price -- it could build a critical wartime alliance of convenience. Or Russia and China could decide to let the United States stew in its own new strategy of pre-emption and predominance, and deal with its multifront battles on its own. That would truly stress the system.

HEADLINE: The Souffle Doctrine 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Boy Emperor picked up the morning paper and, stunned, dropped his Juicy Juice box with the little straw attached.
 "Oh, man," he wailed. "North Korea's got nukes. Sheriff Musharraf was helping them. Al Qaeda's blowing stuff up again. The Pentagon's speculating that the sniper might really be Qaeda decoy teams trying to distract the law while they plan a bio-blitzkrieg or a dirty bomb attack on the capital. Tenet's broken out in hives about the next 9/11. Powell spends all his time kissing up to the Frenchies. Saddam's ranting about a river of American blood. Jebbie's in a world of hurt. The economy's cratering. At least Karl says our war strategy will open up a can of Election Day whoop on Congressional Democrats. 
 "This is not the way my new doctrine was supposed to work. We are supposed to decide who we pre-empt and when we pre-empt them. The speechwriters called it an Axis of Evil, but it was really just a Spoke of Evil. Condi and Rummy said once we finished off Saddam, nobody would mess with America again. But everything's gotten fuzzier than fuzzy math. Some people are actually talking about my doctrine leading to World War III!!! Karl says that would be bad."
The Boy Emperor was starting to feel bamboozled by his war tutors. He needed a fresh perspective. There was a guy on TV with a round face and deep voice running around Provence, London and Berlin, where he suggested Schroder resign. He was pre-eminent on pre-emption. The Boy summoned him to explain the Bush doctrine.
"Do I know you?" he asked his visitor.
"I am the chairman of your Defense Policy Board," an amused Richard Perle replied. "I am an adviser to Rumsfeld, a friend of Wolfowitz's and a thorn in Powell's medals. Je suis un gourmand, Monsieur le President. I have always dreamed of opening a chain of fast-food souffle shops based on a machine that would automatically separate eggs, beat the yolks and combine them with hot milk and sugar, add the desired flavorings, whip the whites until stiff, fold them into the mixture and bake in individual pots without human intervention. Then conveyor belts would bring the glass-enclosed ovens to the table and patrons would get to see their meals rise. I've never found investors smart enough to realize the dazzling ingenuity of the Perle Souffle Doctrine. Meanwhile, I'm killing time trying to get your foreign policy to rise. I'm known as the Prince of Darkness."
"Why?"
"I persuaded Reagan to ignore the weak-kneed, striped-pants set at the State Department and buy every weapon in sight until the Evil Empire was scared stiffer than a perfectly executed meringue."
"But why are we going after a lunatic in Iraq for planning to make a bomb and not a lunatic in North Korea who already has bombs?" the Boy asked.
"At the end of the day," Perle replied, his voice dripping with patience for his student, "Iraq is an easy kill."
"But if North Korea can deter us by brandishing a nuclear weapon," the Boy pressed, "why can't we deter Saddam by brandishing a nuclear weapon?"
"You must puncture the souffle before it rises," Perle instructed.
"Why are we mad at North Korea for flouting its international agreements when we flout our international agreements?" the Boy wondered. 
"You cannot make sublime crepes suzette without a fire," Perle lectured.
"Didn't you insist that Saddam and Al Qaeda were linked?" the Boy persisted.
"We made that up," Perle shrugged. "You have to be imaginative, as Audrey Hepburn was in 'Sabrina' when she offered to make Bogie a souffle out of saltines and eggs. As the Baron told Sabrina: 'A woman happily in love, she burns the souffle. A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven!' "
"Huh?" the Boy said. "Tony and Colin told me to stop talking about 'regime change' and instead say, 'War is a last resort,' and stop talking about a 'pre-emptive strike' and instead say, 'War is not imminent.' "
"They're sissies," Perle said, his lip curling with an epicene disdain. "You cannot deliver the sashimi unless you use the blade."
The Boy Emperor was more befuddled than ever.
"Get me Condi!" he yelled. "And a peanut butter and jelly sandwich."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: CONGRESS; 
A South Dakota Race Is More Opposites Than Issues

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
Though the candidates do not make a point of disagreeing on most issues, there may be no important House race in the country with two such different opponents.
 William J. Janklow, the Republican, is 63, finishing his 16th year as governor, on top of four as attorney general. He says he is hard of hearing and concedes that patience is a virtue he sometimes lacks. He has never spent time in Washington but insists he would not feel out of place as a House freshman. 
 Stephanie M. Herseth, the Democrat, is 31, making her first run for office. She is boundlessly cheerful and says her experience growing up on the family farm will help her shape the future of South Dakota's farmers and small towns. She knows Washington from 10 years as a student and lawyer there.
This odd matchup, which both parties see as a crucial tossup in the battle to control the House, came about when Representative John Thune, a Republican, gave up his seat to wage a bitter fight to unseat Senator Tim Johnson. State law required that Mr. Janklow quit the governorship after two terms (as he did before, in 1986). A rival for whom he had little use, former Senator Larry Pressler, was seeking the state's only House seat, so Mr. Janklow jumped in and won the nomination. 
Since then the question he has had to field most often is why, after 16 years as a governor, would he seek the obscurity that attends a freshman in the House? 
He explains: "I love policy issues. I love problem solving. I like getting things done. I'm not suggesting I do all those things in Washington, but I could be a player."
Ms. Herseth's route to this race was simpler. The granddaughter of a rare Democratic governor, she said the idea of seeking public office was always in her head when she was growing up. Her father, a former candidate for governor himself, introduced her to some political players who were impressed with her appeal, and Emily's List, the Washington group that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, provided perhaps a third of the $400,000 she needed to run a primary campaign.
Despite having two Democratic senators, Tom Daschle and Mr. Johnson, South Dakota is overwhelmingly Republican at the state level, and the House race would be tough for a Democrat against any Republican.
But Mr. Janklow acknowledges, "People say I fight a lot," and he has made enemies in his own party over the years. Ms. Herseth presents herself as "much more conciliatory," she said in an interview, and in debates she always talks about "building coalitions," implying that Mr. Janklow cannot.
Still, neither campaign spends much time attacking the other. Ms. Herseth said she had no need to, because South Dakotans knew Mr. Janklow's weaknesses already. Mr. Janklow, working to shed the confrontational image, emphasizes his experience and does no more than hint that Ms. Herseth has little to match it.
The gentle tone of the campaign stands in stark contrast to that of the heated Senate race, or to an even more bitter Republican primary for governor, in which one candidate was attacked for holding stock in a company that was accused of misusing the skin from cadavers.
Jim Meader, a professor of political science at Augustana College here, who conducts election polls, said his latest survey showed Ms. Herseth ahead, but the 45-to-41 percent edge was within the survey's four-percentage-point margin of sampling error, leaving it unclear who actually was ahead.
But Dr. Meader said he thought Mr. Janklow was scoring with his emphasis on his experience, and while "she's taking a very high road, at some point the argument for the need for new leadership may not be enough to win the day."
Not only is Ms. Herseth's campaign attack-free, it is, cautiously, nearly policy-free. At the end of a Tuesday night debate here, she said, "I have a vision for South Dakota, and it's a vision for the future, that every generation of South Dakotans, especially our young people, have the economic opportunity to stay here, to return here, and to thrive here."
In an interview, she said she would have voted differently from Mr. Janklow on some issues, like supporting alternative energy, and would put a greater priority on education. 
But except for her support for abortion rights and his opposition, there are hardly any clear-cut policy divisions.
Not that Mr. Janklow avoids blunt talk. He rails at Washington for ignoring longstanding problems like money for special education. He wants to fix the "funny books" that Washington keeps. Speaking at a women's luncheon in Aberdeen on Tuesday, he had this to say about the people he hopes to have as his future colleagues: "When someone in Congress makes a promise we ignore it because we know we don't believe them."
In an interview, he said he hoped the voters would send him to the capital.
"If they don't," he said, "I won't feel as bad as the kids that lost the state basketball final, but I'll feel bad."

The rest of the country may not like it much, but for the first time in Brazilian history a presidential election has come down to this: two candidates from Sao Paulo, representing parties that were created in Sao Paulo and that draw their largest support from Sao Paulo, battling to succeed a president who is from Sao Paulo. 
 With a population of 38 million, slightly larger than California's, Sao Paulo is by far Brazil's most populous and prosperous state. But for much of the last century, a theme of Brazilian politics has been how to prevent Sao Paulo from dominating the government as thoroughly as it does the economy. 
 Though Rio de Janeiro is better known outside Brazil, "Sao Paulo is the true center of gravity" of Latin America's largest country, said Fernando Limongi, director of the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Research here. "Even now, there is fear and resentment of Sao Paulo and its tremendous weight, which powerful lobbies from smaller and poorer states are always trying to limit." 
No sooner had Fernando Henrique Cardoso been elected president in 1994, becoming the first Sao Paulo politician in a generation to hold that post, than there was instantly grumbling that Brazil was becoming the "Paulista Republic." Whether the victor in the Oct. 27 runoff is Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party or his rival, Jose Serra of the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party, those complaints are likely to continue. 
As Jose Genoino, the Workers' Party candidate for governor here, put it when he launched his second-round campaign last week, "Sao Paulo is a state and a nation" that no Brazilian can afford to ignore. If Sao Paulo were independent of Brazil, its population and gross domestic product would surpass those of Argentina and Colombia, the most populous countries and biggest economies in South America after Brazil. 
Sao Paulo accounts for more than a third of Brazil's gross domestic product, a situation that in the past has prompted some business leaders here to complain that their state is "a locomotive pulling 26 empty wagons." Coffee, oranges, and soybeans are grown in the prosperous interior; the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is based in the state, as is the leading genetics mapping institute outside the United States. 
But the real engine of the economy is metropolitan Sao Paulo, which in the last 130 years has had "the fastest long-term rate of big-city growth in human experience," said Norman Gall, executive director of the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics here. From 31,000 people in 1870, the city and its suburbs have mushroomed to more than 18 million today, making greater Sao Paulo the third-largest urban area in the world after Tokyo and Mexico City, according to United Nations figures. 
Though it generates more than a quarter of Brazil's tax base, according to a study by the institute, the city gets back less than 10 cents for every dollar it pays, slowing the construction of needed schools, roads and hospitals. 
Like New York, modern Sao Paulo, both the city and the state, has been built largely by immigrants and owes its cosmopolitan character to them. Both Mr. Serra and Mr. da Silva are products of that process, though they represent two very different streams.
A 60-year-old economist, Mr. Serra was a senator and a deputy representing Sao Paulo in Congress before he joined Mr. Cardoso's cabinet. His father emigrated from Italy and ended up owning a small fruit business in Santos, the bustling port that exported most of the coffee that was the source of Sao Paulo's wealth. 
The immigrant flow started with the abolition of slavery in 1888, which required new sources of labor. Paulistas boast that Sao Paulo has more people of Japanese descent than any city outside Japan, more people of Syrian-Lebanese descent than any city outside the Middle East and more people of Italian descent than any city outside Italy. 
Mr. da Silva, in contrast, is part of a vast and more recent internal migration that is the Brazilian equivalent of poor rural blacks moving from Mississippi to Chicago in search of factory jobs. He was born into a family of sharecroppers in the poverty-stricken state of Pernambuco but arrived here as a 7-year-old after his father got a job working on the docks in Santos. 
Like millions of others who came here from northeastern Brazil, Mr. da Silva, known as Lula, has borne the stigma of being a "pau de arara," or parrot percher, so called because many of the migrants made the 2,000-mile journey standing in the backs of trucks. But even with just a fifth-grade education, he was able to find a job in the industrial belt around Sao Paulo, and he eventually became a lathe operator, a leader of the metalworkers union and the founder of the Workers' Party. 
"Only in Sao Paulo could someone like Lula emerge," said Ruy Mesquita, editor of O Estado de Sao Paulo, the state's leading newspaper. "This is one of the most mobile societies that you can imagine."
Nevertheless, Mr. da Silva's roots in the Northeast help make him more palatable than Mr. Serra to voters and political bosses in that and other regions. "One of Serra's problems is that he is seen as very Paulista in his policy positions, trying to control the redistribution of income from Sao Paulo to the Northeast," Dr. Limongi, the political analyst, said.
Today, more than one of every five Brazilian voters is a Paulista. But the state has only two-thirds of the seats in Congress it would be entitled to if the principle of one person, one vote were to be strictly applied. 
"This has been a permanent feature and source of tension in Brazilian life since the Empire" of the 19th century, said Luiz Werneck Viana, a sociologist who has written extensively on regional differences in this nation of 175 million people. "The Paulistas may cry about it, but Brazil exists as a unified nation only because ways were found to compensate smaller states for what they lacked, and that was at Sao Paulo's expense."
In the past, local dissatisfaction even led to rebellions against the central government. In 1932, for example, resentment at the decision of the dictator Getulio Vargas to appoint an official to replace an elected governor, thereby weakening Sao Paulo's traditional political primacy, prompted an uprising that was quelled only after a three-month siege and was followed by years of discriminatory policies. 
"The goal of Getulio Vargas was to annul the political power of Sao Paulo," said Mr. Mesquita, the editor, whose father was one of the main leaders of the resistance. 
He added, "Sao Paulo struggled back, only to have the same thing happen again during the military dictatorship" that governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985. 
The generals who ruled Brazil during those years were, like Vargas, mostly from Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul. To dilute the power of Sao Paulo, where opposition to their rule was strongest, they created new states, put a ceiling on the number of representatives any state could have in Congress and granted each state, no matter how small, a minimum of four representatives (a number that was later raised to eight). But Dr. Werneck Viana suggests that the state is an unstoppable force destined to play an increasingly larger role in Brazil's political and intellectual life.
"Only coercion can inhibit this, and we have already seen that coercion doesn't work," he said. "In an open society, Sao Paulo, as the leading point of modernity in Brazil, will be victorious again and again."

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks More Rules To Protect 401(k) Plans 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that "more steps are needed" to protect employee retirement packages from corporate wrongdoing, as he took credit for putting rules in effect under legislation passed by Congress.
 His message was timed to coincide with the quarterly statements being received by employees who save part of their wages in tax-advantaged 401(k) plans, often investing the money in the stock market or their own company shares. Because of the market's tumble in the third quarter, many people are seeing declines in these accounts. 
 "Today's workers own more than $1.5 trillion in assets through their 401(k)'s," Mr. Bush said in his weekly Saturday morning radio address. "Younger workers have an average of about $10,000 in their accounts, while workers near retirement hold closer to $100,000 in their 401(k)'s. This is real money for real workers, and we must do all we can to help make sure it's there for them when they retire."
The radio address is one of several steps the administration is taking to deal with economic policy questions before the election on Nov. 5.
Out of five legislative proposals on retirement savings that the administration offered after the Enron bankruptcy, Congress passed two. One gives workers 30 days' notice before a "blackout period" on selling company stock in these plans -- as might occur when changes are made in the management of a retirement account. The other prevents executives from buying and selling during blackout periods shares that they are awarded under stock option plans.
The other three proposals passed the Republican-led House but are still waiting for action by the Senate.
Mr. Bush, who has sought to counter Democratic criticism of his economic policies by arguing that the Senate has been blocking his initiatives, asked it to complete action on the other proposals.
"For the sake of American workers who are concerned about their retirement security, I urge the Senate to pass the rest of my proposals into law," Mr. Bush said. "People who work hard and save for the future deserve every protection we can give them."
The other three proposals, which Mr. Bush called "common sense," would let workers sell company stock from their retirement plans after three years, give investors more information on the performance of their accounts and provide workers with more access to professional investment advice "so they can make more informed decisions about their savings," Mr. Bush said.
The president, who has not spoken about the economy in his weekly address since mid-August, also discussed the plans of the Securities and Exchange Commission for new regulation of corporate executives. The rules would prevent executives from selling their own holdings of company stock while workers could not.
"Corporate executives will no longer be able to sell off their company's declining stock while employees are left holding the bag," Mr. Bush said. These rules will take effect early next year and "give workers greater protections against corporate fraud or abuse," the president said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BAGHDAD; 
From Its Palaces, Iraq's View Is of a World Filled With Allies

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
As Iraq confronts the possibility of a new war with the United States, its leaders appear to have concluded that they have one decisive advantage that they lacked during the countdown to the Persian Gulf war 12 years ago: this time, they seem convinced, the world is on their side and against the United States.
 "The world has abandoned America; it has become isolated," Saddam Hussein's No. 2 man, Izzat Ibrahim, boasted as he announced the result of this week's election: Iraqis, by official reckoning, had re-elected Saddam Hussein to his position of absolute power as president with 100 percent of the 11.4 million votes cast. Along with other leaders in Baghdad, Mr. Ibrahim accused the United States of warmongering, threatening not only Iraq but the entire Middle East. 
 Mr. Hussein's inner circle has also taken heart from the United States' inability to win United Nations backing for a resolution threatening military action against Iraq. Page 13. In 1991, by contrast, a broad coalition of more than 30 nations formed under American leadership, and under an unambiguous Security Council resolution, to trounce Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait. 
Iraqi leaders said this week that France and Russia, with their holding action in New York, were proving the depth of their "friendship" for Iraq and their unwillingness to accept American "hegemony."
But amid the speeches, news conferences and newspaper headlines boasting Iraq's defiance, there was also a sense that Baghdad's aging leaders, a tight circle of men that has changed hardly at all since the gulf war, were busy trying to persuade themselves that they could somehow ride out the most serious threat yet to their power. In this, there were strong echoes of the months before American bombs started falling in 1991, when Baghdad seemed to think it could bluff and maneuver its way into hanging on to Kuwait.
Without doubt, the international mood seems better for Iraq than it has in years. Opprobrium over the Kuwait invasion has long since faded, although Baghdad has defied many of the terms imposed on it by the United Nations after the war. In addition to frustrating weapons inspection teams, Mr. Hussein has deftly manipulated the issue of United Nations economic sanctions, impressing much of the world with claims that 1.7 million Iraqis, a million of them children, have died from malnutrition brought on by the embargoes -- one of several allegations that many people who have traveled around Iraq in recent years regard as outlandish exaggerations, at best.
Looking around the Arab world, Mr. Hussein finds that there is not a single country backing American military action, not even gulf states like Kuwait and Qatar that would be likely bases for American aircraft in a new war. In the West, the United States has only one unambiguous ally in its threat of military action, Britain, and there is much wavering elsewhere. In Baghdad's newspapers on Saturday, headlines trumpeted the announcement that Spain's top diplomat in Baghdad, Fernando Valderrama, had resigned in protest over Spain's "subordination to the American government" in the crisis.
The theme of American isolation was prominent in Mr. Hussein's inaugural speech on Wednesday. In the rambling, the Iraqi leader ran through a checklist of countries and concluded that Iraq has the backing not only of "those aggressed against by the Zionist alliance" -- Palestinians and their supporters -- but also "by freedom lovers all over the world." Together, Mr. Hussein said, these nations would "cause the arrows of aggression to go astray" and doom America to end up "despised, condemned and defeated" in a war with Iraq.
 But as the Kuwait crisis showed in the fall of 1990, opinions that are against America, or only lukewarm, can shift radically as the weeks go on, a possibility that Iraq faces if the Security Council surmounts its current differences and approves a new, tougher mandate for the weapons inspectors.
Iraqi officials have said that they will make no announcement of their attitude towards a new weapons-inspection program until they see the text of a new resolution. But their record raises serious doubts that they will be ready to accept, for example, the immediate and unconditional access to Mr. Hussein's many palaces that the United States has demanded.
Beyond this, it is not clear if Iraqi leaders have grasped the wider changes in the world since 1991. When Mr. Hussein plunged into the gulf war, the "unipolar hegemony" of the United States that many in Europe and the Middle East condemn these days was yet to evolve. Iraq's handling of the weapons inspection teams, if they reach Baghdad, could depend on the judgment Mr. Hussein and his advisers make of the United State's readiness to go to war without the broad coalition that backed action over Kuwait.
Given the secretive nature of the Baghdad elite, it is impossible to know how these issues are weighed, and how realistic the advice being given to Mr. Hussein may be. The fact that his lieutenants could organize a referendum result that had virtually no prospect of being taken at face value outside Iraq -- and Mr. Hussein's own description of the 100 percent vote as an expression of the "indescribable love" shown for him by the country's 22 million people -- suggest that the leadership may be disposed only to hear what it wants. 
Mr. Hussein, in particular, may have to struggle to grasp the realities of the world outside Iraq. He has given no interviews to Western reporters since before the Persian Gulf war and has not traveled outside the country. In the face of several assassination plots originating with his own armed forces and state security forces, he has become increasingly reclusive, moving anonymously within his vast array of palaces and underground bunkers. When he does appear, the only voices he is exposed to are those of Iraqis shouting, "Saddam, Saddam, we are ready to sacrifice to you our blood and our soul."
But much else in Baghdad suggests that ordinary Iraqis may not be of quite the uniform mind that their leaders would like the world to believe. Along with public displays of fealty to Mr. Hussein, some have privately begun to show signs that they may be beginning to look to another kind of Iraq.
The signs are small -- nothing that remotely resembles open dissidence, because that invariably ends with imprisonment or worse. But some rules for visitors that in the run-up to the gulf war were nearly ironclad have now been quietly eased, and satirical remarks that would once have earned a stern reproof now sometimes get a knowing smile.
The changes seem to hint that the Iraqi state, as fearsome a machine for marshaling obedience as any in the post-Soviet world, may be retreating, at least in small things. And from small things, larger things can follow. In the months after the Kuwait invasion, but before the American-led bombing began in January 1991, it would have been improbable in the extreme to enter a cafe and find Iraqis not sitting silent, rapt, before a television carrying a speech by Mr. Hussein. But on Wednesday, during his inaugural speech, customers in one cafe were too busy chatting to play the TV broadcast much heed. Perhaps, in ways outsiders can only guess, real changes in Iraq may already be under way.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO WITHDRAW FROM ARMS ACCORD WITH NORTH KOREA 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has decided to scrap the 1994 arms control accord with North Korea that has provided Western energy aid in return for the North's promise to freeze the development of nuclear weapons, senior administration officials said today.
 North Korea admitted two weeks ago that it was pursuing a covert nuclear weapons program, and accused the United States of taking steps that forced Pyongyang to nullify the accord. The White House has since debated whether to end the accord, with some aides warning such a step could lead North Korea to even greater nuclear violations. 
 For that reason, the administration plans to caution North Korea of serious consequences if it tries to remove nuclear material now stored under international supervision at Yongbyon, the reactor site that was the centerpiece of a previous nuclear standoff with North Korea in the early 1990's. American diplomats visiting Beijing apparently asked China this week to convey that warning, though it is not clear whether the message has yet been delivered to the North Koreans. 
The immediate practical effect of the decision to scrap the agreement is the halting of the annual shipments of 500,000 tons of fuel oil from the United States to North Korea. 
Even if the clandestine North Korean program effectively suspended the accord, the administration's decision to formally abandon it sends a clear message: it signifies an American effort to pose a stark choice for North Korea, between abandoning all of its nuclear weapons programs and facing near-total economic isolation.
 "We think the framework as we knew it is dead," one senior administration official said when questioned about the administration's strategy. "The North Koreans already told us they viewed it as 'nullified,' " the official added.
More immediately, abandoning the accord also means that the United States will urge its allies, Japan and South Korea, to suspend, if not end, a multibillion dollar project to provide modern nuclear power plants to the North. Ground has already been broken for proliferation-resistant reactors, designed to help North Korea provide basic electricity service to cities and towns that go dark every night, and to World War II-era factories that now barely operate. The reactors have not yet been delivered.
Other officials described a lengthy debate within the White House over the risks of abandoning the agreement altogether. 
"There are some who fear that it could tempt the North Koreans into a rapid breakout, to produce weapons as fast as they can," one official involved in the debate said. But Mr. Bush, who came to office deeply suspicious of the usefulness of the accord, has concluded that the North Korean admission, made in defiant tones after the United States presented evidence of the breach, proves that the accord was fatally flawed all along, his aides say.
In 1994, President Clinton had contingency plans in place for a military strike at the Yongbyon plant if North Korea tried to make use of the reactor fuel for bombs, according to several of his former national security aides. The accord reached at the last minute that year, as American forces were being reinforced on the Korean Peninsula, defused that crisis. Since disclosing Wednesday night that North Korea has admitted to pursuing a new nuclear project, Mr. Bush's aides have played down any talk of a military response. North Korea acknowledged the program in defiant tones after the United States presented evidence that it had breached the accord.
Officials did not specify what consequences North Korea might face if it ignored American warnings, a sharp contrast to the approach being taken with Iraq. They argued again that the North, even if nuclear armed and unpredictable, does not pose as great a threat to the United States and its allies as does Saddam Hussein, who does not appear to have any nuclear weapons so far but is suspected of having chemical and biological arms. 
Several years ago the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that North Korea already had reprocessed enough plutonium at Yongbyon to make one or 2 nuclear weapons, and that the fuel in storage could be fabricated into 5 or 10 more. 
American officials say there is no indication so far that any of that material has been removed from the storage facilities, which the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors. 
The 1994 accord was specifically designed to halt a sophisticated and well-advanced nuclear program at Yongbyon that involved extracting plutonium from reactor waste, and using it to produce weapons. But under other agreements, the North Koreans were also forbidden other new projects, including the one it now says it has been pursuing, using a more easily hidden technology to produce a bomb from highly enriched uranium. 
Enforcing that isolation -- the administration would not use the word "embargo" today, although that appears to be what it has in mind -- would require the agreement and cooperation of China, Russia, Japan, South Korea and Europe. Already the administration is running into significant resistance -- chiefly from South Korea, which has long argued for engagement with the North. South Korean officials fear that the enigmatic North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, will feel backed into a corner by any American-led effort at economic isolation. 
"This is going to take some time, because a lot of countries have different equities with the North Koreans," said the senior official, describing a slow and deliberate diplomatic approach that contrasts with the short timetable for disarmament it has given to Iraq.
But South Korea wants to do everything it can to tamp down any sense of crisis, for fear that a repeat of the 1994 nuclear confrontation could veer out of control. The difference between the American and South Korean approaches was evident tonight when South Korea's unification minister -- whose job it is to smooth relations with the North -- arrived in Pyongyang, the capital, for an official visit.
The minister, Jeong Se Hyun, raised the nuclear problem in the most circumspect terms, and a pool report distributed in Seoul quoted Mr. Jeong as telling North Korea's prime minister that it was "of paramount importance to wisely resolve the concern recently raised."
Before leaving Seoul this morning, Mr. Jeong said he would ask the North Koreans "to resolve the nuclear issue" while going ahead with "the agreed-upon agenda for reconciliation and exchange" between the North and South. 
The administration does not plan to publicly announce its decision to abandon the 1994 agreement anytime soon, officials say, in hopes of creating a unified front with its allies. 
The spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean McCormack, said today, that "North Korea, by its own declaration, has said the agreed framework is 'nullified' and their actions have made them noncompliant with the agreement."
Much of the technology for the new program came from Pakistan, according to current and former officials familiar with the intelligence. Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said on Friday that a news article in The New York Times describing the American intelligence finding was "absolutely baseless." 
"There is no such thing as collaboration with North Korea in the nuclear arena," General Musharraf said.
The White House, in a carefully worded statement, said it hoped all nations would cut off any nuclear aid to North Korea, and neither confirmed nor disputed the Times account.
In Seoul today, James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for Asia and the Pacific, and the man to whom the North Koreans revealed their clandestine effort in a heated session two weeks ago, said the United States wanted to bring "maximum international pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions." 
But he carefully avoided hinting that South Korea supported a tough stand vis-a-vis the North. Mr. Bush will meet South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, who is about to leave office, and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, at a Pacific economic summit meeting in Mexico next weekend.
Mr. Kelly's stop in Seoul was a prelude to that meeting, and he moved on today to Tokyo in search of a unified response to the surprise North Korean announcement. He would say only that he and South Korean officials "discussed all aspects" of North Koreas nuclear program but had "reached no decisions" on what to do next.
Today, Mr. Kelly said that the North Koreans "did not make any demands" during his visit on Oct. 3 and 4, when the nuclear program was revealed, but he added that they "did suggest there were measures that might be taken" to induce them to comply with the American demand that they disarm and come back into compliance with their past agreements. North Korea has repeatedly accused the United States of delays in construction of the twin light water nuclear reactors.
"They indicated when all these good things were done, we might be able to talk about their covert enrichment program," Mr. Kelly said. "The North got it upside down."
The senior administration official interviewed about the White House's strategy said that North Korea must end the highly enriched uranium program "in a verifiable way," a major task in a country known for its skills at digging deep caves. The official added: "This time we must also address other problems -- missile transfer, the conventional forces the North has, and the abominable way it treats its people." None of those issues were covered in the 1994 framework accord.
"You can't have re-entry into the international community of states and brandish a nuclear weapon," said the official.

HEADLINE: Private Art in Public 

BYLINE:  By Gabriella De Ferrari; Gabriella De Ferrari is a writer and former director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston.

 BODY:
In America it is individuals, not governments, who have established public collections of art, books and manuscripts of dazzling quality, diversity and depth. The single-donor museum has long contributed to this nation's cultural richness. While tax deductions support the founding of these institutions, it has been the vision of generous donors that has given the public such treasures as Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, New York's Frick Collection, Los Angeles's Getty Museum, and more recently the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts in St. Louis, the Neue Galerie for German and Austrian Art in New York, and the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C.
 Some donors impose few restrictions on their gifts. J. Paul Getty, for example, gave his trustees a relatively free hand in accomplishing "the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge." Others, like Mrs. Gardner, attempted to control every detail, dictating how the collections are displayed, prohibiting loans, forbidding new acquisitions and even requiring the museum's director to live in the museum building. While restrictions can preserve the values of the time when the collection was created, they also carry risks. The Barnes Foundation, one of the most important collections of late 19th- and early 20th-century art in America, is a case in point. 
 Last month, 51 years after Albert C. Barnes died, the trustees of his foundation filed a petition requesting relief from Dr. Barnes's rigorous limitations on operations, use of the collection and governance. The trustees claim that the foundation is on the verge of bankruptcy, unable to meet operating expenses given changing economic circumstances and Dr. Barnes's many restrictions. If the petition is granted, the foundation's governing document would be changed to permit relocation of its gallery from suburban Philadelphia to a new museum downtown and to expand the board from five to 15 members. This proceeding raises the question of how long a donor's control over cultural treasures should last.
Virtually all institutions established by a single donor -- no matter how wealthy when founded -- eventually require public support to survive. That support includes direct cash from the public and indirect subsidies through local, state and federal tax exemptions. These institutions become public burdens as well as public assets, and should therefore reflect the public's interest in ensuring access to important cultural properties. 
Current law permits donor restrictions to run in perpetuity. Yet every museum confronts increasing costs, changing public demands and new approaches to the presentation of collections. Mrs. Gardner could never have foreseen the need for and expense of climate control nor the public benefit of lending artworks for short periods of time to traveling exhibitions. Mr. Frick could not have imagined the many public programs museums must now provide. Flexibility is not merely desirable but also necessary if cultural property is to serve the public as fully as possible.
Today's trustees can go to court for relief, as the Barnes's trustees have done. But these proceedings are time-consuming and their result is uncertain. A better way to balance a donor's wishes and the public's interest is to adopt state laws that would limit the period during which donor restrictions are enforceable, releasing trustees from them after, say, 50 years. This change would give trustees latitude to adjust to changing needs. 
Would such laws diminish gifts of great collections to the public? There is little reason to think so: the drive of collectors to present their holdings as they enjoyed them, even for a limited period, and the tax and personal benefits of giving are simply too compelling. Limiting the period of restrictions would benefit the public and give single-donor museums a more robust life in perpetuity.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Chief executives takethe education of Congress in hand to help the Postal Service.

BYLINE:  By Claudia H. Deutsch 

 BODY:
O.K., true or false?
The United States Postal Service is subsidized by the government.
 It has one union, with which it can bargain quite aggressively. 
It can cut costs by consolidating post offices in areas where mail traffic is too meager to warrant separate branches.
David Sable, chief executive of Wunderman New York, a Young & Rubicam unit that does mass mailings, knows that many -- maybe even most -- people wrongly think those statements are true. He can live with that. What makes him crazy is that many members of Congress have the wrong answers, too. 
"You'll hear a congressman ask, 'Why can't these guys negotiate a better deal?' " Mr. Sable said, noting that the federal government decides what benefits the Postal Service can offer. "I've even heard congressmen campaign on the idea of cutting subsidies to the post office, when the feds haven't subsidized the post office for decades."
Now, Mr. Sable and 13 other corporate chiefs whose businesses cannot function without a thriving mail system, have taken the education of Congress into their own hands. They have formed the Mailing Industry CEO Council to set senators and representatives straight on the Postal Service's facts and figures -- and, they hope, to point Congress toward a workable postal overhaul bill.
"We C.E.O.'s represent a tremendous collective ability to encourage a healthier Postal Service," said Gary M. Mulloy, chief executive of the direct mail marketing firm ADVO and the new council's secretary.
The chief executives have specific cures in mind. For example, they want Congress to make it easier for the Postal Service to raise rates, negotiate employment levels and salaries and close operations.
"We want Congress to let the post office act like the independent agency it's supposed to be," said Michael J. Critelli, the new council's chairman and the chief executive of Pitney Bowes, whose postage-meter and mail-services business depends on a functioning Postal Service. "And we want Congress to acknowledge how important a healthy mail system still is."
Congressional advocates for postal change say they welcome help in getting attention for their cause. "My colleagues in Congress understand the financial difficulties facing the post office," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who recently sponsored a bill to create a presidential commission to look into improving the postal system. "But the business community has to make them more aware of the negative impact of frequent, unpredictable rate increases."
This is not the private sector's first foray into Postal Service issues. Since 1988 the Mailers Council, a group of companies and trade associations that represent more than 70 percent of the country's mail volume, has regularly weighed in on postal rate increases. It also has long shared the CEO Council's frustrations with Congress.
"You can count on two hands the members of Congress who have a serious interest in postal reform or who realize that the Postal Service owes billions of dollars in pensions and insurance," said Robert E. McLean, the group's executive director.
Several of the chief executives on the new council are already members of Mr. McLean's group. In fact, several, along with many of their employees, have also served on the mailing industry task force, which was formed at the Postal Service's behest in the spring of 2001.
But the task force has concentrated on improving operations -- for example, finding more efficient ways for sorting mail, for handling payments for postage and for determining mail-delivery routes. The Mailers Council has focused more on public policy, but it represents so many factions -- junk mailers, catalog companies, banks, publishers, in fact anyone using the mail system -- that consensus has been elusive.
"All the Mailers Council can agree on is that we should cut costs and offer great service," said John M. Nolan, the deputy postmaster general.
Mr. McLean acknowledges this. "The best we've been able to do is ask for a presidential commission to investigate the Postal Service," he said. "If Mike Critelli's group can get Congress interested, we will be truly happy."
The chief executives in the CEO Council must overcome conflicting agendas, too. Indeed, the group's name seems a misnomer, in that its concept of a "mailing industry" is an artificial construct; many of the members run companies that rely on the mail to do business but do not get revenue from the business of mailing. And yet, the CEO Council posits that providers of mail services, like Pitney Bowes, and customers of those services, like Wunderman, make up an industry that employs nine million people, generates $900 billion in annual revenue and represents 8 percent of the gross national product.
"Sure, our subissues may diverge, but we have one common need," said William L. Davis, chief executive of the printing firm R. R. Donnelley & Sons. "We must make the people inside the Beltway understand how far-reaching the postal system's grasp is on the economy."
There is little question the Postal Service can use help. It supposedly is a self-supporting independent agency, but it is owned by the federal government. Although it pays no taxes, it is not subsidized. It deals with four unions -- for city carriers, rural carriers, clerks and mail handlers -- and its labor negotiations are subject to final arbitration.
The Postal Service must go through an arduous legislative review each time it wishes to raise a rate or close an office -- and not surprisingly, few members of Congress will vote to allow any post offices to close in their districts. Moreover, its pension liabilities "would swamp most companies," Mr. Davis said.
So encumbered, the Postal Service lost more than $1 billion in each of the last two years. Although its recent rate increases will probably enable it to turn a profit of $600 million or so in fiscal 2003, which began on Oct. 1, Mr. Nolan puts the amount in context. "That's enough for two weeks' payroll," he said.
What is more, the Postal Service is prohibited from lobbying Congress on its own behalf. Which is where the CEO Council comes in.
"These C.E.O.'s have the ability to present the facts of what we are to Congress, and to persuade Congress and the administration that change is needed," Mr. Nolan said.
Senator Collins echoed that thought. "When Congress is dealing with prescription drugs and war in Iraq," she said, "it helps to have high-profile C.E.O.'s pointing out the importance of postal reform."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A Boon for Nonprofits With Software Needs

BYLINE:  By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
If these are lean times for corporate information technology purchasers, what is the situation for nonprofit groups that need new hardware or software? Surprisingly good, as it turns out.
 Despite the moribund information technology economy, the nonprofit sector may actually be benefiting from the slump -- as companies like Microsoft see donations as a way of helping keep their products in widespread use, and as large numbers of otherwise unemployed hardware and software professionals demonstrate a new willingness to take jobs in the nonprofit community. 
 At the Family Stress Center, a county-financed nonprofit family services agency in Concord, Calif., Paul Bongiovanni has the task of continually updating the computer system that keeps the agency running.
That is a challenge because the center serves 7,000 clients a year throughout sprawling Contra Costa County, 30 miles east of San Francisco. 
The agency, which offers programs for the prevention and treatment of child abuse, operates on a budget of only about $2 million. And with 70 or so full- and part-time counselors and administrators to pay, that leaves little left to spend on the latest version of Windows software, say, or on installing additional high-speed Internet lines.
But through a relatively new online software store for nonprofit organizations called DiscounTech, Mr. Bongiovanni, the center's business manager, is able to buy leading software like Norton Antivirus and Microsoft Office XP for about 10 percent of the original retail price. That means instead of paying the $500 or so he might spend on each copy of the Microsoft Office XP suite of word-processing, scheduling, spreadsheet and other applications, Mr. Bongiovanni pays only a $60 administrative fee to CompuMentor, the nonprofit organization in San Francisco that created DiscounTech. That way, he said, the agency can spend its money on technology consultants, instead of software, to get the most out of the technology.
DiscounTech was introduced in February by CompuMentor, which has been offering computer consulting at discounted rates to other nonprofit groups for 15 years, primarily in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
The advent of DiscounTech, which is available nationwide, has clearly struck a chord with nonprofit organizations, which in the past have had to rely on a hodgepodge of grants, direct donations and assistance from a variety of foundations to pay for new technology. Or they have simply done without.
That had been the experience, for example, of Mark McNeil, information technology director of the nonprofit Economic Opportunity Council, a social services agency in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Before DiscounTech, Mr. McNeil said, he would typically contact Microsoft and other companies directly to request specific product donations.
"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't, but it always took a lot of effort," said Mr. McNeil, adding that he had also received donated software through Gifts in Kind, an organization that helps match donors of various sorts with nonprofit groups.
But not until DiscounTech came along, Mr. McNeil said, did he find it possible to use the most current versions of leading programs, like Microsoft Office XP and Symantec's antivirus software.
"Our organization has to run pretty lean," Mr. McNeil said. "Now for every four licenses of Microsoft Office we save enough to buy another computer."
Rebecca Masisak, the director of DiscounTech, hopes to start offering discounted computers and networking technology by the end of this year, though many of the details have still to be worked out. Once a DiscounTech customer has installed the purchased technology, the user can then turn to CompuMentor for discounted consulting services, online bulletin boards and an informational Web site for nonprofits called TechSoup.
CompuMentor's original charter -- to match volunteers, or mentors, in the technology industry with nonprofit agencies -- is still a large part of the organization's focus. But the current one-stop approach marks a coming of age for CompuMentor. It was founded in 1987 by Daniel Ben-Horin, a former journalist, who set it up with a $2,500 grant from a local foundation.
"I thought I'd do it for about a year," Mr. Ben-Horin said. Considering the enthusiasm for technology at the time, he said, "it seemed like a no-brainer" to match computer programmers and consultants with agencies in need of their specific services. But keeping his own nonprofit afloat proved to be more challenging than he had expected.
In the last decade, Mr. Ben-Horin said, the organization has come close to bankruptcy more than once. But it is now on firmer footing, as it receives financing from Microsoft and AOL Time Warner, along with the Surda Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the Kellogg Foundation. CompuMentor is also the Bay Area affiliate of the national network of technology assistance providers, called the NPower Network, that Microsoft founded several years ago.
CompuMentor has benefited somewhat in the last year from the demise of the local Internet economy in San Francisco. For one thing, Mr. Ben-Horin has been able to find spacious offices in a converted warehouse once occupied by a Web company. And he has seen the caliber of job applicants rise, as layoffs sent talented Internet entrepreneurs, project managers and designers looking for their next projects.
Recently, for example, CompuMentor received 500 applications for a single editor job on TechSoup. CompuMentor now employs about 65 people in roomy offices in the southern end of San Francisco once known as Multimedia Gulch.
For software companies, CompuMentor's DiscounTech simplifies the process of donating to numerous small and midsize nonprofit groups -- a disparate array of clinics, community service agencies, homeless shelters and other organizations.
Microsoft, which began distributing a limited selection of programs through CompuMentor, has now made DiscounTech one of the company's largest donation outlets.
In its fiscal year 2002, which ended on June 30, Microsoft donated $25 million in software through DiscounTech, accounting for about one of every eight of the company's software donations, according to Bruce Brooks, Microsoft's director of community affairs.
This fiscal year, Microsoft expects to use DiscounTech to donate $30 million of software.
For Microsoft and other software companies, having their products widely distributed, even at steep discounts or for free, can be a way to raise visibility -- a tax-deductible form of marketing.
"There's a definite market-recognition factor in the nonprofit sector," agreed Eran Goren, vice president of business development at Ontero Software, which donates its Web portal program called InfoCentral. "And it's a sector that definitely has a need."

HEADLINE: A Powerful, Flawed Witness Against Enron 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
The recent plea agreement with a former senior Enron trader presents new opportunities for the law enforcement officials investigating a range of possible crimes at the company. But it also creates challenges for prosecutors that did not exist before.
 Under the agreement announced last week, the trader, Timothy N. Belden, pleaded guilty to conspiring with others to manipulate the California energy market during the state's energy crises that began in 2000, and he agreed to cooperate in the investigation of Enron. In his statements to the court, Mr. Belden acknowledged submitting false commitments for energy delivery for the purpose of driving up prices. 
 Prosecutors now have both a crucial witness to aid in the investigation of trading irregularities, and one who can create paths of inquiry, potentially going further up the line in Enron's management. Already, people involved in the case said, Mr. Belden has provided information to investigators about Enron's broadband unit as well as about its use of huge reserves from its California energy trading to offset losses in other businesses.
But Mr. Belden also arrives with certain baggage as a witness. He is the first crucial witness in the Enron case to have provided statements in the past about his wrongdoing -- as far back as three years ago -- and presented answers that any clever defense lawyer would use to undermine his accusation of a conspiracy involving others at Enron. At bottom, during those interviews, Mr. Belden has maintained at times that his actions were not illegal and that he, and he alone, was responsible for them.
At issue is the complex system that was adopted by California in 1996 and made operational two years later. The law created two institutions, the California Power Exchange, which served as the primary marketplace for wholesale electricity, and the California Independent System Operator, which was responsible for managing the state's energy-transmission grid. Through those institutions, the energy marketers, including Enron, would schedule deliveries of fixed amounts of electricity to their wholsesale and retail customers.
There were plenty of ways for energy marketers to profit from high demand. If a power line was overcrowded by too much scheduled delivery, a marketer would be paid a "congestion management fee" for rescheduling a delivery or moving power in the other direction. Marketers were also paid for making commitments to deliver standby electricity in the event of a sudden loss of supplies. Then, if generators in the state could not supply the needed power, marketers could sell out-of-state electricity at a higher price.
But the rules seemed to rely on traders not taking advantage of the system -- something Enron did, according to the company's records and other documents. It submitted bogus schedules for huge amounts of electricity for delivery, thus creating congestion, then received payments for "relieving" overcrowding that did not really exist. It guaranteed delivery of large amounts of power it did not intend to deliver. And it shipped power out of California, only to ship it back as high-priced "out-of-state" electricity. 
By 1999, one year into the new California system -- and before the energy crisis hit with full force -- Mr. Belden and Enron were already engaged in some of those activities. On May 25, 1999, Enron scheduled for the transmission of nearly 2,900 megawatts of electricity over a line known as the Silver Peak, which was able to carry just 15 megawatts. The power was never sent, but the bogus scheduling caused energy disruptions and higher prices. California opened an inquiry, questioning executives including Mr. Belden. 
At that time, Mr. Belden said nothing about a conspiracy or acting on the instructions of others. Rather, according to notes from the interview, Mr. Belden assumed responsibility for the event. "He was the sole party responsible for making the decisions to submit the bids and schedules that led to the event," investigative notes from the interview read.
Of course, the statement was limited to the Silver Peak event, and does not explicitly eliminate possible knowledge of Mr. Belden's actions on the part of others. But legal experts said that such a statement was sure to be an issue in any trial in which Mr. Belden served as a main witness.
"A statement like this would certainly be a priority and a key line of questioning for anyone facing charges resulting from Mr. Belden's cooperation," said Stephen Meagher, a former prosecutor in San Francisco. "Any lawyer would want to get to the bottom of why one transaction was presumably so different from the others in which he is now implicating other senior executives." 
Of course, the existence of such a statement does not prove that Mr. Belden was misrepresenting anything; rather, it is simply a piece of evidence that can be used to attack his credibility on the stand. The creation of such problems is one of the reasons lawyers often insist that their clients refuse to testify during a criminal investigation, because they can be locked into an account that later works against them. 
Cristina C. Arguedas, a lawyer for Mr. Belden, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. 
According to the investigative notes, Mr. Belden submitted the bogus bids and schedules on Silver Peak as an experiment. He told investigators that the effort was "only intended by its actions to make clear to the marketplace that a dangerous loophole existed," the notes say.
Ultimately, California fined Enron $25,000 for its maneuvers on Silver Peak, and its then head of trading, Lawrence G. Whalley, signed an agreement never to repeat such maneuvers. But according to Mr. Belden's admissions last week, that is exactly what Enron did during the energy crisis.
The trading pattern was eventually discovered in 2000 by Enron lawyers, who interviewed Mr. Belden about his strategies. And again, the notes of those interviews, which have been obtained by investigators, provide page after page of additional previous statements by Mr. Belden that could be used to undermine his credibility. 
Why would Mr. Belden have been so open in his discussions about potential wrongdoing, when so many others at Enron have refused to speak about the scandal? For one, the interviews took place in 1999 and 2000, before the Enron scandal exploded into public view. Moreover, many traders, Mr. Belden included, seem to have thought that such manipulations were simply clever methods of taking advantage of poor rules, rather than illegality.
But legal experts said, regardless of the regulations in place, obtaining profits through the submission of false documents, as Mr. Belden did, crosses the line into criminal fraud.
"Gaining economic advantage through material misrepresentation doesn't really require regulations to be violated" for a criminal prosecution, Mr. Meagher said. "It's fraud, pure and simple."

Vivendi Moves Up Deadline On Bids for Publishing Unit
Vivendi Universal is rushing suitors of its publishing business, which includes Houghton Mifflin, to submit final bids by today, executives involved in the discussions said.
 Vivendi, which is trying to sell assets to cut its enormous debt, moved up the bidding deadline so that it could negotiate a higher bid, or possibly counter, an offer by the Vodafone Group for Vivendi's stake in Cegetel, the large French phone company. Page C2.

First Novel Becomes Best Seller
"The Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold has become the biggest-selling book of the year, beating competition from Tom Clancy, Nicholas Sparks and Stephen King. It is the literary equivalent of that other word-of-mouth success, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." How the book, a first novel, became a best seller reflects its strength in a wave of literary novels. It is a trend that appears to be blurring the boundaries of literary and commercial fiction. C7.

For Big Game Maker, Online Play Is a Big Gamble

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Electronic Arts is a Silicon Valley company markedly out of step with its neighbors.
 In this region, where the market values of many technology companies have shriveled the last two years, Electronic Arts, the world's biggest video-game publisher, has flourished. On Friday, its shares closed at $70.14, its highest finish since the company went public 13 years ago, and up 13 percent for the year. 
 Analysts attribute the stock's ascent both to continued strength by Electronic Arts and to an industry growth cycle driven by the introduction of hardware platforms the last two years: Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox. Retail and video-game industry analysts say the sale of the hardware, and the games played upon them, could be a rare bright spot this holiday season, though perhaps not as bright as previously projected. 
Electronic Arts remains so confident that it has decided to postpone the release of a potentially top-selling game from the holiday season, the peak period for video game sales. Sims 4 -- the latest version of its popular game in which players control characters as they go through their daily lives -- will be delayed until early next year. 
The idea is to avoid cannibalizing sales of its other major holiday games, including James Bond 007: Nightfire; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets; and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. In particular, Electronic Arts wants to leave the field clear for The Sims Online, an Internet-based game whose success may dictate whether the company will meet its and Wall Street's lofty expectations. 
"The Sims Online is the most important game they've come out with in a long time," said Michael P. Wallace, an analyst with UBS Warburg.
"Everyone knows they're going to have a good Christmas, but that game determines where the stock goes," Mr. Wallace said. "If it's not a hit, you're looking at more losses in the online division, and the stock hits a wall."
A growing number of people are betting the stock will do just that. The interest of short sellers -- investors who bet that a stock falls -- has grown steadily to its highest point in more than a year. As of Sept. 13, the most recent date for which the data is available, there were 11.8 million shares of short interest, the shares that have been borrowed and sold short -- 12 percent of the outstanding shares -- compared with 10.7 million the month before, and 8.8 million shares in Oct. 2001.
At Friday's closing price, the shares are selling at around 34 times projected earnings, not particularly high by historical standards -- the company's stock typically trades at 25 to 35 times earnings -- but it is twice the amount of several of the other major game makers, including Activision and THQ.
So investors will be watching closely when Electronic Arts announces its second-quarter financial results this week. 
So far, the company has had a strong year. For the last two quarters -- its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002 and its first quarter of fiscal 2003 -- total revenue increased more than 80 percent over the periods a year earlier. For the company's second quarter, Wall Street is projecting revenue of around $393 million, which would be about a 64 percent increase over last year's period, and a profit of 17 cents a share -- compared with a loss of 24 cents a share in the period a year earlier, which analysts attributed to investments in the online unit's start-up.
As an industry, video games are still larger by sales volume than are Hollywood movies, with $9.4 billion of games and hardware sold in 2001. And recently, as in the early 1990's, the industry has seemed to be ignoring the economic recession.
But in the last few weeks, industry analysts said, retailers have expressed concern that video games will sell less well this holiday season than previously forecast, as worries mount that the current economic doldrums are too prolonged to insulate game companies. John G. Taylor, an analyst with Arcadia Investment, said that earlier this year analysts had been projecting industry sales as high as $12 billion for 2002. He now expects the final number to be closer to $10.5 billion.
One game maker, Acclaim Entertainment, publisher of the popular Turok action games, had a nasty surprise for Wall Street last Thursday, reporting a much deeper loss than expected for its fiscal fourth quarter, blaming weak sales for Turok and its other top games. The stock, already weak, collapsed, closing on Friday at 73 cents, only a fraction of its 52-week high of $6.25 last November.
Video-game industry analysts say that retailers had cut back their orders for games, and may cut shelf space allotted to the software.
"Retailers have a decent amount of inventory that is under-performing," said Mr. Taylor He said that average weekly sales of hardware had "flat-lined" since July, leading to lower expectations for software sales. The retailers, Mr. Taylor said, "realized there is a ton of new products they are expected to absorb between August and December."
Indeed, from now to Christmas, video-game makers will introduce 300 games -- more than 20 from Electronic Arts, which took in about half its 2001 revenue of $1.3 billion in the holiday quarter last year.
Among the new games, the most crucial for Electronic Arts may be The Sims Online. The game is an Internet version of the Sims series, which is one of the most successful video games of all time and has an usually high number of female players. In it, players oversee their online characters as they go to work, build a home, and develop relationships. In the online version, players will be able to interact with one another over the Internet, conceivably creating a virtual world where people play out real-world pursuits.
Moving the game online is a potential watershed not just for Electronic Arts, but for the industry. So far, the handful of online games that have succeeded are action-adventure games like EverQuest, a role-playing game, published by Sony Online Entertainment, that are not aimed at the mainstream audience Sims tends to attract.
Electronic Arts has spent some $300 million on EA.com, the Web site and related technology that will support The Sims Online -- an investment that some industry analysts have criticized as too large and too risky. For the Internet operation to break even, analysts say, EA.com will need to attract 250,000 subscribers at a fee that analysts expect to be around $10 a month. 
John S. Riccitiello, the president of Electronic Arts, said that for EA.com to attract a substantial customer base, the game must truly appeal to a mainstream audience even more so than it currently does. In turn, he said, there is a challenge in making the game highly accessible to people who are not inveterate game players.
"To get to one million or more subscribers, we're going to make the game feel really friendly," he said, expressing some doubt as to whether the designers had yet achieved that goal. "We need to do some work to improve the newby experience."
Mr. Riccitiello said the company still expected to have the EA.com unit break even by the end of the year and get "north of 200,000 subscribers." But that would take a remarkably fast start, given that The Sims Online has yet to be rolled out.
It was to better focus consumer attention on The Sims Online that the company decided to delay the introduction of Sims 4 until the spring, Mr. Riccitiello said. "We've got so much going on," he said, "that we needed a little more room for them."
Shawn Milne, an analyst with SoundView Technology, said it made sense for Electronic Arts, which will spend $200 million in the quarter on marketing for all its games, to focus on The Sims Online. "If they don't execute properly, it will mar their core business strength." 
The Sims Online aside, analysts say Electronic Arts continues to do several things right: the company emphasizes sports games, most notably its signature game, John Madden Football, publishing new versions each year to capitalize on evolving technology, and updating players and teams.
Mr. Taylor, the Arcadia analyst, said another reason for the company's strength is that it does not rely on a single game for its revenue. "It's the single most diversified publisher out there," he said, noting that in 2001, even John Madden Football accounted for only 11 percent of the company's total revenue. 
Because of the company's dominance, Mr. Milne and several other analysts said they did not expect Electronic Arts to feel the pinch if retailers reduced the shelf space allotted to video games. Instead, they said, retailers will probably continue to stock the known brands, and sacrifice less popular games from smaller companies that lack Electronic Arts' marketing power. 
The company may also continue to benefit from the fact that the industry is still in only the early stages of the new product cycle for the Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. Last year, Microsoft and Nintendo sold about a million consoles each, and Mr. Wallace, the UBS Warburg analyst, predicts the companies will sell 4 million each this year. He said that Sony, which sold about 6 million PlayStation 2's last year, will sell about 7.5 million this year. 
The hardware sales are a reason Mr. Riccitiello argues that analysts' forecasts for game software are too low. "People are now seeing growth of 15 percent for the year," he said, referring to industry sales in general. "I think that's low by 5 points, maybe 10."

HEADLINE: Thunder in Paradise: A Resilient Bali Prepares for a Storm 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KUTA, Indonesia, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
The allure of surf and a Hindu culture of temples and incense that tolerated discos and drinking made Bali the elixir of good time, low-cost contemporary tourism.
 When the attackers blew up the Sari Club on Oct. 12, they hit at the heart of the dream of every young Western traveler. 
 But behind the commercial patina lay a place of local religious devotion and personal elegance that attracted foreign painters and jewelers, fashion designers and furniture makers and their fancy friends for much of the 20th century. 
Drawn to houses with deep cool verandas set in a lush landscape, where living is made easy by smiling, sarong-clad staff members, a colony of Europeans and Americans have lived what many would consider a fantasy life in paradise. 
In recent years, upmarket hoteliers packaged that lifestyle into expensive resorts that included outdoor spas fringed with frangipani, and $1,000-a-night luxury villas. 
Whether the attackers, who are believed to be Islamic militants tied to Al Qaeda, will succeed in destroying all this remains an open question.
In the short term, tourism will plunge, residents said. But in the longer term, they suggested, the island may bounce back because in the past, the Balinese have shown resilience against natural disaster and political turmoil. 
"What will happen now?" asked Idanna Pucci, an anthropologist who splits her time between Bali and Manhattan. "It will depend on how the Balinese react. The religious authorities in every village have been asking the population to keep calm and to face this terrible tragedy in a nonviolent way."
There was some concern, Ms. Pucci said, that the Hindu Balinese would retaliate against the Muslim minority, most of whom have come in recent years from the adjacent and overcrowded island of Java. 
Last Wednesday, in an effort to keep the peace, the island's priests asked their congregations to attend temple and make offerings -- platters of fruit, candy and little cakes -- for the souls of those who died. 
Bali was discovered by European travelers in the 1920's and 30's, when the island's interior -- mountains, terraces of emerald rice fields and banana and coconut trees -- became the stuff of paintings by Dutch and German artists. Walter Spies, a German painter, settled in the village of Ubud, far from the beach in 1927, and helped introduce Balinese painters and culture to the world.
The American anthropologist Margaret Mead studied the religion, and Charlie Chaplin used Balinese comic actors as the inspiration for his famously disjointed walk. By the end of the 1960's, hippies from London and New York found Bali a sanctuary of freedom. 
Ms. Pucci remembers arriving in 1973 as an anthropologist and thinking that her new way of life was "like being high without drugs." 
The Westerners were fascinated, she said, by the integration of religion into everyday life and by the temple ceremonies for various deities. 
But by the late 1970's, the idyll began to change.
The international airport was built near the capital, Denpasar, in 1969; the first major American hotel, the Hyatt, opened in 1973; and Australians looking for a nearby vacation spot poured onto the island. The village of Kuta became a crowded thoroughfare jammed with boutiques, bars and eventually the Sari Club. 
Once the hotels opened, a new economy developed, backed by expatriates and maintained by Balinese labor. The expatriates ran businesses to supply the hotels with food and furniture. Then, exploiting the artistic talents of the Balinese, some expatriates moved into jewelry and clothing. 
Today, an American, John Harding, has entire villages making jewelry that sells at Neiman Marcus and other high-end American stores. An Italian clothing designer, Milo, sells his creations of silk and organza that are hand stitched by Balinese women for wealthy clients in Asia.
An Australian jewelry designer, Lyn Shwaiko, who lives in Ubud, said she arrived in Bali in 1974. In those days, the backpackers' route had three high points, Goa, Katmandu and Bali, she said. For her, Bali was special because it was far from Europe.
"In those days, obviously they had a spiritualism that transcended everything else," said Ms. Shwaiko. "For those of us coming from the West, it was amazing to see people living in such a spiritual way." 
Beyond that, she said, the Balinese were economically smart. The agricultural system based on rice cultivation was so efficient, with natural irrigation from the mountain waters, that the farmers had plenty of time to develop the arts. "The Balinese had the time for the arts; this was immensely attractive to people from the West," she said. 
But in recent years, a darker side has developed. 
So much land has been taken over for commercial use that Bali is no longer self-sufficient in rice. Ms. Pucci said she was worried that layoffs in the hotel industry in the wake of the disco bombing would force people back to their villages where they would probably face a shortage of food. "A lot of people are going to be hungry, for sure," she said.
Along with the hotels on the coast came boisterous establishments like the Sari Club, where scantily attired surfers, footballers and young women mixed in a heady atmosphere of music, sex and booze.
The club was the most popular among young foreign travelers. To the established expatriate community, it represented the worst of the West in Bali, synthetic carpet, flip-flops and T-shirts and all-night carousing. 
Until a recent court case, Ms. Shwaiko said, the club posted a sign saying only "foreign nationals" would be admitted. Later, the admission standard was changed to "invitation only," code for a policy that tried to exclude Balinese, she said.
At the other end of the tourism market, Bradley and Debbie Gardner, a couple who first came to Bali in the 1970's, built a hotel consisting of five villas on a hillside near Ubud.
One of the villas features its own indoor-outdoor swimming pool, and a three-room bathroom pavilion. There have been cancellations since the disco bombing, and the hotel has returned deposits, said Mr. Gardner.
"But this is early days," he said. "You look forward and you move forward. I think the Balinese will do the same. We chose Bali over other places in Asia because Bali is not just another coconut tree and sandy beach."

Upstate Voters Wait to Hear A Plan for Jobs

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
THE campaign for governor has not exactly riveted this city in central New York. Many of the people encountered during a visit here last week didn't even know that Syracuse was playing host to a campaign debate yesterday, nor did they evince much interest when told.
 But when asked what burdens them and their city, they showed no lack of energy, answering in choruslike agreement, from once-grand Salina Street downtown to Carousel Center, the mall a few minutes north. 
 "Oh my God, the jobs," said Fran DeRoberts, buying coffee at the mall's food court. "People are moving out right and left." Ms. DeRoberts, 66, is a native with three children, one of whom has moved to Tucson. 
People follow the jobs. That is the story of central and western New York, and as the public sees it, none of the candidates for governor are saying enough about it.
"They talk about it -- superficially," said Anna Giannantonio, a retired accountant, as she waited for a bus downtown. "And only when forced to."
Onondaga County just cut some programs and raised its property taxes by 4 percent after reducing them for six years running, citing higher Medicaid costs and other state mandates.
"Jobs Stuck in Neutral" read a headline on Friday in The Post-Standard here, above an article about 400 fewer people on payrolls in September than the year before. Unemployment is slightly lower than the statewide figure, but economists say that reflects a drop in the number of job-hunters. Nothing to boast about.
"We're not depressed, just not thriving," said Michael J. Wasylenko, professor of economics at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. "We are still creating jobs but also losing a lot of population. It's just going down steadily."
Other cities in central and western New York have it even worse. Census figures show that from 1990 to 1999, Syracuse (population 150,000) lost 9,300 people, or 1.2 percent; Binghamton lost 6 percent; and Utica and Rome, 7.5 percent.
"People keep losing jobs here, keep getting laid off," said Christopher Wiater, 49, a parking attendant at a Murbro parking lot downtown. Mr. Wiater, laid off from a plastics factory a year ago after more than 12 years, now earns half of what he did, and gets no benefits. "It's just a job, keeps me going," he explained.
MOST of the jobs that are being created are low paying, like those at Carousel Center, which plans to expand into the largest mall in the country -- DestiNY USA -- with help from federal and state tax incentives and property tax exemptions.
Fine, say Syracusans, but why doesn't government give equivalent resources to companies that can provide higher-paying jobs?
Jessica M. Lasda, a 20-year-old college junior and a native of Syracuse, is worried about her future. "To be paid equitably you have to move out or start your own business. I have roots here. Syracuse is depleting its own resources. Attempting to make it the largest mall in America is the wrong decision. I've worked here. It cannot sustain the business it gets now."
She's not sure how she will vote, and is not alone. Though ads and posters sell the candidacies of Gov. George E. Pataki, Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Tom Golisano, the campaign seems distant.
Mr. Pataki is still expected to win here, but Mr. Golisano, the businessman from Rochester who is financing his campaign, has made some inroads, and, counterintuitively, seems to be hurting Mr. McCall more than Mr. Pataki, who tried to push Mr. Golisano out of the campaign.
"It's a three-way race," said Assemblyman William B. Magnarelli, a Democrat from the area. "With things going the same old way, people want a change."
Jeffrey M. Stonecash, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School who has conducted polls for Republican candidates from upstate, has found that trend reflected in his polls. "Golisano is taking from Democats and independents, people who are disaffected."
Consider Louis Levine, a lawyer and a Democrat. "Pataki and McCall are downstaters and Golisano is an upstater, so I think he'll pay more attention to us," said Mr. Levine, 50.
People in his city care basically about three issues, in his opinion. "There's the economy, jobs, education. What else is there to talk about?"
During yesterday's debate, six candidates did talk about those issues when asked -- for at least 60 seconds at a stretch.

North Korea's Confession: Why?

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
When the United States announced last week that North Korean officials had acknowledged the existence of a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord, a simple question could be heard echoing around the world: What were the North Koreans thinking? 
 With a tightly controlled, highly secretive country that is home to the world's only Communist dynasty, the temptation of outsiders to write off North Korea's leaders as crackpot Machiavellis or scarily unpredictable weirdoes is sometimes irresistible. 
 Many close watchers of North Korean affairs, however, say that for all of the leadership's eccentricities, the decisions are seldom outright irrational. Experts who disagree on many other matters concerning North Korea say decision making in the country whose future holds the key to peace and stability in northeast Asia is driven by an impulse for survival amid ever constricting options. 
"A lot of people have interpreted the announcement by North Korea of its uranium enrichment program as a sudden tactical move, perhaps trying to take advantage of the fact that the United States is preoccupied with Iraq," said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. "But that's not the case at all. This was a case where Washington simply had the goods on them, and Pyongyang just didn't see any other way out." 
For years, North Korea has perfected a kind of bloodcurdling official polemics used by the national radio and newspapers to denounce the United States, South Korea and Japan, and to warn its enemies that they will suffer humiliating defeat if they dare attack.
In fact, North Korea experts say, the tone has grown harsher in almost direct proportion to the country's underlying insecurity. Since the early 1980's, when it was still at rough economic parity with its capitalist rival, South Korea, North Korea's situation has grown steadily more precarious.
The late 1980's opened an era of disasters, from the disappearance of the Soviet bloc, whose countries were North Korea's main economic partners, to a series of catastrophic famines brought on by crop failures, droughts and flooding.
Against this backdrop, the United States, the North's great historical enemy, has emerged as the world's sole superpower, and one increasingly willing to move against nations it sees as threats. In another nightmare come true, South Korea, meanwhile, has become vastly richer. 
Even China, long the ever dependable ally, has taken more distance from North Korea lately, as witnessed last month by Beijing's arrest of a Chinese investor who had just been handpicked by Pyongyang to oversee a newly announced capitalist enterprise zone.
Lacking in generous friends at a time when the economy is crumbling, the country's leader, Kim Jong Il, is facing a moment of unusual vulnerability. He has already introduced major reforms aimed at opening the economy, but he appears increasingly unable to resist pressures for more far-reaching changes. Among those changes, some experts say, may be the recent trend toward diplomacy by confession.
Faced with the urgent need to fend off economic collapse, Mr. Kim's confession of a uranium-based nuclear weapons program appears to many experts to have been a pragmatic, if ultimately misguided response to an insurmountable obstacle: a Bush Administration that had little interest in engagement.
Admission of the nuclear program rather than denial, appears to have been intended to "persuade the world that Kim Jong Il is a new kind of leader, and his leadership does not resort to terrorist means, or secrecy," said Han S. Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. 
Mr. Kim tried the same approach last month, when he was host for a meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. Faced with Japanese demands for an explanation of the disappearance of 11 of its citizens in the late 1970's, the North Korean leader bluntly reversed a long tradition of angry denial, and apologized for what he acknowledged were official kidnappings.
Initially, the admission seemed to propel North Korean-Japanese relations strongly forward, with widespread expectations of rapidly normalized ties and large-scale aid from Japan. As the sordid details of the kidnappings have sunk in here, though, Mr. Koizumi has been forced by sensitive public opinion to be far more cautious.
North Korea desperately needs better relations with the Japan and the United States because the former has long promised to provide heavy development assistance once relations are normalized, while the latter controls many of the international financial institutions, whose cooperation is indispensable to North Korea's re-entry into the global economy. 
Looking at his confessions, Mr. Kim appears to have focused on the issues most important to each of those two nations: the emotive question of the fate of its citizens for Japan, and weapons of mass destruction for the United States.
"North Korea has always wanted to pursue normalization with the United States, and however awkwardly, now they are bargaining," said Selig S. Harrison, director of the National Security Program at the Center for International Policy in Washington. "What they are saying is that they are prepared to negotiate an end to all nuclear activity and allow inspections, if we agree to two things: not to threaten them militarily and to pursue normalized relations." 
Mr. Harrison, who is the author of "Korean Endgame: A Strategy for Reunification and U.S. Disengagement," said Pyongyang's position was spelled out to him this week by the country's representative to the United Nations.
Whether or not North Korea seeks to negotiate with Washington along these lines, its acknowledgment of a nuclear weapons program has inflicted faster and far graver setbacks than the missing persons issue with Japan.
"This is not a crisis yet, but it may be the last stage before a crisis," Mr. Cha said. "This administration is not going to pay to go inspect another hole in the ground, and whatever happens, it is not going to be framed as an exchange, where everyone gives up something to obtain Pyongyang's cooperation."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN; 
Pledging to Focus on Lowering Property Taxes and Loosening Drug Laws

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from the debate yesterday among six of the candidates for governor, as recorded by The New York Times. The participants were Thomas K. Leighton, Marijuana Reform Party; Scott Jeffrey, Libertarian Party; George E. Pataki, Republican Party; H. Carl McCall, Democratic Party; Stanley Aronowitz, Green Party; and Tom Golisano, Independence Party. More excerpts are online at nytimes.com/nyregion.

Property Taxes

Q. . . . Property taxes in New York State are well above the national average of 1.5 percent of the value of a home. Many New Yorkers pay 3.5 to 4 percent of the value of their home in property tax. Do you think this is a problem? And if so, what can you do on the state level to lessen the property tax burden?

MR. JEFFREY -- Yes, it's a terrible problem. Taxes in our state are out of control. We have utility taxes on top of the property. People are paying for electricity, taxing on their telephones, on their cable. What we need to do, I spoke about at the last debate, was we need to end corporate welfare. We need to quit these giant tax breaks, giving giant tax breaks to giant corporations. When we talk about the empire zones in development, these projects aren't free. And they're funded on the backs of small businessmen and on the average taxpayer. And if these projects made economic sense developers would build. . . .

Q. Thank you, Mr. Jeffrey. Governor Pataki.

MR. PATAKI -- Yes, I remember very well, long before I got into politics, I lived in a close community with many of my family members. And I remember my aunt when she was maybe in her early 70's telling me she was going to sell her house. And she lived right next to my parents where I had grown up. And I asked her why. And she said, "I simply can't afford the school property taxes. I have to sell." So I know that it's painful when someone is forced out of their home. And we have put in place a number of programs and are going to do more to deal with this issue. The most important is the STAR program. It is the single greatest effort to help local property owners that this state has ever put in place. And right now it is saving senior citizens from school taxes to the tune of about $2.8 billion a year. All homeowners, here in Onondaga County and across this state, benefit from the STAR program. . . . We have to continue to have state budgets that reduce the burden on local governments. And we have to look to reorganize local governments. And we're putting in place a task force . . . to do that.

Q. . . . Comptroller McCall, your answer to the same question.

MR. McCALL -- Property taxes are really a terrible burden on people throughout this state. We have the highest property taxes in the country, 72 percent above the national average. George Pataki will talk about cutting state taxes, but what he's really done is he's shifted the burden from the state to the localities. Every locality, every county executive is now announcing his budget. And all of those budgets are increasing property taxes on property owners across the state. What the governor has done is passed on to our localities unfunded mandates.
If we want the counties to engage in new activity, then we at the state level are going to have to pay for it. . . . 

Q. Stanley Aronowitz.

MR. ARONOWITZ -- Well, the first thing we have to say is that we need education. And we need health care. And we need environmental protection. And we have to have a way to pay for it. And we can't pay for it by property taxes primarily because property taxes are the most unfair, sales taxes are the next unfair form of taxation. If the state is going to take responsibility for the mandates to, for example, make sure that poor people have Medicaid, you can't cut Medicaid as Mr. Golisano would do. Because if you cut Medicaid, what you're doing is you're hurting people. Now the basic problem that we have is that we have to have a tax program that taxes those who can best afford to pay fairly.
Property taxes are a regressive tax. But incomes taxes are relatively speaking a progressive tax. And I have a tax plan that could help solve those problems. . . .

Q. . . . Mr. Golisano . . .

MR. GOLISANO -- The issue of property taxes obviously is a very important question to New Yorkers. It's almost to the point now where our tax payments are almost larger than our mortgage payments. And that is a situation that we cannot tolerate. Let me tell you this story as a business person. About three months ago, I transferred a senior executive from Atlanta, Ga., to Paychex in Rochester, N.Y. The gentleman bought a house, approximately the same market value, approximately the same square footage. He found out his property taxes in Atlanta, Ga., were $5,000 and are going to $15,000 in New York State. He walked into my office and he said, "Tom, as a business person, what are you going to do about it?" The fact of the matter is, as a business person we have to pay our people higher in New York State just so they can pay their tax burden.

Q. . . . Mr. Leighton.

MR. LEIGHTON -- Well, I think the first thing we have to do is change the way we fund public education in New York. I propose that we shift funding for public education away from property taxes into a combination of sales and income taxes and general revenues. And that way everybody will pay their fair share of costs of public education and all schools will get the same.
Now we all know that nobody wants to pay more taxes. But there is one group who does want to pay more taxes. And I represent today probably one million New Yorkers who are . . . eager and ready to pay more taxes. . . . I know that New Yorkers who smoke marijuana would much rather pay taxes to this state via a regulated market for marijuana rather than buy their marijuana from a black market dealer or face a risk of arrest. And this represents millions of dollars of tax revenue. . . .

Budget

Q. . . . What steps do you plan to take to address the projected deficits? And why haven't more steps been taken before the election to cut costs?

MR. McCALL -- Well first of all, the people who've been in charge haven't done that. Instead what we've seen over the last few years, a year of great surplus, in fact, is that the governor spent money three times the rate of inflation, increased the state's debt by some 35 percent and made no effort to reduce the debt. . . .
We have to have better management of our fiscal affairs. When I become governor, I'm going to inherit a mess. But I'm going to go in with a professional group of people and we're going to analyze the situation and we're going to take whatever steps are necessary to turn this economy around. 
You know, one of the problems we have here is that this is a nice opportunity for us to come and have a minute to talk about the important issues that face the state, but this issue of the budget and how we're going to face the crisis that comes ahead, we need to have a real debate. And I've challenged the governor to sit down with me and let's have a real debate and talk about the issue, about how we're going to face the challenge of the future. We're not going to be able to do it in these one-minute sound bites. . . .

Q. . . . Mr. Aronowitz.

MR. ARONOWITZ -- Well, Mr. McCall, when I took up your challenge to have a real debate with you, you withdrew your offer. You said that I had debated you, but that debate was about housing. So I'm not so sure that you really want to debate with everybody at this table. You may want to debate with Pataki, but you don't want a real debate with anybody else.

MR. McCALL -- You're right.

MR. ARONOWITZ -- Well, Carl, that asks the question, either you meant it or you didn't mean it last time.
Anyway, I think our major problems about budget is that nobody is talking seriously about what to do about the budget. We still say when we want to create jobs that we're going to create corporate welfare, we're going to give corporations money. Mr. Golisano takes $600,000 in his corporation to accept money to keep jobs. 
We really should not be paying the large corporations anything. We should be dealing with the tax issue in a very concentrated way, a way that will allow us to face the music. Either we're going to have public goods or we're going to have nothing. And we're going to have layoffs and libraries will shut down and state workers will shut down. And I'm opposed to that, so I'm for a real tax program.

Q. . . . And your response, Mr. Golisano.

MR. GOLISANO -- Well, first of all, I think it's great that Paychex has created thousands of jobs in this state. We're very proud of it. We're one of the leading edge companies in upstate New York. And I think the governor and all the other candidates should be very proud of what Paychex has accomplished. Secondly, I agree with Carl McCall, trying to discuss these budget issues in a 60-second soundbite is not possible. We know the budget has gone up 45 percent under Mr. Pataki. We know we're the highest in debt population in the country, 18 straight years. . . .
Mr. Pataki has been talking about leadership. I want to bring up another subject as long as I have a few minutes. There is a scandal in our state where we sold paroles for campaign contributions. The U.S. attorney called it the worst campaign scandal in generations. A parole board chairman was an unindicted co-conspirator in these sales. And he's still on the job. My question to the governor is why is this person still on the job running the New York State Parole Board after this indecent scandal?

Q. . . . To try to refocus the issue, Mr. Leighton, we're talking about the budget deficit, the projected deficit and what you'd do about it.

MR. LEIGHTON -- Well, I already addressed this issue in the first question when I talked about new hemp industry, new revenues and paying taxes on the sale of marijuana. . . . Recently, Mr. Golisano has been running campaign commercials about medical marijuana. Now I welcome his support on this issue. But I wonder why now, three weeks before the election, he is choosing to do so. Mr. Golisano has been a candidate for eight years and we've heard nothing about medical marijuana. Why is he doing this now? The answer is very simple. It's an act of political desperation. And he's using the suffering of sick and dying people to his own political advantage. . . . The only way to get the State Legislature to pass a medical marijuana bill is by creating the Marijuana Reform Party for the next four years. And that can only be done by voting for the leaf on Nov. 5. . . .

Q. Again, the question involves the budget deficit, the projected budget deficit and ways to close it. And Mr. Jeffrey, we go to you for an answer.

MR. JEFFREY -- Thank you. . . . I would like to address the budget deficit. My first suggestion would be to Joseph Bruno, perhaps we don't need a new sports stadium in your own name. So we could start with that to cut our state budget. Libertarians are very strong supporters of capitalism, but we are equally loud in our opposition to corporate abuse. I've talked about corporate welfare. There's also eminent domain abuse. And that's where the government steps in and confiscates property from one private owner. And rather than building a public work project like a railroad, now they're turning it over to large corporations. In New York City, we're out today protesting The New York Times, who is confiscating 11 buildings, shutting down 30 businesses or displacing them. And we're out there being vocal, bringing up this issue that you won't see covered in the media. . . .

Q. . . . Governor Pataki, is the deficit going to be that big?

MR. PATAKI -- . . . The question is the budget, and I'm glad that's what we're talking about. Unfortunately, one candidate talked, used his time to debate debates and the other to talk about parole instead of addressing this issue. I've had the leadership and been through budget deficits in the past. In 1995, we had a $5 billion deficit. And there was no reason, no national recession or attacks of Sept. 11. And we dealt with it by closing the gap and cutting taxes. Since 1995, we've set aside record surpluses, multiple billions in surpluses. And we've kept spending below not only what other states have done, but the lowest of five states in America. What we're going to do going forward is continue to make our government operate more efficiently. We've done it in the past working with the public employee unions. And we will continue to do that. We're going to restructure the state's debt, taking advantage of the fact we have the highest credit rating in a generation. And we have the lowest interest rates in a long time. We're going to use some of those surpluses we set aside. And I can tell you that Standard & Poor's just in September said no state is better prepared to deal with the financial difficulties going forward than the State of New York. . . .

Drug Laws

Q. . . . What are your specific plans . . . to make the criminal justice system work more effectively by repealing or changing what is considered to be the Rockefeller drug law?

MR. LEIGHTON -- Well, obviously what we do need to do is repeal these laws outright. . . . And that's why I favor people voting for the leaf on Nov. 5 and forming the Marijuana Reform Party to work on this the next four years.
. . . But I'd like to take the time today to ask the governor and Comptroller McCall, as a titular head of their party, is why can we finally not put politics aside and just get together on this issue? The people who are suffering under this issue are 94 percent black and Hispanic. They come from New York City. And these laws are ruining lives and destroying the future. . . .

Q. . . . Mr. Jeffrey on to you.

MR. JEFFREY -- Well, besides the Rockefeller drug laws, which people are very aware of, in New York City we have 60,000 marijuana arrests every year. And that's too many good New Yorkers going to jail. And they'll spend up to three days in jail just waiting to see a judge to be processed. Now also what we need to do is change the entire dynamic of the drug culture. We need to address the problem of hard drug use. Now I believe marijuana is a steppingstone by being illegal. I think pot smokers are introduced to drug dealers who can try to sell them something else. Pot smokers grow accustomed to breaking the law. And the fact that cocaine is illegal no longer serves as a deterrent. So I believe that if we really want to fight the drugs that are truly destroying both individual lives and entire communities, we need to be honest, get real and legalize marijuana.

Q. . . . Governor.

MR. PATAKI -- I think it's important that we reform the Rockefeller drug laws, but not repeal them. If we were to repeal them right now, there are 5,000 people in prison, convicted of violent felonies as well as drug felonies, who would be eligible to get out on the street. And our streets are the safest they've been in a generation. . . . But having said that, we also know that intensive treatment is far better than incarcerating someone who has made a mistake and used drugs or been involved in drugs in a low level manner. And that's why I've advanced reforms that would allow those, including those who have been convicted of drug felonies, to have a second chance with intensive treatment. . . . And I will continue to work to reform the Rockefeller drug laws to allow those who have made a mistake to have a second chance, but to keep those who are violent away from us and behind bars to protect us.

Q. . . . Comptroller McCall.

MR. McCALL -- Mr. Leighton, the reason it hasn't been done is because of leadership. The governor has made promises. He says he's committed to changing these harsh, discriminatory laws. But he's had eight years to do it and he hasn't done that. Last year, the Assembly passed a bill that substantially changed the laws. For instance, they repealed the mandatory minimum sentences. And I support that. We have to give judges the discretion to decide whether people should be incarcerated. And some people should be incarcerated, but others can be rehabilitated. And we've got to do that. . . .

Q. . . . Mr. Aronowitz.

MR. ARONOWITZ -- . . . The Green Party on Row G is for repeal of the Rockefeller drug laws and the decriminalization of drugs. Mr. Pataki has conflated violence with drug use. I think that's a fudge that needs to be eliminated.
The fact of the matter is that violent criminals should be incarcerated. But drug users should not be incarcerated. Treatment programs are absolutely necessary if we make this a public health issue. We could also save $2.5 billion or a good part of $2.5 billion a year, maybe $100 billion, on the people who would not be sent to jail and who we have to support. And we could take that, excuse me, I'm sorry, $1.1 billion a year, and we'd be able to use that for education, for environment and other uses.

Q. . . . We move on to Mr. Golisano with the same question.

MR. GOLISANO -- You're correct. The Rockefeller drug laws either need to be repealed or reformed. We haven't had the leadership in our state to get it done. The laws are too harsh. The judges should be making these decisions and not the politicians. At least when they have a defendant in front of them, they can look at their character and their personal background and not have to give a sentence that's defined by a politician. . . .

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
A Thoroughbred of a Track to Stage the Breeders' Cup

BYLINE:  By BILL FINLEY

 BODY:
After 75 years, any racetrack would have to have some stories, tales of the memorable and the forgettable, from terrific to terrible. It's just that Arlington Park has had more than most.
 Actually, a lot more. There has been a fire, a scandal, a two-year shutdown. The track goes down, but it never fails to come back. There are a lot of reasons to like Arlington, an elegant racetrack a few miles northwest of Chicago, but there is one quality a bit more remarkable than the rest. This is the track that just won't give up without a fight. 
 Never will that be more evident than Saturday, when Arlington plays host to the Breeders' Cup. Seventeen years ago the track was engulfed in flames. Three years ago it was closed, its owner tired of losing millions and fighting a state government that didn't share his concerns for the sport's problems. Today it is the shining jewel of Illinois racing and about to experience its most important day since its opening in 1927.
"There's no doubt this will be Arlington's finest moment," said Bill Thayer, a senior vice president who has been at Arlington for 30 years. "All the best horses in the world are coming here. We've had some great races here before, but they generally have involved one horse. The Breeders' Cup is the greatest event you can have. It goes to show that this track has had a lot of challenges and we have met them all and we have come out of them all."
Arlington opened in the fall of 1927. It has gone through several ownership changes, some of them involving roguish characters and a chief executive who was once called upon to testify in the bribery trial of an Illinois governor. But the history of the modern Arlington begins in 1983, when an area businessman, Richard L. Duchossois, bought the track from the Madison Square Garden Corporation.
He served as a tank commander under Gen. George S. Patton Jr. in World War II, and after nearly 60 years still likes to battle in the trenches. Duchossois is demanding, hard-headed and driven, but is universally respected for his unwavering dedication to his sport and his track and his refusal to give up easily, if at all.
"There have been challenges here, sure," he said. "You don't stop to think about it. You've been given a job and you do it. It's a challenge to get things done."
If the Breeders' Cup will be the highest point in Arlington's history, the date of July 31, 1985, is surely the lowest.
The trainer Jere Smith Sr. was at his barn that morning, never expecting that this day would be any different from any other on the backstretch. Instead, it became a day no one associated with Arlington will ever forget. It has been described as one of the most spectacular fires anyone has ever seen.
"Once that thing caught on fire, it just went down," Smith said. "When those flames started shooting up in the air like they did, I thought it was all over."
It probably should have been. The cost of rebuilding Arlington would be astronomical, the area had two other thoroughbred tracks in Hawthorne and Sportsman's Park, and racing was at the beginning stages of a slump that has yet to go away. No one knew what Duchossois would do, but those who knew him well knew the track would be back -- new, different and no doubt better.
The first challenge was to run the Arlington Million, the track's signature race, and fulfill a commitment to NBC and the sponsor, Budweiser. The Million was to be run just 23 days after the fire, and few thought it could be done. With work crews putting in 21 hours a day, what was left of the charred stands was removed, the rubble was hauled away and what has become known as the Miracle Million was run before 35,000 fans huddled in tents or simply standing in the wide expanse in front of where a towering grandstand and clubhouse used to be.
Duchossois considers the Miracle Million among his greatest accomplishments in business, but he was only warming up. Instead of building a racetrack, he erected the sport's version of Shangri-La, a facility that opened in 1989 and reportedly cost $200 million. To this day it sparkles and shines like a freshly minted penny.
"I've been all over the world and there's not another racetrack out there as nice as this one," Smith said. But $200 million racetracks need a lot of customers, and Duchossois's timing was not good. He built a track for a different era, not one in which horseplayers, the ones who haven't been converted to casino or lottery players, are far more likely to bet over the phone or at their nearby OTB shop than at a racetrack.
By 1998, Duchossois had had enough. He pleaded with the Illinois legislature and the governor at the time, Jim Edgar, for some legislative relief, but got nowhere. With the intention of sending a message, he did not open Arlington for the 1998 or 1999 racing seasons.
"When Arlington has closed, racing in this area hasn't looked very bright," the trainer Wayne Catalano said. "The people who run the other tracks here do a great job, but it's just not the same there. Arlington is a special place. It got tough around here."
Duchossois never intended to close the track for good. He just wanted to shake up the politicians and show them that a vibrant racetrack was important to the state's economy. It worked. New laws that included tax breaks and revenue from nearby riverboat casinos were passed, and Arlington reopened for the 2000 season. A few months later, Arlington merged with Churchill Downs to take advantage of that company's fiscal might and network of racetracks.
Arlington isn't going anywhere, but track executives long for something better. Its purse structure places it well behind those at the top tracks in New York, Kentucky and California, so it cannot offer top-quality racing. And it is surrounded by riverboat casinos or Indian casinos in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Missouri. They have drained millions from Chicago racing. Elsewhere, racing has solved these problems by adding slot machines to the wagering menu. Arlington officials would like them, but nothing is imminent.
But no one will be worrying about slot machines come Saturday. It will be an occasion for celebration, appreciation of the Breeders' Cup and Arlington's latest revival.
"Three years ago," Duchossois said, "we were standing still. In a couple of days, we'll be hosting the Super Bowl. That makes me feel proud."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE SECOND DEBATE; 
In 2nd Debate, Pataki's Rivals Go on Attack

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's opponents battered him today in a televised debate with charges of cronyism, corruption and mismanagement, with Tom Golisano repeatedly accusing the governor's administration of selling paroles for campaign contributions.
 Mr. Pataki did not respond to the charges during the debate, but later his campaign vigorously disputed Mr. Golisano's allegations, calling them "despicable lies." 
 The second of two debates Mr. Pataki agreed to participate in proved to be a far more raucous affair than the first, a week ago, with the candidates ganging up on the governor and making pointed accusations in a way they had mostly refrained from doing earlier. The most persistent attacks came from Mr. Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, and H. Carl McCall, the Democrat, but even the minor-party candidates joined the fray. 
The governor largely held his own, and he was more specific about issues, policies and proposals than he has been through this campaign, talking about plans to lower county property taxes, defending investments in high-tech projects and explaining his proposal to ease the Rockefeller drug laws. Mr. Pataki had been criticized for avoiding such substance through the campaign and during the first debate, when he answered nearly every question by saying that he was proud of his record.
But five times during the hourlong debate, which was broadcast on WCBS-TV in the New York City area, Mr. Golisano turned questions on other subjects to the investigation that sent three State Parole Board officials and a Pataki fund-raiser to prison -- though, ultimately, they were not convicted of trading paroles for contributions.
"There is a scandal in our state where we sold paroles for campaign contributions," Mr. Golisano said here at the studios of WTVH-TV. "A parole board chairman was an unindicted co-conspirator in these sales. And he's still on the job." 
The governor at first ignored the charges, then responded tautly, "Three times now, Mr. Golisano has raised a question in the form of a negative personal attack." 
But he never responded directly to the charges, not even to rebut them, and he never addressed the continued presence on the parole board of its chairman, Brion D. Travis.
Of the charges, he said, "Of course they're untrue." When asked why he had not said so in the debate, he said, "I thought I did." 
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's chief spokesman, said, "He thought he said it, and I think his intention was to say it." It was a rare misstep in a campaign whose discipline has often stood in striking contrast to the opposing campaigns.
Mr. Golisano, a billionaire businessman who is setting campaign spending records, also released a new television advertisement today attacking the governor over the parole issue, bringing a much harsher tone to the race 16 days before Election Day.
After the debate, Mr. McKeon and one of Mr. Golisano's consultants, Erick Mullen, engaged in an impromptu debate of their own in the television station's lobby about the accuracy of Mr. Golisano's allegations, surrounded by a clutch of reporters. 
The argument quickly devolved into an obscenity-laced shouting match, with the two men calling each other liars. When the confrontation grew especially heated, a police officer stepped in. 
Mr. Golisano was not the only one to cry scandal.
Early in the debate, Mr. McCall said, "Governor Pataki's approach to economic development is to provide contracts to relatives." That was an apparent reference to an architect who is a friend and neighbor of the governor's, and also a distant relative by marriage, who was awarded five contracts worth more than $200,000, and was tentatively awarded another, worth more than $1 million, from the State University of New York, after university officials manipulated the contract process. Two top SUNY officials were later dismissed. 
Mr. McCall also referred to recent news reports that Rikers Island correction officers say a high-ranking official there forced them to do work for the Pataki campaign, while the campaign was paying the official more than $200,000 over a period of a few months. The governor did not respond to those barbs, either, during or after the debate. Pataki aides have been insisting that Mr. McCall, whose campaign is short of money, is increasingly irrelevant, and that the contest is now between the governor and Mr. Golisano.
A New York Times poll conducted last week showed that when undecided voters were pressed to state a preference, Mr. Pataki had the support of 42 percent of likely voters, to 31 percent for Mr. McCall and 18 percent for Mr. Golisano. The poll shows Mr. McCall and Mr. Golisano virtually even in the areas outside of New York City, though Mr. McCall is ahead in the city.
Also participating in today's debate were Stanley Aronowitz, the Green Party candidate; Thomas K. Leighton of the Marijuana Reform Party and Scott Jeffrey, the Libertarian Party nominee. Gerard J. Cronin, the Right to Life candidate, did not attend because of illness. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has withdrawn from the race, remains on the Nov. 5 ballot as the Liberal Party candidate.
The exchange of allegations obscured a forum that centered on economic issues like job creation and New York's high property taxes, and featured Mr. Pataki's most extensive defense of his record that he has offered during this campaign.
His challengers blamed double-digit increases in local property taxes on the governor, saying that increased state mandates on local governments were to blame. Mr. Pataki cited the creation of 600,000 new jobs during his tenure, talked proudly of the STAR program that he said has cut property tax bills by $2.8 billion a year, noted that he had appointed a commission to look into consolidating the overlapping layers of local government to save money, and insisted that on balance, he had reduced local mandates.
"We have an aggressive agenda to build on the success we've had," he said. He cited the state's Empire Zones, which attract businesses through tax breaks; the "Centers of Excellence" program he began to invest in various scientific fields at SUNY campuses, and reduced business regulation. "These are all new programs that we're putting in place that are going to allow us to continue to grow in New York State."
The idea that economic development is working may be a hard sell upstate, an issue the challengers seized on. "The way to find out whether there have been new jobs created is to talk to the people of upstate New York," Mr. McCall said during the debate. "They'll tell you about the fact that during Governor Pataki's tenure their young people have left. They're leaving New York because there are no jobs, there are no opportunities."
The parole scandal centered on Yung Soo Yoo, a Korean-born New Jersey businessman who gave $15,000 to Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and raised money from others for Mr. Pataki and his one-time political mentor, former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Yoo told Korean-Americans whose children were in state prisons that paroles could be arranged if they gave to Mr. Pataki's campaign. The Pataki camp stressed that Mr. Yoo had no official role in the campaign, and that they returned his contributions when questions about his conduct surfaced.
Two parole board members, Sean McSherry and Leo S. Levy, and Ronald Hotaling, executive secretary of the board, were convicted of lying to investigators. Mr. Yoo was convicted in 2000 of obstruction of justice for covering up his actions, but a jury deadlocked on the question of whether he had promised paroles in return for contributions.
Prosecutors suggested that the guilt extended farther and called Mr. Travis, the Parole Board chairman, an unindicted co-conspirator. Responding to Mr. Golisano's statement that Mr. Travis should have been removed, Mr. McKeon, the governor's spokesman, said Mr. Travis was never accused of a crime.
During Mr. Yoo's trial two years ago, prosecutors claimed that Patrick Donohue, the former finance director of Mr. Pataki's campaign, knew that Mr. Yoo was promising paroles to contributors. In a blistering cross-examination, Mr. Donohue, who was also never charged with a crime, denied such knowledge.
Mr. Hotaling testified that Mr. Pataki's office had pressured the parole board to release one of the Korean-American youths, a claim the governor's office denied.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: More Restaurants Open, Despite Economy 

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 Despite the city's weak economy, almost twice as many restaurants opened in the past year as closed, according to the 2003 Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey published today. 
The survey said 186 restaurants opened and 104 restaurants closed, but the gap between openings and closings was the narrowest since the recession of the early 1990's. Of the shuttered restaurants, 15 were below Houston Street. "There's definitely been a bigger loss of business downtown, " said Tim Zagat, above, a co-publisher of the survey. The Zagat survey also found that people were returning more often to the same restaurant, which may make it harder for new restaurants to attract customers. Terry Pristin (NYT)

HEADLINE: The Bloomberg Way 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg seems not to care that he can be a lightning rod for frustration. He matter-of-factly talks about the fiscal pain to come for New York City, offering no sugar coating. That, as New York is learning, is the Bloomberg way. 
 The mayor has been warning in recent days that property taxes may rise, transit fares may increase, tolls may be imposed for East River bridges, and city services -- perhaps even fire and police departments -- may be hit hard with cuts, all aimed at closing an expected budget gap of some $5 billion. It's bad news and he gives it to the city less like a politician and more like a pathologist. 
 He is also clearly unmoved by hecklers who do not like his proposed ban on smoking in restaurants and bars. It was with similar single-mindedness that he decided to invite actors from "The Sopranos" to the Columbus Day parade, causing a rumble with Italian-American leaders that might have been avoided if he had consulted with them.
New Yorkers, despite their fractiousness, do like a mayor with moxie, and now is a very good time to have someone in city hall who doesn't mind delivering unpleasant truths. Knowing how to take the heat is practically a mayoral job description, and Mr. Bloomberg has filled the bill. But all that decisiveness can verge on insensitivity. He hurts feelings and starts fights that aren't necessary, like the current war between the mayor's office and the public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum. 
While it appears that the honeymoon is over, Mr. Bloomberg didn't become mayor to spend his time publicly canoodling with anyone. His supporters point out -- at least once a day -- that he comes without the strings of special interests, having personally financed his own campaign. Still, Mr. Bloomberg must not appear aloof as he charges full speed ahead with his agenda.
City workers, who will certainly be asked for givebacks, may do so more willingly if they know the mayor understands the problems of working people caught in a slumping economy. Likewise, homeowners and commuters may more easily digest a tax offered with regret and as a last resort. That's not political pandering. It's a mark of leadership.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Democrats Court the Elderly

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

 BODY:
 This 30-second commercial, titled "Starting Over," is one of four being broadcast beginning this week by the Democratic Party in states where President Bush is campaigning for local candidates. It will first appear on Tuesday in Bangor, Me., and Chester County, Pa. Party officials said they would spend several hundred thousand dollars on the commercial, but they would not specify the amount.

PRODUCER -- Penczner, Burton

ON THE SCREEN -- It is the 1950's. A young, eager junior executive getting ready for his first day of work is knotting his tie while sitting on his bed and talking to his wife in the background. As the ad progresses, the couple is morphed to the present and the executive, now in his 70's, is no longer eager. Instead, he appears apprehensive about being forced to begin a new job. The ad concludes with the caption: "Vote Democratic. A strong America should be strong for all of us."

THE SCRIPT -- Young wife: "So, first day of the new job. Ready for the big adventure?"

Husband, speaking with enthusiasm: "Ready as I'll ever be."

Narrator: "In the last two years, over two million Americans have lost their jobs. And hundreds of thousands of seniors are again looking for work."

Wife is transformed into the present and is now 70 years old: "So, first day of the new job. Ready for the big adventure?"

Husband, speaking apprehensively: "Ready as I'll ever be."

Narrator: "For eight years, Democrats led America to the strongest economy in history. In two, Republicans have brought us the weakest economy in a generation."

ACCURACY -- The economic numbers cited in the ad are accurate, although establishing the causal link between those numbers and the role played by Democrats and Republicans in the ups and downs of the economic cycle is debatable. The economy did expand to unparalleled levels in the 1990's. Unemployment dropped to historically low levels, large numbers of people moved off welfare and the stock market reached new heights. The stock market peaked in March 2000, and the economy began to show signs of slowing later that year. Since then, the markets have sunk and unemployment has risen and the economy has undergone a recession. Sharply eroding retirement savings has forced many older voters to come out of retirement or postpone it.

SCORECARD -- Democrats are hoping to turn the election into a referendum on the administration's handling of the economy. So far, they have gained little traction as the White House has kept the focus on foreign policy.

But as President Bush hits the hustings in a final push before the midterm elections, Democratic strategists are hoping to refocus the campaign and pin all of the economic problems and corporate scandals on Republicans. Republicans have countered that the plight of the economy is a natural consequence of the business cycle. Their strategists have calculated that most long-term investors will not take out economic woes on Republicans because, they say, such voters believe that the economy and the markets will ultimately rebound and are generally beyond the control of a president or Congress.

HEADLINE: Jolted by North Korea, Japan Grows Angrier 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
American envoys working to forge a united front against North Korea are finding their most receptive ally in Japan, where revelations of kidnappings and spying by North Korea have already hardened opinion against it. 
 James A. Kelly, an assistant secretary of state, started talks here tonight with Japanese officials on what to do about North Korea's latest admission -- that it has restarted its nuclear weapons program -- as Japanese newspapers and politicians called for a tough stance. 
 "It is outrageous that North Korea would have nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction when its people are starving," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said while campaigning over the weekend for his party's candidate in a by-election. "It should ensure good living standards for its people." 
His predecessor, former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, said of North Korea in another campaign speech, "There is a very dangerous country in the neighborhood that has conducted savage acts such as abductions and is aiming its nuclear missiles right at Japan." 
Mr. Kelly came here after meetings in Beijing and Seoul, where the public concern of political leaders was muted. Separately, John R. Bolton, under secretary for arms control and international security, is visiting Moscow, Paris and London, pushing for a common strategy to block North Korea's bid to become a nuclear power. 
"Close consultation" with the United States was promised this evening by Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, after meeting here with Mr. Kelly. Japanese and North Korean negotiators are to meet on Oct. 29 in Malaysia for what were originally billed as two days of talks to pave the way for establishing diplomatic relations.
Shinzo Abe, Mr. Fukuda's deputy, denounced reports of North Korea's secret bomb-making program as "a violation of North Korea's promise with Japan, the United States and South Korea."
Referring to the planned talks, he vowed, "We will seek to address this issue on the negotiating table."
The Yomiuri Shimbun, a conservative newspaper, reported Saturday that Japan was considering freezing its contribution to financing construction of two light-water reactors in North Korea. Similarly, the Bush administration has decided to scrap a 1994 arms control accord with North Korea, a move that would mean the end of annual shipments by the United States to North Korea of 500,000 tons of fuel oil as well as the likely suspension of the reactor project.
In Japan, hostility toward North Korea now cuts across party lines.
Mr. Koizumi traveled to North Korea last month, "overlooking the danger and only believing in resumption of normalization talks," charged Yukio Hatoyama, president of the largest opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan.
Hirohisa Fujii, secretary of the Liberal Party, criticized the joint declaration signed in North Korea last month by Mr. Koizumi and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il.
"The declaration only specifies economic assistance and avoids other issues," Mr. Fujii, a conservative, said on television today. "If we enter into negotiations by leaving it as is, the abduction and nuclear development issues could be left buried."
The Asahi Shimbun, a liberal newspaper, warned in an editorial about the bomb program, "North Korea must scrap the program at once and open it up to inspections." 
Fueling the general hostility has been a weeklong drama, played out in daily installments, of the return of five Japanese kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970's. 
On Thursday, Hitomi Soga, one of the returnees, received her high school diploma, a quarter century late. The next day she burned incense at a Shinto shrine where years ago her name had been inscribed on a family monument, along with the names of dead relatives. 
Over the weekend, all five returnees received Japanese passports. One couple is choosing Japanese names for their children and plans to go to their hometown town hall to register their marriage, which took place in North Korea. Many of the kidnap victims' children do not know that their parents were born in Japan, according to news reports. 
With the real number of Japanese kidnapped by North Korea believed to be about 50, the issue has become so pressing in Japan that Empress Michiko touched on it in a written interview released today in honor of her 68th birthday. 
"I felt both surprise and sadness, as well as mortification as partial facts concerning the series of abductions of Japanese nationals were being reported," she wrote, responding to reporters' questions. Alluding to the fact that North Korea has produced only five survivors, she added that her "thoughts are on the families of those who were not able to return this time."

HEADLINE: Protesters Fault Mayor in Fire That Killed Six in Baltimore 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
About 400 people gathered today at the charred row house where Angela Dawson and her family lived to protest what they called the city's neglect of the neighborhood.
 Ms. Dawson, 36, died Wednesday morning with five of her children in a fire the authorities say was set in retaliation for her crusade against drug dealing. 
 Today, residents and ministers rallied in front of her house and criticized Mayor Martin O'Malley and his administration. The ministers accused Mr. O'Malley of refusing to respond to requests for meetings in the last three days to devise a strategy to fight drug-related violence.
They said the mayor's administration had also ignored pleas to increase police patrols and take other steps to revitalize the neighborhood, where boarded-up houses pockmark most blocks and violent drug dealers take over corners at night.
"The community is here; where is the mayor?" asked the Rev. Calvin Keene, pastor of Memorial Baptist Church. "Mayor O'Malley, we're looking for you. Where's O'Malley?" 
Taking his cue, the crowd, carrying white signs with "Thou Shalt Not Kill" written on them in red letters, began chanting, "Where's O'Malley?"
Rally organizers from Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development, a citywide group of about 50 religious congregations known by its acronym, Build, contended that low-income neighborhoods had suffered for years because they were a low priority at City Hall.
Gerry Shields, a spokesman for Mr. O'Malley, accused Build's leaders of politicizing the deaths to get back at the mayor for not providing more money for the organization's after-school programs.
"They have been no fan of the mayor's, and to use this horrendous incident as an opportunity to criticize the mayor is unbelievable," Mr. Shields said.
The mayor's top priority is fighting drug-related violence, Mr. Shields said, adding that more aggressive law enforcement has contributed to significant declines in violent crime in the last two years.
Mr. O'Malley, who is to attend a vigil at the Dawsons' home on Monday, will elaborate this week on further plans to combat drugs and violence, Mr. Shields said.
The police said that Darrell L. Brooks, 21, who was accused of starting the fire, was angry that Mrs. Dawson had confronted drug dealers and reported them to the police. Mr. Brooks is being held without bond on six counts of first-degree murder, arson and many related charges.
The police said Mr. Brooks kicked in the door of the Dawsons' house after 2 a.m. on Wednesday, poured gasoline and ignited the fire, which also critically injured Mrs. Dawson's husband, Carnell Dawson Sr., 43.
At today's rally, the ministers also called for a commitment from the mayor to strengthen schools, housing and health care in the neighborhood and to help provide more drug treatment, recreation and economic development.
"There's definitely a double standard, and this neighborhood is the home of many who are second-class citizens," said the Rev. Curtis Jones, a co-chairman of Build and pastor of a nearby Presbyterian church.
Many also questioned why the police did not protect Ms. Dawson's home after drug dealers had repeatedly threatened her and after the house was firebombed on Oct. 3. City officials have said they offered to move the family or provide more police protection, but that the Dawsons refused.
"Protection should have been automatic," Mr. Jones said.

HEADLINE: A Chat With Sharon 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After his visit with President Bush and Congressional leaders, Israel's Ariel Sharon returned to his farm, surveyed his cattle and sheep, and as the Sabbath sun set, took my call.
 If war starts, did you promise Bush that Israel would not be provoked by Saddam into responding to his missile attack, thereby troubling whatever Arabs may want to cooperate in his overthrow? 
 "Israel is not interested in being involved in a campaign against Iraq," the prime minister replies, having been assured that U.S. forces would first seek to neutralize Iraq's capability to attack Israel. "We'll support America's decision and will show sensitivity to U.S. needs by exercising maximum restraint. At the same time, if our citizens are attacked seriously -- by a weapon of mass destruction, chemical, biological or by some mega-terror act -- and suffer casualties, then Israel will respond." 
Has he promised to consult Bush before doing anything drastic? 
"Consult? We have a regular dialogue. Israel and America are consulting now as never before in the past." 
Sharon notes an unremarked danger: "The Syrians, together with the Iranians, are playing a double game, escalating tension on our northern border. Assad's son is completely under the influence of Hezbollah, helping them more than his father ever thought about, integrating the terrorists into Syria's front-line forces. And the Iranians have supplied those terrorists with 9,000 to 10,000 rockets, maybe including a new one with a 200-mile range. If war comes, we see what Syria-Iran-Hezbollah are preparing: they'll be surrogates for Saddam, opening a second front to help him." 
In that regard, Sharon persuaded Russia's Vladimir Putin not to sell Syria shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. Putin wants our old Jackson-Vanik amendment dropped, and Sharon says "we support that it should be bent already."
Syrian-occupied Lebanon has begun diverting precious water from one of the sources of the Jordan River: "That blatant violation of law does damage to a strategic resource, and is a matter of life and death to us. 
"The Six-Day War in 1967 really started in 1964 when Arabs started to divert the sources of the Jordan. We accepted the U.S. proposal to negotiate, but if the diplomatic process does not produce results, Israel will be forced to act." 
Turning to Intifada II, I asked if he had reacted to Bush's draft of a "Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution" handed him in Washington. "It's six pages in small letters and I haven't read it yet," he says, shifting the emphasis with "We accept the plan outlined in Bush's speech." Then he struck a note of optimism:
"About the Palestinian reforms, one feels that there are changes going on there. There are those who realize Israel won't be able to move forward until the end of the terror attacks and a different leadership emerges. We have seen positive signs that Palestinian society is moving toward reforms, especially economic reforms, though slowly -- first, Arafat must remove his hands from the cash flow." 
Progress was made in Washington on the release of tax money to the Palestinian Authority, which Israel feared would be used for arms. "We agreed to a mechanism to monitor those revenues," Sharon reports, "which is the most important thing right away. The Palestinians chose a man with good intentions. For accountability and transparency, we want a team led by U.S. experts, along with Europeans and Russians and especially Japanese, so that the money we release gradually, under inspections, will not be used to purchase illegal weapons. 
"We will continue our secret contacts with high-ranking Palestinian officials, and we have told them that the appointment of a prime minister is a first, necessary step in Palestinian reform." (That would, I presume, leave Arafat as figurehead president. As for those "secret contacts," they're hardly secret anymore.) 
"The U.S. knows who are the leaders who support reform," Sharon stresses, "and they should be strengthened." 
He's an unabashed admirer of this President Bush. "Thank God, at this historic moment, the U.S. is leading the free world toward liberation from fear of terror."
And his unwavering confidence under sustained pressure makes me an unabashed Arik Sharon admirer. "We go back many years," he says. "Call me more often." I may just do that.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Still Advising, From Afar and Near

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
When last we heard from Karen P. Hughes, one of President Bush's closest and most powerful advisers, she and her golden retriever were in her 1995 Mazda on a hot July day headed south to Texas, where she would take up a sane new life away from the pressures of the White House. Her 15-year-old son, Robert, was leaving the stresses of St. Albans, the private incubator of Washington's male elite, for public school in Austin. Her husband, Jerry, a lawyer who had never found full-time work in the capital, would get a job.
 Ms. Hughes planned to keep advising the president from afar, back in a cramped office in the Austin house that she and her husband had never been able to sell. But some Republicans close to the White House said that she was in denial, and that her physical distance from the Oval Office would make her invisible. 
 So far, that hasn't happened. Ms. Hughes, whose resignation set off another news media boomlet about whether women could balance family and high-powered careers, has in fact kept up such an intense schedule of campaigning, fund-raising, speech writing and travels with the president that she appears only slightly less busy than during the 18 months she kept such brutal hours at the White House. Although Republicans close to the president say she has lost some of her ability to affect policy decisions, she still talks to Mr. Bush two or three times a week, if not more, and is in daily contact with some of the most important officials in the West Wing.
"The rumors of my retirement have been greatly exaggerated," she told a rapturous crowd at a Dallas fund-raiser last month for John Cornyn, the Republican candidate for Senate, according to Republicans who were there. Last week, Mr. Cornyn's campaign asked for and got advice from Ms. Hughes on how to handle questions from Mr. Cornyn's opponent, Ron Kirk, about contributions that Mr. Cornyn received from the Enron Corporation, whose meltdown and political largess have become an issue in the race. At a debate on Friday, Mr. Cornyn deftly fought off the blows by questioning how Mr. Kirk could attack him when Mr. Kirk's own law firm had received $180,000 from Enron.
This week, Ms. Hughes will campaign for Republican candidates over three days in four states -- Colorado, Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota -- then meet up with Mr. Bush at his ranch in Texas. From there she will travel with him over the weekend to Mexico, where he is to attend an economic conference. Earlier this month, Ms. Hughes edited the speech on Iraq that the president delivered on Oct. 7 in Cincinnati. She also wrote the president's speech marking the anniversary of the terrorist attacks and was heavily involved in his Sept. 12 speech to the United Nations. She said through an aide, Kim Black, that she was too busy to comment for this article.
When Ms. Hughes is in Washington, often for three to four days at a time, she works in the small West Wing office, once used by Dan Bartlett, that was next to her big corner space that looked out toward the Truman Balcony. (Mr. Bartlett, the White House director of communications, is now in Ms. Hughes's old space.) Ms. Hughes, who is paid by the Republican National Committee, still takes time to work out in the gym in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with Mary Matalin, a top adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. She had dinner one of the last times she was in Washington with Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser.
Ms. Hughes has also found time to meet with New York publishers about a book about her time at the White House and to campaign for Jim Talent in Missouri and Norm Coleman in Minnesota, two White House-recruited Senate candidates in crucial races. 
Friends describe her as unusually content. When she is at home in Austin, they say, she drives Robert back and forth to school, a switch from her days in Washington, when she left the house before he was up and returned late at night. Her husband, who no longer practices law, now works as assistant director of adult education at the Westlake Hills Presbyterian Church, where Ms. Hughes remains active.
"She's very happy," said Mr. Bartlett, who noted that he and Ms. Hughes worked apart for long months during Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, when he was at headquarters in Austin and she was on the road, and that modern communications could bridge the distance. "Instead of e-mailing it upstairs, you're e-mailing it to Texas," he said.
The one big change? "I think she misses the president," Mr. Bartlett said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The White House Letter article yesterday, about Karen Hughes's part-time presence in Washington as an adviser to President Bush, referred incorrectly in some copies to the view from her former White House office. It looked out toward the Truman Balcony, not the South Portico.

HEADLINE: Autism Therapy Is Called Effective, but Rare 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE TARKAN 

 BODY:
No one has found a cure for autism, the neurological disorder that leads to lifelong impairments in a child's ability to speak, respond to others, share affection and learn. But there is a growing consensus that intensive early intervention is both effective and essential -- the sooner after diagnosis, the better.
 Early intervention, which involves many hours of therapy with one or more specialists, does not help every autistic child to the same degree. It is best started no later than age 2 or 3, and for reasons that are unclear, it does not help some children at all. But for those who are helped, their parents say, the changes are miraculous. 
 Yet the success of early intervention is posing a painful predicament for schools and families -- a predicament made more immediate by a rising tide of diagnoses of autism. Last week, researchers reported that the number of austistic children in California had risen more than sixfold since 1987, and other states and the federal government have also noted sharp increases. 
By federal law, public schools must provide appropriate education for children with disabilities, starting at age 3. But the treatment is so expensive -- averaging $33,000 a year, according to research published in the journal Behavioral Intervention -- that many families cannot persuade their school districts to pay for it. 
Brian and Juliana Jaynes of Newport News, Va., can testify to that. As a baby, their son, Stefan, developed normally, if not ahead of the curve. By age 2, his vocabulary was well over 100 words. He knew his address and his colors, and he spoke in short sentences. But soon after his second birthday, he started to regress, forgetting the words he once knew.
His parents suspected a neurological disorder. A specialist confirmed their suspicions, telling them Stefan was severely autistic and urging them to get intensive therapy for him.
Instead, school officials placed Stefan in a special-education preschool, where, the Jayneses say, he rapidly regressed. (The school district says the placement was appropriate.) After the neurologist told the frantic couple that their son might have to be institutionalized, they removed him from the preschool and began 40 hours a week of behavior therapy at home.
It cost them more than $100,000 over three years. Today, Stefan, 11, attends a school for autistic children and has vastly improved his language, social and self-help skills. He can say some simple sentences and communicate his needs; perhaps most important, he spends more and more time interacting with his family, and less time in his own world. The behavior therapy, his father said, "has brought about an awakening in this little boy's personality that is truly a miracle."
In recent years, four leading institutions -- the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences -- have called for early intervention, including one-on-one therapy, for children with autism. A panel of experts convened by the academy last year recommended a minimum of 25 hours a week, 12 months a year.
But Dr. Catherine Lord, the panel's chairwoman and a psychology professor at the University of Michigan, estimates that fewer than 10 percent of children with autism are getting the recommended level of therapy. "Almost everywhere, schools will say kids are getting services," she said. "But what they're getting varies enormously."
Because the young nervous system has a great deal of plasticity, many experts believe that early intervention enriches neural growth.
Dr. David L. Holmes, president of the Eden Institute, an autism center in Princeton, said, "If you have a child with autism who's not wired correctly, and we allow that to continue without intervention, those neuropathways will become fixed, and it becomes far more difficult to undo that tangled mess."
Autistic children lose the ability to learn by observation, something other children do constantly. Behavioral therapy is aimed at teaching these children how to learn. Teaching an autistic child to wave goodbye, for instance, can take 40 hours of repetitive lessons.
There are several kinds of therapy. The most popular -- the one Stefan Jaynes receives -- is applied behavioral analysis, in which a therapist asks a child to perform small tasks and then offers feedback to reinforce correct responses.
Other programs use sensory integration therapy, based on the theory that autistic children have defects in processing the messages from their five senses; auditory integration therapy, which assumes that some are oversensitive or undersensitive to sound or have problems processing sounds; speech therapy; and group programs.
The federal education law leaves decisions about therapy to professionals and parents. But administrators say parents often demand far more therapy than the experts recommend. "Is the school system going to override teachers, and substitute the teacher's decision with the parent's decision?" asked Bruce Hunter, associate executive director for public policy at the American Association of School Administrators in Arlington, Va.
The biggest obstacle is budgetary. "When you're looking at limited resources in a school district, sometimes the available resources drive what services schools will propose to offer," said David Egnor, policy director at the Council for Exceptional Children. "It's simply pragmatic."
Mr. Hunter added: "The problem all along in special ed is that you have a chronic shortage of money that is exacerbated by downturns in the economy, which is when it really gets bad. You get the joy of taking the money from one group of children and spending it on another group."
Under law, the federal government may reimburse states up to 40 percent of the extra cost of educating a child with a disability. But this year, Congress is paying just 17 percent, or $7.5 billion. President Bush has proposed adding $1 billion next year.
"The federal and state governments ought to pay attention to these children who have disabilities and need to be educated and need special treatment, and that costs money," said Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, who has an autistic grandson.
But the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, opposes full financing of the act until major changes are made. He and others have called for reforms in identifying students with disabilities -- minority students are classified far out of proportion to their numbers -- and in the daunting paperwork for the schools.
Many experts believe society would pay less in the long run if children received appropriate early intervention. An article in Behavioral Intervention in 1998 found that if 100 children were given early intensive intervention and 40 of them had only partial improvement, the public would save $9.5 million over their school years, ages 3 to 22. 
Most insurance companies do not pay for therapy for developmental disorders like autism, though a few companies offer reimbursement as part of their health benefits. 
Another obstacle to treatment is a lack of specialists. Public schools have a shortage of more than 12,000 special education teachers, and the number is expected to grow as many teachers retire or leave the field. 
Advocates say the supply of teachers trained to deal with autism is even shorter, so schools are forced to rely on expensive outside specialists. 
Even parents who decide to pay for treatment have trouble finding private specialists. Autism schools and private behavioral therapists typically have waiting lists of more than a year. This forces parents to set up their own in-home school and hire teams of people to provide the 20 to 40 hours a week of therapy. Many parents train themselves in the behavioral therapies, and then train college students, whom they can hire for considerably less money than specialists.
Yet another obstacle to early intervention is delayed diagnosis. Autism is most commonly diagnosed at 20 to 36 months, but experts say the signs often surface earlier. Many families experience delays because pediatricians often dismiss their concerns.
The growing awareness of autism may ease that problem. (Autism is now diagnosed in 1 out of 600 children, by most estimates.) But without appropriate therapy, early diagnosis does little but create frustration for parents, as Stefan's mother, Juliana Jaynes, recalled recently. "I had the doctor telling me that every moment counts," she said. "There's that horrible feeling of time slipping away and nothing being done."

HEADLINE: In Germany, Banks Mirror Wide Malaise In Economy 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
With plummeting share prices, faltering credit ratings and bad loans that keep piling up, Germany's banking system has come to symbolize the country's broader economic distress.
 The news is so bleak that a recent rumor, later discredited, of a liquidity shortfall at one of the largest banks, Commerzbank, was enough to stir talk that Germany was facing a full-blown banking crisis. 
 Not so, says one of Germany's banking elders, Rolf E. Breuer, the chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank and president of the German banking association. At least, he added, "not in the traditional sense." 
" 'Banking crisis' is a very risky expression, because usually people then think of 1929," Mr. Breuer said in an interview today. "We're not talking about a liquidity problem. We're not talking about a credit crunch. What we are talking about is a lack of profitability." 
Two of Germany's four big commercial banks, Commerzbank and the HVB Group, are likely to lose money this year in their core banking business, according to a new report by Salomon Smith Barney.
Deutsche Bank is expected to eke out a modest profit; the fourth, Dresdner Bank, which was acquired for $20 billion last year by the giant insurer Allianz, had heavy losses in the second quarter.
Despite the red ink, Mr. Breuer said the chances of a big bank failure in Germany were remote. He said foreign investors had been rattled unnecessarily by the rumor about Commerzbank, which circulated against a backdrop of political tension between Germany and the United States over Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's opposition to an American-led war on Iraq.
"It added to the overall mood that German banks are not the flavor of the month," Mr. Breuer said.
Still, he acknowledged that the banks had been whipsawed by a combination of global economic woes and home-grown weaknesses, chiefly their bloated costs and the fact that there are simply too many of them.
"I do think we have double what is needed," Mr. Breuer said, comparing Germany with its European neighbors. With more than 2,700 lending institutions and 42,350 bank branches, Germany has more branches per capita than any major country except Belgium. Even in the United States, the undisputed champion of consumer credit, there are about half as many bank branches in proportion to population.
"We missed an early consolidation," Mr. Breuer said. "And we are too expensive vis-a-vis our competitors in Europe." 
As Germany's economy teeters on the edge of a recession, the winds are turning even more harshly against the banks. Commerzbank predicts that the number of corporate insolvencies in Germany is likely to rise by 30 percent this year and not reach a peak until sometime in 2003, not 2002 as had been expected.
That will drive up the number of bad loans, in some cases to as much as 1 percent of a lender's total portfolio. That may not seem high by the standards of Japan or China, where the banking systems have been plagued with huge volumes of defaulted loans. But in Germany, it is enough to wreck the banks' profits.
"The banks need to focus on areas where they have real prospects of making economic returns," said Jeremy Sigree, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. "It may mean less is more." 
Along with eroding loan portfolios, German banks have been hit by steep declines in the value of their stockholdings as the market has crumbled. In this jittery atmosphere, mere rumors can prove devastating.
"People are willing to believe things are worse than they think," said Mark Hoge, a banking analyst at Banc of America Securities in London. "You get into a situation where you have a self-fulfilling crisis, where people end counterparty relations and credit spreads widen." 
The major credit-rating agencies have steadily downgraded Commerzbank and HVB, putting them in danger of losing their A ratings. Mr. Breuer said he wished the agencies had given more warning before the downgrades, which he said had deepened the mood of uncertainty.
Mr. Breuer is speaking out to dispel what he views as a canard: that Germany is headed for the same kind of banking crisis that afflicts Japan. There, many of the largest banks are fundamentally insolvent and are kept in business only by injections of public money and by the forbearance of bank regulators.
"We don't have a real estate bubble," he said, referring to a major cause of Japan's crash. "We also have the flexibility, and have used the flexibility, to expand to other shores of the business sector."
Japanese banks, he said, have historically been much more restricted than German banks in their ability to expand into ancillary businesses like investment banking and asset management.
The question is whether German banks are prepared to undergo the painful cost-cutting and humbling consolidation that Mr. Breuer says is necessary for the industry to claw its way back to profitability.
"We don't have our back to the wall yet," he said. "You can really argue that the worst has to happen before you really get it. It is a very sad statement, but it is supported by the evidence."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
This year, marketers are trying to take the boo out of Halloween.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
FOR the second consecutive year, Madison Avenue is exorcising many of the spooky, ghoulish and violent elements from Halloween advertising.
 You don't need witchcraft to conjure up the reasons the more monstrous images are disappearing from most Halloween marketing, replaced by smiling ghosts and pumpkins and phrases like "Playful fun" and "All treats! No tricks!" A more sober national mood after 9/11 and anxiety over the sniper attacks in metropolitan Washington as well as the struggling economy have swayed many marketers from their typical Halloween tactics. 
 The trend is particularly noticeable in advertising aimed at children. "What we're tracking is more restrained marketing to kids, with less of the supernatural," said Dr. Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company. "The biggest change is the upsurge in costumes like firemen, policemen, doctors and nurses," rather than skeletons, werewolves, mummies and other creepy creatures. 
For instance, a print advertisement for Nestle showing young trick-or-treaters depicts them dressed as a ballerina, a baseball player, a fireman and a wizard. 
And of the 10 children wearing Halloween costumes on the cover of a circular from the Toys "R" Us retail chain, 8 are dressed in mild, not wild, outfits ranging from a Disney princess and a Power Ranger to Spider-Man and a prom queen. Only two of the children are conventionally clad, as a witch and a vampire. 
Susan McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Toys "R" Us in Paramus, N.J., said the company's focus in recent years had been on costumes based on characters licensed from marketers like the Walt Disney Company.
Dr. Frances Roy, a psychologist who is president of Frances Roy & Associates in Nashville, said: "People are trying to move away from things that are painful in nature. There have been so many negatives, people want to hold on to what's more positive."
And marketers do not want to scare off consumers from shopping for what has grown into a major American holiday. During the 1990's, Halloween expanded beyond its focus on children to embrace adults looking for a reason for a party between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. That fueled substantial growth in sales of costumes, candy, decorations and other related merchandise, which increased to $6.9 billion in 2001 from $2.5 billion in 1996, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade association.
However, a survey by the federation indicates that consumers are pausing in their Halloween spending spree. They said they planned to spend $44 a household this year on such items compared with $45 last year.
"I've toured the stores and talked to shoppers and I'm hearing that Halloween is going to be pretty disappointing for retailers, like back-to-school," said Candace Corlett, partner at WSL Strategic Retail in New York, a consulting company.
"People are saying, 'I'm scared about the economy, the talk about war, I just don't know what's going to happen,' " she added, "and it's scary enough for them to count how much they spend."
Those grownup thoughts are reflected in Halloween campaigns aimed at adults for products like alcoholic beverages. For example, last year the Miller Brewing Company sponsored a promotion carrying the theme "Get vamped," showing a model with vampirelike teeth.
This year, the promotion "is more sexy than ghoulish," said Rob Acosta, a spokesman in Milwaukee for Miller, part of SABMiller. The theme is "It's the fright time for Miller Time" and the posters and signs depict a young woman in a tight red dress. 
Another beer marketer, the Gambrinus Company, which imports beer brands like Corona Extra and Corona Light to 25 states, the Caribbean and Washington, is bringing back a humorous Halloween campaign that shows limes carved into grinning jack-o'-lanterns. The "lime-o'-lantern" character spoofs the limes that many beer drinkers squeeze into bottles of those brands.
"Everything we do is tongue in cheek, very lighthearted," said Don Mann, group director at Gambrinus in San Antonio.
"Many consumers are expressing interest in traditions they like that they want to continue as they always have," he added. "That's a consideration here as well."
To that end, some marketers say, they are continuing to run the softer, less intense Halloween advertising that, they believe, consumers have come to expect from them.
"Our Halloween ads have always been lighthearted and kid-friendly," said Peg Buchheit, a spokeswoman for the Pillsbury cookie products sold by General Mills in Minneapolis, "because our target is families with kids." The ads show what are described as "spooky-shape cookies," though the pumpkins, ghosts, bats and black cats are all smiling, and carry the theme "Playful fun."
Of course, there is an exception to every rule, and this year it is the Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Fla., owned by Vivendi Universal. The resort's Halloween Horror Nights are being promoted with television commercials replete with grisly images of the fiendish goings-on in the laboratory of a mad scientist. 
David Angelo, chairman and chief creative officer at the resort's agency, David and Goliath in Los Angeles, offered a counterpoint to the kinder, gentler Halloween.
"The client encouraged us to be as bold as possible," Mr. Angelo said, "and come up with something that would scare people out of their pants."
And there does appear to be a pop-cultural appetite for scary fare, at least on the movie screen as the success of movies like "The Ring" and "Red Dragon" can attest.
"We're very mindful of all the events going on," Mr. Angelo added, "but we wanted to stay true to Halloween, which for the most part is about fear."
And selling, too; Mr. Angelo said tickets to the Horror Nights "have pretty much sold out in the first couple weeks."

HEADLINE: Index of Leading Indicators Off For Fourth Consecutive Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell in September for the fourth consecutive month, a private research firm said today, the first time that has happened since the start of the 1990-91 recession.
 The drop suggests the recovery may stall through the first quarter of next year. 
 The research firm, the Conference Board, said its index dropped 0.2 percent after falling a revised 0.1 percent in August. 
Over the last six months, the index has declined at an annual rate of 0.5 percent. It would take a 3.5 percent rate of decline over six months to signal a recession, the New York group said.
"A little bit of patience is probably appropriate," said Gary Stern, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. His comments on the economy came in a speech to a business group in Bloomington, Minn. He said the economy might accelerate in the second half of next year.
Falling stock prices, rising jobless claims and a drop in consumer optimism contributed to the decline in the Conference Board's index. The group uses 10 gauges of economic activity to indicate the economy's direction over the next three to six months.
Economists had expected a 0.2 percent decline in the leading indicators index after a previously reported 0.2 percent drop in August, based on the median of 40 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
"As a general matter, our economy is doing O.K.," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said earlier today. "We continue to look at possible things that might be done to help it along."
Ken Goldstein, an economist who compiles the report for the Conference Board, said: "Except for the financial markets, there is little evidence of a developing economic decline. A stalling-out of growth is a more reasonable prospect than the economy falling back into recession."
The economy will grow at a 2.2 annual rate this quarter, down from a projected 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, according to the latest Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey. 
Five of the 10 indicators the Conference Board uses to calculate the index declined, and four rose. The group bases its measurement on seven previously reported economic statistics and estimates for three others.

HEADLINE: Public College Tuitions Rise 10% Amid Financing Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Battered by government budget cuts, public colleges and universities raised tuition almost 10 percent this year, with tuition at private institutions going up almost 6 percent, according to a survey released today by the College Board.
 The survey found that over the last decade, a period of minimal inflation, tuition at both public and private institutions had gone up 38 percent. 
 With net family worth declining over the last two years for the first time in a half century, middle-class families have been hard pressed to keep up with rising costs and have sought more financial aid.
"For millions of American students, college is the dream of a lifetime," said Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board. "But financing that dream causes many sleepless nights." 
While private institutions have raised tuition about 5.5 percent annually in recent years, tuition at public colleges and universities is rising more quickly each year. Two years ago, public institutions raised tuition 4.4 percent. Last year, the increase was 7.7 percent. This year, it is 9.6 percent, or $356, according to the College Board. About 75 percent of American undergraduates attend public colleges or universities.
"The main thing here is the recession and state fiscal responses to the recession," said Thomas J. Kane, a professor of policy studies and economics at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Public institutions are reeling from economic blows from several quarters. The plunging stock market and worsening economic outlook have cut the revenues states collect from capital gains and income taxes. And colleges, which can raise tuition, present a more vulnerable target for budget cuts than elementary and secondary education or Medicaid payments, Mr. Kane said.
At the same time, returns from endowments and donations to colleges are down. And institutions are carrying greater debt than ever before, said John Nelson, a senior vice president at Moody's Investor Service specializing in higher education. Just three years ago, the median debt held by a public college or university was $87 million. By last year, it had topped $140 million, he said.
"Many colleges have had a decline in endowment two years in a row, some three years in a row," Mr. Nelson said. "They have these high tuitions, and if you marry it with the family profile, the number of families that can afford to pay these fees is declining."
In its annual report on the cost of attending college, released here today, the College Board charted increases in tuition and fees of 5.8 percent this year, or $1,001, at four-year private colleges and universities. While the rate of increase is smaller than for public colleges, the gap between public and private college continues to widen in terms of real dollars because private colleges charge so much more to begin with.
The increases come after a decade of steadily rising tuitions that consistently outpaced the consumer price index, currently by 8.4 percent for public institutions and by 4.7 percent for private colleges and universities. But financial assistance in the form of grants and loans increased 10 percent this year, to $90 billion, according to the College Board report.
For the second straight year, the board said, aid in the form of grants rose more than loans, reversing a trend over the previous decade.
Mr. Caperton argued the rise in tuition was something of an illusion: while the "sticker price" of a college education is rising, the percentage of families that pay full tuition is declining. Today, only 8 percent of all college students pay full tuition.
David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, predicted that thanks to greater financial aid, "out-of-pocket costs for most students at these institutions will not rise appreciably."
But much of the help offered students is in the form of loans, with the typical college graduate carrying $18,000 of debt. That burden is likely to get heavier in coming years.
Asked at a news conference today for her advice to middle-class parents of college students who face financial setbacks, Georgette DeVeres, associate vice president for admissions at Claremont McKenna College in California, stressed that her college and many others were now offering families loans to cover the full amount of tuition.
At the same time, a greater share of financial aid, at both public and private institutions, is awarded on the basis of merit rather than need alone, in an effort to attract stronger students. 
Based on interviews with university officials, Mr. Nelson of Moody's estimates that just 50 private institutions admit students without regard to their ability to pay, and 25 award all scholarships on the basis of need alone. More than 1,900 institutions, Moody's estimates, offer a combination of merit and need-based aid.
As the financial pressures on families have grown, more and more families are turning away from small, independent colleges to state universities, with their far more modest tuition.

HEADLINE: A Little Bordeaux With That Bagel?; 
Huge Wine Show Brings a Taste Of France to New York City

BYLINE:  By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The French are coming. Well, at least the ones from Bordeaux, the city of wine. And they're bearing tons of it: some 20,000 bottles to be tasted, tout de suite! 
 When the Bordeaux wine festival opens today at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for an unprecedented visit to North America, there will be an exuberance of promotion, an abundance of networking and a surfeit of traditional swirling, and, yes, spitting. 
 But the question among some wine mavens is: can the show, which many argue is the world's most prominent, find happiness in the New York area -- the leading consumer of imports in America -- despite the economic downturn and an overabundance of production? 
The three-day paradise of wine -- called Vinexpo Americas International Wine and Spirits Exhibition -- is a trade show, barred to the public, open only to more than 10,000 expected industry professionals. But a frenzy of ancillary Francophilic events will be open to the general public right through the weekend, including tastings, auctions, art and antiques shows and special menus at top French restaurants celebrating Bordeaux, the capital of the French region of Aquitaine. 
Beyond this, the show is expected to enrich the city's coffers by at least $30 million, according to a Vinexpo study that estimates spending on hotels and restaurants, as well as payments to truckers, exhibition carpenters and party suppliers for all the blowout socializing. 
Some think the show represents a high-profile effort by the French to pursue the American market. In fact, the kickoff ceremony today will feature Alain Juppe, the former prime minister of France, who just happens to be the mayor of Bordeaux. He said, before leaving for New York: "We are here to do business." 
There have been wine conventions before in New York, but most have been open to consumers as well as the trade, and have confined their wares to wines already in distribution. "But at Vinexpo the trade meets the trade, offering new things that are not distributed in the United States," said Daniel Boulud, the Manhattan chef who is offering cuisine from Bordeaux in two of his restaurants, Daniel and Cafe Boulud. "There will be a huge concentration of winemakers here."
More than 5,000 different wines will be poured by the smiling cadres of 600 exhibitors from 28 countries in 204,000 square feet of Javits space. Tasting their way from booth to booth will be distributors, wholesalers, importers, retailers, restaurateurs, sommeliers and auction devotees. 
Francois Janoueix, one of the growers who were uncrating their wares yesterday, expressed high hopes "that we can find new importers for our products," as he unpacked eight cases of wines.
"It's our first time in America," he said. 
His and other booths will offer a torrent of wines for tasting from the world's 10 top-producing wine countries (Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United States and South Africa). There will be tastings of the 2000 grands crus from Bordeaux, and new offerings including Clos Poggiale, a Corsican wine, and Fresita, a sparkling Chilean wine with strawberry pulp. 
"Vinexpo has the international reputation of being the most important trade show in the world," said Jon Fredrikson, a wine analyst who is president of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, industry consultants in Woodside, Calif. "Now they are trying to market to the vast trade audience that doesn't go to Bordeaux." 
Despite threats of war and gyrating markets -- or possibly because of them -- United States imports of table wine are projected to be up 12 percent to 52 million cases over last year, out of the total of 214 million cases expected to be sold in 2002, according to Mr. Fredrikson. 
Many in the city's wine trade are pleased that Vinexpo has come to town. "I applaud them in bringing the show to New York, which really needs the convention business," said Richard Genova, president of House of Burgundy, a Manhattan wine importer. "New York deserves to have a pre-eminent wine trade fair." 
But he added: "Whether this show is organized to be that pre-eminent show is another question. The jury will be out until next week." 
The organizers hope that Vinexpo will be a United Nations of wine, said Robert Beynat, chief executive of Vinexpo, that will "help develop the North American market." But Mr. Fredrikson said the economic downturn "has negatively affected the consumption of wine in high-end restaurants." He added that the timing of the show could be "inopportune," since the industry has already booked all its imports for the holiday season. 
Mr. Fredrikson said that Vinexpo has arrived at a time in the business cycle of the $19 billion United States wine market "where there are large supplies of wine available right now, and so it's a very competitive situation."
The wine glut, he added, "may make it difficult for the sellers to get the attention of retailers."
This is more than a theoretical consideration. Admission to the trade show is free to preregistered professionals (and $40 to latecomers). But exhibitors pay an average of $13,000 to sell their wares. Given all the incidentals, including promotional parties and dinners, Mr. Genova said, "the cost is at least $25,000 to exhibitors." 
But Mr. Beynat of Vinexpo said that the trade show "is not here just for this year's market; it is a multiyear investment for the future." Planning for the show, which started 18 months ago, only intensified after the terrorist attack at the World Trade Center "because we very much wanted to show our support for New York City," he said. 
Organizers of the host of related events are hoping for high visibility in the fall Manhattan social swirl. Aside from the catered galas, tasting dinners and auctions, there is the Bordeaux and Aquitaine Grape Harvest Festival, a selection of food and wine from the region at 15 Manhattan restaurants, including Alain Ducasse, Le Bernardin and Lespinasse. 
Mr. Boulud, for example, will be presenting a country-style cabbage soup -- garbure au canard et foie gras -- at Cafe Boulud. The dish is on the menu of La Tupina, a revered restaurant in Bordeaux whose owner and chef, Jean-Pierre Xiradakis, will attend Vinexpo. 
In addition, a show at a town house called the Embassy, on East 67th Street in Manhattan, will display art and antiques from Aquitaine chateaus, imported to New York by French dealers. A listing of events can be found at www.vinexpo.com.
Vinexpo, founded 21 years ago in Bordeaux, has raised its ensign every two years since, drawing ever-increasing hordes of thirsty wine professionals to its turf among the world's greatest vineyards.
Last year the show drew more than 2,000 exhibitors from 40 countries and 54,000 visitors. The New York show is its first North American satellite.
"It's all about networking; floating, tasting, seeing, looking for what's new," said F. Paul Pacult, editor of Spirit Journal, a quarterly with 12,000 subscribers that is published in Ulster County, N.Y. 
Although offerings were predominantly French in the early years, now 40 percent of the exhibits are of non-French wines from around the world. 
The event in New York "is long overdue," said Mr. Pacult, who added that "this is the first time that the French are actually looking at North America as a market that they must capture." 
Some are looking to buyer inquisitiveness for success. "No two bottles of wine are the same, and wine people are always curious," Mr. Genova said. "We're always willing to fall in love again."

HEADLINE: Alaskans Worry About Future Of Their Oil Royalty Checks 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The state's oil royalty fund, which pays every man, woman and child in Alaska a dividend each year just for living here, may be running dry for the first time since it began 20 years ago.
 The state Constitution says that the principal of the Alaska Permanent Fund, about $22 billion, cannot be touched, and because of the downturn on Wall Street, it has been dangerously close to that level and sometimes below it. 
 The dividend checks have been mailed out every fall since 1982. This year's payout was $1,540 per person; all told, about 600,000 Alaska residents are splitting $900 million. 
The loss of the dividend next year could have a huge effect on Alaska's economy and the lives of its poorer residents. Many use their checks on shopping sprees at the mall or put the money down on new cars, snowmobiles or hot tubs.
"I would guess over 75 percent of the folks that come in here during the Permanent Fund time are spending their Permanent Fund dividends," said Maggie O'Hara, co-owner of Bill's Cat House, which sells Arctic Cat snowmobiles and other recreational vehicles. "And they usually spend them on coats, helmets and used snow machines. Which is why we have our big sale at this time."
If there is no dividend?
"People will buy fewer toys, I think," Ms. O'Hara said.
But while some Alaskans spend the dividend on luxuries, poorer people often depend on it for help with housing and other basics like gasoline, heating oil and electricity, which are expensive in Alaska's remote areas.
"The dividend helps a small community a lot, because there's no work out here," said Moses Toyukak, one of three employees at the power plant in the village of Manokotak, a 350-mile flight from Anchorage. "I've been putting mine toward housing the last eight years."
Nearly half of Manokotak's 80 families have incomes of $25,000 or less. Because the average Manokotak family has five members, the loss of the dividend would cut family income by 30 percent or more. 
Villagers catch and dry fish and hunt moose, caribou and beaver for food. But their hunting forays are on all-terrain vehicles or snowmobiles, and gasoline costs $2.45 a gallon.
Pete Andrew is a salmon fisherman in Dillingham, a town of 5,000 where the cost of living is about 50 percent higher than in Anchorage. Milk costs $6 a gallon, cabbage $7 a head.
Mr. Andrew has been putting away the dividends for college for his four children, ages 11 through 16. 
The Permanent Fund was set up in 1976 after oil from Prudhoe Bay began flowing via the Alaska pipeline. Royalties paid to the state by the oil companies are put in the fund and invested, about half in the stock market, 40 percent in bonds and 10 percent in real estate.
In 2000, the fund's value peaked at $27.8 billion, and the dividend that year reached a record $1,964 for every Alaskan.
This year's dividend was equal to roughly 5 percent of Alaska's $17 billion economy.
"If there was a loss of the complete dividend, it would be a lean Christmas for our retailers," said Gregg Erickson, an economist in Juneau, "and for many families and households who depend on it."

HEADLINE: The Science and Politics of Super Rice 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: HANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Huang Danian, an expert at the National Rice Research Institute here, has created a rice so resilient and tasty, he says, that "every farmer in China will certainly want it."
 So far, however, it grows only on a few acres in Mr. Huang's walled garden near Hangzhou, about 100 miles southwest of Shanghai. Though he has passed government safety tests and has a national patent for his creation, China has banned his rice from grocery shelves because it depends on altering rice genes to create a breed immune to the toxic effects of herbicides. 
 Reversing its formerly enthusiastic embrace of genetic experiments, China has imposed restrictions on domestic varieties of genetically modified crops like rice, soybeans, vegetables and tobacco, and required lengthy safety tests and cumbersome labeling rules for imports of such food. 
The go-slow approach reflects rising concerns about food safety, but mainly, many critics say, the restrictions are a convenient tool for trade protection.
Officials in Beijing fear that small-scale, and therefore relatively inefficient, Chinese farmers cannot compete with food imports from the United States, many of them genetically modified. Officials also think that the country's own food exports may suffer in the world market, where fears of so-called Frankenstein food are rampant, if China becomes a pioneer in genetically altered foods.
China's entry into the World Trade Organization earlier this year was supposed to open its markets permanently and make it difficult to manipulate trade in such ways. But new rules and regulations governing farm products and some crucial services like banking and telecommunications, show that it has no intention of making domestic producers fend for themselves overnight.
"The U.S. hoped China was just going to get out of the market, but it obviously isn't happening that way," said Robert Paarlberg, a political science expert at Wellesley College who has studied China's policies on genetics. "In some ways, the genetics issue is just an excuse to control trade."
The newly cautious approach to genetically modified foods has disappointed American farmers, who expected to sell far more goods to China after it joined the trade organization early this year. Instead, their sales of soybeans, the largest export crop, fell 23 percent in the year through September compared with the similar period of 2001, largely because of complications related to China's new testing and licensing procedures.
Bush administration trade officials have made repeated trips to China in recent months aimed at persuading officials to allow unfettered imports of soybeans. Trade in farm products is also expected to be a sensitive economic issue on the agenda when President Jiang Zemin meets President Bush in Crawford, Tex., on Oct. 25.
Possibly to ease trade tensions, China recently announced that it would extend a provisional arrangement allowing imports of soybeans until next September, giving it more time to review health and environmental effects.
This concession relieves some of the uncertainty that had disrupted the $1 billion soybean trade. But it may also push back the date when China decides whether to certify American soybeans as safe.
More broadly, the guarded approach to genetically modified foods appears to be ascendant. Officials in the agriculture ministry want more restrictions on genetically altered foods because of safety and competitiveness concerns, several Chinese officials said. They have outmaneuvered people in the nation's science establishment who wanted to see the fruits of genetic research harvested quickly.
"China has long wanted to be No. 1 in developing rice and other staple foods," said Mr. Huang, who had been negotiating with Monsanto and other big foreign biotechnology companies to commercialize his rice breed. "But it is becoming clear that we will not develop faster than the rest of world. We are not going to be first."
That would amount to a decisive shift for China, which until recently seemed to want to become the developing world's leader in biotechnology. It has invested large amounts -- as much as $100 million annually, according to a survey team from the University of California -- to develop more than 140 varieties of genetically modified plants.
The idea is to rearrange genes in important crops to maximize their resistance to pests or to pesticides and herbicides. Other strains have been designed to grow in arid or salty soil, while still others were tweaked to improve taste.
China saw genetic research as the way to maintain basic self-sufficiency in staple foods and get the most from its arable land, which is already scarce and is shrinking every year.
So strong was its commitment to genetic engineering that it was the only developing country to join the Human Genome Project. Its scientists played a leading role in deciphering the complex rice genome. And China produced genetically modified seeds to grow potatoes, tomatoes, soybeans, rice and even trees and flowers.
But some early failed experiments with genetically modified tobacco plants in the 1990's, as well as reports that genetically modified corn had unintentionally been mixed with organic corn in Mexico in 1999, began to diminish its ardor, local and international experts said.
Growing consumer resistance to genetically modified food in Japan and South Korea, as well as in Europe, provided another warning. Chinese officials feared that they would lose important export markets by pushing ahead too quickly.
Polls also showed that domestic shoppers preferred food that had not been genetically altered. After Chinese officials issued new labeling rules this summer, supermarkets were supposed to begin putting notices on products that contained genetically modified ingredients. Few products carry such labels now, but there are many, like Rong's brand corn oil, that have bright yellow labels saying they contain only organic ingredients.
Both the Bush and Clinton administrations had hoped that China would become an ally on farm issues in the World Trade Organization, where the fight over the safety of genetically modified food may eventually end up. Instead, China now appears more inclined to support a cautionary stance like the one taken by the European Union. If its position does not change, it may slow the trade of genetically modified food globally.
"In the long run, China could still be an ally of the U.S. within the W.T.O.," Mr. Paarlberg said, "but in the short run they are definitely not going to be a stalking horse."
Indeed, the trend is toward more restrictions. Although China has had new seed varieties available for years, it has allowed the widespread planting of only one crop, a strain of cotton modified to resist the bollworm.
This spring, Beijing banned biotechnology companies like Monsanto and Syngenta from investing in the development of genetically modified strains of corn, soybeans and rice seeds.
More recently, it canceled plans to allow the broad use of corn plants modified to fight bugs in the main grain-producing provinces in the northeast. Field tests showed that in China's tightly concentrated farm plots, pests evolved quickly to overcome the resistance of genetically modified plants.
"The general sense is that the risks are too high and the market is too small" for most genetically modified plants, said Wu Kongmin, who heads a panel of experts conducting safety tests for the agriculture ministry.
At his laboratory near Hangzhou, Mr. Huang is waiting for approval to develop rice seeds based on his herbicide-resistant breed. But he puts most of his energy into developing a new grade of rice that has an extra long grain, which he plans to market under the brand name Tianmei. He achieved that result, significantly, through conventional crossbreeding, not by rearranging genes.
"At least," he said, "we can make some progress the old way."

HEADLINE: 35-Story Tower Is Planned For Last Open Times Sq. Lot 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Twenty-two years after the city and the state announced an ambitious project to transform a seedy and forlorn Times Square, a prominent real estate family is planning to build a 35-story tower on the last remaining parcel in the 13-acre redevelopment district.
 The family, Howard and Edward Milstein, plan to break ground today on the 850,000-square-foot building, which will combine office space, street-level stores and possibly apartments on a parking lot at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue. 
 It is designed by Fox & Fowle, the same architects who designed the Conde Nast and Reuters buildings a block away on Times Square.
The Milsteins' $500 million project will sit in an area that has already undergone a neon-glazed sea change as T-shirt shops and pornography stores gave way in the mid-1990's to new theaters, sleek glass office buildings, a World Wrestling Entertainment restaurant, the largest toy store in the world and, last week, a colorful 860-room Westin hotel. 
But, until now, the last piece on the Times Square checkerboard sat quietly.
"Eddie and I are 100 percent committed to completing this building by 2004," Howard Milstein said yesterday. "Even in these times of uncertainty, New York City and Times Square remain the crossroads of the world."
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who spent much of the 1980's and early 1990's trying to get the Times Square project off the ground, said it was a long time coming.
"It's gratifying," Mr. Cuomo said yesterday. "It took longer than it should have and was more tortuous. But the energy and the power of the place is so formidable."
Despite frequent news conferences and much fanfare, the redevelopment of Times Square was stymied for many years by community opposition, 47 lawsuits and a deep recession in the early 1990's.
But companies and retailers flooded into the area beginning in the late 1990's, after Disney announced it would rehabilitate the New Amsterdam Theater, on 42nd Street near Seventh Avenue, and Douglas Durst, the developer, began building a new skyscraper in Times Square.
State and city officials provided developers with hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to build in Times Square. They also granted tax breaks to tenants like Conde Nast Publications, Ernst & Young, Reuters, The New York Times and others.
Even after the transformation was well under way, the subsidies got larger, not smaller. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani provided Conde Nast, for instance, with incentives worth about $10.7 million in 1996, while Ernst & Young got $20 million in 1999.
Although the resurgence of Times Square is certain, the Milstein project is not without some risk for a family that has not erected a new office building in 19 years or a new residential building in a decade.
The booming economy of the late 1990's, which brought tourists, new restaurants, stores, investment bankers and even accountants to once-forbidding Times Square, has faded a bit.
Boston Properties is scouring the city for tenants for its tower under construction on the south side of 42nd Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, as is Forest City Ratner for space in the proposed headquarters for The Times on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets.
Developers have also completed, or are building, eight apartment towers with more than 3,000 apartments on 42nd Street, west of Eighth Avenue, or nearby.
But Mr. Milstein said he expected to complete his tower in 2004 after Boston Properties opens its building and before Forest City completes its project.
If the office market remains soft, he said, he has the option of building apartments instead of a large block of office space. The Milstein building will also have a parking garage and retail space on three floors.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, which has overseen the Times Square redevelopment project, said he was "pleased that the last empty lot on a booming 42nd Street is being developed."
The Milsteins have long wanted to be a part of Times Square redevelopment. The family bought a decrepit hotel at Eighth Avenue and 44th Street in 1978, renovated it and opened it as the Milford Plaza, just outside the Times Square redevelopment area.
But they were rebuffed by state officials when they wanted to be designated as an official project developer for the 42nd Street site. 
The Milsteins bought the parking lot at Eighth Avenue in 1983 for $5 million, after state officials, short of cash, turned down an offer to buy it. But little happened afterward. In recent years, Howard Milstein tried to develop a one-million-square-foot tower on the site, but it became contested territory in a feud between different wings of the Milstein family.
Early last year, Howard, his father, Paul, and his brother, Edward, bought out their cousins' interest in a deal that valued the parking lot at $111 million.

The Fare Dance, and Paying the Piper

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The band is still playing very softly, but make no mistake: the familiar waltz that a transit official once affectionately called the "dance of death" is under way again.
 Anywhere else, it might be considered strange to use such a macabre phrase to describe what is, after all, only the chance that subway and bus fares will rise. But in New York, with the largest transit system in the Western Hemisphere and an economy entwined in it, the description seems somehow apt for the grim political pas de deux that occurs as reliably as wildfires in the West. 
 Since the subway opened in 1904 at a nickel a ride, the dance has ended in an increase 13 times, five of those in the last two decades, bringing the basic fare up to $1.50. As with most of the previous performances, the newest dance is proceeding according to a set of inviolable rules, rendered much stricter because this particular dance has begun during a gubernatorial election year. 
Among the rules are these:
*Everyone in an official position to decide whether the fare will rise -- in other words, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which he controls -- must act as if the very idea is only slightly less outrageous than levying a special tax on breathing. At least until after Election Day.
*Those same people must become even more evasive than usual about the true nature of the transit agency's finances. For example, while some transit officials talk about a dangerous operating deficit for next year of more than $600 million, the most recent figures show subway and bus revenues actually running $33 million ahead of budget right now. How do those two figures jibe? And how did last year's equally dangerous deficit projection, of more than $700 million, manage to vanish?
*A subset of those same people, while denying that a fare increase is looming, must carefully begin laying the philosophical groundwork for one. At a City Council hearing in March, the M.T.A.'s budget director, Gary G. Caplan, stressed that it had been seven years since the last increase, and added that MetroCard discounts had driven the cost of an average subway or bus ride down to $1.06. (He did not add an important related point, but his critics quickly did: the drop does not mean that the agency now collects less money. Ridership has increased, so fare revenue has actually remained about the same over the last five years.)
Returning to the Council this month, Mr. Caplan appeared to place another important brick in his foundation, contending that New York riders pay slightly less than half of the transit system's operating costs.
Once again, his dance partners countered vigorously, citing federal statistics that show that riders actually pay almost 60 percent of running the subways and buses, much more than many other cities' riders do. In Boston, for example, the $1 basic subway fare and 75-cent bus fare foot only 29 percent of the bill, while government subsidies make up the rest.
In many ways, the background music for this newest dance is the same sad tune that has been playing since the M.T.A. was created in 1968 and the state took over the system. And it is that, while transporting a huge percentage of the state's citizens every day, the system has always received less than this percentage in state transit aid. The gap is considerable: the system moves 84 percent of the state's riders and gets only 63 percent of state aid, meaning that it regularly finds itself needing to raise fares and makes itself a huge target for accusations of unfairness.
But there are other melodies complicating the dance music this year. One is that the system is in better shape than it has been in past fare-increase situations, making it much harder to argue that riders would be forced to pay more for less. (Opponents counter that service has not nearly kept pace with ridership increases, leading to a lot less of many important things, like space and seats.)
The other difference this time is that the city's mayor -- whose dance role has always been to pirouette wildly in protest of any possible increase -- seems to have forgotten his part. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is trying to balance his own troubled budget and is looking for ways to cut even the city's meager contribution to the subways. So he has all but welcomed an increase, leaving opponents even more isolated and meaning that the dance is more likely to end with higher fares. 
While it might seem that this is always the inevitable result, it has not always been so. In 1981, for example, state officials responded to public pressure and worked through the night to pass a tax package giving more money to the subways and buses and staving off an increase.
How will it all end this time? "It's much harder to tell, because nobody is leveling with the public," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, playing its traditional role of opponent in the dance. "But you can expect a whole lot of leveling very soon."

HEADLINE: For Indonesia Leader, Small Talk Edges Tough Talk 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
When the Australian foreign minister arrived here after the bombings in Bali to talk about terrorism, President Megawati Sukarnoputri greeted him with the kind of inconsequential remark expected from a protocol officer.
 The Indonesian weather, Australian officials say she told the minister, Alexander Downer, was very hot. 
 The daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's charismatic founder, Mrs. Megawati often behaves like a court princess, bound by codes of formal conduct and minimal public expression. 
There are frequent accounts in Jakarta of Mrs. Megawati, when confronted with a serious question by a visiting diplomat, replying across the tea set, "Have another cookie." 
Yet, beneath the polite exterior lies a desire, say her admirers, to bring stability to an ethnically diverse nation that has known terrible violence and a dedication to democracy after three decades of authoritarian rule.
She is very supportive of the military, a sympathy that can be explained, they assert, by a yearning for national cohesion. Her reluctance to take on Islamic militants, even as the United States has repeatedly linked some of them to Al Qaeda, stemmed, they say, from her concern that a crackdown would lead to turmoil. 
President Megawati is scheduled to leave here on Tuesday for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Mexico, where she is scheduled to meet with President Bush to discuss terrorism. In an unusual challenge to a foreign president, Mr. Bush said last week that he hoped to "hear the resolve of a leader" when he sat down with Mrs. Megawati in Mexico. 
That is the question in Indonesia, too: Can the 55-year-old president of the world's most populous Muslim nation, who has spent much of her life as a housewife, change her modus operandi after 14 months on the job? Can she rule rather than reign?
"She has started to move, but not fast enough," said Jusuf Wanandi, the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. "She's trying to lead. She is now at last calling frequent cabinet and security meetings." 
Those cabinet meetings exposed the divisions within her government. They also underscored the balancing act Mrs. Megawati must try to carry off as she faces the international community over terrorism and as she faces re-election in 2004.
Overwhelming numbers of Indonesians practice a moderate form of Islam, but there are increasing calls for an Islamic state with Shariah law. President Megawati is in the contradictory position of wanting to avoid a harsh crackdown that might increase sympathies for the Islamists while avoiding looking too weak in the face of a challenge from her vice president, Hamzah Haz, who is likely to be an opponent in the 2004 contest, political analysts say. 
Mrs. Megawati was able to smooth the severe divisions in her cabinet last week and, finally, after a marathon cabinet session that ran until midnight last Friday, the government issued two new antiterrorism decrees that provide for sweeping powers of investigation and detention. They were laws that the United States had been urging on the government since last year. 
True to form, Mrs. Megawati did not speak publicly about the stern edicts she had been previously reluctant to push. But one thing was clear. She had somehow laid the political groundwork so that not only were there no immediate public protests, but the most important moderate Muslim leaders openly embraced the new laws.
Like a number of other leaders in Asia who are women, Mrs. Megawati ascended with the help of a political pedigree. But hers was a difficult rise, fraught with personal unhappiness and political persecution. 
She was born in 1947, in Yogyakarta, the intellectual center of Indonesia when it was still battling the Dutch. Her name means cloud, and she grew up in the pleasant surroundings of the presidential palace in Jakarta. Sukarno took her on his frequent trips abroad, including one to meet President John F. Kennedy. 
Apparently upset about the bloody overthrow of her father, Mrs. Megawati dropped out of college after only a year. Soon after her father's death in 1970, her first husband, Surindro Supjarso, an air force officer, was killed in a plane crash. She then eloped with an Egyptian diplomat, only to have the marriage annulled by her family. 
In 1973, she married her present husband, a businessman, Taufik Kiemas. After staying at home for more than a decade raising children, she joined her husband in running for Parliament in the mid-1980's as members of the opposition Democratic Party of Indonesia.
By 1999, largely on the power of her name as Sukarno's daughter, she had become the country's most popular politician. Her party won 35 percent of the votes in the first free elections since the 1950's.
But even though she was the top vote getter, Mrs. Megawati could not bring herself to negotiate with other political parties to form a government. She became vice president to Abdurrahman Wahid and, when Mr. Wahid's tenure ended amid impeachment charges last year, she emerged as president with a coalition that included Islamist politicians.
The broker behind all her political moves has been Mr. Taufik. As she has moved up the political ladder, he has moved from managing a chain of gas stations during the Suharto era to becoming the consummate dealmaker of his wife's administration. 
Until the attack in Bali, however, the dominant question in Indonesian politics was whether Mrs. Megawati's election prospects would survive the political damage from Mr. Taufik's business deals, American diplomats said. The perception that Mrs. Megawati is unable to move decisively against corruption does not help, nor does her announced ignorance of economic matters. For example, she referred during a recent foreign trip to applying the "housewife's management system" to the nation's economic problems.
Mrs. Megawati has proved a perplexing problem for the Bush administration. She was one of the first foreign leaders to see President Bush after the Sept. 11 attack, and promised to fight terror. But when she came home to a widespread anti-Americanism, she carefully distanced herself from Washington.
Last month, the White House dispatched Karen B. Brooks, 31, a specialist on Indonesia on the National Security Council, and the person Mrs. Megawati likes best in the administration. Only Ms. Brooks, it was reasoned, could persuade her that Qaeda-linked militant Islamic groups were operating in her country. Sadly, however, Mrs. Megawati took notice only after the deaths of more than 200 people in Bali, a senior American official lamented.

Making a Case for a U.S. Invasion of Iraq

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE THREATENING STORM
The Case for Invading Iraq
By Kenneth M. Pollack
Illustrated. 494 pages. Random House. $25.95
 In "The Threatening Storm," Kenneth M. Pollack makes what is very likely the best and strongest case that can be made for invading Iraq. His argument is not that it is desirable to send 200,000 American troops to Baghdad, but that an invasion is the least bad option faced by the United States -- the only option that can solve what Mr. Pollack presents as a dangerous and deteriorating situation that will only get worse as long as the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains in power. 
 It is fair to say that whatever your feelings about the question of Iraq, you owe it to yourself to read Mr. Pollack's book, which is both hawkish and judicious. Its essential argument is that the containment policy followed since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 -- consisting of economic sanctions, a continued American military presence in the Persian Gulf and United Nations weapons inspections -- is fast eroding. Sanctions are being circumvented by the rampant smuggling of Iraqi oil. The presence of American troops in the region, especially in Saudi Arabia, is breeding local resentment. Meanwhile, the most important element in the containment policy, United Nations inspection teams searching for and destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, ceased in 1998 and, in Mr. Pollack's view, is not likely to be effective even if revived.
What to do? Mr. Pollack reviews all the options, from doing essentially nothing to a military effort relying on anti-Hussein Iraqi resistance forces supported by devastating air strikes, somewhat like what was done with the Northern Alliance and the Taliban in Afghanistan. He reviews the pluses and minuses of each of the options, giving due weight to opinions contrary to his own, and then concludes: "The only prudent and realistic course of action left to the United States is to mount a full-scale invasion of Iraq to smash the Iraqi armed forces, depose Saddam's regime and rid the country of weapons of mass destruction."
Mr. Pollack spent the 90's studying this issue, first as an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and then as director of gulf affairs for the National Security Council. He is a man, in short, who knows his subject, and the implications of what he is arguing, most important the deaths of American soldiers and the expenditure of billions of dollars. "Every time I say or write this, I find myself wondering whether it is truly necessary," he declares of his pro-invasion conclusion. In this sense, his book reconstructs his own experience in studying the question of Iraq and how he arrived, even somewhat reluctantly, at his overall conclusion.
This does not mean that it is impossible to detect weaknesses in his argument. Mr. Pollack waxes positively rhapsodic about the benefits that would accrue once a democratic, pro-Western Iraq has arisen from Saddam Hussein's ashes, but while, as always, he demonstrates an awareness of the risks and costs of the nation-building that would be required, he glides a bit lightly over them. Put another way: he has no confidence in the ability of Western public opinion to pursue a containment policy over the long term, but he seems to have no doubt about the ability of public opinion to stay the course after Mr. Hussein has been safely disposed of. More generally perhaps, those who oppose an invasion will find that Mr. Pollack is more attuned to the dangers posed by an Iraq seeking nuclear weapons than he is to the dangers of an essentially unilateral invasion.
On the other hand, for those who have faith that a newly conceived, intrusive United Nations weapons-inspection regime can do the job will meet a tough challenge in this book. Mr. Pollack contends that any such effort would be a dangerous trap. Mr. Hussein would surely cooperate if troops were massed on his border and an invasion was otherwise unavoidable, but it would take far longer for inspections to work than it would be possible to maintain the credible threat of an invasion.
"All Saddam would need to do is wait until we were forced to start scaling back our forces in the region, and as the threat receded he would return to his past tactic of 'cheat and retreat' with the inspectors that served him so well in 1991-98," Mr. Pollack writes. 
Other matters are dealt with: Mr. Pollack measures the likelihood of a military success and what the best-case and worst-case American losses would be. He analyzes the attitudes of important other countries. He graphically describes the "pervasive climate of terror throughout the country, which is the linchpin of Iraqi totalitarianism." In short, Mr. Pollack has written a timely book that should be read as the public debate on Iraq continues.

HEADLINE: The Price of Stability 

BYLINE:  By Michael O'Hanlon; Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is now debating a postwar occupation of Iraq modeled on the United States occupation of Japan after World War II. Under this approach, Iraq would initially be ruled by an American military officer while a new Iraqi government is formed. Coalition military forces would perhaps remain in Iraq for years to make good on President Bush's promise of a post-Saddam Iraq where "the oppression of Kurds, of Assyrians, Turkomans, Shia, Sunnis and others will be lifted" and in which "the United States and our allies will help the Iraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of liberty."
 War is not yet inevitable, but if there is a war, rebuilding Iraq will have to be part of the planning. A prolonged occupation is reportedly unpopular with some Pentagon officials who prefer a quicker option by which the United States would invade Iraq, overthrow Saddam Hussein, pass power to a government-in-exile that would be brought back to Baghdad, and then withdraw its forces. 
 One view put forward by Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board, an advisory panel to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, is that a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq might resemble Romania after the fall of another tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu, at the end of the cold war. Under this model, Iraq would gradually struggle toward democracy on its own, remaining relatively stable in the process without the help of occupying forces.
However, the Romania analogy is highly optimistic given that country's relative ethnic homogeneity and the cohesion of the resistance movement that overthrew the Communist regime. For every Ceausescu, there is a Mobutu or a Tito whose death has contributed to the disintegration of his country.
If we overthrow Saddam Hussein and then quickly leave Iraq, civil war is likely. Some will seek retribution against elements of the old regime, like Republican Guard troops and Saddam Hussein's kinsmen from the Tikrit region. Those loyal to Mr. Hussein may try to reconstitute their power base once American forces leave. The Kurds might try to secede; Kurds and Sunni Muslims may fight for oil-rich Kirkuk in the north of the country. Such chaos could entice Iran into pursuing territorial gains in Iraq's oil-rich and Shiite south and make it possible for terrorist groups to find refuge and even gain access to some chemical or biological weapons in the ensuing chaos.
So making plans for a postwar occupation makes sense, though it would be wiser to have the United Nations administer the government rather than an American officer. But what level of military effort would such an occupation require? The United States has almost one million law enforcement officers for a population of just under 300 million. It used a comparable density of forces to police postwar Germany in the American occupation zone. Protecting and resettling refugees and internally displaced Iraqis, as well as searching for weapons of mass destruction, will also be labor intensive.
Based on past experience, stabilizing a country the size of Iraq with a population of more than 20 million people would require an occupation lasting several years and at least 100,000 foreign troops in the initial phase. Perhaps a quarter to a third of that force strength would be American troops, depending on how much allied help we could recruit, in which case annual costs to the United States might be $5 billion to $10 billion or more (on top of war costs likely to be in the vicinity of $50 billion). Costs could be even greater if the military has to increase its size to carry out this mission.
The good news is that most of the labor-intensive tasks could probably be completed within one to two years. Just as NATO's forces in Bosnia have declined to less than 20,000 from 50,000, an occupation force for Iraq might be reduced to 50,000 from 100,000 within a few years, with the American presence cut proportionately.
Even so, costs will be substantial and higher than anything publicly acknowledged by the administration so far. Until we face up to the very real possibility that a multiyear occupation will be needed, we have not yet accepted the reality of what war to overthrow Saddam Hussein could entail.

HEADLINE: Pataki Calls Commuter Tax a Bad Idea 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
With an uncomfortable-looking Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg standing by his side, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he did not support reinstating the commuter tax to help the city out of its fiscal crisis. 
 "Reimposing the commuter tax now would be extraordinarily counterproductive," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference in Harlem. As the governor spoke, Mr. Bloomberg, his Republican ally, drifted away from the lectern they were sharing, looked up at the sky and shifted his weight from foot to foot. 
 The mayor recently dropped his opposition to tax increases as he works to close the city's second $5 billion budget gap in a row, and his aides have made it clear that they would welcome the nearly $500 million that a commuter tax would generate.
The tax, which was levied on people who work in the city but live elsewhere, was repealed by the state in 1999 over the strong objections of city officials.
Mr. Pataki said that reinstating it would hamper the city's economic recovery.
"We have thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, that have been temporarily dislocated," he said. "And it's very important that we fight very hard to bring all those jobs back. And we can't do that if we're telling employers, we're telling employees, 'Come back to Lower Manhattan, come back to New York City, and by the way, we're going to hit you with a new tax.' "
When Mr. Bloomberg was asked to weigh in, he thanked the governor for his help in the past and stressed that his first order of business would to be to cut the city's expenses. He did not use the word "tax" once.

HEADLINE: 3M Reports 38% Increase In Net Income 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The 3M Company said today that its third-quarter net income increased 38 percent, the largest quarterly profit in five years.
 The company, which changed its name from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing in April, said that it cut costs and that sales increased in Asia, its fastest-growing market. 
 Net income rose to $545 million, or $1.38 a share, from $394 million, or 99 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 4.5 percent, to $4.14 billion from $3.96 billion. 
Revenue overseas rose 8.8 percent, while sales in the United States were little changed. About a quarter of 3M's sales are from Asia and about half in the United States.
The company reduced costs by changing the way it buys some material, including through auctions, the chief financial officer, Patrick D. Campbell, said.
W. James McNerney Jr., the chief executive since January 2001, is managing 2,500 cost-cutting projects, using methods he learned in his 18 years at General Electric.
Charles Carlson, a money manager at Horizon Investment Services in Indiana, said of today's report: "Volume wasn't bad outside of the U.S., but inside was a disappointment." He said Horizon did not hold 3M shares because the company "is pretty expensive considering the rate of top-line growth."
In New York Stock Exchange trading, shares of 3M, the largest component of the dollar-weighted Dow Jones industrial average, rose $3.69, to $129.
The company said it might take a $1 billion charge against equity for its pension plan in the fourth quarter. It added that last quarter it contributed $789 million to its United States pension fund.
3M said it did not see signs of the global economy improving. 
It projected the full year's net income to be in the range of $4.95 to $5 a share. Excluding certain benefits and costs, 3M said, profit will be $5.22 to $5.27 a share. Its previous estimate was for profit of $5.15 to $5.30. Fourth-quarter profit, 3M estimated, will rise to the range of $1.25 to $1.30 a share from 98 cents in the fourth quarter of 2001.

HEADLINE: Bush Sees Korean Nuclear Effort as Different From Iraq's 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had to disarm his nation "for the sake of peace," but indicated that he saw a significant difference between North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and Iraq's pursuit of them.
 In his first public remarks about North Korea since the White House announced last week that the country was conducting a covert nuclear weapons program, Mr. Bush said he would use diplomatic pressure, not threats of military action, to try to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear efforts. 
 "It is a troubling discovery, and it's a discovery that we intend to work with our friends to deal with," he told reporters in the Oval Office after a meeting with the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson. "I believe we can do it peacefully. I look forward to working with people to encourage them that we must convince Kim Jong Il to disarm for the sake of peace." 
In contrast, Mr. Bush said he was threatening military action against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq because his case was "unique" in that he had gassed his own people and "thumbed his nose" at United Nations resolutions for more than a decade.
The president's remarks reflected recent comments by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, that Iraq poses a greater threat to the United States, even if it does not yet have nuclear weapons, because of its record of using chemical weapons and its hatred of the United States and its allies.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush said that he viewed North Korea's admission "very seriously" and that he would work with the leaders of China, Japan, South Korea and Russia at an economic summit meeting of Pacific nations this weekend in Los Cabos, Mexico, to exert pressure on Mr. Kim.
The No. 2 official in North Korea made a public overture to the United States today, saying he was willing to negotiate over the country's nuclear weapons program "if the United States is willing to withdraw its hostile policy toward the North." American officials said they were uncertain how to respond to the overture by Kim Yong Nam, the country's nominal head of state. Mr. Kim made the offer during a meeting in Pyongyang, the North's capital, with a South Korean delegation.
For now, the administration remains embroiled in an internal debate over how and even if the United States should negotiate with North Korea. Hard-liners in the administration argue that the North should be required to dismantle its nuclear program before any talks can begin, but some State Department officials say negotiations will be necessary before the North can be induced to move. The administration is at the same time under growing pressure from Asian allies, which are urging that talks should begin.
A 1994 arms control accord between the United States, its allies and North Korea that might have served as a framework for talks is for all practical purposes dead, and has been ever since the North Koreans admitted to the United States early this month that they were conducting a secret nuclear program. At the same time, North Korea said it had "nullified" the 1994 accord, which provided Western energy aid in exchange for the North's promise to freeze the development of nuclear weapons. Today, senior administration officials said that because the North Koreans had walked away from the accord, the United States had no intention of honoring it.
Similarly, the European Union, which is helping finance the construction of two nuclear reactors in North Korea to generate electricity, promised under the accord, said today that it would almost certainly terminate support of the program.
"It is difficult in present circumstances to see how we can continue with our contributions unless the North Koreans make clear pretty rapidly that they are going to stop their attempts to develop nuclear weapons," Christopher Patten, the European Union's commissioner for external relations, said after a meeting with European foreign ministers.
In Moscow today, John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control, turned over a dossier of American intelligence on the North's clandestine project. Some American officials have suggested that Russian companies have been among the North's suppliers, though they indicated that the Russians provided less crucial technology than did Pakistan. 
After the meeting, the deputy Russian foreign minister, Georgi Mamedov, appeared to put the blame for the showdown with North Korea, at least in part, on the administration's new doctrine of military pre-emption and its inclusion of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil."
"We think that such statements may aggravate the situation and don't facilitate constructive solution of the nonproliferation issues," Mr. Mamedov said.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK SENATOR; 
For Hillary Clinton, A Dual Role as Star And as Subordinate

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
By all appearances, the rally and fund-raiser in the overcrowded hotel ballroom here the other night was for Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the Democratic candidate for governor. Yet Mrs. Townsend was not to be the star of her evening.
 That became clear when Hillary Rodham Clinton took the stage to an eruption of cheers and a shout from the crowd, "President Hillary Clinton!" And when Mrs. Clinton finished her speech -- a brass-knuckled appeal to vote Democratic this fall -- and stepped back to allow Mrs. Townsend her turn, people started drifting out of the hall. 
 But in the United States Senate these days, Mrs. Clinton has become known as anything but the star of the show. She is the celebrity senator who is forever offering to bring a colleague a cup of coffee, or volunteering to sit in as presiding officer in the deserted chamber on a Friday night, or stepping back at news conferences to let other senators speak. 
Two years after Mrs. Clinton left the White House, the former first lady has presented what would seem to be two very different personalities in the new orbits of her life, but in a clear pursuit of a single goal: To finally establish herself as her own power in Democratic politics and American government, at a time when there is renewed evidence that she remains a polarizing force in much of the nation today.
As Mrs. Townsend saw here, the senator from New York has emerged this fall as her party's single best fund-raising draw, a source of advice to candidates, a partisan cheerleader in what Democrats see as an increasingly tough election, and the only Democrat, other than perhaps her husband, who can pack a room.
Mrs. Clinton has campaigned, or held fund-raisers, on behalf of more than 30 Democratic candidates for the House and Senate who are in close races, as well as for three Washington-based Democratic campaign committees. She has donated $1 million from her own political action committee, out of the $2.5 million she has raised, to candidates of her choice across the nation.
In Washington, "Whitehaven," the five-bedroom Clinton home on Whitehaven Street near Embassy Row, has in these post-White House years become a conveyor belt of fund-raising dinners and receptions that Democratic candidates are clamoring to climb aboard. Some of the party's largest donors pay as much as $25,000 to eat dinner with Mrs. Clinton and occasionally Bill Clinton, in a tent set up in the sprawling gardens behind the house, or in the more intimate dining room inside. 
"She has done more to raise money for Democratic candidates than almost anyone else," said James M. Jordan of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Beyond that, at a time when the party is struggling to recover from its dispiriting defeat in the 2000 presidential election, and worried that what once seemed like a strong chance for a Democratic sweep in November may now be slipping away, Mrs. Clinton has positioned herself as a sometimes ferocious Democratic partisan, warning at every opportunity of the perils of a Republican sweep this fall. 
"The stakes are so high in this election -- I just have to impress upon you how critical this is," Mrs. Clinton said. "If we were to lose the Senate, there would be nothing standing between the Republican leadership and confirming the most extremist judges, in rolling back environmental regulations. And certainly, you might as well say goodbye to fiscal responsibility."
Yet if Mrs. Clinton is cheered in friendly places like Maryland, and has won over some members of the Senate, she remains in much of the country a highly polarizing and disliked figure: a symbol of liberal excess and Clinton misdeeds in the White House. Republicans continue to use her, to great success, to goad contributions from their mailing lists, and her name appears often in Republican television advertisements across the country.
Most recently, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is running two television advertisements -- one in Montana and one in Louisiana, at a cost of about $300,000 -- trying to tie the voting records of the Democratic incumbents in those states to hers. 
When Mrs. Clinton sought to help Jean Carnahan, a senator facing a tough re-election battle in Missouri, the Carnahan campaign chose an unusual venue to do it: a closed fund-raiser in Los Angeles. Mrs. Clinton has been pointedly absent on the campaign trail there and in much of the country.
And while Mrs. Clinton's name has been increasingly mentioned as a potential candidate for president in 2008, some of her closest supporters said that as of now, that remained unlikely. "Her image among average Americans is not likely to change anytime soon -- and it's a disproportionately negative image," one senior Democratic strategist said.
Still, Democrats were quick to note Mrs. Clinton's success at changing perceptions of her both in New York during the 2000 campaign and in the Senate today. And when it was suggested that she remains highly unpopular in large parts of the country, Mrs. Clinton smiled brightly and responded: "That's because they don't know me."
Mrs. Clinton's evolution both as a member of the Senate and as a power in her own right in the Democratic Party captures what friends describe as a complicated transformation she has undergone in the two years since she has left the White House. First in the Senate and now on the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has moved to establish her own personality and political orbit.
"It's a quantum leap," said one longtime friend, who asked not to be identified. "You see somebody who -- really for the first time probably since she was in law school, or married to Bill Clinton -- is basically able to reach for her limits. For the first time, she has been able to blossom in a way she was never able to do as a wife of a governor, wife of a president." 
By day, Mrs. Clinton has embarked on a meticulous effort to win acceptance in the Senate. She has treated more senior members of the Senate with deference, and regularly declines interviews that might accentuate her celebrity. And she has avoided the heated, partisan language that she uses in her campaign appeals.
Mrs. Clinton has sought to master the rules and traditions of the Senate in a way that one friend likened to the methodical approach Lyndon B. Johnson took as a Senate newcomer, ingratiating himself with the more senior Southern Democrats who ruled the body. (Johnson succeeded in becoming majority leader in his first term).
"The thing that has impressed me is sitting down at our Tuesday caucus meeting and watching her get up to get coffee and ask the other senators whether she could bring them back some coffee," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. "She aggressively avoids the spotlight and intentionally holds back, while most of us try to do the opposite."
"She is a very congenial colleague," said Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, sounding surprised at his own words.
Mrs. Clinton has approached other senators on the floor and asked to be co-sponsor of legislation that interested her, rather than trying to claim it on her own. She has identified herself with some national issues, like extending unemployment benefits, but also on issues of New York concern, including working with her senior colleague, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, to win federal assistance to rebuild downtown New York and help out the ailing economy upstate.
"There was a lot of feeling at the beginning of the term that she was going to Hollywood: klieg lights, high visibility," said Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. "In fact, she has been very hard-working, diligent and well-prepared."
By night, at Whitehaven, Mrs. Clinton has created what party officials describe as one of the most effective, and sought-after, fund-raising venues of the season. She has twice held back-to-back fund-raisers on the same night.
"It's like an event at the White House," said one senior Democratic Party official. "There is a big difference between going to a fund-raiser at Hillary Clinton's house and going to one at Ted Kennedy's house.'
Mrs. Clinton has also been a mentor for more junior Democrats. Christopher Van Hollen, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Maryland, said Mrs. Clinton pulled him aside when she was campaigning for him to suggest how he should unseat Representative Constance A. Morella. He should, she said, remind voters that a vote for Mrs. Morella was a vote for a Republican Congressional leadership, no matter how moderate Mrs. Morella might be.
Mrs. Clinton has to tread cautiously as she builds her own profile, mindful that critics have long warned that her goal in running for Senate is to obtain a platform to return to the White House. The favors she is collecting now would certainly benefit her if she does.
Mrs. Clinton pledged during her campaign that she would serve out her term, which would rule out 2004, though she has left open the possibility of running in 2008. "I'm not planning anything other than to be the best senator I can," she said.
Still, if Mrs. Clinton has changed over these last two years, she remains a cautious figure, at least in public. Her attacks on Republicans at private fund-raisers -- the ones where there are no cameras present -- are described by attendees as much more brutal and alarmist than her public statements.
In an interview at her office, Mrs. Clinton was critical of President Bush's economic policy but offered no criticism of his approach to Iraq, declining even to say if she, like many Democrats, was suspicious of the timing of the Iraq initiative.
Asked, for example, to discuss her view of the Democratic field for 2004, she responded: "Come talk to me when that election is as imminent as this election. I mean, I am so focused on the next three weeks."

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman ("Drilling for Freedom," column, Oct. 20) convincingly explains that Middle East tyrannies will end when their oil revenues decline. The United States can help this happen by consuming less fuel. 
 The only way the United States can reduce fuel use is to increase the fuel tax. Adding a nickel per gallon every month until the United States buys its last barrel of imported oil would cause no more than minor disruption of the economy. Yet fuel use would decline almost immediately. 
 Our political process refuses to discuss a tax increase, the only measure that can work. We are like a 300-pound patient asking a doctor how to lose weight but insisting that the answer must not mention eating or exercise.

HEADLINE: In Campaign, Subject of Race Is Banished To Background 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
In the campaign of H. Carl McCall, the first black candidate from a major party to run for governor in New York, there is no surer way to kill a conversation than to bring up the subject of race.
 Asked about it recently, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the dean of the New York Congressional delegation and an architect of Mr. McCall's campaign, said, "I'm not allowed to talk about race in this race." 
 Mr. McCall himself has consistently played down the subject. At a dinner two weeks ago for black journalists, he was asked if his race had limited his fund-raising. "Race is a factor in everything," he replied, moving swiftly to the next question. 
The moment summed up how subtle a role race has played in the campaign for governor. Although it cannot be discounted as an influence on voters, it is not something that either side has emphasized.
While the de-emphasis has so far spared Mr. McCall the divisive politics that marked Fernando Ferrer's run for mayor last year, some analysts say it has also cost him some crucial attention, national momentum and financial support.
"There's not this sense that there's this historic opportunity here," said Richard Schrader, a Democratic consultant. "To his credit, McCall has successfully crossed over. In order to get that, he's had to in a lot of ways -- very subtle ways -- deracialize these campaigns."
Mr. McCall, whose strategy has been honed by his two successful statewide runs for comptroller, said recently that there was a simple reason why he did not discuss his race more often: "It's so obvious. I mean, why do I have to talk about it?"
Gov. George E. Pataki, his Republican opponent, has also steered clear of the issue. Aides to Mr. McCall said they could cite no examples of even the back-channel racism sometimes employed in campaigns.
Some supporters say that this could actually cost Mr. McCall votes he needs to overcome Governor Pataki's inroads into the Democratic base. Though polls show that Mr. McCall will get most of the black vote, it usually goes to the Democratic candidate anyway. The issue is whether black voters will come out in greater numbers than they normally do.
"The question is, where's the energy in the black community for Carl McCall?" said Hank Scheinkopf, a longtime consultant who has worked on the McCall campaign.
Some Harlem residents said that Mr. McCall has not effectively reached out for their support, adding that they had seen Hillary Rodham Clinton more often when she was running for United States senator than they had seen Mr. McCall.
Sikhulu Shange, the owner of the 125th Street Record Shack, said yesterday that no one had offered him a McCall sign for his window, even though a news article on Sunday quoted him as saying he would be happy to have one. "I'm in the heartbeat of Harlem and I haven't seen no signs out here," Mr. Shange said.
Some contrast the seeming lack of street-level momentum with the Pataki campaign, which announced a development plan in Harlem yesterday. The governor has also made a point of learning Spanish and of reaching out to Latino voters. Yesterday, his daughter Emily opened an Amigos de Pataki office in Washington Heights.
Political scientists cite many reasons for the quiet submersion of race. Among them is the notion that black voters increasingly accept the fact that black candidates like Mr. McCall must win support from white liberals and moderates.
"There's also a generational change going on in the black community, where symbolism matters less than actual performance," Mr. Scheinkopf said. "There's a new maturity."
Andrew M. Cuomo, who dropped out of the primary against Mr. McCall, felt that race was still enough of a factor to have prevented him from attacking Mr. McCall for fear of being perceived as racist.
And no Democrat, least of all Mr. Rangel, who persuaded Mr. Cuomo to drop out, wanted race to erupt as it did last year, when the supporters of Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, said that supporters of Mark Green, his opponent in the mayoral run-off, had used coded language to scare white voters. A cartoon suggested that Mr. Ferrer was beholden to the Rev. Al Sharpton.
This year, many analysts say, Mr. McCall has kept Mr. Sharpton at arm's length.
Not true, according to Mr. Sharpton. "I've done more with Carl McCall than I did with Freddy Ferrer," he said. The difference is, he said, that no one has made it an issue.
"Some people learned last year that where they thought they could incite a white backlash vote, they instead incited a black and Latino backlash vote against playing what appeared to us to be the race card," he said. "You've not seen Pataki trying to play that card."
In fact, Governor Pataki is the only person in this race who has been attacked for his association with Mr. Sharpton. Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, mailed out literature pointing out that both had gone to Vieques, Puerto Rico, to condemn the Navy bombing there.
Mr. Pataki has so scrupulously avoided charges of racism that in a recent attack ad, an official state photo of Mr. McCall was used instead of one that might have been perceived as deliberately unflattering.
"Pataki has chosen to try to define Carl as a white liberal," said Mr. Schrader, the consultant. "Because he's beaten two white liberals, Mario Cuomo and Peter Vallone."
Still, Mr. Pataki offered one of the few overt comments about race, one that was perceived variously as a magnanimous gesture or a cynical attempt to draw attention to the fact that Mr. McCall is not white.
"I'm proud as well that the Democratic Party has made a historic move in nominating the first African-American to be the governor of this state," Mr. Pataki said at a union rally a few weeks ago. "We should all be proud of that."
Mr. McCall is very different from minority candidates of the past. He does not speak of the "gorgeous mosaic" of diversity central to the campaign of David N. Dinkins, the first black mayor of New York City. Nor does he mention, as Mr. Ferrer did, "the other New York."
Yet if Mr. McCall has not played the race card, he sometimes acts as if he has it tucked up his sleeve.
Mr. Dinkins describes how Mr. McCall addresses black audiences. On occasion Mr. McCall says, " 'You have a chance to make history,' " Mr. Dinkins said. "He says: 'You can elect the first governor who's a minister. You can elect the first governor who's been the president of the Board of Education.' The audience kind of chuckles. He doesn't say, 'You can elect the first black governor.' "
At a Congressional Black Caucus dinner, Mr. McCall attracted only a smattering of applause when Al Gore mentioned him onstage. And national money has been slow to pour in.
"It's been assumed, and the polls have supported it, that he's probably not going to win," said David A. Bositis, a senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Politics and Economic Studies in Washington and an expert on black political candidates. "And that really has, if anything, deflated the enthusiasm about the historical nature of it."

HEADLINE: NEW LOOKS; 
Bumper-to-Bumper Details of the Crossover Era

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON; Phil Patton is the author of, most recently, "Bug: The Strange Mutations of the World's Most Popular Automobile."

 BODY:
AMERICANS want more space in their vehicles without adding length. They also want a single vehicle to play the role of many. Those conflicting demands make these the toughest times for car designers since the late 1970's, when fuel crises forced sudden downsizing. Designers now speak of "crossovers" -- vehicles that are part truck and part car, part sport utility vehicle and part sports car. 
 This century, in fact, began with one failed crossover experiment, the Pontiac Aztek, which is already legendary for its ugliness, and another that succeeded beyond expectations: the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Both offered many of the same elements -- generous, versatile interior space wrapped in forms suggesting sports-car handling. 
 Crossbreeding of types has led to crossbreeding of styles. There's the Ford Sport Trac model of the Explorer, for instance, which is an S.U.V. with a pickup bed. Chrysler is readying the Pacifica, due out next year, and Mercedes-Benz the Grand Sports Tourer in 2005; both are minivans with S.U.V. height. 
More experiments lie ahead, marriages of traditional shapes that have never bonded before. "Is it going to be Princess Bride," asked Daniel A. Gorrell of Strategic Vision, a San Diego company that tracks customer attitudes toward automobiles, "or the Bride of Frankenstein?" 
In the 40's, cars had distinctive rounded, Moderne lines. In the 50's, it was tail fins. In the 80's, it was the aero, or "bar of soap" look. Pinning down what is distinctive in today's crossover era is trickier, but here are some stylistic influences. 

The Hatch Is Back
The rear hatch door, long detested as a relic of the downsized econobox, has come back. And why not? A rear door that opens upward makes sense, offering easy entry to small cars and, when the rear seats are folded, storage for large objects. Hatchbacks appear in models of the Suzuki Aerio, Mazda MP3 and Protege and the Honda Civic Si. Ford's Focus, especially in its Special Vehicle Team version, combines the hatch with racy rear taillights to make an economy car look sporty. The hatch also shows up in the Pontiac Vibe (above) and the Toyota Matrix, siblings that many consider the most successful crossover designs so far because of their height, interior space and agile handling. Paradoxically, Saab, which for years kept producing hatchback styles when the rear door was in disfavor, has abandoned it in its latest 9-3 model.

Car-Truck or the Return of the El Camino?
We remain a nation of truck drivers. The best-selling vehicle in America is still the Ford F-Series pickup. But pickups have been turning into passenger vehicles for a while now. Most can hold four passengers, either in a small back seat or with four full doors in the "crew cab." A new generation of car-truck hybrids is making the distinction between car and truck hazier. Chevrolet, which produced the El Camino, an early version of a sport pickup, almost 50 years ago, has updated it with two models -- the SSR (for Super Sport Roadster), to be issued early next year, and the Avalanche (below), which offers a folding partition between passenger cab and bed. The old El Camino had many fans, but was never a star car. The Avalanche, Cadillac Escalade EXT pickup and Subaru Baja have already far surpassed it in popularity.

Big Wheels
The larger the wheels, the more macho a car's image. Which explains why the wheels of all but the smallest econocars have been gradually growing over the last decade. These days, manufacturers are offering even larger wheels as factory options and sales of huge, custom wheels have increased exponentially, especially for trucks and S.U.V.'s.
Tire and parts dealers sell an astounding variety of sizes and patterns, notably 19- and 20-inch models in bright chrome. Favored by celebrities, and most frequently seen on Cadillac Escalades, Lincoln Navigators and other large S.U.V.'s, they are the stylistic equivalent of the wide whitewall tires of a generation ago. Big wheels have their own style and slang. Twenty-three-inch models are known as "Jordans" -- after the basketball star's number -- and fetching faceted patterns suggesting Cuisinart blades are called "slice and dicers."

The Bentley Back
No styling feature of recent years caused more controversy than the raised trunk of the new BMW 7 Series, right, which appeared in the United States earlier this year. Condemned as a "hunchback," the high rear end suggested a last-minute compromise between the designer and the trunk-space committee. But combining rear-end aerodynamics with adequate storage has produced many higher backs in cars, some jarring and awkward. Designers are groping for a solution. High backs look stiff and stern, as on many small cars, or sliced off, as on Volvo sedans. But history offers solutions. BMW's rear bears an accidental resemblance to the Bentley of an earlier age. The back end of the Hyundai XG350, the South Korean maker's top model, bears an intentional resemblance to the Bentley -- an economy car's claim to elegance. 

Matte-Metal Interiors
Apparently weary of gray plastic and black knobs, many drivers have signaled a thumbs up to Audi and Volkswagen, whose simple black and brushed-aluminum interiors are part Bauhaus, part Krups coffee maker. The Germans have set a standard for simplicity and elegance at comparatively low cost, which many American and Japanese interior designers are trying to match. The new Lincoln Navigator, for instance, plays down traditional chrome and wood in favor of matte-surfaced metallic parts it calls "nickel," giving a higher-tech, richer look (above). Actually an advanced, rugged plastic with a metallic surface, the material echoes the look that is currently popular in small electronic devices, like cellphones and MP3 players. The 1990's brought more chrome, inside and out. Now, in a less upbeat time, the metal is literally less flashy. 

Hot Color: Sport Yellow
Soft, pale yellows vanished from the auto palette a decade ago, but a yellow as bright as a beach ball has long been reserved as a signal of sportiness. On a Mustang or a New Beetle, it was a rare, eye-catching, self-advertising color for people with outgoing personalities. Manufacturers are currently moving it to the center of their plans. Hummer's ads for the new H2 model (below), a smaller but still hefty version of the S.U.V. made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger, show only the sport-yellow models. The Suzuki Aerio, Mazda MP3 and Protege and Mitsubishi Lancer (below, bottom) balance their low prices by pushing yellow models that suggest raceworthy performance, and Chevrolet will be using the color to emphasize the sportiness of its new hybrid SSR pickup (in the middle, below). 
Next to return: the bold oranges of the 70's.

The Honeycomb Grille
 Grilles offer subtle, even subliminal signals about the vehicles they front. Jaguars, notably the new S-Type R model, and Bentleys evoke nobility with grilles that recall a knight's chain mail. Rolled metal, perforated grilles on Mercedes's M Class S.U.V. or the Mercedes SLK sports car, radiate vigor. Ford and Nissan trucks and the Toyota Matrix (above) offer grilles in a pattern of joined hexagons, like honeycombs, suggesting the industry of the honeybee, and perhaps its efficiency. 

Complex Headlights
Designers think of headlights as the eyes of a car. In Chryslers, Mercedeses and Chevrolets, complex arrangements of tubular mirrors and lenses give several new models a staring expression. Using high-intensity discharge lamps with a bluish glow that first showed up in BMW and other European makes (as well as other advanced lighting systems), these headlights suggest that the car is packed with sensational gadgetry. 
Such headlights appear behind faceted front glass in Cadillac's CTS sedan, introduced last year, and its new XLR roadster. The Range Rover uses a pattern of overlapping circular lights (left) to contrast with its boxy lines. The Nissan Altima offers a set of crystalline tubes that make it look aggressive. 

Riding High
Because of S.U.V.'s, drivers have become used to sitting higher up and seeing farther down the road. That broader vantage point is particularly popular with women, said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J. Now, the height of the driver's seat -- the "H point" or "hip point," as designers call it -- is moving up. Higher "command position" seating was critical to the shape of the Pontiac Vibe crossover (below), with its sibling Toyota Matrix, said John Mack, who designed the Vibe.
The Ford Motor Company's chief designer, J Mays, has made the high H point a crucial element of Ford's 500 family sedan, due out in 2004. 

The Rubber Boot Look
Dark, thick-looking cladding, like rubber bumpers, has become a universal signal of toughness in cars, emulating the protective rims on outdoor shoes. 
As the station wagon and S.U.V. blend together in such vehicles as the Audi Allroad, the Volvo Cross Country and Volvo XC90 (left), more wagons are wearing these lower body guards, apparently ready to defeat rock and mud. Because these sport wagons are several inches higher than their less-rugged cousins, it seems as if they have rolled up their trouser legs for wading, and the dark cladding enhances the effect, as if they have put on L. L. Bean boots. Although the cladding resembles rubber, it is usually made up of thermoplastic olefin and other materials more symbolic than functional. And it is far from impervious to nicks and scrapes. 

Jeweled Taillights
 In 1997, Jaguar's S-Type introduced a stunning taillight composed of intersecting ovals of orange and red that rendered in miniature the flowing, ovoid shapes of the car's body. Now, the cost of such lenses has dropped, thanks to computer aided design, and far humbler models, like Toyota's new Corolla, above, or Daewoo's Lanos, offer them. Such lights, said Gerhard Steinle, the president of Prisma Design International, a design studio in Tustin, Calif., are "the jewelry of automobiles" -- costume jewelry, that is, making inexpensive cars look richer.

HEADLINE: THE ENVIRONMENT; 
Ford Gives River Rouge a Green Coat

BYLINE:  By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
SINCE 1918 around Detroit, the words "River Rouge" and "Ford" have been associated with simple, traditional things: steel, coal, cars, trucks, smoke, soot and jobs. Now it means sedum, too. 
 At a time when nearly all of the auto industry's attention has been focused on the tumbling stock price and multibillion-dollar losses at the Ford Motor Company, the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., has created a buzz by installing sedum, a rugged plant that is used as ground cover, in an unlikely place -- on the roof of a new 1.1-million-square-foot assembly plant in the River Rouge complex here. 
 On Oct. 4, the first thin sheets of sedum, which absorb heat and water, were put in place. In the next months more than 10 acres -- 454,000 square feet -- of sedum will be rolled out, watered and encouraged to thrive on the world's largest "living" roof. The roof -- a centerpiece of an innovative and potentially risky $2 billion redevelopment project that will take 20 years to complete -- will cool the factory inside during the summer and keep things toasty in winter, reducing the amount of energy needed to maintain working temperature in the building. The roof will also cleanse rainwater flowing off the building. 
The roof is also drawing attention because of what it represents. The sedum feeds into a yearlong debate over which Mr. Ford is operating his family's company: is he the self-proclaimed environmentalist who has raised hopes among advocacy groups, or is he the cost-cutting truck lover whose new slogan is "No Boundaries"?
In 1999, when Mr. Ford announced his vision to "transform a 20th-century industrial icon into a model of 21st-century sustainable manufacturing," few people beyond the company's front office knew what to make of it.
But as the River Rouge modernization project (which includes a new assembly factory and updates on some existing buildings) evolves from ambitious concept to actual construction, the plant's 7,000 workers and millions of Detroit-area residents are beginning to recognize a significance that extends beyond the plant's walls. The entrance to the complex is being transformed into a 1.5-mile-long green boulevard with 22 acres of wetlands, trees and shrubs. Some 1,500 trees and other plantings are starting to surround the new assembly plant. To control rainwater and pollutants, the plant's 15-acre parking lot is covered with a porous surface through which water is filtered, cleansed and stored in underground basins to be slowly released into the canals and wetlands. 
All across the Rouge complex shallow drainage canals and multiple artificial wetlands are being built and seeded with indigenous plants. The exterior greenery, wetlands and canals are designed to use nature's ability to soak up and cleanse rainwater that drains into the nearby Rouge River. This "green" approach is designed to save Ford $35 million, when compared with the cost of installing a conventional water-treatment system. The plant's walls will be covered with ivy to produce oxygen and help cool the building.
Inside the new assembly plant, Ford is preparing to install equipment capable of producing up to nine different vehicle models. This "flexible" factory is designed to save money and drastically reduce waste by making it much easier to retool to manufacture different models. Ford says the plant will use space more efficiently because parts will be installed soon after they arrive and 90 percent of vehicles will be shipped the day they are completed. 
"People are going to be astounded at how well these systems work," said William McDonough, an architect in Charlottesville, Va., who was chosen by Mr. Ford to lead the design team. He says the immense scale of Ford's project could elevate green manufacturing principles from a useful niche to a mainstream industrial movement.
The living roof, for instance, costs roughly the same as a conventional roof but is expected to last twice as long because it will not expand during the day and shrink at night. (Like ivy, it will need minimal maintenance.) Its insulating capacity will help Ford reduce the amount of ventilation duct work by 40 percent. It will store four million gallons of rainwater, eliminating pollutants that would ordinarily pour off the roof and straight into the river. Skylights will provide the plant with so much natural light that Ford engineers anticipate turning off half of the interior lights during the day, saving nearly $50,000 annually. 
Environmental leaders say they admire what Ford is doing at the Rouge plant -- renamed the Ford Rouge Center -- but call for the same pollution-reducing principles to be applied across the company's policies and product line. Several environmentalists said, for instance, that Ford fought hard earlier this year to block Congress from enacting higher fuel economy standards.
"The environmental impact of cars comes in three stages -- manufacturing, use and disposal," said Lana Pollack, the president of the Michigan Environmental Council in Lansing. "Ford is making great strides in the first. We've yet to see any tangible progress in the second and third, and that's where it really counts."
INDUSTRY analysts say they are waiting for the plant to begin production before making a judgment. "Internally, Ford thinks this project will help them," said Bruce Belzowksi, a senior research associate at the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation in Ann Arbor. "But the industry and the analysts will judge this after it's been in action for a while."
There is little dispute, however, that Ford's aim to increase production of vehicles with new, energy-efficient technology, while substantially reducing air and water pollution, represents a realistic paradigm in American industry. It's a model that Mr. Ford is pushing in the very same place that his great-grandfather invented the concept of "vertical integration" and set the worldwide standard for manufacturing innovation that endured for more than 50 years. 
Ford's 1,100-acre River Rouge plant opened in 1918 and began to turn iron and other raw materials into completed cars. To the relief of most people in southeast Michigan, the factory remains open and among the largest employers in the Detroit region. That is not taken for granted in a city and a state numbed by companies that closed obsolete plants and sent tens of thousands of high-paying auto jobs to the South and overseas. "While most companies would rather move than invest in an 83-year-old site," Mr. Ford said two years ago, "we view this as an important reinvestment in our employees, our hometown."
Ford officials say that the River Rouge plans are a notable exception to the deep retrenchments that were caused by the company's money troubles. "When we started this, we were flush with money and it was easy to get going," said Donald Russell, the manufacturing sustainability manager who is overseeing the assembly plant's new roof. "The chairman is 100 percent behind us and we haven't left off anything that we wanted to do. The main components are all intact." 
Ford is not alone in the idea of improving Detroit's economic competitiveness by cleaning up and restoring the region's waterways, especially the Rouge River. Ford's plant, which sits on a bend just upstream from where the Rouge empties into the Detroit River, is essential to the project and the region's economic health, city officials say.
More than $535 million in federal, state and local grants have been invested in making the Rouge River, once one of the country's dirtiest, clean enough to swim in and beautiful enough to attract new residents, businesses and visitors. The work is slow and expensive, but after nearly a decade of planting trees, controlling rainwater, restoring wetlands and improving parks, the Rouge is clean enough to support a small sport fishery and its banks are much greener. Mr. Ford is the chairman of one of the committees that oversees the cleanup.
Still, even as Ford's new and cleaner factory attracts national attention, Mr. Ford acknowledges that his work is viewed skeptically in another arena critical to the company's success: Wall Street. Nevertheless, Mr. Ford says he is convinced that the green measures will have a tangible payoff. "It's still a tough sell," he said in an interview published on the company's Web site. "I do believe that I'm building a stronger Ford Motor Company for my children and my grandchildren."

HEADLINE: NEW LOOKS; 
Niche Mania!

BYLINE:  By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
WHEN Janis Joplin implored the Lord for a Mercedes-Benz, no further elaboration was necessary. At the time, three decades ago, the Mercedes was a symbol in this country of precise engineering, exacting quality and exclusivity. The cars came in four basic sizes, in about a dozen variations, all of them expensive. To most Americans, buying a Benz required divine intervention.
 But like other automakers who have expanded their reach by moving upscale or down-market or both, even Mercedes has scrambled its mix. Today, a modestly successful blues belter can probably swing the monthly lease payments on a C230 Sports Coupe, which at $25,000 and up costs no more than certain Honda Accords. Sport utility vehicles bearing the Mercedes three-pointed star shuttle junior-hockey players through middle-class suburbs. A would-be Mercedes buyer has to choose among nearly 40 distinct models in 9 car and truck lines, with more on the way. 
 Mercedes is hardly alone in expanding its reach. After the small BMW 1 Series arrives in 2004, its dealers will offer nearly three dozen models, beginning barely above $20,000. American and Japanese manufacturers -- indeed, the British, South Koreans and Swedes, too -- are also offering far more vehicles across much broader price spreads than ever before. Automotive News, a trade publication, counted 1,314 specific vehicle models in the United States for 2002, an increase of 42 percent in five years. 
This abundant supply is driven by customer demand for more and more variety, as Americans treat automobiles as fashion accessories and image enhancers. And after years of dreary sameness, individual automakers are so eager to expand their turf that they are working overtime to dream up new market niches that they can fill.
"The car industry is really a fashion business, more than ever before," said Christopher Cedergren, an industry analyst with NexTrend, of Thousand Oaks, Calif. He said that Americans "wear" their cars, and that "customers are fickle, and they are going to go with the latest craze."
 This fragmentation is taking automakers to places where they have never been, and until recently would never have thought of going. Volkswagen, whose very name means "people's car," is on the verge of offering a huge luxury sedan, the Phaeton, with a price approaching $100,000. Porsche, a name synonymous with fast, expensive rear-engine sports cars, is bringing out a sport utility, albeit one that can reach 165 miles an hour. (In the past, Porsches went off-roading mainly when the drivers' skills failed to match the cars' high-speed abilities.) Although General Motors executives haughtily insisted a few years ago that Cadillac would never make a truck, G.M.'s luxury division is putting the final touches on its fourth utility vehicle, the SRX.
 Car companies are not just expanding their reach, they are slicing and dicing their cars and trucks to fit ever narrower niches where they hope to find ever more buyers.
If you are a 22-year-old mountain biker, Nissan has an Xterra for you. If you are 50-something and want to recapture lost youth, you might like a Ford Thunderbird that reminds you of the cool convertible your uncle bought when you were 11. If you are one of the world's 8,000 titans of capitalism with more than $30 million in "investable assets," you might like the ultraluxurious Maybach in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. (Easy-payment plans are not available.)
If consumers find all this confusing, they can be excused; the automakers themselves often seem unsure of what their brands stand for in a mixed-up market where change is constant, cars can be trucks and trucks can be cars and the future is as murky as a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude. Not long ago, the quintessential Cadillac was a bloated, baroque Sedan de Ville, but with dealers selling trim European-style sedans, fancy pickups and, soon, luxury roadsters, what image does the Cadillac name conjure up today?
The other force behind the trend is enduring overcapacity -- auto plants around the world can produce 20 million more vehicles this year than consumers are likely to buy. This increases competition in the market's hot spots -- like $20,000 family sedans, $30,000 midsize "near luxury" cars or $40,000 sport utilities. This is pushing automakers in opposite directions: adding more models in higher price ranges, where profits are larger, and trying to lure younger, less affluent customers with cheaper models.
Joseph Phillippi, president of AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J., said that the approximately 30 companies selling cars in the United States were all aiming to increase their share of a mature market that has been growing, on average, only about half a percent a year. "What we are seeing is a continual effort on the part of all competitors to come up with unique, different ideas."
There's a technological angle, too: much of the proliferation stems from the automakers' increasing skills at adapting vehicle platforms, which is the foundation of a car or truck design, to a wide variety of models of various sizes and body styles. (The basic Ford F-Series pickup comprises 118 models, by Automotive News's reckoning.)
While it is nothing new for automakers to play Mr. Potato Head by sticking on different grilles and nameplates -- "badge engineering" in industry parlance -- the adaptations go beyond restyling a Buick Regal and calling it a Pontiac Grand Prix. Increasingly, the DNA of a car is injected into a truck, or vice versa, in design studios that dabble in automotive genetic engineering.

Everybody Wants a Truck
Nowhere is transplantation more obvious than in the world of light trucks, including the ubiquitous sport utility vehicle. S.U.V.'s used to be niche vehicles, like early Jeeps, that were designed for the fairly small universe of people who truly did work or played off the beaten path. Those who did not usually found them too rugged, slow and uncomfortable for regular use on paved roads.
Now, light trucks make up the majority of new vehicles that are sold in the United States, and the segment has evolved into a world of niches. Automotive News counts 769 truck models on the market, compared with 545 cars.
G.M.'s full-size truck family includes Chevrolet and GMC pickups in a head-spinning array of combinations -- different cab sizes, wheelbase lengths, cargo beds, engines and transmissions, light-service or heavy-duty versions, trim ranging from vinyl-plain to gentleman's-club plush. And that same truck platform supports a herd of big Chevy, GMC and Cadillac S.U.V.'s, as well as the smaller, gentler-driving Hummer, called the H2, and the Avalanche and Cadillac Escalade EXT -- essentially sport utilities with pickup beds.
Like its main competitors, G.M. is playing three-dimensional chess. There is value in occupying a space, if only to keep a rival from landing there. Being first in a new niche with a new type of vehicle like the Avalanche means you have the market to yourself until the competition catches up. Meanwhile, you define the niche and play to your strengths.
Trucks in general, and S.U.V.'s in particular, have kept Detroit booming even as the Big Three have given up more than half of the passenger-car market to foreign rivals. But the Japanese are closing in.
Toyota, for instance, offers five S.U.V.'s, or car-based sport utility wagons, and its Lexus division sells three more. Jim Press, the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, recently hinted that three more models might be coming, along with some lower-volume niche utilities.
"There's no end to the number of S.U.V. cues you can have," he said. "Cells of customers are attracted to specific products, as opposed to products that are one-size-fits-all."

Crossing Over
In the world's automotive capitals, imitation is the sincerest form of competition. When one company strikes gold in a new niche, rivals show up like forty-niners to stake their own claims.
 Thus, there are currently more than a dozen roadster models, following the path of the Mazda Miata. The Volkswagen Beetle's phenomenal return inspired other retro favorites: the Chrysler PT Cruiser with its Jimmy Cagney style; the Mini Cooper, a flashback to London in the mod 60's; and the reborn two-seat T-Bird.
Subaru set off the stampede into cars that look tough but ride tender by raising the body of its Legacy station wagon and adding sport-utility trim like plastic-covered lower body panels. Presto! The car was reborn as a pseudo-S.U.V. called the Outback, which played on Americans' fascination with all things Australian in the wake of "Crocodile Dundee." Sales soared and more Outbacks were created, based on other models and body styles.
Volvo took note, and turned a version of its V70 wagon into the Cross Country; Audi transformed its A6 Avant into the Allroad.
In the auto industry, combination vehicles like these are called "crossovers," and they are red-hot. There are combination car-S.U.V.'s like the Acura MDX and Toyota Highlander; minivan-S.U.V.'s like the Buick Rendezvous and the yet-to-arrive Chrysler Pacifica; and car-pickups including the Subaru Baja, which looks like a shrunken Avalanche. With its retractable roof, the sporty Chevy SSR, due out early next year, could be called a combination roadster-pickup. The Porsche Cayenne is a sports car-sport utility.
Quite often, the aim of these crossovers is to create a new niche -- a specialized product that will make customers say, "Why didn't they think of that before?"

Cars for the Young and Restless
Another crossover vehicle, the Pontiac Aztek, illustrates -- none too prettily -- the pitfalls of trying to change a tiger's stripes. Designers' attempts to hide the Aztek's minivan origins simply made it look bizarre, and its sales have been disappointing despite its innovative interior features. These include a removable center console that doubles as a picnic cooler; a cargo floor full of pop-up-storage modules; stereo controls in the rear compartment; and an optional tent that transforms the Aztek into an impromptu motel room. So, the Aztek remains alone in a niche that might be called "crossover minivan-based vehicle for partying and sleeping."
The Aztek also illustrates how designers are searching for cars that will press the buttons of the echo boom generation. This group of 70 million potential customers, currently aged 8 to 25, represents the largest demographic bulge since the baby boomers. But market researchers say echo boomers will be tough customers, demanding and fickle, with an independent streak and an aversion to the usual marketing campaigns.
With them in mind, Toyota -- whose average customer is 45 -- has gone so far as to create a new division in this country, called Scion. The first Scions will go on sale next year in dedicated areas within Toyota dealerships. (Toyota's experiment in selling youth-oriented cars in Japan has been sobering; after an initial burst of interest, sales fell short of expectations.) 
What do youngsters want? Many designers think they want a box that moves, with a lot of room for their friends and their possessions. So, there will be a boxy Scion, and Honda is thinking along those lines with its new Element, which company executives have characterized as a "dorm room on wheels." A box with straight sides and double doors that open from the center to create a grand, unobstructed opening, the Element's interior is cavernous, especially if the rear seats are folded up against the wall.
Nissan and Mazda, among others, have also displayed design studies for "box cars." Sporty coupes with punishing back seats and dinky trunks, the favored design of young people in the 60's and 70's, will not do.

Extra Frosting, for a Price
Their numbers might not be great, but buyers of sporty cars are still around, and these enthusiasts are coveted customers, on the theory that their relatives, friends and neighbors seek them out for car-buying advice. In many cases, they are willing to pay substantially extra for a little more performance -- and the status that a special-edition car can confer. The M5 badge on a BMW may not mean anything to Aunt Bertha, but gearhead cousin Vinnie knows that the car has a 394-horsepower V-8, a race-tuned suspension, a $70,000 sticker price and a long waiting list.
 For years, BMW has produced low-volume cars like the M5 through its Motorsport division, and Mercedes has done so through its AMG operation. Both units "tune" conventional cars for exceptional performance, substituting brawny engines, brakes and suspension parts, along with special trim and nameplates.
Other import brands have jumped in with high-caffeine variants of their cars. In Detroit, Ford's Special Vehicle Team, known as S.V.T., has won raves with its high-performance tweaking. In its hands, an F-150 pickup became the SVT Lightning, which will take a cowpoke around the ranch in record time. The Focus SVT is an economy car transformed, Cinderella-style, into a quick, nimble Euro-style sports machine.
G.M. and Chrysler are setting up their own tuning divisions. One of the first products of G.M.'s performance unit will be the Silverado SS, a 345-horsepower pickup that borrows its initials from those imprinted on Chevy muscle cars of the 60's.
The Japanese are thinking fast, too. The Impreza WRX, a version of a Subaru used in rally racing overseas, has been a huge hit among civilians, and Mitsubishi also plans to import a rally car.

The Image Is Everything
The ultimate niche vehicles are "halo" cars, distinctive, limited-production vehicles designed to excite the public, draw shoppers into showrooms and cast a glow over a company's more mundane models. Ford is heavily promoting the return of its GT40, an updated street version of a legendary 60's racecar, and Chevy has gone further back for inspiration, to its 1949 pickup, in designing its jaunty SSR sport truck.
Sometimes the strategy works, sometimes not. The Viper, a sledgehammer of a muscle car with a V-10 engine, helped to give a gutsy, sporty image to the entire Dodge line. But some previous attempts, like the limited-run Cadillac Allante of a decade ago, fell flat.
Halo cars alone cannot invigorate otherwise boring car lines, said Mr. Cedergren, the NexTrend analyst. The Prowler, a crowd-stopping reinterpretation of a custom street rod, couldn't save Chrysler's Plymouth brand from extinction.
Nor has the plush Blackwood pickup helped Lincoln in its continuing attempts to redefine itself. The luxury division of Ford Motor, Lincoln struck gold in 1998 with its huge Navigator sport utility, forcing Cadillac to play copycat. But the $53,000 pickup version sold so poorly that production was quickly canceled in record time. The Blackwood's high style made it almost useless as a truck. A hinged, power-operated lid over its pickup bed, for instance, impressed passersby but limited the size of any items the truck might carry, and the pickup bed's gleaming stainless-steel lining was vulnerable to shifting cargo.
Sometimes, the car stars that burn brightest turn cool the fastest. New Beetles literally stopped traffic in 1998, but now they seem nothing special, and sales have plunged. VW has added more variations to revive interest, including a speedy Turbo Beetle; a convertible is due out soon. The PT Cruiser is on the same slope; Chrysler is adding a PT Turbo and a convertible to perk up interest.

Luxury for Everyone
Like designer clothing, automobiles with luxury labels aren't just for the rich anymore. The greatest growth in car and truck sales has been among high-end brands.
 But since the common econobox comes with features that were once found only in luxury cars -- air-conditioning, remote-control locks, CD players, power windows -- what is a luxury car today?
Often, the distinction is in the name. A top-of-the-line Toyota Camry XLE is pretty much the same car as a Lexus ES 300, which costs $6,000 more. But the cars are categorized differently: the Camry is a midsize family sedan, and the ES 300 is an "entry luxury," or "near luxury" sedan. This category, with prices from the high $20,000's to around $40,000, is fiercely competitive, crowded with models from most automakers.
Instant gratification is the theme in this market. People who might have once said, "Someday, I am going to drive a Jaguar," now can, with X-Type leases of $399 a month.
 It was pressure from Japanese luxury brands like Lexus in the early 90's that pushed Mercedes into the mass market. Instead of designing and engineering its cars to the highest of standards, and charging premium prices for them, the company started to design its cars so that they would sell at target prices, as volume manufacturers do. 
Prices of Mercedes became much more competitive as sales jumped, but at the expense of some prestige. The company's ranking in quality surveys started to fall, particularly after the arrival of the M-Class sport utility in 1997.
As Mercedes and other luxury imports have moved down the price scale, they are meeting other brands, including the South Koreans, trying to move up. Hyundai, which has transformed itself from a joke to a juggernaut, has successfully expanded from subcompacts to a range of cars (and a utility wagon) that tops out in the upper $20,000 range.
In a tongue-in-cheek comparison test in its March issue, Automobile magazine pitted a Mercedes C320 Sports Coupe against a comparably priced Hyundai XG 350 sedan. The larger, more extravagantly equipped Korean car held its own.
It is no longer lonely for the exclusive brands at the other extreme of the luxury car market, where more than half a dozen companies are hoping to compete with cars priced from $150,000 to $600,000 and more. Aside from the Mercedes Maybach, new ultraluxury or superexotic cars are coming from Volkswagen's Audi, Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini subsidiaries; from a Rolls-Royce that will soon be under BMW's control; and from Ferrari, whose $700,000 Enzo is essentially a limited-edition Formula One racecar certified for public roads.

As Many Models as Customers?
Looking ahead, people in the industry and those who watch it expect even more choices for consumers. "The trend is toward lower volume and more niche-oriented products," said Mr. Cedergren of NexTrend. "People are still very self-centered and image-conscious."
Jim Hall, an analyst with AutoPacific, a market research firm in Southfield, Mich., expects the time-tested sedan to remain popular, along with what he calls "image compacts" -- small cars like the Toyota Matrix that are packaged in new configurations with different features. And, he predicts, "there will be lots of permutations of things that people will call S.U.V.'s, but they aren't" -- cars wearing costumes.
Advances in technology may result in more variations, too. Already the Honda Civic Hybrid, with both a gasoline engine and electric motor, is sold alongside several models of gasoline-only Civics, and other manufacturers are planning hybrid versions of several vehicles. But if hybrid technology pans out, Mr. Hall says, "it simply becomes another choice," like the engine options on today's cars.
 When G.M. tunes its crystal ball further, it sees hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars that would have their operating systems embedded in a platform that looks something like a giant skateboard. The car's body would attach to the platform the way a laptop computer slides into a docking station, making it easy to switch from one body style to another -- letting owners plug in a roomy wagon to take the children to camp or a sporty convertible for a sunny Sunday drive.
 Mr. Phillippi of AutoTrends said that such futuristic ideas were actually proposed decades ago. "It's an interesting concept," he said. "But that would be a very expensive proposition. Where do you store the bodies? Or do you go to a body-exchange depot?"
 Any product takes on more forms as it matures, Mr. Hall said, as those who sell it try to set it apart in a crowded marketplace. But ultimately, the consumer decides how many versions are appropriate.
Mr. Hall draws an analogy to cable television. "What is the right number of channels to offer?" he asked. "The correct answer is one -- the channel that I want to watch."

GRAPHIC: Photos (Stephen Kroninger)(pg. G1); (pg. G13); (Brenda Priddy & Company); (Olivia Gay)(pg. G13) Chart: "A Dozen Radical Departures"Automakers' attempts to offer vehicles in every conceivable niche of the market have taken many of them far from the products and brand images that made them successful. Here are some examples: MERCEDES-BENZ C230 Sports CoupeA small $25,000 hatchback that seems incongruous in showrooms next to $100,000 luxury sedans. Though cars like this raise sales figures, they can make exclusive brands seem common. PORSCHE CayenneMany enthusiasts shudder at the prospect of a sport utility vehicle from a company renowned for its lightning-fast sports cars, and S.U.V. critics say there's no point to an off-road-capable vehicle that can reach 165 m.p.h. Porsche says the demand is strong. VOLKSWAGEN PhaetonIt takes more than flower power to move this huge luxury sedan. But VW is determined to challenge Mercedes and BMW in the luxury-car market, even if that spells trouble for Audi, its own luxury-car subsidiary. HYUNDAI XG350This South Korean company used to be known for cheap, and cheaply built, small cars, but its sales have soared along with huge improvements in quality. The XG350 is a credible competitor at the low end of the midsize-luxury market, and the company has indicated that it plans to aim even higher. CHRYSLER PT CruiserThe Chrysler that your grandparents drove was a stately, full-size, all-American car. But with Plymouth discontinued, the Chrysler brand became a repository for downscale Voyager minivans and the flashy Prowler hot rod. It also got the hot-selling PT Cruiser, a retro niche car that says little about what Chrysler stands for today. LINCOLN BlackwoodIt seemed like a stroke of genius: turn the Navigator S.U.V. into a black-tie pickup by adding a stainless-steel cargo bed under a rigid cover that could be raised and lowered by pushing a button. But the pickup bed was too delicate for use, the cover restricted the size of the load and a lack of four-wheel drive kept the truck on smooth pavement. Lincoln halted production so fast that the Blackwood will be among the shortest-lived models on record. ROLLS-ROYCE 2003 modelStarved by decades of underinvestment, the grandest name in autodom lost much of its luster as it churned out cars that were expensive and antiquated. But BMW takes over Rolls in January and will offer a German-designed car jammed with the latest technologies. Will Teutonic perfection snuff out the lingering charm of Rolls's English eccentricities? JAGUAR X-TypeIntent on doubling its sales, Jaguar added two smaller car lines to its traditional big saloon and sporty XK's. But the $40,000-plus S-Type and the $30,000-and-up X-Type share engines with other Ford subsidiaries, and the X-Type is built largely on the back of the Mondeo, a lowbrow European Ford. What's so special about that? CADILLAC Escalade EXTA few years ago, G.M. executives insisted that the Cadillac wreath and crest would never appear on a truck. But the success of the Lincoln Navigator forced Cadillac to counter with its own S.U.V. Now there's a pickup version in vogue among urban hip-hop cowboys. BUICK RainierBuick, which built its franchise on elegant cars, finally stuck a toe in the sport utility waters last year with its minivan-based Rendezvous. Next it will get the Rainier, a fancy version of the Chevrolet TrailBlazer that will fill the theoretical gap that will be created when Oldsmobile, and its Bravada S.U.V., finally fade away. TOYOTA SequoiaJapan's largest automaker got big by thinking small, but those days are over. Toyota and its Lexus luxury division now offer 10 distinct truck lines, and its hulking Sequoia -- which competes against the Ford Expedition and Chevy Tahoe -- is the monster of the bunch. SUBARU BajaQuirky Subaru has thrived in recent years by anticipating the confluence of cars and S.U.V.'s with its Outbacks, and by cultivating a loyal following among academics, political activists and gays, among others. Can it work the same magic for its odd-looking Baja, with a pickup bed grafted onto the rear of a Legacy sedan? (pg. G13)

HEADLINE: Canadian Bank's Invasion of U.S. Fizzles 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The plan was nothing if not ambitious: to invade the United States retail banking market, not by buying banks or building traditional branches but by teaming up with supermarket chains and blanketing the country with automated teller machines.
 What the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce thought it was inventing was, as John S. Hunkin, the chairman and chief executive, said less than a year ago, nothing less than "a new kind of bank for the 21st century." 
 But the Canadians appear to have badly misjudged American banking habits.
Canadian Imperial said Monday that it would "substantially" reduce or close the United States operations of Amicus, the unit it set up to lead the charge into the United States, including its flagship joint ventures with two major supermarket chains, Safeway of Pleasanton, Calif., and Winn-Dixie Stores of Jacksonville, Fla. 
Canadian Imperial will take a charge of as much as 375 million Canadian dollars ($240 million) in the fourth quarter to pay for broken leases, severance pay for workers and other costs.
There were signs that the move was coming. Mr. Hunkin told analysts last month, "We know that our shareholders have lost patience with the earnings drag and, considering the current environment, so have I." 
The bank said Monday that it was still in talks with Safeway and Winn-Dixie over Amicus's future. But Jacek Dzierwa, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Toronto, said of the bank, "I think they will just walk away -- there is no way they would prolong the bleeding."
Amicus lost 291 million Canadian dollars ($186 million) before taxes in the nine months ended July 31, on revenue of only 159 million Canadian dollars ($102 million). Its losses have mounted steadily over the last three fiscal years.
Canadian Imperial had been more successful with the supermarket banking idea in Canada. It set up its first venture with the Loblaw Companies, the country's biggest food retailer, to set up President's Choice Financial, adopting the brand name of one of Canada's best-known store brands. The venture offers savings accounts, personal loans, mortgages, credit cards and retirement accounts from kiosks in stores, over the telephone and on the Internet.
The relatively low fixed costs of the operation make it possible for President's Choice Financial to offer higher interest rates on deposits and lower fees on loans than traditional banks typically do. And shoppers who use a President's Choice debit card at Loblaw stores earn points toward free groceries.
The approach has also worked well in Britain. Sainsbury's Bank, a five-year-old partnership between the Halifax Bank of Scotland and J. Sainsbury, has 1.3 million accounts and made $:22 million ($34 million) in profit last year.
In the United States, bank branches in supermarkets have typically borne the bank's brand name, not the store's. And the ventures have not generally been hitting home runs.
"Supermarket banking for everybody has been a cheap single at best," said James McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group in New York. In the United States, Mr. McCormick said, most deposit growth over the last seven years has come at smaller banks that "stuck to the basics, offering better customer service and investing more heavily in traditional branch growth."
Andrew Collins, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp-Piper Jaffray in New York, said that of the banks that have tried putting branches in stores, "there have been only two or three that have been supersuccessful." Analysts cite National Commerce Bank Services of Memphis, Wells Fargo of California and Fifth Third Bank of Cincinnati as examples.
Unlike those banks, Canadian Imperial had no established retail presence or recognizable brand in the United States when it started Amicus.
Still, David Marshall, the bank's former vice chairman and the architect of Amicus's expansion, told analysts last December that Amicus had the potential to reach 40 million American customers, more than the entire population of Canada.
Amicus formed Marketplace Bank in partnership with Winn-Dixie in 1999, and Safeway Select Bank with Safeway a year later. Marketplace now has pavilions in 185 Winn-Dixie stores, while Safeway Select has 161 outlets.
The hope was that as in Canada and Britain, shoppers who opened a Marketplace or Safeway Select account could then be sold an array of other financial services from the same institution. And most of the transactions would be conducted fairly cheaply on Amicus's electronic banking system.
But American shoppers have not taken to the Canadian-British model. According to John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, Americans "want options -- they don't want to be funneled into one delivery system."
Americans also tend to use electronic banking less than Canadians do. According to the Bank of International Settlements, Canadians made an average of 54.3 debit card transactions in 1999, compared with 27.5 by Americans. Canadians also make more use of teller machines.
Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said that supermarket financial services have worked best in the United States where they complement a bank's other activities, rather than operating as a free-standing business. Canadian Imperial's "concept may have been flawed," Mr. Kraushaar said.
President's Choice Financial in Canada is not affected by the cutbacks at Amicus, the bank said on Monday. That operation is expected to be profitable by late 2003.

HEADLINE: Look What's For Dinner 

BYLINE:  By PETER KAMINSKY 

 BODY:
EVERY year around this time, the world's greatest wildlife migration passes by New York City. Whales, dolphins and tuna swim past on their way south, and monarch butterflies as brilliant as stained-glass windows are in the air. Ducks, geese, woodcocks and songbirds fly with them above waters teeming with baitfish in uncountable billions and, best of all for the hungry angler, bluefish and the local champion in pinstripes, the striped bass.
 At times the bass off New York are so thick that they thump against the side of your boat with a tom-tom beat. And for the last two weeks, I have followed them from the northern part of Jamaica Bay, within 100 yards of the idling jets at Kennedy Airport, on past the churning tidal rip of Breezy Point, through the Narrows and the windswept passage between Liberty Island and Manhattan and on up the East River to the Triborough Bridge and beyond. 
 When I tell nonangling friends that I fish New York waters, every one of them asks the same question, as if I were slightly off my rocker: "You mean you can eat those fish?" 
To which I answer, "Yes, you can."
New York Harbor is the beginning of a fjord, or arm of the sea, that surrounds Manhattan and has a tidal reach in the Hudson River that extends up to Troy, N.Y. Throughout that entire stretch the action of the tides flushes out the river and the harbor twice a day. Environmental improvements since the passage of the Clean Waters Act of 2000 have further improved the water, so that the state deems it swimmable even at the north end of Manhattan and fishable throughout the harbor.
Although I release 99 percent of the fish I catch -- and encourage everyone to do the same -- every now and then I get a great kick out of marching down to the harbor, meeting my buddies in a boat and catching my dinner, the way the Indians did.
Last week, Frank Crescitelli, a local fishing guide and one of the moving forces in promoting angling in city waters, took me fishing off Hoffman Island, just south of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. A century ago, this granite outcropping served as a quarantine center for would-be immigrants. Only one striped bass came to the fly (too small to keep -- the state limit is 29 inches). But Frank managed to hook a legal four-pound bluefish, and dinner was assured.
My inspiration for the dish I made that night -- bluefish with farfalle in a sauce of roasted tomatoes, capers, white wine and lemon juice -- was the ineffable mullet with farfalle I first tasted in a seaside fish joint in Viareggio, on the Tuscan coast. Blues are often thought to have a particularly "fishy" taste that turns people off. This happens only when the oily flesh is exposed to the air for a long period, which turns it rancid. In fact, mackerel, salmon and tuna share this characteristic. 
But if you go straight home from the boat, skin and fillet the fish and cook it, you would be hard pressed to find flounder that is milder in flavor. (You can also buy bluefish at most fish markets.)
Catching and cooking a striped bass is a taller order -- or at least a longer one, given the size fish you must catch to keep it. (Buying one is only a little easier. Farmed striped bass are readily available in fish markets, but legally taken wild ones are far less abundant.)
Through the summer, the big bass are often off Montauk, Cape Cod, Nantucket and on up to Maine. Their return to local urban waters is heralded by the advance guard of the autumn run, false albacore. These green and blue relatives of the tuna are among the speediest and strongest fish to battle on light tackle. They are good sport, but awful eating. Still, on a warm afternoon in early October, I met a guide named Brendan McCarthy at the River Cafe, under the Brooklyn Bridge. On a rising tide, we spent most of the afternoon chasing and catching albacore in the East River, from Castle Clinton at the Battery up to the Harlem River.
It was just a matter of time until the bass showed up. And last week, after a series of storms bestirred the horde of fish off Montauk and got them moving south, John McMurray of One More Cast Guiding Service called to report 20-pound stripers off Norton's Point in southeastern Brooklyn. That was enough to rouse me at 5 o'clock the next morning to meet him at Gateway Marina on Dead Horse Bay.
With wind from the south and an incoming tide, we sped to a clearly defined rip, which is a current line separating water moving at different speeds. Baitfish would be caught in the rip and, we reasoned, would attract predators: the bass. I cast and retrieved a chartreuse fly, the same color as the tiny baitfish. On the second cast I felt a tug. By the feel, it was a big bass, which shook its head and took off, peeling a hundred yards of line from my reel. Slowly I retrieved line, and swiftly the fish took it back, which allowed John an opportunity to deride my technique. But ultimately, the fish surrendered .
At 34 inches and 14 pounds, he was a grand fish, one that demanded an equally grand presentation at dinner.
I had already settled on fish and vegetables baked in a thick salt crust. I first saw this method employed by Francis Mallmann, who was at that time a top chef and restaurateur in Argentina. The economic travails in that country have since landed Mr. Mallmann on Long Island, where his Patagonia West restaurant in Westhampton Beach offers a version of his Andean haute cuisine. But he taught me to salt-bake in Argentina, at an outdoor barbecue in the wine region of Mendoza.
Eschewing the mounds of meat that typify most Argentine outdoor cookery, Mr. Mallmann built a wood bonfire for a dinner of salt-baked salmon. He placed a large iron plancha about a foot from the coals. He packed a layer of salt on it to a depth of about an inch and then placed a fresh 30-pound Chilean salmon atop the salt. He covered the salmon with more salt, again to a thickness of about an inch, and then, as if assembling a do-it-yourself bookshelf, he put another plancha a foot above the salmon. On top of this he shoveled half the coals from the bonfire.
After an hour, four strong cooks removed the salt-mounded fish from its plancha. With a swordsman's flourish, Mr. Mallmann tapped the crust with a hammer. And as the hardened salt fell away, a puff of briny steam rose and dissipated, to reveal a moist, perfectly cooked salmon.
The same technique, edited for the home kitchen, is quite simple. A 14-pounder takes a lot of salt. (I bought a whole case of kosher salt and used 10 32-ounce boxes). But that's part of the show.
Along with the bass, Mr. Mallmann suggested roasting medium-size potatoes, carrots and sweet potatoes. His sauce -- garlic, parsley, lemon zest, olive oil and a few seasonings -- is actually a variation on the gremolata that is often served with osso buco. I call it Boca salsa, in honor of the neighborhood in Buenos Aires where many believe the tango was born and where Mr. Mallmann had both a restaurant and a home.
The scary thing about cooking in a salt crust is that you are essentially flying blind. You set the salt-covered fish and vegetables in the oven, wait the recommended time and hope everything isn't mush when you crack the crust. I placed a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the bass and removed the baking pan from the oven when the temperature read 150 degrees.
The salt roasting produced succulent flesh, juicy carrots and softly creamy potatoes. Set on a white plate, it had a bold minimalist look.
I wanted something equally autumnlike, with a punch of strong flavor, to accompany the meal. Anna Klinger, the talented chef of Al Di La in Park Slope had just the thing: chard stems, sauteed, then grilled and finally bathed in an anchovy vinaigrette. At last, something to do with chard stems other than toss them in the trash while you cook the more tender leaves.
And then the ultimate test: Mom. With my family of four, a couple of friends and my parents, we sat down to dinner. I put the striper on the table.
We dug in.
My mother, an accomplished cook, delivered the highest accolade that any seafood can aspire to.
"Nice piece of fish," she said.

SALT-ROASTED STRIPED BASS WITH SALSA DE LA BOCA
Adapted from Patagonia West, Westhampton Beach, N.Y.
Time: 1 hour 45 minutes

For the salsa:
2 cups extra virgin olive oil
1 cup chopped parsley leaves
1/2 cup chopped garlic
1/2 cup fresh oregano
Zest of two lemons, finely diced
Fleur de sel, to taste
Cracked black peppercorns, to taste

For the fish:
8 carrots, trimmed and peeled
6 medium potatoes
6 medium sweet potatoes
5 3-pound boxes kosher salt
1 cleaned, unscaled 8-pound striped bass, head and tail removed (see note).
1. Combine all ingredients for salsa in a small bowl. Cover, and reserve until needed.
2. Place carrots on a sheet of foil, and wrap tightly to make a sealed bundle. Wrap each potato and sweet potato in foil.
3. Heat oven to 500 degrees. Pour all the salt into a very large bowl or a clean plugged sink. Add 4 cups water, and toss salt to incorporate evenly. The consistency should be like spring snow, slightly wet and lightly clumping. If necessary, add up to 1 cup water for desired texture.
4. In a large roasting pan (about 16 inches long), tamp down a 1-inch layer of damp salt. Place bass diagonally in pan on top of salt. Arrange foil-wrapped carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes snugly around sides of fish. Insert an ovenproof (not instant-read) meat thermometer in thickest part of fish, and leave it there. Pour rest of damp salt into pan, spreading it to make a 1-inch-thick layer over fish and vegetables. Tamp down salt to compact it.
5. Place pan in lower third of oven, and bake until thermometer reaches 150 degrees, about 55 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to rest at room temperature 20 minutes. Tap salt crust with hammer or mallet until it cracks. Discard salt. Remove vegetables from their foil wrappings, halve potatoes if desired and keep warm. Brush any remaining salt from fish, and lift off and discard skin.
6. To serve, use two large spoons to lift fish from backbone and transfer to plates. Place a serving of carrots, potatoes and sweet potatoes on each plate. Garnish with salsa, and serve.
Yield: 8 servings.
Note: Bass may also be roasted with head on, on a large sheet pan or a roasting pan.

OVEN-ROASTED TOMATOES
Time: 20 minutes, plus 3 to 4 hours' roasting

5 pounds plum tomatoes
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon fleur de sel
3 sprigs fresh thyme
10 cloves unpeeled garlic
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, or as needed.
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Heat oven to 200 degrees. Line 2 large sheet pans with parchment paper, and set aside.
2. Blanch tomatoes in boiling water for 10 seconds. Transfer to cold water, peel, and cut in half lengthwise. Discard seeds and pulp, and place cut side down on pans. Scatter sugar, fleur de sel, thyme and garlic cloves evenly over tomatoes. Sprinkle with pepper, and drizzle with olive oil.
3. Roast tomatoes until shriveled but still moist, 3 to 4 hours. Allow to cool. Discard thyme sprigs. Transfer tomatoes, garlic and pan liquid to covered containers. Refrigerate or freeze until needed.
Yield: 3 to 4 cups.

BLUEFISH WITH FARFALLE AND OVEN-ROASTED TOMATO SAUCE
Time: 30 minutes

2 tablespoons salt, or to taste
1/2 to 3/4 cup pan liquid saved with oven-roasted tomatoes (see recipe)
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tablespoons capers
2 cups oven-roasted tomatoes
1 teaspoon sugar
3 cloves garlic from oven-roasted tomatoes
3/4 cup white wine
Freshly ground black pepper
1 pound farfalle
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound skinless bluefish fillets.
1. Put salt in a large pot of water, and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, place liquid from oven-roasted tomatoes in a small saucepan over high heat, and reduce by about half. Add lemon juice and capers, and continue cooking about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to low, and add tomatoes, sugar and garlic. Cook 2 minutes. Add wine, and cook until raw flavor of wine dissipates, about 2 minutes more. Season generously with black pepper. Simmer a few more minutes, remove from heat, and keep warm.
2. Add farfalle to boiling water, and cook until it is al dente, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place a large skillet over high heat, and film the pan with olive oil. Saute bluefish until it is cooked through, about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Remove from heat, and set aside.
3. When pasta is cooked, drain it well, and transfer to a large serving bowl. Add tomato sauce, and mix in fish so it breaks into bite-size chunks. Serve immediately.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

If You Land It, Is It Safe?
THE New York State Health Department says it is safe to eat one meal a week of bluefish or striped bass caught in city waters. Women of childbearing age are advised not to consume striped bass. 
To put this in perspective, the Health Department advises eating no more than one meal a month of smallmouth bass and walleye from the Ashokan Reservoir, which supplies the New York City water system. A full discussion is at www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/environ/fish.htm.
Anyone interested in catching these fish would do well to remember that New York Harbor bustles with traffic. There is a good amount of flotsam in the water. And there are strong currents. If you intend to fish, it is strongly recommended that you hire a guide. I have fished with all of the following and can highly recommend them. PETER KAMINSKY

HEADLINE: Romania, Wooed by U.S., Looks to a Big NATO Role 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: CONSTANTA, Romania, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Maybe their next mission will be against Iraq. Maybe it will just be routine naval exercises, aboard warships built in the 1980's to combat the West. Either way, the poor and once-forgotten nation of Romania looks set to join NATO, and the very happy sailors at this Black Sea port have no doubt whom to thank.
 "We are looking at the United States as a close friend," said Alex Gobjila, a young officer aboard a minesweeper here that is slated, perhaps soon, to steam out of port on NATO missions. "It's important always to have a good friend." 
 The ever-closer tie between Romania and the United States is likely to be cemented if, as expected, Romania and perhaps six other nations are invited to join NATO in November. It is but one example of how Sept. 11 has reconfigured the world, in often unexpected ways. Romania is, by any measure, at the rear of Europe's pack: reform withered here, as corruption thrived. The country still has no market economy. Its prospects to be a real part of Europe have looked, at best, long term. 
But Romania is across the Black Sea from Central Asia, an area that has assumed greater strategic importance since Sept. 11. In recent weeks, American officials have also traveled here to discuss how Romania might help in a coalition against Iraq (An air base just 15 miles from here was reportedly discussed). 
Romania decided in the defining days after the Sept. 11 attacks, and in notable ways since, to speak out quickly in solidarity with the United States. Many intellectuals and politicians here said it was a crucial, almost last-ditch, gambit to join the coveted club of the West.
"We play the American card and aggressively," said Silviu Brucan, the nation's elder statesman and a top political thinker. 
After Sept. 11, America wanted allies, and Romania opened up its airspace and later sent troops to Afghanistan, acting as police officers in Kabul as well as patrolling with Americans and guarding the perimeter of an American military base in Kandahar. Then it was the only nation in Europe to support the United States' demand to exempt American peacekeepers from the new International Criminal Court. 
As a result, Romania, not considered a top candidate for membership a year ago, looks likely to enter the NATO summit meeting next month in Prague with the strong backing of the United States. There has been no official decision, but Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia and Slovakia may also be invited to join an east-reaching NATO. 
While offering no predictions about what might happen at the NATO summit meeting, an American official here said: "It's a country that likes America and wants a partnership with us. I'm very convinced that Romania wants not just to be a member of NATO, but a crucial member of NATO with which the United States consults."
Whether Romania would take part in any action on Iraq is an open question. Ioan Mircea Pascu, the defense minister, has been quoted as saying he does not believe that Romanian soldiers are prepared for actual combat there, but he makes clear Romania's sympathies. 
"You have undertaken an obligation to stay in the coalition no matter what comes," he said in an interview. "You can't say, 'Now it's tough, it's difficult, I'm opting out.' "
But Romania's pro-American strategy carries risks. The friendship has caused some tension with the other club that Romania wants to join: the European Union. 
The union rates Romania low on the list of 12 potential candidates to join it. Many European states have also found themselves at odds with what they see as the Bush administration's go-it-alone approach to issues like global warming, trade and Iraq. European Union officials, opposed to the American position on the criminal court, were outraged that Romania broke European solidarity on the issue. 
Last week, in their report on expansion, European leaders took a cautious stance toward Romania and its neighbor, Bulgaria, saying they "noted" the nations' desire to join by 2007 and making a commitment to help them achieve that goal.
"There has got to be a shifting of gears," said Jonathan Scheele, the European Union's chief in Romania, who praised recent changes but said the fundamentals had yet to be tackled: overhauling the economy, judiciary and public administration. "Romania will not survive without accomplishing transition." 
European officials worry that joining NATO, despite talk in the West about it being an alliance of shared democratic values, may not be enough to prod Romania to real reform. It might, some worry, serve as a publicly satisfying substitute for deeper internal change by President Ion Iliescu, and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.
"The average Romanian has very little to gain from joining NATO, which is something rarely heard," said Matei Paun, an investment banker who moderates an influential Internet discussion group on the Romanian economy and politics. 
Romania has had one of the toughest transitions of any formerly Communist state, despite old ties to Western Europe which once earned its capital, Bucharest, the title "the Paris of the East." The reasons are many: the long and harsh dictatorship of Nicholae Ceausescu, who was executed in 1989; the fact that old-guard Communist officials largely took over; and the profound poverty and fear of change among many ordinary Romanians. 
As a result, of the 12 potential candidates for European Union membership, it has the lowest gross domestic product, the highest inflation, the least foreign investment and, by one measure, the most corruption. The nation's image, both among Romanians and abroad, is one of being more than a few steps behind: a place more of horse-drawn carts than new cars. 
Despite recent changes in both the government and the military, Mr. Brucan and other experts said they had long concluded that Romania could only get out of its rut if forced from the outside. Then terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and Romania's leaders made certain they were firmly on the Americans' side. 
"There was no gambling on corpses, as we are accused," said Mr. Pascu, the defense minister.
Still, experts say the tragedy marked an opportunity that Romania carefully cultivated. American officials say they view Romania -- with 22 million people, the largest nation, in the unstable Balkan region -- as its anchor friendship in Europe's southeast, much as Poland has been to the north.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
For Prospective Tenants, Cash Is King

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: FRISCO, Tex., Oct. 17 

 BODY:
The mixers and steamrollers draw closer every day, rumbling through the tilled and unseeded soil of fallow cotton and onion fields in a rough parallel to the long-abandoned Preston Ridge cattle trail, ladling out the fresh hot asphalt of the Dallas North Tollway, a growth serum for office parks and shopping malls.
 Frisco is the next stop on the map, but Frisco cannot wait. The city is paying companies to move here, offering them cash to sign leases in the few office buildings that have been built this far north. The city's inducement money comes from Stone-briar Centre, a 1.6 million-square-foot mall that General Growth of Chicago opened here in August 2000, and from the Centre at Preston Ridge, 1.1 million square feet of retail stores anchored by an outsize Target discount store. 
 Together they generate $5 million a year in sales taxes to support the Frisco Economic Development Corporation, which voters here elected to create rather than joining their neighbors to the south in contributing to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system. Dallas and its more immediate suburbs, having spent their sales tax dollars on buses and trains, typically offer property tax abatements to potential employers. 
But for prospective tenants, cash is king. "We sat down with Carrollton; we sat down with Plano; we sat down with Frisco; and at the end of the day you're looking at a future tax abatement versus a pile of cash," said J. Tracy Fults, a broker who represents office tenants for the Texas offices of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services firm.
With that pile of cash in hand, in the form of an agreement with the economic development group, a tenant's next step may well be to see Craig Hall, whose Hall Financial Group is the owner of the most prominent office development here so far. 
Mr. Hall bought 175 acres of land here in 1989 for about $25,000 an acre, and he voluntarily handed over about 15 acres to the Turnpike Authority a few years later, effectively inviting the tollway to his doorstep. The road is now 21.3 miles long; it is used by 312,000 cars a day at a maximum toll of 75 cents. The current construction phase is planned to end at Gaylord Parkway, the intersection where Hall Office Park stands. 
Mr. Hall's group began development in 1998, using its own money and planning to build four million square feet of office space in 22 buildings over the course of 15 years.
The group estimates the development cost of its buildings as $150 a square foot, including conference centers, nature trails and other amenities intended to make the office park feel like a suburban corporate campus, only with multiple tenants. The group spent an additional $10 million on artwork.
Seven of the buildings are finished, and the group has been using each completed building as collateral to secure a loan and replenish its capital for the next. Rental rates have fallen to around $22 a square foot, with as much as a year's free rent on a five-year lease, from about $23 a square foot at the market's height a few years ago, Mr. Hall said. The concessions to tenants for refinishing offices has risen, to $22 a square foot from $18. Those rates are comparable to rates several brokers here quoted for buildings all over the north Dallas suburbs.
Frisco's program of cash incentives has been useful in attracting tenants to Mr. Hall's buildings. "We have three large tenants who have received incentives; it's fortuitous, it's helpful," Mr. Hall said. But, he stressed, "It's more than financial incentives, it's that the people here are pro-growth in a responsible way."
The city is also spending $65 million on a minor league baseball park, an ice arena, and a 100,000-square-foot convention center. The Frisco RoughRiders, a farm club for the Texas Rangers, will play here, and the Southwest Sports Group, the owner of the Rangers, plans to build a million square feet of office space in small buildings ringing the field.
One hundred years after its incorporation, with the cities from here to Dallas largely developed, Frisco is getting its turn at booming growth. People here once rolled their houses on logs, transporting the center of their community five miles to be closer to a lake built by the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway where the steam engines stopped, changing their community's name from Lebanon to Frisco to commemorate the event. Today they are sitting still just above the northern terminus of the tollway, paying for office tenants, a sacrifice requiring no deforestation.
"They've been able to steal some clients from Plano and Dallas and the Richardson area," said Gregory C. Biggs, a broker with the firm Julian J. Studley. "You run the economics, and the municipal incentives make the difference in the deal."
Frisco has signed deals with about eight companies this year, promising payments of as little as $25,000 and as much as $1.2 million in exchange for a signed lease within the city limits.
"They certainly were a nice gesture on the part of Frisco, but it really wasn't a huge factor in our decision," said Steven J. Becker, a senior vice president of Fujitsu Transaction Solutions, a hardware, software and services company that caters to the financial services and retailing industries and is a unit of Fujitsu Ltd. of Tokyo. The company was promised up to $130,000 from Frisco, and it signed a five-year lease for 89,000 square feet in Hall Office Park, moving its 200 employees from a building in Dallas.
Whether the payments are a huge factor or just a contributing one is of little consequence to building owners, developers and city officials from here to downtown Dallas.
"They literally are simply taking tenants out of existing office buildings by handing them checks," said Susan Mead, a lawyer with Jenkins & Gilchrist who represents about a dozen property owners, including CarrAmerica and Crescent Real Estate Equities, in Dallas and its northern suburbs. That, she said, violates the intent of the economic development statute, adding: "There is no express prohibition of what they're doing, but the legislative intent is to grow jobs, to grow business. It doesn't include poaching of an existing tenant of an existing building in an existing city."
Laura Miller, the mayor of Dallas and the wife of the city's senior state representative, said she would press the legislature in its next session to prevent Frisco from paying tenants to leave Dallas.
"We feel that it's a very lopsided playing field when you've got suburbs that are able to write checks to lure companies to their towns," she said.
Lt. Gov. William R. Ratliff said that such a measure would be impossible to enforce, but that he would support legislation to prevent towns from directly paying corporate officers who make real estate decisions. Mayors in the north Dallas suburbs have accused Frisco of doing that, but they have provided no proof, he said.
Besides, Mr. Ratliff added, "not a one of them's hands are clean of in the past proselytizing to Dallas tenants."
While Plano, Richardson and Addison have passed resolutions scolding Frisco, its economic development director, James L. Gandy, is undeterred.
"Frisco will remain very pro-business and proactive to ensure that it has a diverse tax base and job opportunities for its residents," he said.
While the lawyers and politicians work things out, some well-known Dallas developers are scouting Frisco. Ross Perot Jr. made a speech here last week, and the Southwest Realty Group, controlled by Thomas O. Hicks, is making overtures to other developers, including Cousins Properties, to join in more office and hotel development here.
While the payments last, "I'm going to get as much for my clients as I can," said Rick Hughes, a senior director of Cushman & Wakefield of Texas. "Life isn't always fair. If they can do it, they might as well do it until somebody stops them."

HEADLINE: Chechnya's Wine Industry Clings to Remaining Roots 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: RUBEZHNOYE, Russia 

 BODY:
Chechnya is no Tuscany and no Rhone Valley, and it never was. But there was a time not long ago when it produced wines drunk by the Soviet elite and peasants alike.
 More than 35,000 acres of vineyards once flourished along the dry, sandy valley of the Terek River, which cleaves Chechnya in two. Each fall more than a dozen wineries turned the grapes into sturdy reds and whites, brandies and cognacs. 
 They may not have been world-class vintages, but they are recalled here nostalgically, memories of a more peaceful time.
"In the 70's, some of our wines won gold and silver medals" in national competitions, said Turpal Yakhyayev, the viticulturist at the state-owned collective farm here that is known, still, as Soviet Russia. 
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 began a tumultuous decade that left Chechnya's wine industry, like much of the republic, in shambles.
Some here say the industry's decline began earlier, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign in 1986, which resulted in thousands of vineyards across the Soviet Union being tilled under.
But it quickened, all agree, when Chechnya's first president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, declared the republic independent and began to restore Muslim traditions. His government stopped supporting the wineries.
"There was no proper maintenance of the vineyards, no development, no new production," recalled Said Arsanukayev, who has worked at the Naurski Wine Factory, Chechnya's largest, for 21 years, the last four as its director. 
Of all the factors, though, fighting has caused the greatest toll. The two wars in Chechnya -- the first from 1994 to 1996, the second from 1999 and still grinding on -- destroyed thousands of acres of vineyards and several wineries, including the main one in the capital, Grozny.
Fewer than 10,000 acres of vines remain, mostly in the northern half of the republic, where fighting was less intense. There were once 14 wine producers; today there are 4. 
Wine once accounted for 30 percent of the republic's domestic product, second only to oil, and officials in Moscow have cited the industry as a potential engine for economic recovery. As part of its effort to revive the battered republic, Moscow contributed $1 million to the industry.
Today the Soviet Russia farm mostly grows a variety of grape, rkatsiteli (pronounced er-kotz-uh-TEL-ee), that is used to produce dry table wines that are not likely to be mistaken for the world's greatest. 
Mr. Yakhyayev, like Mr. Arsanukayev, dreams of producing higher quality wines, even vintage ones. 
Chechnya as the next Napa Valley?
"Yes, you could say that," he said, earnestly. "It's a beautiful climate for vintage grapes."

HEADLINE: Escalating Tuition Bills 

 BODY:
The public universities and colleges that grant three-quarters of this country's degrees are becoming increasingly unaffordable to the poor and working-class students who have traditionally used them to move out of poverty into the middle class. This troubling trend was underscored yet again this week when the College Board released alarming data showing that public-college tuition had risen by nearly 10 percent -- the largest increase in a decade. 
This sharp tuition rise follows a period when the costs of higher education have outpaced tuition aid.
 The public college tuition hikes can be partly traced to the recession, but also to the long-term tendency of state legislatures to attack higher education in times of hardship. The rising tuition costs are made worse by the fact that federal tuition aid has failed to keep pace with the real costs of education. A quarter-century ago the federal Pell grants for lower-income students covered about 85 percent of the costs of attending a public college. Today they cover about 40 percent. To make matters worse, colleges and states have begun to award aid based on test scores and grades as opposed to need. 
 Congress needs to bring the Pell grants closer to the real cost of higher education. At the state level, legislatures need to remind themselves that they must open the road to college for poor and working-class residents before they underwrite tuition assistance for their wealthier constituents. If the current patterns persist, the country will end up back at that point in history when colleges were reserved mainly for the affluent few.

HEADLINE: Comparing 2 Sets Of Twin Towers; 
Malaysian Buildings Offered as Model

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
Over many months, reams of analysis have piled up -- a sometimes competing mix of calculation and deduction that suggests an array of answers to the questions of why and how the steel skeletons of the twin towers suddenly came apart in raging fires on Sept. 11. And with that increased understanding, the storms of emotion surrounding the grim, disturbing questions have quieted some.
 But as scientists and engineers have gained these hard-won glimpses into the mechanics of a tragedy, there is one other question that almost all of them have carefully avoided asking: could another building, indeed any building, no matter how stoutly or cleverly built, have stood longer than the twin towers did, let more people escape or perhaps never collapsed? 
 At a time when public officials across the country are considering sweeping revisions to building codes, and some tenants are struggling to regain confidence in the safety of skyscrapers, many technical experts say there are good reasons they have dealt so gingerly with such a volatile, if perhaps valuable, question. Those experts worry about putting victim families through wrenching what-if thoughts, they want to avoid highlighting new potential targets for terrorists and they are awed by the sheer complexity of actually producing an answer. 
It turns out, though, that in little-noticed lectures at academic and professional institutions in the last year, one man, Charles H. Thornton, who is among the world's most renowned engineers, has been both asking and answering that lingering question.
In statements that some experts see as bold and others as self-serving, Dr. Thornton has argued that at least two enormous buildings would have withstood the Sept. 11 attacks far better than the World Trade Center towers did: the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, the world's tallest buildings and, in a structural sense, alter egos of the trade center.
Dr. Thornton, who collaborated on the design of the Petronas Towers, says this has nothing to do with an exercise in ego. He says his two buildings in the capital of Malaysia are an extraordinary guide for engineers and architects who are now rethinking tall buildings from top to bottom. Dr. Thornton's claims have produced both anger and admiration. Some have accused him of grandstanding. Others say he has, with considerable courage, helped force a continuing examination that is sorely needed.
"In a situation like this, some people are hesitant to raise any issue," said Michael J. Chajes, a professor and structural engineer who is chairman of the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Delaware, where Dr. Thornton spoke last spring.
"Having someone at his level saying these things and bringing up the discussion is certainly a good thing for the engineering community."
For example, in the Delaware talk, Dr. Thornton contrasted the lightly protected, wallboard-encased stairwells of the World Trade Center -- which were severed by flying debris, trapping hundreds of people above -- with the thick concrete walls enclosing the Petronas stairwells. In the talk, Dr. Thornton said "concrete-encased stairwells probably would have survived that and allowed people from above to get down," Dr. Chajes recalled.
Dr. Thornton, who is co-chairman of the Thornton-Tomasetti Group, an engineering company, is one of the few living builders who can match the prestige of Leslie E. Robertson, the engineer who designed the twin towers. In 1999, they were both named among the top handful of engineers of the last 125 years by the venerable Engineering News-Record, along with people like Emily and Washington Roebling, who built the Brooklyn Bridge, and Gustave Eiffel.
Guy Nordenson, who leads his own engineering company in Manhattan and is an associate professor of architecture and civil engineering at Princeton University, where Dr. Thornton gave a talk shortly after 9/11, has an information-age comparison of the two titans. "Les is a Steven Jobs to Charlie Thornton's Bill Gates," Dr. Nordenson said, calling Mr. Robertson "a brilliant thinker" and Dr. Thornton pragmatic.
Leveling a criticism at the assertion that the Petronas Towers would have stood longer than the World Trade Center towers did, Dr. Nordenson said, "If you're claiming that such and such a building would have performed better than the World Trade Center, then the answer is, 'Well, you're an engineer; show me the calculations.' "
In an interview, Dr. Thornton said, "common sense and intuition can replace a lot of calculations." For instance, he said, there is little doubt in his mind that the concrete-enclosed spine of the Petronas Towers -- with walls 30 inches thick at the bottom of the building -- would have performed better against blasts and fires than the lightweight gypsum wallboard of the trade center.
Despite such criticisms, Dr. Thornton's words have had such resonance partly because he is generally careful to say he believes Manhattan's twin towers were built as well as they could have been in their day.
He describes Mr. Robertson's design as visionary and points out that the advanced, high-strength concrete holding up all of the Petronas Towers -- not just the core -- had not been developed when the trade center went up in the 1960's and 1970's.
In that respect, the Petronas Towers, built in 1998, were made possible by rapid improvements in the most mundane of materials, said Franz Ulm, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "In the '80's and '90's, there occurred a real revolution in concrete materials that is almost not known to the public," he said.
He said that high-strength concrete generally resisted both blasts and fires better than steel like that in the trade center, where the plane impacts probably knocked loose a lightweight form of fireproofing that had been sprayed onto columns and beams, which then buckled in the heat.
Advocates for steel construction, which has long battled concrete in the marketplace, dispute the claim that there is any real difference in properly constructed buildings that use either of the materials -- especially since even the high-strength concrete is reinforced with embedded steel bars. "There's this perception that just because we wrap something in concrete, that it's protected from the fire," said Charlie Carter, chief structural engineer for the American Institute of Steel Construction in Chicago. "That's not true."
For a combination of historical, cultural and economic reasons, tall, concrete-core buildings dedicated to office use are unusual in New York, where builders prefer the wallboard-enclosed cores with steel frames that Mr. Robertson pioneered in the trade center.
But Patricia J. Lancaster, an architect who is the city's building commissioner, said that despite the possibility of higher costs, the city should look at revising its building codes. "Certainly, the hardening of core areas including elevator shafts and stairway enclosures is something that needs to be looked at," she said.
The escape system of the Petronas Towers has other advantages, Dr. Thornton said. The bridge running between the towers, he said, offers a backup plan that perhaps only a twinned skyscraper -- or, at least, one very near another tall building -- can take advantage of: if a catastrophe in one tower somehow blocks escape, the bridge opens an alternate route. He recommends finding new ways to put this kind of redundancy into high-rise escape plans.
Another idiosyncrasy of the Petronas Towers, one that may make them more stable against catastrophic collapse, could be hard to emulate in other structures.
The World Trade Center towers were box-shaped, and tightly clustered rows of steel columns around the facade not only held up nearly half the towers' weight but also provided all of the stiffness needed to resist the force of high winds. Each of the floors that were bolted and welded to those columns both held up the weight of people and office equipment inside and provided lateral support for the columns, preventing them from buckling.
But 16 massive concrete columns are arranged in a circle around the outside of each Petronas Tower. And the concrete core not only shares the task of holding up the building's weight with those columns but also provides about half the stiffness against the wind. Floors, of course, still run from core to exterior, but both the strong core and the circular exterior are stable and can stand largely on their own, Dr. Thornton said.
When floors began falling in the heat of the fires at the trade center, federal engineers investigating the attacks determined earlier this year, the columns were prone to buckle, setting the conditions for a total collapse. In Dr. Thornton's view, the Petronas Towers could lose several floors and remain standing. Some experts, working for Larry A. Silverstein, the leaseholder at the trade center, have recently offered a rival version of why the towers collapsed, one that says the floors did not contribute to the collapse.
"A circle is a stable shape -- much more stable than a square shape," said Dr. Thornton, adding that the choice of that motif originally had nothing to do with stability. Instead, the builders were looking for shapes consistent with Islamic imagery.
Which only goes to show, said Richard Tomasetti, co-chairman of the Thornton-Tomasetti Group, that there is likely to be more than one path to safer skyscrapers of the future. "I do think that there are features in the Petronas Towers that give you an arrow to the future," Mr. Tomasetti said. But he added: "Every building is an individual. I don't think there's a Utopian solution out there."

(Duane Perry/University of Delaware) Chart/Diagram: "The World Trade Center and the Petronas Towers"Both sets of twin towers share a design concept, the tube, in which there is a building core surrounded by perimeter columns. But the World Trade Center towers were square with steel as the structural components while the Petronas towers are round, with concrete as the main material. WORLD TRADE CENTER19731,368 and 1,362 ft. EXTERIOR COLUMNSThe steel columns supported less than half of the building's weight, but they shouldered all of the lateral forces from winds. BUILDING COREThe steel core columns supported the majority of the building's weight. Stairwell walls in the core were built with fireproof layers of gypsum board. FLOOR TRUSSESThe floors were supported by trusses made of pairs of steel bars, each slightly larger than an inch in diameter, zigzagging down the truss. The trusses were covered by spray-on fireproofing. FLOOR FUNCTIONThe floors prevented buckling of the interior and exterior columns by holding the two systems together tightly. Also, as winds applied pressure to one face of the building, the floors distributed those loads to adjacent faces, where they would be transferred to the ground. PETRONAS TOWERS1998IN KUALA LUMPUR 1,483 ft. EXTERIOR COLUMNSThe main tower columns are about eight feet wide at the building's base and are made of reinforced concrete. They support 60 percent of the tower's weight and resist half of the lateral forces from winds. BUILDING COREInstead of structural columns, the core has reinforced concrete walls that support 40 percent of the tower's weight and half of the load from wind pressure. The concrete provides its own fire resistance. FLOOR SUPPORTSThe floors are supported by 18-inch-deep steel I-beams that connect to the core walls and to concrete beams between the main columns. The floor beams are covered with spray-on fireproofing. FLOOR FUNCTIONFloors unite the columns and core, distributing wind pressures on a given face to other outside columns and to the core. Petronas engineers say both the columns and the core can stand independently for several floors, so the risk of buckling is reduced if those floors are compromised.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
New Clubs, Mixed Results For Giants Who Left Town

BYLINE:  By BUSTER OLNEY

 BODY:
Ron Stone stretched on the south side of Giants Stadium before the season opener Sept. 5, across from players he once called teammates. They were dressed in blue, and he wore the white jersey of the San Francisco 49ers. Jim McNally, the Giants' offensive line coach, walked over and shook Stone's hand, clasping his left elbow warmly, wishing him well.
 McNally wrote Stone a letter of gratitude and congratulations in the off-season, after he departed in a purge of high-salaried veterans. Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi, faced with a payroll swollen beyond the constraints of the salary cap, allowed Stone, wide receiver Joe Jurevicius and others to leave as free agents, and he included linebacker Jessie Armstead among a group placed on waivers. 
 Some of the former Giants have struggled. Others, like Stone, an offensive lineman, have been effective. "He's kind of a quiet guy," McNally said. "He didn't say a whole lot. He and I got along. I always thought he was a good player -- a big, powerful guy we could run behind."
Stone was an All-Pro, a strong, straight-ahead run blocker who was not adept at pulling or at finishing blocks downfield. As the Giants faced their financial crisis, the notion of committing millions to a guard seemed like a luxury. Stone signed with the 49ers. After a slow start, he has played well in recent games, with San Francisco's explosive offense gaining momentum.
Lomas Brown, the left tackle who helped the Giants reach the Super Bowl in 2000, has appeared in two games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Greg Comella, the fullback who blocked for Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne and caught 39 passes last season, has had his role diminished since joining the Tennessee Titans. Comella started the first four games and came off the bench in Weeks 5 and 6 before dislocating a shoulder. Comella has 6 receptions for 43 yards.
Jurevicius improved with the Giants in 2001, making 51 catches for 706 yards and 3 touchdowns. At the time, there were a lot of questions about the condition of Ike Hilliard.
But Hilliard and Amani Toomer, the Giants' primary receivers, have been terrific, and Jurevicius appears to have gotten lost in what has been an inconsistent Buccaneers offense. Playing in seven games -- including one start -- Jurevicius has 11 catches for 121 yards, meaning that he is on a pace for fewer than 30 receptions.
Giants place-kicker Matt Bryant is one of only two kickers to make all of his field-goal attempts this season -- Philadelphia's David Akers is the other -- and Bryant is probably the team's most pleasant surprise. Still, Accorsi said during the summer that of all the decisions he made in the crunching of finances, the most difficult might have been not to re-sign kicker Morten Andersen. Accorsi wanted Andersen back, Andersen made it clear he wanted to come back, but the Giants had not yet agreed to a contract extension with Kerry Collins or Michael Strahan and Accorsi did not know whether he could create the salary-cap space for Andersen.
So Andersen signed with Kansas City, and although he has had problems with kickoffs -- and everyone knew this was not his strength -- he has converted 41 of 42 kicks: 15 of 16 field-goal attempts and 26 extra-point attempts. Incredibly, he already has almost as many extra points for the explosive Chiefs offense as he had during the entire 2001 season for the Giants (29).
Strong safety Sam Garnes signed a three-year deal with the Jets, including a $500,000 signing bonus and a base salary this year of $550,000. Garnes, like many of the Jets' newcomers, has performed poorly.
Armstead, the soul of the Giants' defense for most of a decade, has amassed tackles for the Redskins, including 14 solo tackles in a game against San Francisco. There have been instances when Armstead, a step slow, has struggled in pass coverage. He is part of a surprisingly ineffective defense that has allowed 30 or more points in three of six games. There were three years when Armstead was with the Giants and the defense surrendered 30 or more points only once per season.
Without Armstead, the Giants' linebackers have performed erratically: Dhani Jones played well against St. Louis, the week after he made a crucial coverage mistake in the last two minutes against San Francisco; Brandon Short has hustled, he made an impact in a game against Dallas Oct. 6 and he had terrible problems in pass coverage against Atlanta a week later. But Jones and Short are making much less money than Armstead, which is part of the reason they are with the Giants and he isn't.
Shaun Williams has traded messages with Garnes, Barber has talked about what a great friend Comella is, and Hilliard swaps e-mail messages with Armstead. "We miss all those guys," Hilliard said.
Accorsi follows them, as well, his interest personal, and professional. In a year in which so many veterans left and the Giants are relying on young players, Accorsi's decisions will inevitably be evaluated on how the former Giants and their replacements perform.
"We try to keep up with all the teams," he said. "I know pretty much how they're playing."

HEADLINE: Under the Arab Street 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar 

 BODY:
At a seminar here this week on relations between America and Islam, one of the questions discussed by American and Muslim scholars was that elusive issue: Where is the Arab street and how might it respond to a U.S. invasion of Iraq? For my money, the most helpful answer was provided by the Jordanian columnist Rami Khouri, who said that "what's really important today is not the Arab street, but the Arab basement." 
 This is an important distinction. The "Arab street" is the broad mass of public opinion, which is largely passive and nonviolent. The "Arab basement" is where small groups of hard-core ideologues, such as Osama bin Laden and his gang, have retreated and where they are mixing fertilizer, C-4 plastic explosives and gasoline to make the bombs that have killed Westerners all over the world. 
 Over the years, Arab leaders have become adept at coping with the Arab street, which is why not a single one of them has ever been toppled by it. They know how to buy off, or seal off, its anger and how to deflect its attention onto Israel. They also know that the street's wrath can be defused by progress on the Arab-Israeli front or elections at home.
The Arab basement, though, is a new and much more dangerous phenomenon. These are small groups of super-empowered angry men who have slipped away from the street into underground cells, but with global reach and ambitions. While issues like Israeli and U.S. policy clearly motivate them, what most fuels their anger are domestic indignities -- the sense that their repressive societies are deeply failing, or being left behind by the world, and that with a big bang they can wake them up and win the respect of the world. 
"These guys started in their living rooms," said Mr. Khouri, "then they went out into the streets, got pushed back, and now they have retreated to the basements." Unlike the Arab street, no diplomacy can defuse the Arab basement. It doesn't want a smaller Israel, it wants no Israel; it doesn't want a reformed Saudi monarchy, it wants no Saudi monarchy.
So what to do? The only sensible response is to defeat those in the Arab basement, who are beyond politics and diplomacy, while at the same time working to alleviate the grievances, unemployment and sense of humiliation that is felt on the Arab street, so that fewer young people will leave the street for the basement, or sympathize with those down there -- as millions of Arabs do today.
There is no question that America can help by making a more energetic effort to defuse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and by speaking out for the values that America has advocated everywhere in the world -- except in the Arab world: namely democracy. I met yesterday with 50 students from an elite Qatari high school and the new Cornell Medical College in Doha. They were so hungry to talk, to have their voices heard; and what you heard when you listened was how much they still looked up to America, but how much they thought America looked down on them. 
But the Arab states have a huge role to play too. You cannot seal the door between the Arab street and the Arab basement without addressing the reasons for Arabs' backwardness and humiliation cited in the U.N.'s Arab Human Development Report, which are their deficit of freedom, their deficit of women's empowerment and their deficit of modern education. 
"It takes many years of political, social, economic and human degradation to create a terrorist," notes Mr. Khouri. "So fighting terror can only succeed by rehumanizing degraded societies, by undoing, one by one, the many individual acts of repression, obstruction, denial, marginalization and autocracy that cumulatively turned wholesome developing societies into freak nations, and decent, God-fearing people into animals that kill with terror."
My guess is that the only way to stop the drift of young Arabs from the street to the basement is by administering some shock therapy to this whole region. Could replacing Saddam Hussein with a progressive Iraqi regime be such a positive shock? I don't know. I don't know if the Bush team really wants to do that, or if the American people want to pay for it. But I do know this: If America made clear that it was going into Iraq, not just to disarm Iraq but to empower Iraq's people to implement the Arab Human Development Report, well, the Arab basement still wouldn't be with us, but the Arab street just might.

HEADLINE: Climate Talks Will Shift Focus From Emissions 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The latest round of international talks on global warming begins today in New Delhi, with delegates focused more on ways to adapt to changes than on cutting emissions of gases that scientists say are the main cause of rising temperatures.
 The shift in focus is to some extent motivated by the Bush administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 climate pact completed last year and endorsed by most of the world's countries, rich and poor. 
 Without the United States, the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, the Kyoto treaty is so weak, experts and government officials say, that it may have little effect. Others say the treaty has in any case been so watered down through years of negotiations that it is likely to be of limited benefit. 
Instead of looking mostly at ways to reduce the level of heat-trapping gases, then, the 10-day conference "will discuss how to build greater capacity, especially in developing countries, for minimizing vulnerabilities and preparing for worsening droughts, floods, storms, health emergencies, and other expected impacts," said a statement issued by the United Nations, which supervises the talks. 
The shift satisfies the Bush administration, which has fought to avoid mandatory cuts in admissions for fear it would harm the economy. "We're welcoming a focus on more of a balance on adaptation versus mitigation," said a senior American negotiator in New Delhi. "You don't have enough money to do everything." 
Many developing countries also embraced the change as an opportunity to press for more aid from rich nations. A central question in New Delhi, several delegates said in interviews, will be how much should the industrialized countries -- which generate most of the greenhouse gases released into the air -- pay to help poorer countries deal with the consequences. 
Some private environmental groups criticized the shift, saying that it was essential for countries to intensify efforts to blunt the human impact on climate even as they seek ways to deal with the consequences. 
Others said that even a weak treaty was better than none at all. "The protocol does not do much of anything for the atmosphere," said Eileen Claussen, the president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a private group. "But you've got to get a framework in place before you can take more than relatively small steps." 
The treaty, if it enters into force early next year as most delegates expect, would technically require industrialized countries that are signatories to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 2012 to more than 5 percent below levels measured in 1990. 
But it includes a host of compromises that limit the need to cut releases from smokestacks and tailpipes. For example, it grants credits for growing forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. 
The Kyoto pact grants billions of tons of carbon-dioxide credits to Russia, where the economic implosion of the last decade resulted in emissions diving far below 1990 levels. 
Other countries can meet their treaty targets at least in part by purchasing some of Russia's surplus credits, which some environmental groups have taken to calling "hot air" credits. 
One of the biggest weaknesses, experts say, comes from the abandonment of the treaty last year by the United States, which produces about half of all the carbon dioxide released by industrialized countries and a fourth of the global total. 
President Bush this year called for voluntary American measures to slow, but not halt, growth in emissions, saying the strict timetables of the treaty would have harmed the economy. He also said that global warming needed to be attacked by all countries. The treaty required no action by big developing countries like China and India, whose emissions could soon surpass those of wealthy countries. 
Most scientists agree that the main cause of a 50-year global warming trend is a rise in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide released by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. 
The warming is projected to affect ecosystems, agriculture, and coastlines around the world, with most of the harm focused in poor countries that are least able to build defenses.

HEADLINE: Schools, Transportation, Air Quality Are Issues in Debate 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
In their third debate, Gov. John G. Rowland and his Democratic challenger, William E. Curry Jr., sparred tonight over many of the same issues raised in their first two meetings: education, transportation, the environment and the possibility of a third Indian casino in Connecticut.
 But unlike the first two debates, this one took place in Stamford, in the heart of affluent and vote-rich Fairfield County, where issues like urban sprawl and increasing traffic congestion are election priorities. 
 Accordingly, if there was a difference tonight in the two candidates' increasingly familiar refrains from the two past debates -- Mr. Rowland's steady recitation of his achievements in eight years, and Mr. Curry's itemized indictments of the ways in which he says the governor has failed to improve life for middle- and low-income people -- it was in Mr. Curry's eagerness to compare his thoughts on open space and commuter trains with Mr. Rowland's two-term track record. 
Mr. Curry painted the Rowland administration as a group of road builders uninterested in innovative public-transportation solutions to relieve the congestion that clogs Interstate 95 many hours a day. 
Mr. Rowland countered with statistics on how many buses and commuter-train cars have been added to solve congestion. 
Mr. Curry also hammered Mr. Rowland for supporting a plan to build towering high-capacity electricity lines through Fairfield County instead of investing in renewable energy sources. He also accused Mr. Rowland of not doing more to improve Connecticut's air quality, which is among the nation's worst.
"The governor could have been a hero to every school kid who carries around an inhaler," Mr. Curry said. "Instead, he caved in to the energy companies."
Mr. Rowland stuck to his main points: 150,000 new jobs in the last 10 years; 30,000 acres of recently bought open space in Fairfield County; public schools whose students that score among the highest in the country; experienced leadership in tough economic times. 
Political experts say Mr. Curry has refined his message and curtailed his habit of giving meandering answers since the first debate with Mr. Rowland on Oct. 7, moves that may translate into more votes on Election Day. 
But, they added, with only two weeks left to campaign and only one-quarter of the money that the Rowland campaign has raised, Mr. Curry has reached the moment of truth. If he is to win, experts say, he must do something immediately to catapult himself ahead or damage the governor. 
Mr. Curry remains publicly optimistic. On Monday, he highlighted the silver lining in a just-released University of Connecticut poll that showed Mr. Rowland leading by 15 percentage points among likely voters. Two weeks ago, Mr. Curry noted, he had trailed by 18 points, evidence, he said, that his message was beginning to sink in. The poll, of 608 likely voters, has a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points. 
But the UConn survey held other clues suggesting that a full-fledged Curry comeback may not be imminent. Those surveyed indicated that improving public education is their top concern in choosing the next governor, and that Mr. Rowland would do that better than Mr. Curry, by 43 percent to 31 percent.
Balancing the $12.3 billion state budget, which now faces a $400 million deficit, was the second-greatest concern of those surveyed. On that issue, respondents favored the governor over Mr. Curry by 46 percent to 30 percent. 
But perhaps most worrisome for Mr. Curry is his relative lack of support from fellow Democrats. While 85 percent of Republicans support Mr. Rowland, Mr. Curry carries only 57 percent of Democrats, the poll found.
Most Connecticut voters are independent; among them, the poll found Mr. Rowland leading Mr. Curry by 42 percent to 31 percent. 
The two candidates are scheduled to debate once more, next Monday.

HEADLINE: Japanese Plan To Overhaul Banks Hits A Stone Wall 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE and KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Heizo Takenaka, Japan's new economy czar, was forced late today to postpone his plan for sweeping changes in bank regulation to deal with the country's $420 billion mountain of bad bank loans, just before he was scheduled to lay it out in detail to reporters. 
 The development, which took most people in Tokyo by surprise, appeared to have been engineered behind the scenes by a conservative alliance of bankers, bureaucrats and ruling-party legislators, who bitterly oppose Mr. Takenaka's plans to force the banks to recognize and write off bad loans much faster than they are now willing to do. 
 The bad-loan plan, developed by an 11-member task force of experts named by Mr. Takenaka when his responsibilities were expanded to include financial regulation early this month, would tighten the rules governing how banks count their capital and take away much of their discretion on which loans to classify as nonperforming. 
Analysts say those changes would result in banks having to book losses so large that several of Japan's -- and the world's -- biggest institutions would be rendered insolvent. The plan would oblige those banks to accept public funds to shore up their balance sheets, and in doing so give the government the power to dismiss their managements, or in some cases to nationalize the banks completely.
Though called a postponement, today's action raised serious questions about whether Mr. Takenaka's plan would be allowed to proceed at all, or whether it would be delayed and watered down to the point of impotence, the fate of many past efforts to deal with the banking crisis.
Apparently unaware of the brewing rebellion against Mr. Takenaka's plans, a Bush administration official lavished praise on the minister by name in a press club luncheon speech today, and the minister's staff was still working through the afternoon to prepare for the minister's scheduled briefings with reporters in the evening.
But the cracks had already begun to open beneath Mr. Takenaka's feet. Mikio Aoki, an influential member of the upper house of Parliament, openly criticized Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi today, saying that "what he lacks most is leadership vis-a-vis the economy," a remark that analysts later interpreted as a declaration of political war against Mr. Takenaka's plan. Speaking to reporters, another ruling-party member of Parliament, Hideyuki Aizawa, said of Mr. Takenaka, "The party's worried about him pursuing his own radical way."
Conservatives were rattled earlier this month when Mr. Takenaka broke with 12 years of cautious government policy and told reporters that he thought no bank or borrower was too big to be allowed to fail. 
Though Japan's seven largest banking groups lost a combined $32.8 billion last fiscal year, they all exceed minimum capital requirements as they are now defined. But analysts say that most of them would be in danger of failing to meet the requirements under Mr. Takenaka's plan. Most bank stocks fell today, as did the Japanese stock market generally.
Masashi Teranishi, president of UFJ Bank and chairman of the Japanese Bankers' Association, spoke out forcefully today against aspects of the plan, telling reporters at a news conference: "It's like being told we can suddenly use our hands and play American football, when all along we've been ordered to play soccer. If the longstanding regulations were to change rapidly, it would cause confusion in the markets and among investors."
His reference to America was pointed: Mr. Takenaka taught economics at Harvard University before joining the government, and his proposals are widely seen -- and resented -- as an attempt to impose on Japan an American approach to bank regulation.
John B. Taylor, United States under secretary of the Treasury, told reporters in his luncheon speech today: "Minister Takenaka, I understand, has established some principles for dealing with nonperforming loans. I agree very much with these principles. They make sense, and we're supportive of those."
At midafternoon, one of the 11 members of Mr. Takenaka's task force on the bad-loan crisis was in a downtown hotel, sipping hot cocoa to combat Tokyo's autumn chill and summarizing the main points of the plan that was to be announced in a few hours.
"The task force has a very big sense of urgency," he said. The state of some of Japan's major banks is so bad, he said, that nationalizations "are very possible."
Pressed for details, he answered serenely that Mr. Takenaka would be furnishing them in handouts to reporters at briefings in a few hours.
But that never happened. Instead, Mr. Takenaka was summoned to a meeting late in the afternoon with the eight top executive members of the ruling party. Mr. Aizawa, who leads an economics panel for the party, said that the leaders "are worried that the tax force's plan would cause the bankruptcy of many banks and their corporate borrowers."
Emerging from the meeting, Mr. Takenaka said that he had "consulted with many people on their opinions" and decided to delay announcing the bank cleanup plan. The Japanese news media reacted with excited reports of Mr. Takenaka's humiliation at the hands of the conservatives, and one television reporter even described the day's events as a "coup d'etat." 
Analysts were more measured. "This is good news for the bad banks, good news for the bad companies, and bad news for the economy," said Brian Waterhouse, senior Japan bank analyst at HSBC Securities. "It is very disappointing that the very person who we hoped was actually going to get something done has been stymied at the first hurdle."
With Mr. Takenaka, Mr. Koizumi's chosen point man on bank reform, unable to overcome the opposition of the conservatives on his own, analysts said the situation had become a crucial test of Mr. Koizumi's leadership in the run-up to voting to fill seven vacant parliamentary seats on Sunday. 
"It's going to be a serious issue if the ruling party continues to object to Takenaka's plan after the elections," said Takeshi Sasaki, the president of Tokyo University and a former political scientist. "If the results of the elections are bad, there will be even more attacks against Takenaka, which may inflame the situation further."
Mr. Koizumi's own credibility is on the line, said Robert A. Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Japan. "If they backpedal on this reform, they are politically dead," Mr. Feldman said of Mr. Koizumi's cabinet. "The strategy for the antireform people was to convert Koizumi into a puppet."
Japan's prime minister was noncommittal this evening.
"There are various views as a matter of course," he said after Mr. Takenaka postponed his plan. "Some say the disposal of bad loans should be accelerated and others say it should not be accelerated."

HEADLINE: 54% Who Lost Airline Jobs After 9/11 Are Still Jobless 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Many airlines laid off a fifth of their workers after the Sept. 11 attacks, and a report released yesterday found that 54 percent of New York-area airline workers who lost their jobs remained unemployed.
 The report, based on surveys by the machinists' union and three City University of New York professors, also found that half of those laid off had no medical insurance at some point in the last year and that a fourth still had no coverage. 
 The survey, one of the largest conducted on post-Sept. 11 layoffs, also found that 12 percent of the area's laid-off airline workers had to move for financial reasons, while 31 percent said they feared they might have to move soon because of financial difficulties.
"There is an ongoing disaster for these airline workers who were displaced by the events of 9/11," said Bill Kornblum, a City University sociology professor and the main author of the report. 
For the survey, the machinists' union and three professors at City University Graduate Center mailed questionnaires to 1,800 mechanics, customer service representatives, baggage handlers and other workers laid off by United, American and Trans World Airlines, and 609 workers returned completed questionnaires.
One jobless worker, Joel Garhartt, an avionics crew chief who had worked for T.W.A. for 27 years, said he and his wife were selling their house in Astoria, Queens, because they could no longer afford their $885 monthly mortgage payments. Mr. Garhartt's unemployment insurance, $405 a week, ran out after nine months.
"It feels strange having to sell our house after living there for 27 years," he said.
At a news conference at City University Graduate Center, James Parrott, deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, estimated that the airlines laid off about 10,000 workers in the New York area.
"This was an industry that was hit harder than any other industry in New York City," Dr. Parrott said.
The Fiscal Policy Institute and the Consortium of Worker Education, a labor-backed group that helps retrain workers, sponsored the study.
Unemployment benefits for most of the airline workers expired in July, causing the report's authors to recommend federal legislation to extend benefits at least three months.
Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, attended the news conference on a day when he was campaigning for H. Carl McCall, the Democratic candidate for governor. Calling the airline workers victims, Senator Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said, "They didn't lose their lives, but they did lose their livelihoods, and now many of them are starting to lose hope."
He noted that when President Bush's father was in the White House, unemployment benefits were extended three times.
"We were able to agree that extending unemployment benefits was the right approach then; we should be able to agree that it is the right approach now," Mr. Daschle said.
Many workers said they had looked for other jobs with little success.
"I'm extremely depressed," said Helen McFarland, a ticket counter supervisor who had worked 35 years for T.W.A. "I was making $17 an hour, and I just went for an interview for an administrative job at a doctor's office that paid just $8 an hour," Ms. McFarland said. "I can't afford to live on that."
Steve Sleigh, director of strategic resources for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, criticized lawmakers in Washington for approving $11 billion to bail out the airlines industry while doing little to help aviation workers.
"The crisis for New York's airline workers and their families is about to get worse," Mr. Sleigh said, adding that many of the unemployed would soon lose their medical coverage because they could no longer afford the premiums.
Gloria Daniels, who was a station support clerk for United, said she could not afford the $350 a month needed to keep her medical insurance.
"I have to go to the doctor next week, and I'm going to have to pay for it out of my own pocket," said Ms. Daniels, who was carrying job-rejection letters from Delta, JetBlue and Sabena.
In the survey, 21 percent of the laid-off white workers said they had no medical insurance, while 39 percent of the black workers and 37 percent of Hispanic workers said they were without coverage.

HEADLINE: Wider Support Is Sought For Disclosing Fund Votes 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Three organizations yesterday urged investors to campaign for a new regulation that would require mutual fund companies to disclose how they voted on company issues. In doing so, they contended that the nation's major funds have too often sided in secret with corporate America when making proxy votes for their individual investor customers.
 The campaign is a joint effort of Pax World Funds, a mutual fund company; the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; and Funddemocracy.com, a shareholder-rights group. The effort is an attempt to overcome opposition by mutual funds to a rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 20. The S.E.C. has given the public until Dec. 6 to comment on the proposal. 
 "There is strong industry opposition to the S.E.C.'s rule proposal," said Thomas W. Grant, president of Pax World Funds. "The reality is, individual investors are going to have to speak up."
By requiring that fund managers disclose how they vote shareholders' proxy votes, the S.E.C. hopes to ensure that advisers vote in the best interests of clients. This may not always be the case, according to the S.E.C., which has noted that conflicts of interest may arise when fund managers oversee 401(k) accounts or other employee benefit plans for the same companies whose shares they own and whose proxy issues they vote on. To keep these accounts -- and the fees they generate -- from moving to another fund company, fund managers might vote with corporate management even if the vote was not in the best interests of public shareholders. 
Investment managers oversee $19 trillion in assets today, the S.E.C. said, including large equity stakes. As a result, funds can be a powerful force in protecting shareholders from weak corporate governance or pernicious managerial practices. 
But in the years since the stock market bubble burst, and even in the recent past, as scandals have dominated the business scene, few fund companies have been willing to take up public fights against corporate executives. Funds have even been silent on runaway executive compensation, a trend that almost all investors seem to agree is unacceptable. 
As a result, some investors wonder whose side fund managers are on. "The tendency of mutual fund management to vote with corporate management has contributed to the $1.5 trillion that has been lost by investors," said Michael Garland, corporate transactions coordinator for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Fund managers have a fiduciary duty to vote in the best interests of their fund investors, but they're basically saying, 'Trust us.' The only way to monitor this fiduciary duty is to give clients the information they need to monitor it."
The Labor Department requires pension fund managers that oversee investments of union pension plans to disclose their proxy votes. But mutual funds that oversee 401(k)'s are not subject to such a rule.
The mutual fund industry has not yet formally commented on the S.E.C.'s rule. But it rejects the existence of a conflict of interest involving the shares it holds for clients and the fees it earns from managing large accounts for corporations.
"The voting of proxies is part of all mutual funds' duties to shareholders, and the funds take this obligation very seriously," said John Collins, spokesman for the Investment Company Institute. "For the first 62 years of the fund's modern existence the shareholders have been well served by the current system."
Mutual fund companies have also argued that compliance with the rule will be costly. Fund companies also say that if their votes are made public, outside groups might use the information for their own purposes and might campaign for funds to vote in ways that were not in the best interests of shareholders. 
Mr. Grant of Pax World Funds rejected the argument that disclosing proxy votes would be expensive. His company, which specializes in socially responsible investing, has disclosed its proxy votes since 1971 without incurring excessive costs. 
Mr. Garland noted that in 1998 Fidelity voted against a shareholder proposal that would have increased the number of independent directors at Tyco International.
"Stronger board oversight may have been able to prevent the kind of abuses that went on at Tyco," he said. "Instead you had a board that was largely beholden to the C.E.O."
Vincent G. Loporchio, a Fidelity spokesman, said it never discussed specific proxy votes. "We are carefully reviewing the S.E.C.'s proposal," he said. "We vote over 5,000 proxies every year, and we have long believed in quiet diplomacy where we work with management for the best interest of our shareholders."

HEADLINE: The Healthier Side Of Health Care 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Health costs are spiraling into another year of double-digit increases. Patients, employers and government health programs are feeling the financial pain.
 But where is the money going? And why do health costs continue to rise when in so many other parts of the economy -- from cars to clothes to computers -- prices are falling and profit margins are being squeezed? 
 The big winners for now include hospitals, particularly those that have assembled networks that dominate local markets, and makers of ingenious medical devices like advanced heart pacemakers and the latest hip and knee replacements that cost more than the earlier versions. Nurses, in short supply through much of the country, are getting big raises and better working conditions. 
And the strongest managed care companies -- even though they long ago lost their power to check health care costs -- are reporting sharply higher profits, as premiums rise even faster than do underlying costs.
By contrast, the growth of spending on drugs is slowing, after a decade-long bonanza of profits for drug companies. As health plans require members to pay a steeper share of drug costs, more consumers are turning to lower-priced generic versions of blockbuster drugs like Prozac whose patents have expired. Doctors are writing more than eight times the new prescriptions for the generic version of Prozac, fluoxetine, than for Prozac itself, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.
The pattern, in other words, is a classic one: the less competition, the higher the prices. 
"Anybody that charges money and has close to a monopoly is ahead of the game," said Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, head of the Jackson Hole Group of health policy experts, which drafted an early version of the Clinton health proposal. "The losers are the patients."
Many health insurers are enjoying robust profits, passing on their costs -- and then some -- to employers, dropping money-losing customers and doing little to compete on price, analysts say.
Last week, the UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest managed care companies, reported a 44 percent leap in earnings per share for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with the period a year ago. This month, Aetna, a big insurer that lost money last year, said its third-quarter profit would be twice what Wall Street was expecting.
Employers say that they are fed up with the increases, but their main response so far has been to shift more costs to workers in the form of higher deductibles, higher co-payments and a larger share of insurance premiums.
In 2003, employees will pay an average of 19 percent of total premiums for individual coverage, up from 17 percent in 2001, according to a survey of large employers released last week by Hewitt Associates, the benefits consulting firm. For family coverage, employees will pay 24 percent of premiums, up from 21 percent last year.
Employers, which typically still pay the greatest share of health costs, are putting up with the substantial increases because they know that coverage is a big item in recruiting and retaining workers, said Helen Darling, president of the Washington Business Group on Health, a group of big companies nationwide. For their part, workers are eager for more, rather than less, health care, as long as they have insurance to pay most of the bills.
More than half the increase in health spending is for hospital services. Outpatient costs are now the fastest-growing health care category, outpacing drugs, according to a study published last month on the Web site of Health Affairs, a scholarly journal. 
Hospital executives say that they are just passing along their own increased costs, notably for medical technology like the latest in catheterization and for higher salaries in a nursing shortage.
On Monday, 10,200 nurses at 17 hospitals and 34 medical offices in California operated by Kaiser Permanente ratified a contract that includes wage increases of 26.5 percent over four years, expanded retiree health and pension benefits and a ban on compulsory overtime. The California Nurses Association said that hospital staff nurses with eight years of experience in the Bay Area currently earn close to $75,000 a year.
(Physicians' fees, by contrast, have been rising less than 2 percent annually, the Health Affairs study said.) 
Of course, if hospitals were merely covering their costs, the earnings of some for-profit hospital chains would not be growing. Insurers and government officials say that some hospital systems have won the power to raise prices and profits by developing oligopoly-like concentrations of hospitals in markets like Houston, Long Island, Boston and San Francisco.
Some of the largest hospital operators point to other explanations for their profit gains. The Tenet Healthcare Corporation, among the nation's largest hospital chains, reported a rise in profit of 118 percent, to $338 million, in its latest quarter while revenue increased 12 percent, to $3.7 billion., It said the increase resulted from treating sicker patients and getting higher rates from H.M.O.'s and increased reimbursements from Medicare.
Another big engine of rising costs is new technology. Purchasers of health care rarely say no to a hot new product or drug that can extend or improve the quality of patients' lives, but advances generally carry premium prices. 
In just over a year, for instance, sales of a new type of pacemaker that coordinates the action of both sides of the heart have hit $470 million, a figure that Glenn M. Reicin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, projects will rise to $700 million next year. 
The pacemakers are offering a new lease on life to 40,000 people in the United States with congestive heart failure. And they have contributed to a rise exceeding 15 percent this year in sales and profits at both companies that make them. Medtronic of Minneapolis has more than half the market; Guidant of Indianapolis has the rest.
Advances in cardiology have been a steady source of profits for medical device makers. Minimally invasive procedures to open clogged arteries are another case in point. 
First, in the 1970's, there were $300 balloons, inserted through an artery. But arteries often clogged up again within months, so surgeons began inserting tiny metal props called stents that cost $1,000 each to prop the artery open. 
One patient in six still had serious reclogging and needed a repeat procedure. So device makers developed drug-coated stents, which tests and experience overseas have shown to be much more effective. But they cost $3,000 each.
Wall Street analysts estimate that the coated stents will add more than $3 billion next year to the nation's $1.5 trillion health care bill. Kurt Kruger, a health care technology analyst at Banc of America Securities, expects that most of the money will go to Johnson & Johnson. Last night, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of the company's coated stents. Final approval is likely to come later this year. 
The outlook may be less promising for makers of prescription drugs. Richard T. Evans, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said that pharmaceuticals were "no longer a growth industry." The drug makers seem unable, he said, to raise prices and reduce costs of production and sales enough to keep profits rising during fallow periods when important new drugs are scarce. 
Spending on new drug research and development is less productive than formerly, Mr. Evans added, while consumer resistance to high drug prices is rising. On Monday, when President Bush offered a plan to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs, the stocks of most big pharmaceutical companies fell.
Like so much in the economy, of course, the prospects of health providers move in cycles. 
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton, said that insurers would probably prosper for the next two to three years before competition among them brings prices down and squeezes profits.
Hospitals may be the next target for protests by patient advocates. Although one hospital in four is in financial trouble, strong hospital groups "have the upper hand these days, so they will come in for greater scrutiny," said Mark Pauly, a health business economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "People are looking around for some other bad guy."
Dr. Arnold Milstein, a health care consultant at William M. Mercer, agreed. "First it was H.M.O. executives, then pharmaceuticals that got their comeuppance," he said. "Now it's the hospitals' turn."

HEADLINE: Golisano, Battling Red Tape, Bites the Hand That Fed Him 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
As the Independence Party's nominee for governor of New York and the star of his own expensive advertising campaign, Tom Golisano has repeatedly condemned the tax and paperwork burdens that he says Albany imposes on small businesses.
 "The bureaucracy and the administrative red tape of being an employer and a business in this state are way too complex for small business," he told voters in a recent debate. "We have to change these things to make it better." 
 But helping small businesses cope with that red tape is exactly how Mr. Golisano built the substantial fortune that is financing his run for state office, his third since 1994. And his Rochester-based company, Paychex, has itself sought some of the corporate tax breaks that Mr. Golisano, who is 60, deplores. 
The company's application for about $600,000 in state tax subsidies to help finance its expansion, which was criticized in a televised debate on Sunday, was defended by Mr. Golisano in a recent interview. "Imagine the situation I'm put in as a C.E.O.," he said. "They offered it, we're entitled to it, other companies are getting it, I represent the shareholders today -- and I said 'yes.' "
This balancing act has left the billionaire businessman vulnerable to accusations of hypocrisy, like those raised in the recent debate. But to corporate watchdogs, it simply underscores how carefully Mr. Golisano has separated his private ambitions from the duty he owes to Paychex's shareholders, including several large public pension funds, most of Paychex's 8,000 employees -- and himself.
Although the campaign Mr. Golisano is running has been described as a bit haphazard -- "He's an amateur, an outsider and a neophyte," said Mark Alesse, the New York state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, the small-business trade group -- the company he runs as chief executive is anything but. 
Paychex's basic business is handling the back-office personnel chores, from generating payroll checks to withholding income taxes, for more than 440,000 small and medium-size businesses across the country.
Measured by its client count, Paychex is the second-largest payroll processing company in the country, after the older and better-known Automatic Data Processing. (As it happens, A.D.P.'s co-founder, Frank R. Lautenberg, is also on the ballot this fall, as the Democratic Party's replacement for Senator Robert G. Torricelli in New Jersey's United States Senate race.)
Paychex has a financial position many C.E.O.'s would envy. It has a fat cushion of cash, and no debt. Since its shares were first listed on the Nasdaq market, back in 1983, its annual revenues have soared and so have its profits. After adjusting for stock splits over the years, the price of Paychex's stock has increased from roughly 19 cents a share in 1983 to $28.79 a share yesterday -- a gain of more than 30 percent a year for nearly 20 years.
Besides a host of other investments, Mr. Golisano still holds just under 40 million shares, or just over 10 percent, of Paychex's stock; at recent prices, that stake alone is worth more than $1.1 billion.
Although Paychex's track record has made Mr. Golisano glitteringly rich, his personal style is not extravagant, friends say. His toys are unremarkable for a man of his wealth: a Gulfstream jet, a Mercedes convertible, boats and three homes (a 2,500-square-foot ranch outside Rochester, and vacation homes on Canandaigua Lake and in Naples, Fla.)
And the corporate culture is spare almost to the point of eccentricity. "That's part of being an entrepreneur -- you watch your pennies," Mr. Golisano said during an interview in his corner office, about the size of a single room at a Holiday Inn.
Paychex's red-brick headquarters building on the outskirts of Rochester is fresh and functional but not lavish. The art on the walls could have come from Sears; the desks, which are supposed to be kept clutter-free and tidy, are early Marriott. Mr. Golisano's pay package, just under $750,000 a year, is remarkably modest, executive compensation experts say. He did not get a bonus last year because the weak economy and low interest rates slowed the company's revenue growth, and he receives no stock options.
Neither he nor any of his executives receives even the most common perks of corporate life -- no company cars, no reserved parking spaces, no country club memberships, no company-owned jets, not even fancy titles on the business cards.
Originally christened Paymaster, Paychex was born in 1971, the brainchild of Mr. Golisano, a young Rochester-area native who seemed to have been born with an entrepreneurial itch. (When he married, his father-in-law offered to lend him the price of a house; Mr. Golisano asked instead for a loan to buy two small rental properties and, he recalls, "became a landlord at 21.")
His formal education after public high school was a two-year stint at Alfred State College, sandwiched between two unsatisfying bouts of working in a bank. "From the day I got out of school" in 1962, Mr. Golisano said, "I was looking for an idea."
He found it in 1966 when -- at age 25 -- he quit a sales job at a large corporation to start Bidder's Guide, a newsletter that collected bidding information from local newspapers and made it available to companies interested in selling goods and services to local governments.
It was a good little business but not enough to support his young family, so he got a job as a salesman for a payroll processing company. But he kept looking for another business idea -- and found it in the potential customers his employer overlooked.
"It struck me that most businesses have less than 100 employees, but most payroll services were going after bigger companies," he said. So he thought up a way to provide payroll services to very small companies at a price they could afford.
He proposed that instead of sending employees out to collect payroll information in person, they do so by telephone -- "cheaper, easier and faster," he said. (Today, it can be done over the Internet.) He also calculated that if he could collect the payroll taxes that employers have to withhold, he could free them of a difficult chore, and earn a little interest on the collected tax funds besides. That would help him keep his fees low enough for small businesses to handle.
Even today, Paychex's average customer has just 14 employees, about a quarter of A.D.P.'s average customer, according to John Morphy, Paychex's chief financial officer.
After Mr. Golisano was unable to sell his concept to his employer, he quit and, in 1971 at 30, he started the company that became Paychex. "My original business plan? To work hard, get 300 clients in the Rochester area and live happily ever after," he said. "But it took four years to get to 400 clients -- it was during the gas crisis, in a terrible economy."
His drive to build Paychex took its toll on his early marriage to Gloria Austen, with whom he has a son and daughter. (Neither is active in his business or his campaign, and Mr. Golisano is firmly protective of their privacy.) At the time of the divorce, in 1978, Ms. Austen asked to be installed as the Paychex franchise owner in New York City, and when the company went public in 1983, she retired on her profits, he said. They remain friends, he added, and she serves on the board of his private charitable foundation.
In 1994, a second marriage also foundered, perhaps because of Mr. Golisano's entrepreneurial appetite. "I'm a 7-times-24 person," he said a bit awkwardly. "I'm always in on weekends. This is what I love to do."
He also owns a private company that provides vintage radio programming to nursing homes. He bankrolled a nephew who started a documents-storage company that was later acquired by Iron Mountain, an industry giant on whose board Mr. Golisano still serves. He is backing a college student who has developed an Internet company that provides e-mail, scheduling and data storage services to small businesses that lack an internal computer network. 
Sounds like that last one might be a good fit for Paychex. "You mean because it has recurring revenues, is service-based and is aimed at the same customer base?" he asked, grinning broadly. "No, I hadn't considered that at all."
Not every idea works. Jobline, a job clearinghouse service he started in the early days at Paychex, was a costly flop, as predicted by the naysayers whom Mr. Golisano ignored. "One of the mistakes that entrepreneurs make is to think they're a little immortal," he said. "Once we closed Jobline, I didn't have any illusions on that score."
Mr. Golisano's freewheeling creativity stops at the chief financial officer's desk at Paychex. Mr. Morphy said he and his boss were in "total agreement" about the need for credible, conservative accounting and bulletproof audits. Indeed, Mr. Morphy said he almost fired the company's outside auditors a few years ago for not being tough enough on the company.
Corporate reports to shareholders are prompt, clear and candid. But one thing has not yet been officially disclosed: that the company's C.E.O. is running for governor and, if he wins, will leave the company.
Mr. Golisano says the company has not kept his candidacy a secret. "It's been discussed on our conference calls with analysts, and they're all posted on our Web site," he said.
It's also been discussed by the board, said Grant Inman, a venture capitalist who has served on the Paychex board since 1983. "He'd be a great governor -- but I hate to even say that because I love him running this company."
But no, his candidacy and its potential consequences for Paychex have not been mentioned in the company's reports to shareholders, Mr. Morphy acknowledged. And why not? He thought for a moment, and then composed a diplomatic answer. "One of the tests for determining whether something is material," he said, "is to weigh the likelihood that it will actually happen."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Software: Shares In 2 Video Game Companies Fall 

BYLINE:  By Matt Richtel (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Share prices of two video game companies dropped markedly yesterday, as industry analysts have begun to wonder whether video game sales will be as robust this holiday season as originally expected. Shares in Eidos P.L.C., based in Britain, fell about 15 percent, to 84 pence, after the company said it would delay the release of "Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness" until February. 
The company said it needed more time to test the game. Shares in THQ Inc. lost 39 percent after the company said Monday that its 2002 profits would be at the low end of earlier projections, and its 2003 earnings would be far below analyst consensus estimates. The company blamed poor global economic conditions, and the lower-than-expected sales of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox. The news came as the industry prepared for the crucial holiday sales season. But not all video game makers were expressing concern. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., based in New York, said yesterday that it had received more orders for the new version of "Grand Theft Auto," than it did for the first version of the game, one of the most popular games ever. The new version, "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City," is scheduled to reach stores next Tuesday. Matt Richtel (NYT)

HEADLINE: SAFETY; 
Deaths Mounting Again In War on Drunk Driving

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FOR 15 years, the United States was winning the war against drunken driving, steadily reducing the percentage of deaths from accidents involving alcohol.
 But at some point in the mid-1990's, the progress stopped and then reversed. Now, the struggle is a war of attrition, with drunken driving claiming about 17,000 deaths a year and inflicting tens of thousands of disabling injuries. Experts offer many explanations as to why the war bogged down, but they are mostly variations on a theme. 
 "People think the problem has been solved," said Wendy J. Hamilton, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
The increase in the number of young drivers has very likely played a role, experts say, and attention has been diverted to other issues, like road rage, cellphone use and defective tires.
Whatever the cause, the reversal has been striking. In 1982, when drunken driving became a national issue (President Ronald Reagan convened a task force against it and Congress established a National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week), the fraction of fatal crashes in which someone had a blood alcohol level of at least .08 was 53 percent, translating into 23,246 deaths. 
By 1997, that figure had fallen to 34 percent, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with 14,421 fatalities, a reduction of about a third carried out over a period of huge growth in vehicles, drivers and miles traveled.
But since then, the figures have crept back up last year, to 35 percent and 14,953 deaths, based on .08 alcohol concentration level, which Congress recently set as the national standard for drunken driving and encouraged states to incorporate into their laws. (Two-thirds of the states are now at .08.)
The statistics are more important as a yardstick of progress than as a precise measure of deaths. There is no actual count of fatalities caused by a drunken driver; rather, the count reflects the number of fatal accidents in which the driver, a pedestrian or someone else involved had a blood alcohol level of .08 or above. 
Making further progress would require a stronger sense of urgency, but it would also need a strategy as to what kind of problem driver to pursue: the large group of people who occasionally drink a bit too much, or the smaller but far more dangerous group of drivers who drive when very drunk? 
To illustrate what this means, Annette Sandberg, the deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a former superintendent of the state police in Washington State, pulled out a bar chart showing the blood alcohol concentration of the most inebriated driver in each fatal crash. More than half the fatalities involved people who were at twice the legal limit or above. The median was .16.
Ms. Sandberg thinks that there are fewer deaths involving even drunker drivers because it is difficult to operate a car above that level, although the chart topped out with nine drivers who had astounding blood measures of .43. 
It's easier to drive a car at levels around .08 and .10, which was the common legal standard until now. But experts think that fewer cars are crashed with drivers at that level because many people who might in the past have drunk themselves to .08 or .10 have stopped drinking and driving.
In an interview, Ms. Sandberg said: ".08 scared a lot of people. It's a lot easier to get to .08, and you need to be more cautious." Lowering the standard and enforcing it, she added, may have impressed casual drinkers but not people who can reach .16.
"A lot of states need to have stricter rules with regard to their problem drinkers," she said.
In fact, some states are running short of tactics against casual or heavy drinkers. California, which adopted many laws to fight drunken driving early on, has felt the effect of most of them by now, said Cliff Helander, chief of research at the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. Progress has stopped, he said, because "there's been a stoppage of major legislation."
California's last major law was almost 10 years ago, he said, allowing the police and the courts to seize the cars of drunken drivers and hold them for 30 days. It also uses tactics that other states use, like automatic license revocation if a Breathalyzer test shows illegal blood alcohol concentration. He said the next big step might be to raise the tax on alcoholic beverages.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, a New York Democrat who was instrumental in the federal .08 legislation, introduced a bill this year that would set national minimum standards for sentencing repeat offenders.
Repeat offenders and those convicted with especially high-blood-alcohol concentrations would face vehicle impoundment, alcohol ignition interlocks (which work like a Breathalyzer built into the car), treatment and imprisonment. People stopped by the police who refused to take a Breathalyzer test would face penalties tougher than those for drunken driving.
The bill did not even get a hearing. Ms. Lowey, in a telephone interview, was philosophical. "We're not doing much of anything in this Congress," she said. Next year, when the major transportation appropriations bill comes up, she added, she would try to append her proposal to it, and MADD would be knocking on legislators' doors.
Ms. Lowey's bill, named after Burton Greene, a constituent in her Westchester County district who was killed by a drunk driver, focuses on repeat offenders. But in 2001, drunken drivers involved in fatal accidents who had had a conviction in the previous three years represented only 8.4 percent of all alcohol-related fatalities, amounting to 1,461 lives.
Deaths involving drunken drivers with no previous convictions were 10 times more of a problem. Thus, some experts say that a campaign to stop first offenses is vital. 
Some of those experts say that the next step should be in the other direction, to continue cutting the rate of drunken driving among lighter drinkers, who are more open to reason. They suggest lowering the blood alcohol concentration further. The limit is set by states, but Congress twisted the arms of all 50 legislatures in 2000 by tying future highway aid to the blood-alcohol limit, just as it forced the states in the 90's to raise the drinking age to 21. 
The hospitality industry, as it calls itself, fought tooth and nail against .08, arguing that petite women would be over the limit with two drinks. So, stricter limits would be hard to win. The international experience, though, might support a lower limit. At the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an organization of industrial nations, a researcher pointed out that the .08 or .10 allowed in America was "at the high end of the range of blood-alcohol-concentration levels adopted as the legal limit by O.E.C.D. countries." 
Ceallach Levins, of the organization's transport division, said that some Western European countries and Australia had set the allowable blood alcohol concentration at .05 or lower.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Levins said, "The message you're giving by having a higher blood alcohol concentration is that it's O.K. to have a couple of drinks and then drive." But if the limit is set closer to zero, some people cannot legally drive immediately after drinking, even if they had only a single drink, he said. "Socially, you're getting a very different message across." 
ON the other hand, there is forward movement in seat-belt use, which is up to about three-quarters of adults, and offers a collateral benefit to drinking and driving. Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, points to seat-belt use as a cure-all, reducing fatalities and the severity of injuries among people hit by drunken drivers, people riding in cars driven by drunken drivers and drunken drivers themselves -- not to mention accident victims in cases where everyone was sober. 
In states that allow the police to stop cars because someone is not buckled, there is an opportunity to smell for alcohol.
The drunken driving challenge is frustrating because, generally speaking, the procedures and equipment needed to fight it are already available. For all the fanfare about stricter laws governing drunken drivers, they cover only the ones who are caught. According to the AAA, with 1.5 million arrests in 1999, the chance of being arrested while driving drunk were fewer than 1 in 50. Even those whose licenses are revoked still drive. 
"We know what needs to be done," said Barry M. Sweedler, the president of the International Council on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety and the former chairman of the National Transportation Research Board's committee on alcohol and drugs in transportation. "But we must summon the political and social will to make it happen."

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Traffic Deaths and Alcohol"The campaign against drunken driving made progress for 15 years but stalled and reversed in the mid-1990's. Congress recently set a blood alcohol level of 0.08 as a national standard for drunken driving. The question now is whether to pursue the large group of drivers who sometimes drink a little or the smaller group who drive while very drunk.

HEADLINE: Untypically, a Rockefeller Tells the Story of His Life 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
John D. Rockefeller, the famously secretive oil baron who founded his family's vast fortune, once confided that of all his grandchildren, the one who most resembled him was David A. Rockefeller, the only one of his generation to follow his grandfather into a life of business. They were exceptionally close from the boy's infancy in 1915 until the old man's death in 1937.
 Yet it is David Rockefeller who, at age 87, has become the first in three generations of Rockefellers to publish an autobiography, breaking a century-long habit of fierce privacy instilled in his clan by his grandfather. 
 "Memoirs," a candid account of Mr. Rockefeller's life at the busy intersection of global banking, family business and unofficial diplomacy, made its debut from Random House yesterday. And the attendant publicity splash would make the old tight-lipped titan flinch: an 11-city author's tour and a media blitz that has run the gamut from the early-morning "Today" show to late-night's Charlie Rose. The whole exercise is remarkable for a Rockefeller, said Ron Chernow, the author of "Titan," a biography of the dynasty's founder. "John D. Rockefeller, as a monopolist of the gilded age, believed as fervently in corporate opacity as we believe today in corporate transparency," Mr. Chernow said. "And his son was an extremely private and self-effacing man." 
He added, "It is a mark of strength and self-confidence that David Rockefeller can come out and tell his life story in a very forthright way."
Mr. Rockefeller does indeed lay the family linen out on the lawn -- his painful conflicts with his older brothers, his insecurities as a child and shortcomings as a father, his battles over art and real estate and his proud but rocky career at Chase Manhattan Bank, now part of J. P. Morgan Chase.
Why did Mr. Rockefeller, who remains busy with the many cultural, educational and public policy groups supported by his family's fabled philanthropy, undertake this atypical project?
"Well, it just occurred to me that I had led a rather interesting life," he said mildly during an interview in the red-walled library on the second floor of his Manhattan town house. "I thought maybe my own children and family might be interested." Once the idea took root, roughly in mid-1984, he was encouraged strongly by his wife and former colleagues at the bank to see it through, friends said.
One impulse behind the memoir was almost certainly Mr. Rockefeller's desire to show that he had worked for his place in the world and not simply inherited it, especially his place at Chase, long associated with the Rockefeller family.
"It is a very strong element of the family to resent the knee-jerk assumption that 'you can get whatever you want because you're a Rockefeller,' " said Peter J. Johnson, a historian who has worked at the Rockefeller family office for decades and oversaw the memoir project.
Thus Mr. Rockefeller recounts how he labored to earn his doctorate in economics, spending a winter marooned at the family's opulent Tarrytown estate to work on his dissertation and then defending it at the University of Chicago. He tells how he came to enlist as a private in the Army in 1942, shunning the commission his father could have obtained for him and not only surviving the rigors of basic training but also carrying out well-regarded military intelligence work in North Africa and Europe. And he explains at considerable length how hard he worked making Chase an international bank and tackling internal problems that brought his board to the brink of firing him in 1975.
But whatever his initial motive, he says the approach he took -- a candor wholly uncharacteristic of the family previously -- was a lesson he learned from his friend Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post and the author of "Personal History," her own Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography.
"We were both working on our memoirs at the same time, and she encouraged me to do it this way," he recalled in the interview. "It just seemed to me that people would enjoy the book more if I were pretty frank and open -- without causing embarrassment or unhappiness to people," he added. "I tried to avoid being unkind."
He confesses in the book, for example, to his own fearful ambivalence about enlisting for military service after Pearl Harbor, even though his college roommate and dearest friend, Richard Gilder, had done so immediately. He enlisted after his mother prodded him, he said. "I knew that Mother was right," he wrote.
He is equally open about some of his stumbles at the bank. There was, for example, the "unity retreat" he organized for senior management in late January 1969, at which one of his top executives got drunk and wound up in a fistfight with the bank's controller.
Some of the most revealing passages in "Memoirs" deal with the relationships among the Rockefeller brothers, the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. "Winthrop faced an unusually difficult situation within the family," Mr. Rockefeller wrote. "Nelson and Laurance were a club to which he wasn't invited. I, three years his junior, was a club he didn't want to join." Of his brother Nelson, he wrote: "A family adviser once said the two most expensive things a Rockefeller can do is run for public office and get divorced. Nelson did both." And the divorce, in 1961, profoundly altered his view of his childhood hero. "The scales fell from my eyes and I no longer saw him as the hero who could do no wrong but as a man who was willing to sacrifice almost everything in the service of his enormous ambition," he wrote.
Perhaps only a historian would notice, but Mr. Chernow pointed out that Mr. Rockefeller's book is coming out almost exactly a hundred years after the famous muckraker, Ida Tarbell, published the first installment in her historic magazine series about Standard Oil, the iron-fisted monopoly that was the source of the family's immense wealth.
Because Mr. Rockefeller neither types nor uses a computer, producing his 469-page autobiography required a team that perhaps only a Rockefeller could afford. Besides Mr. Johnson, who had worked with the family on a two-volume biography of John D. Rockefeller III, at least 15 other people assisted in the project at various times, searching family and bank archives, transcribing long interviews with friends and former colleagues, and building a day-by-day chronology to guide the elderly banker's recollections.
"He talked his memoirs out," Mr. Johnson said. Those conversations would be reduced to typed drafts, which Mr. Rockefeller would revise extensively by hand. Those changes would be incorporated in new drafts, with which he would again tinker. It was a time-consuming approach that tested the patience and diplomacy of all involved.
Inevitably, there were courteous but firm disagreements. "David loves the passive voice," Mr. Johnson recalled with a laugh. "He loves to have had things happen to him. So that was something we had to work on."
Now that his labors are done, Mr. Rockefeller seems quietly delighted with the book, the proceeds of which he will contribute to charity. His wife, Peggy, to whom he was married for 56 years, did not survive to see it finished, but their six children have applauded their father's effort, especially his handling of the generational strife within the family, Mr. Johnson said, adding, "They feel he told their side of the story very well."
And Mr. Rockefeller's only surviving sibling, the reclusive 92-year-old Laurance S. Rockefeller, has read the book and liked it well enough that he gave copies to all his staff, Mr. Johnson said.
Despite the army of people who worked on the book, those who know Mr. Rockefeller say it still sounds like him: gentlemanly, slightly detached about his wealth, diplomatic but firm in his opinions. "Knowing the process he was using, I was afraid it would sound like it had been written by a committee," said Mr. Chernow, the historian. "But based on my knowledge of the man, it is David's voice, most certainly."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Money and Momentum Elude McCall

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Short of cash and struggling to find a penetrating message, the campaign of H. Carl McCall has been pushed largely to the sidelines in recent days, while Gov. George E. Pataki and Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, wage a war to win over moderate and conservative voters, political strategists say.
 Mr. McCall has been hamstrung by a lack of money since he won the September primary. Recent polls show that he has failed to make headway outside New York City. Indeed, he is running neck and neck with Mr. Golisano in upstate counties and in the city's suburbs. In two previous campaigns, Mr. Golisano never got more than 8 percent of the vote statewide. 
 Mr. McCall, the 67-year-old state comptroller, is stuck in a politician's Catch-22: it is difficult to raise money unless he can show he is gaining momentum and it is hard to gain momentum without spending money for advertising.
Mr. Golisano, meanwhile, a billionaire financing his own campaign, has spent more than $40 million on ads, most of them attacking the governor. His aides say he is spending more than $1 million a day. 
Governor Pataki, who holds a 9- to 10-point lead in most polls, had more than $12 million to spend as of the last campaign filing three weeks ago. At that time, Mr. McCall had only $1 million, and though he has been raising funds furiously, his aides concede he still lags far behind the other two candidates.
"He's locked in almost as a spectator," said Richard Schrader, a Democratic campaign consultant not involved in this race. "He's a bystander while Golisano and Pataki go to war." 
Making matters more difficult for the Democrats, Mr. McCall has been forced onto the defensive by the governor, who has made significant inroads into traditionally Democratic voting blocs like union members and Latino voters. The upshot is that the Democrat has spent most of his time campaigning in New York City, trying to galvanize his base of support. He has flitted from issue to issue, seeking a message that will resonate. 
Privately, several national and state Democratic officials complain that Mr. McCall has not done enough to raise money. At the same time, Mr. McCall's allies, like Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, have criticized the Democratic National Committee for not doing more to help Mr. McCall.
In recent days, Mr. McCall has been dogged by questions whether the national party had lost faith in his campaign. "No, they're not doing enough for me," Mr. McCall said without rancor at a rally in Manhattan on Saturday. "And I want them to do more, don't you?" 
The Democratic National Committee has yet to fulfill its promise to raise $500,000 for Mr. McCall's campaign, though it has given him about $240,000 so far, and the party chairman, Terry McAuliffe, remains committed to raising the rest, a spokeswoman said. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton are also holding fund-raising events for Mr. McCall. 
Yet some Democratic officials say that Mr. McAuliffe appears to have lost confidence that Mr. McCall can win and has decided the party's resources would be better used in key Senate races around the country.
"The party has a finite amount of money," one national official said. "The races most likely to win are getting the money."
Mr. McCall has seemed listless on the campaign trail since last month, when he weathered criticism over letters he had written on official stationery recommending his daughter and friends for jobs. He rarely reverts to the fiery rhetoric and preacher's cadences that he was wont to lapse into after his primary victory in September.
And without cash to broadcast attack ads against Mr. Pataki, the McCall camp has pinned its hopes on Mr. Golisano's barrage of ads questioning the governor's ethics and record on the economy.
Some Democratic strategists believe the higher Mr. Golisano climbs in the polls, the more votes he takes away from the governor. They also hope Mr. Golisano's attack will drive down the governor's support among conservatives and encourage the governor's Democratic supporters to return to their party.
Recent polls show Mr. Pataki with about 4 out of 10 votes statewide, while Mr. McCall has about 3 and Mr. Golisano has about 2. The theory is, if Mr. Golisano sneaks up a few points and takes Mr. Pataki down a few points, Mr. McCall might be able to squeak in with only 40 percent of the vote. 
"You are not going to have to have 50 percent to win this race," one McCall aide said. "If Golisano can rip off a little bit more on the right side, and we can bring the Democrats home, we can beat him."
But waiting for one's enemies to destroy each other has risks. "Carl won't be on the air," Mr. Schrader pointed out. "The danger for Carl is he disappears."

HEADLINE: Big Turnaround at Nissan Leads to Record Profits 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Thanks to strong sales of Altima and Infiniti cars and progress in cutting costs, Nissan Motor will announce record profits today for the six months ended Sept. 30. The automaker will also raise its profit forecast for the year and consider paying shareholders a dividend for the first time in four years, the company said.
 The strong results extend a remarkable turnaround for Nissan, Japan's No. 3 carmaker, which just a few years ago was buried in debt and nearly bankrupt. The latest period will be the fifth consecutive half-year of rising earnings. 
 By selling assets, closing factories and squeezing costs in other ways, Nissan has reduced its debt by nearly 90 percent from its peak.
Having strengthened the balance sheet, the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, is now trying to close the gap in sales between Nissan and its bigger Japanese rivals, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor. To freshen its product line, Nissan introduced 11 models around the world in the first half of the fiscal year, and Nissan is scheduled to roll out another dozen models in the next six months. To meet expected demand for these cars, Nissan will step up production by 240,000 vehicles a year in existing plants, and gain additional capacity when it opens a plant in Canton, Miss., next year.
The upbeat numbers from Nissan come as something of a surprise, given the economic weakness in Japan and Nissan's reluctance to offer cash incentives to American buyers. Sales rose 12.1 percent in Japan and 8.3 percent in the United States from the period a year earlier. 
Nissan had an operating profit of 348 billion yen ($2.8 billion) in the period, the officials said. The operating income figure is about 20 percent more than many analysts had forecast.
Net income after taxes and charges was 286 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in the six months, a 24 percent increase from the period a year ago. The company expects full-year net income of 490 billion yen ($3.9 billion).
Nissan's revival presents new challenges to Toyota and Honda, which have dominated Japan's auto market in recent years. Nissan's subcompact car, the March, has become a hit with young drivers, and demand for its new Z sports car has been strong in the United States. The company plans to introduce a sport utility vehicle, the Murano, and three new Infiniti models before March 31.
"In a slowing economy, it's who has the new models coming out," said Kurt Sanger, an analyst at ING Barings Securities here. "Of the Big Three in Japan, Nissan has the most new product."
By reducing the company's debts and scrapping old factories, Mr. Sanger said, "Ghosn is essentially putting Nissan's balance sheet in line with Toyota's and Honda's."
Renault of France owns about 37 percent of Nissan. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about earnings for Nissan in the six months ended Sept. 30 included an erroneous reference from the company to its record of dividend payments in recent years. Nissan did not pay dividends in the years ended in March 1999 and 2000 but paid them in 2001 and 2002; a payout in March 2003 would not be its first in four years.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICANS; 
IN HOMESTRETCH, BUSH MAKES PUSH FOR G.O.P. GAINS

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER with ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: DOWNINGTOWN, Pa., Oct. 22 

 BODY:
The White House is mounting an all-out push over the final two weeks of the midterm elections, dispatching President Bush to campaign almost nonstop between now and Election Day, as officials seek to turn Mr. Bush's popularity into Republican victories this fall. White House officials today said they were poised for a "historic" Republican triumph next month.
Mr. Bush's travels took him to Pennsylvania and Maine today, as he campaigned on behalf of Republicans running for Congress and governor and, for the first time, specifically exhorted voters to turn out and support Republicans. In recent days Mr. Bush has talked increasingly about domestic issues in what White House aides described as an effort to prevent the Democrats from gaining traction on the issues they consider vital this fall.
White House officials said today that they now believed that the Republicans would at least hold on to the House, where they have a six-seat edge. They said they were less optimistic about the Senate, where Democrats hold a one-seat edge, and still expected that the Republican Party faced a net loss of governors, if only because more seats held by Republican governors are up for election this year.
But in an unusual setting of expectations, senior White House officials said that the Republican Party was in a position to defy historic trends and increase the party's margin in the House.
Only twice since 1934 has the party in power in the White House added seats in the midterm elections, and Mr. Bush's advisers said they believed that the president could help make that happen again.
"If Republicans are able to either keep the House or win back the Senate, we would make history by defying history," Ken Mehlman, the White House political director, said in an interview.
White House officials, who settled on the strategy after prolonged internal discussions, acknowledged that having Mr. Bush campaign had its risks. For one thing, Mr. Bush has now irrevocably tied his prestige to the outcome of these elections and runs the risk of a bad outcome being interpreted as a judgment by voters on his policies. 
For another, several Democrats argued that Mr. Bush was taking a chance in leaving the White House to campaign, noting that President Bill Clinton did much the same thing in 1994, when the Democrats lost 52 seats in what was the equivalent Congressional election of his presidency.
Mr. Clinton's chief of staff at the time, John Podesta, said he now believed that Mr. Clinton might have had a more positive influence on voters had he stayed above the partisan fray and remained in the presidential setting of the White House.
Beyond that, Democrats said they saw opportunity in the course Mr. Bush has chosen, arguing that he was making the election a national referendum on his policies, both foreign and domestic.
The Democrats are broadcasting television advertisements attacking Mr. Bush's economic record in the areas where he is campaigning. In e-mail messages to reporters, they send economic statistics tailored to Mr. Bush's location, and Democratic Party officials are saying that Mr. Bush's activities have provided a much-needed opportunity for the party out of power.
"We believe that Bush's decision to embark on a 14-day, 17-plus-state political tour is going to give Bush his own unwelcome and unexpected 'October Surprise' by having the consequence of nationalizing the mid-terms around the issue of the economy," Mr. Podesta and Joe Lockhart, a Clinton White House press secretary, said in a memorandum to Democratic Party leaders over the weekend. "Bush's strategy presents Democrats with the opportunity to exploit Republicans' most potent political vulnerability -- their mismanagement of the economy and poor leadership record on domestic economic issues."
White House officials expressed confidence that Mr. Bush could withstand those attacks and dismissed the comparison with Mr. Clinton in 1994.
Matthew Dowd, a Republican Party pollster who advises the White House, noted that Mr. Bush was riding a wave of popularity that no president had enjoyed at this point in his presidency since John F. Kennedy in 1962. Mr. Clinton was viewed favorably by about 45 percent of the electorate in 1994; by contrast, Mr. Bush's favorability rating these days is around 65 percent in several polls. 
"This year, the opposition is not running against George W. Bush," Mr. Mehlman said.
Beyond that, White House officials said they concluded that potential benefits of this campaign-closing strategy clearly outweighed any risks.
With Democrats and Republicans saying that turnout has emerged as a decisive factor in these elections, Republicans argued that Mr. Bush's presence was critical to counter what they are expecting to be extraordinary turnout operations by Democrats and their supporters. "In our calculus, the net gain is for the president to appear on behalf of these candidates, in order to get our voters to the polls," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director.
Accordingly, White House officials said that most of Mr. Bush's political stops over the final two weeks would be get-out-the-vote rallies, typically in airport hangers and field houses and that they would open up the stage to Republican candidates running for all levels of office. Today, Mr. Bush repeatedly appealed to voters to make sure to show up on Election Day.
"I'm here to ask you to do whatever it takes to make sure you crank up a good, healthy vote," Mr. Bush shouted at a rally here in Downingtown, a suburb of Philadelphia.
White House officials said Mr. Bush's latest schedule called for him to campaign on 9 of the 14 days before the election.
"The travels of the president over the next week will be to places where his presence can make the difference," Karl Rove, his senior political adviser, said today.
That said, Republicans said they were aware that in some cases Mr. Bush's presence could be problematic. For example, as of now, he is not scheduled to return to Florida to help his brother, Jeb Bush, who is in a difficult re-election campaign for governor. Given what happened in the 2000 presidential election, officials in both parties said that an appearance in Florida by the president could do more to turn out Democratic voters than anything the Democratic Party might do.
Further, Democratic officials said they were moving to try to turn Mr. Bush's high profile against him.
"It gives us an opportunity to engage on a topic that we have been itching to engage in for the past six months," Mr. Podesta said in an interview.
He added, "Rather than to continue in the role of commander in chief, rather than looking big and strong on the national front, he is out there in the dirt with candidates."
Democratic officials said they believed that Mr. Bush's political stature would be hurt if Republicans suffer setbacks despite his efforts. Mr. Bush's aides said they had considered that, but concluded there would be such speculation no matter what Mr. Bush did.
 "Those stories will be written whether he's sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or whether he's on the road," Mr. Bartlett said. More than that, several White House officials argued that even a bad showing by Republicans this November would say little about how Mr. Bush might do in 2004 -- as Mr. Clinton demonstrated decisively in 1996.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about President Bush's campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates misstated the White House position once held by John Podesta, who commented on the political risk to President Bush. At the time of the 1994 elections, Mr. Podesta was staff secretary in the Clinton White House; the chief of staff was Leon E. Panetta.

New WorldCom Losses Hint at a Disputed Future

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Despite its troubles, WorldCom is still an immense company, generating about $80 million in revenue daily, according to data WorldCom released yesterday. It is also a deeply unprofitable company. 
 So how WorldCom may behave if it emerges from bankruptcy protection next year has become a hotly debated question in the telecommunications industry in recent weeks. It is a debate with important ramifications for consumers, business customers, WorldCom's myriad creditors and its competitors. 
 The regional Bell giants are telling anyone who will listen that a revamped WorldCom could plunge the entire industry back into the destructive price wars from which it is only now emerging. Some of the regional Bell allies in research institutes are even suggesting that the Federal Communications Commission strip WorldCom of its licenses and essentially shut the company down. 
But many independent analysts and WorldCom's most direct competitor, AT&T, say that the company would have no choice but to emerge a wiser and more conservative business, one more focused on making money than on generating sales at any cost.
Yesterday, in its first financial report since an accounting scandal resulted in the company's filing for bankruptcy protection in July, WorldCom said it lost $429 million in July and August, while recording revenue of about $4.9 billion in that period. Those figures would seem to support the argument for prudence.
The report of such a big loss might be expected to cheer WorldCom's competitors. But it could also undermine the arguments by the Bell companies and their allies that the government ought to place restrictions on WorldCom if it emerges from bankruptcy protection with most or all of its $42 billion debt wiped off the books.
Without the need to service a debt load comparable to those of its competitors, the new WorldCom could afford to cut prices -- particularly in lucrative business markets -- far below those of other carriers, the Bells say.
"We have a problem with companies that use bankruptcy as a way of cleansing themselves of all their sins and then driving prices down," Ivan G. Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon Communications, the nation's biggest local phone company, said at an industry conference in Washington yesterday.
In an interview yesterday, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the chairman of SBC, the No. 2 local service carrier, made a similar case, saying the terms of WorldCom's emergence would have "huge implications for the industry and the people we serve."
John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's chief executive, said in an interview yesterday that the company would have no motivation to keep losing money. "We have been a competitive business from the beginning and we will continue to be competitive in the future," Mr. Sidgmore said, "but we don't want to start a price war." 
That could have implications for the bargains that millions of consumers and business callers have been enjoying in recent years. While the collapse of stock prices and the loss of jobs in the telecommunications industry has been devastating to investors and employees, for many customers the telecommunications boom of the 1990's has never ended.
As recently as a decade ago, consumer long-distance rates of 35 cents a minute or more were common. Now, astute consumers rarely pay more than 10 cents a minute.
More important, price deflation has been the rule for many years in corporate communications markets, where chief information officers learned to play AT&T off WorldCom, Sprint and Global Crossing, and to play all of them off the regional Bells.
In the 1990's, the much-discussed oversupply in the telecommunications industry was at least as much an oversupply of competing carriers as of raw communications capacity.
Now, according to senior executives across the industry, pricing is finally beginning to firm. (There are few public sources of pricing information for corporate communications because terms are often negotiated case by case basis.)
"In general we feel like prices have stabilized," David W. Dorman, AT&T's president, who is to become the next chairman and chief executive, said in an interview yesterday. Mr. Dorman said WorldCom appeared to be negotiating some especially good deals to retain some important corporate clients. But he added: "Prices have generally stabilized. We're not seeing any new lows, no crazy kinds of behavior."
These days, as Mr. Sidgmore helps lead WorldCom's search for a new chief executive, the company's future direction depends largely on its creditors.
There are essentially five constituencies among the creditors. One consists of companies (like the Bells) to which it owes about $9 billion for services rendered and goods provided. Another is the banks to which WorldCom owes some $2.65 billion. There are the holders of WorldCom's approximately $25.5 billion of its own bonds, as well as the holders of roughly $3.3 billion in bonds issued by MCI, which WorldCom acquired in 1998. And there are the holders of about $1.2 billion in bonds issued by Intermedia, a small communications company that WorldCom bought last year. (There are also holders of preferred stock, but they will essentially be wiped out along with the company's common shareholders.)
For now, the creditors are trying to piece together WorldCom's historical financial records -- the real numbers, not the cooked-books version -- to determine whether any of the three groups of bondholders are entitled to proportionally more of the company than the others.
But in a few months there will come calculations with more far-reaching consequences. The creditors will decide the total amount of debt that they will essentially reissue to the new WorldCom -- or, more likely, to the new MCI, as the company may be known, to distance itself from the tainted WorldCom brand.
For the creditors, the main choice is how much debt they want to retain. By keeping a lot of debt, they may have more confidence in getting at least a few pennies on their dollar. But a lean and relatively debt-free WorldCom might be a nimbler competitor, leaving more potential upside for holders of the revamped company's stock.
Whatever the final creditor calculus, a new WorldCom -- or MCI -- will probably emerge with far less debt than the $42 billion it now carries, and potentially none at all. It is the none-at-all end of the range that the regional Bell companies say they fear, because of the potential it could give WorldCom to engage in new rounds of destructive pricing.
Many analysts dismiss the Bells' argument as regulatory posturing. The analysts say that WorldCom's new shareholders (initially, at least, the current creditors) would demand a conservative approach to profitability rather than unprofitable growth. So would other investors who might consider buying stock in the new company, analysts say. 
WorldCom's loss-laden financial report yesterday may only strengthen the argument that it must focus on achieving profitability. Spokesmen for the WorldCom creditors' committee declined to comment.
"They have been pricing at an unprofitable level for the last three years and that's not sustainable," said Scott Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a communications research firm in Washington. "They used fraud to subsidize their price offerings. I doubt WorldCom will be a disruptive pricer, going forward. They can't afford to be. Their creditors want profit from their prices, not losses."
On condition of anonymity, two Wall Street telecommunications analysts concurred yesterday. They said that WorldCom's corporate customers were far more worried about service quality and reliability than about price.
Perhaps most surprising, WorldCom's chief rival, AT&T, also argues that the company will need to maintain some pricing discipline.
"It's not like there's this huge multibillion-dollar pricing advantage that they can immediately get," Mr. Dorman, AT&T's designated successor, said yesterday. "I don't think predatory pricing from someone who is not generating positive operating margins is a possibility. They will have more capital flexibility and that will be an advantage for them, but it doesn't translate immediately into some market-price advantage because there are other parts of the cost equation besides debt that they have to work on."
At WorldCom, Mr. Sidgmore sees the Bell companies' argument as a cynical ploy in support of their own long-running campaign for various forms of regulatory relief.
"Isn't it a little bit distasteful," he said, "that we have the Bells, a bunch of monopolies with multimillion-dollar lobbying budgets, running around complaining about a company coming out of bankruptcy?"

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: MOSCOW; 
Briefed Further on North Korea, the Russians, Openly Skeptical Before, Are Silent

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton briefed Russian officials for a second day today on American intelligence evidence that North Korea has an active nuclear weapons program. Russian officials, who indicated on Monday that the initial evidence fell short of proof, were silent after today's presentation. 
 But it was not clear whether that silence signaled continued skepticism or Russian agreement that the program -- which North Korea has admitted to the United States -- must face united opposition, as the White House has urged. 
 Mr. Bolton left Moscow today after talking with Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov about North Korea, Iran and other issues that are likely to dominate talks this weekend in Mexico between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bush. 
The two presidents will meet during the so-called APEC summit meeting of Pacific economic powers. The United States has ruled out further talks with North Korea until it forswears its nuclear ambitions. For its part, North Korea has remained unyielding and even threatening in the face of American condemnation. 
"If the U.S. persists in its moves to pressure and stifle the D.P.R.K. by force, the latter will have no option but to take a tougher counter-action," the official Korean Central News Agency said today. 
In Moscow, Mr. Bolton presented the American case against North Korea to a range of senior Russian officials on Monday and today. Mr. Ivanov was said to have received the most detailed account of American intelligence conclusions about the North Korean weapons effort. 
An American diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said before that meeting that Russian officials "concur that what North Korea is doing in the uranium enrichment field amounts to a clear violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty" and a brace of other nuclear agreements. 
But Mr. Ivanov had nothing to say today about his meeting with Mr. Bolton. On Monday, his deputy, Georgi Mamedov, told reporters that Mr. Bolton's presentation to him had been unconvincing, and suggested that American belligerence toward North Korea and other nations in the so-called axis of evil were at the root of world tensions. "This information has come only from one source," he said of Mr. Bolton's briefing. "This is why we have to resort to all possibilities for gathering objective information." 
Russia's government does not always speak with one voice, and so it was not clear whether Mr. Mamedov's obvious skepticism reflected Kremlin policy or a personal view. Russia has openly disagreed with American characterizations of Iraq and Iran, the two other nations in Mr. Bush's "axis of evil," as would-be nuclear powers with potential ties to terrorists. 
The American diplomat expressed hope today that Mr. Putin would override any reservations among his advisers and use his personal relationship with President Kim Jong Il of North Korea to press for an end to the nation's nuclear program. 
North Korea has signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which commits nations to forswear developing or spreading the technology to develop nuclear weapons, as well as a 1994 accord in which it agreed to abandon any nuclear ambitions in exchange for help with a civilian nuclear-reactor program. 
The United States has said it has unalloyed proof that North Korea has broken both pledges by trying to acquire sophisticated centrifuges used only to purify uranium for nuclear bombs. 
American officials say it admitted its program early this month after initially denying the American accusations. 
Since then, Korean officials have made no further public admission of their nuclear efforts. --------------------

Koreas Agree to a Dialogue
 (By The New York Times), SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, Oct. 23 -- North and South Korean negotiators agreed early today on a joint statement to cooperate "through dialogue" after the North rejected a demand that it pledge to abide by its previous commitments, including the 1994 Geneva framework under which the North was to abandon work on nuclear weapons.
The statement issued by the South Korean unification minister, Jeong Se Hyun, and the North Korean chief negotiator, Kim Ry Song, dropped the North's demand for the United States to stop "hostile" activities.

California and Computers In Two Murder Mysteries

BYLINE:  By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
CHASING THE DIME
By Michael Connelly
371 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.95.

THE MURDER BOOK
By Jonathan Kellerman
408 pages. Ballantine Books. $26.95.
 Gumshoe tactics used to be clever enough for detective work. But increasingly these days typing plays a major role. In their sneaky new California murder mysteries, both Michael Connelly and Jonathan Kellerman make computer research and other technological dexterity integral parts of crime-solving and successfully use this to generate suspense. Mr. Connelly has even had the ingenuity to make a voice-activated lighting system vital to his book's combative denouement. 
 "Chasing the Dime" is steeped in up-to-the-minute science. Its main character -- a new one for the author best known for Harry Bosch -- is a research chemist named Henry Pierce. And he has done innovative work in the field of molecular computers and nanochips ("What if your computer was in the button of your shirt or the frame of your eyeglasses?"), to the point where his company is involved in a race to patent its breakthroughs. Henry has named the cutting-edge project Proteus, in honor of the white submarine in "Fantastic Voyage" that traveled through human bodies.
Speaking of bodies, "Chasing the Dime" also has a lot to do with cyberpornography. Henry has just moved into a new apartment in Santa Monica (after his breakup with the woman in his life, a weary and obligatory subplot for this genre) when he gets a phone call for someone else. And then another and another. It seems that his new number previously belonged to a hot number named Lilly, who advertised her availability as an escort for a service named L.A. Darlings. Presto: Henry begins investigating this outfit once he figures out that Lilly is permanently unavailable for future dates.
So Henry enters a world with disembodied sex for sale and criminal shadows lurking in the background. It is the same world that entraps Adam Sandler's character in the current film "Punch-Drunk Love," and it also snares this "longhaired surfer chemist." Mr. Connelly uses this accidental voyeurism as a way of hooking readers, but the scientific side of his book is actually sexier. While "City of Bones" had a more gripping mystery plot, "Chasing the Dime" creates a scarily high-tech brand of intrigue.
Mr. Connelly is a spare, expeditious storyteller with a natural talent for generating forward momentum. Mr. Kellerman takes a more detailed and photographic approach. In "The Murder Book" he creates quite the roller-coaster ride for fans of this genre, leading the reader through a panoramic range of West Coast settings and always stopping to catalog the particulars. Only occasionally (at a ranch redolent of "that curious maple syrup-and-rot tang of dried equine dung") do his descriptive powers get out of hand.
"The Murder Book" opens by providing Dr. Alex Delaware, the psychologically probing hero of many of the author's earlier novels, with a chilling gift for the man who has everything. Without explanation, a photo album full of crime-scene pictures arrives at his home. They are captioned unremarkably but guaranteed to prompt a reaction from the homicide detective Milo Sturgis, Alex's longtime friend and sidekick. The book reminds Milo of a grisly case (a murdered teenage girl who disappeared after a wild party in Bel Air) that he failed to solve 20 years ago. And of course it gets his goat.
While Milo cruises through Los Angeles and environs looking for witnesses with long memories, Alex boots up his computer and checks out search engines. "The Murder Book" makes amusing note of how much off-base information such methods can provide (stories on tourism and hundreds of resort links from the name "Playa del Sol," though Alex is trying to find out about a construction project). But it also finds Alex checking data much more thoroughly than he otherwise could, which gives "The Murder Book" a very knotty and abundant set of clues. Mr. Kellerman habitually has trouble streamlining the whodunit part of his mysteries, so the book unearths many acts of treachery. As Alex himself might observe, the author cannot commit.
Alex is having trouble with his longtime girlfriend, Robin, who rarely says anything interesting. She is out of town for almost all of the story (with "the two of us tripping through the calisthenics of separation," as Alex puts it). But as the book travels from Oxnard to Ojai to Santa Fe, from spoiled rich kids to sullen gang members, Alex pauses periodically to mope and worry about Robin. "She's really had it with my risk-taking behavior," he confides to a fellow therapist.
These digressions help turn Mr. Kellerman's latest into Milo's book. Milo is a big guy -- blunt, funny and no nonsense. The presence of a glamorous Vietnamese restaurant with a Bavarian chef in Los Angeles typically brings out his caustic acumen. ("Milo figured the patrons had never served in the military.") He is stung by the guilt-producing Murder Book, and it is his past that gets re-examined here. And the fact that Milo is gay (his partner is Rick, a doctor) and has had to conceal that fact during a long career with the Los Angeles Police Department adds another element of tension to the story. Mr. Kellerman has a way of succinctly noticing all sorts of bigotry in matters of race, gender, sexual orientation and economic caste that supply the underpinnings for his far-reaching story.

HEADLINE: Wary Companies Are Staying in the Muslim World 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
Despite the apparently globe-girdling reach of Islamic terror groups, some of the biggest Western multinational corporations are holding fast to their investments in most Muslim countries.
 Though foreign investment is falling in countries where terrorists have struck, other predominantly Muslim countries with a good record of controlling violence have experienced little or no diminution. 
 Most developing countries, including those with large Muslim populations, badly need foreign investment to help develop modern industries and service sectors. Such investment has been depressed in recent years by the global economic slowdown. But now, as the worst of the slowdown appears to have passed, the threat of terrorism is continuing to hamper foreign economic engagement in some countries. 
Even before the devastating attack in Bali, investment in Indonesia was declining as the country's problems with terror groups received more attention. In the first nine months of 2002, the country attracted 780 investment projects worth $5.4 billion, compared with 1,017 projects worth $6.1 billion in the period in 2001, according to the country's Investment Coordinating Board.
Contrast that experience with nearby Malaysia, half of whose territory lies on Kalimantan, an island it shares with Indonesia and Brunei. About 60 percent of Malaysia's population is Muslim, according to estimates by the State Department. Yet it is light-years distant from Indonesia's troubles in the eyes of multinational companies and foreign portfolio managers.
"Being a Muslim country has not been a deterrent" to investment, said Rafidah Aziz, the minister of international trade and industry in Malaysia, in an interview last week. "We have become the kind of Muslim country that people do not fear."
On Sept. 11, 2002, the United States closed its embassy in Malaysia -- along with those in Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam -- after officials cited "credible and specific" threats of terrorism. Yet at virtually the same time, all three major credit-rating agencies raised their ratings of Malaysia's unsecured foreign-currency debt, a vote of confidence.
Foreign investment in Malaysia has not suffered; rather, it has risen as the country has come to be seen as a more affordable alternative to Singapore, Ms. Aziz said.
Central Asia has also been called a potential hotbed of terrorist activity. Some terrorists from Al Qaeda who trained in Afghanistan may have come from nearby Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and may have slipped back there since the Taliban's fall. But terrorism and the fear of it have not affected all the region's largely Muslim countries.
"In countries like Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, domestic politics is much more important for the way foreign investment works out," said Alexander G. Zaslavsky, director of consulting at the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. These resource-rich countries, he said, "have much more pressing issues than those of religious conflict."
More than one-third of Kazakhstan's foreign investment has come from the United States, and that trend shows no signs of slowing. Much of the investment has been in oil, but earlier this month, the two countries began a program to make more of American investors' money available to small- and medium-size businesses in Kazakhstan.
"Relationships with companies have been strong for the past 10 years," said Roman Vassilenko, press secretary at Kazakhstan's embassy in Washington. "They have seen no change whatsoever in the past year. They have even strengthened."
Even in the countries abutting Afghanistan and Pakistan that have not yet received much money from the West, Mr. Zaslavsky said, the business climate may be improved by the new presence of American armed forces. "It brings legitimacy to the regimes," he said. "It changes the perception, perhaps, of foreign investors as well -- it conveys the image of greater stability."
Among most big multinationals, the mantra is to stay the course, with a bit of extra care. "We have certainly changed security procedures, but not slowed down any investments," David J. O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive of ChevronTexaco, said in an interview last week. "You can't be deterred from your ambition by one set of events." ChevronTexaco has big stakes in oil fields in West Africa and Indonesia.
Coca-Cola has significant investments in more than a dozen Muslim countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia. The company has not canceled or delayed any investment plans in these countries, said Kari Bjorhus, a spokesman. The same goes for Sara Lee, which operates divisions in Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia, said Hillary Sterling, a spokeswoman.
In the view of General Motors, a big Muslim population is not enough, by itself, to suggest the presence of a radical fringe or a major risk of terror.
"I don't think whether a region or a country is predominantly Muslim or otherwise is even a criterion for us," said Toni Simonetti, a spokeswoman for the company, which has both a sales subsidiary and an assembly plant in Indonesia. "We look at things like the stability of a country, the merits of a proposal, the needs of our business."
Nevertheless, Ms. Simonetti said, General Motors assesses the security situation of its far-flung divisions just about every day. "To the extent that there are political risks to conducting business, we go into that with open eyes," she said.
Though multinationals with extensive experience investing abroad appear undaunted, small companies have begun to seek extra assurances that their investments will be safe.
Ms. Aziz regularly travels abroad to drum up investment. In meetings during her latest trip to the United States, she said, "there would be one odd question out of one local guy, who has never stepped out of his state," about security. In such cases, she said, she would try to ease the potential investor's jitters by explaining Malaysia's situation.
"Then," she said, "I tell them, 'If you're still worried, you'd better not go. It's not good for your health!' "

HEADLINE: Historians Are Doing the Mambo; 
After Decades, Latin Jazz Develops Its Own Academic Canon

BYLINE:  By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
By one measure, the invention of Latin jazz could be dated to 1940, when Machito Grillo started his band, the Afro-Cubans, here in New York City. Before long he would be famous for his glorious combinations of jazz harmony and phrasing with Cuban percussion. By another, it could go back farther, to W. C. Handy's composing "St. Louis Blues" over a habanera rhythm. Or to Louis Armstrong's recorded version of "El Manisero" ("The Peanut Vendor"). Or to the early years of the century in New Orleans, when Cuban and African and Creole cultures mixed so effectively. 
 Whatever the measure, until now there has never been any serious movement to study it, canonize it, historicize it. As recently as five years ago jazz bands were still playing a watery pseudo-clave rhythm and calling it Latin jazz. And the enormous amount of jazz scholarship activity since the 1970's -- biographies, discographies, documentary films, CD reissue work -- had no equivalent on the Latin-jazz side. Now several long-flowing streams of interest in Latin jazz are running together, and it seems that the form is becoming recognized as official culture in America, ready for heritage-building, specialized analysis and education. 
 Jazz at Lincoln Center has put its imprimatur on the music with its own in-house Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, led by the pianist and composer Arturo O'Farrill; it will play two concerts this weekend, tomorrow at Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture in the Bronx and on Saturday at Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts. And the Smithsonian Institution in Washington has taken note: a traveling multimedia exhibition, "Latin Jazz: La Combinacion Perfecta," opened there last weekend and will go to 10 American cities by 2006. (In conjunction with the exhibition, Chronicle Books has published an illustrated companion volume, and Smithsonian Folkways has released a CD anthology of Latin Jazz.) Another show on the local roots of Latin music is currently at the Museum of the City of New York. 
The parallel rise of Latin jazz as an increasingly bigger part of college-level jazz education also suggests that America is finally beginning to come to grips with a music that has been around for longer than most have noticed. "I think there's a practical reason for why this is happening," said Mr. O'Farrill, who is the son of the venerated Chico O'Farrill. (The elder O'Farrill, who died last year, composed long-form works like "The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite" and "The Aztec Suite," both basic to the repertory of the Lincoln Center group.) "As we see in popular culture with the acceptance of Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin," he continued, "the Latino population is a heavy demographic, and people in positions of money and power are realizing that this is an economic force to be reckoned with." 
But, Mr. O'Farrill said, the vision of Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, was central to the creation of the orchestra.
"Wynton asked me to come and rehearse the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra at its benefit concert last year," he said. "They were having trouble with some of the phrasing in one of the Latin pieces, and Wynton's wheels started turning. He understood then that you can't just put jazz players in a Latin band. The guys that play this music the best, I'm telling you, are the guys that really know how to phrase in clave." (Clave is the primary Afro-Cuban rhythm.) 
"It takes years just to stop being terrorized by the clave," he added. "And then if you listen to the music of Machito, Chico O'Farrill, Mario Bauza, this is music on a very high level. It's sophisticated rhythmically, but also in terms of harmony, orchestration, arrangement. It's on a par with the best of orchestral big-band jazz. Wynton understood that this is specialized music that's equal and worthy of investment in terms of bringing the highest-quality performance to it. In doing so, he's taken a very bold step." 
The Smithsonian's touring exhibition -- small, colorful and introductory, in the manner of exhibitions produced by Sites, the Smithsonian's traveling-show extension -- makes an effort to get the terms right and to have the audience see Latin jazz in almost participatory terms. One section, complete with pillows on the floor, is dedicated to a video of the drummer and educator Bobby Sanabria demonstrating aspects of the clave rhythm; there are bongos, shekeres, clave sticks and guiros available for anyone to play along. 
The exhibition is not collection based, because Sites has no collections; aside from a 20-minute video on the evolution of Latin jazz and some display cases holding items like Tito Puente's set of timbales, much of the space is given over to tall, conga-shaped kiosks with texts printed on them. Some of that material draws on the Smithsonian's jazz oral history project.
Raul Fernandez, curator of the exhibition, conducted some of those interviews -- traveling to Stockholm, for instance, to speak with the great Cuban pianist Bebo Valdes. Mr. Fernandez sees the exhibition as part of a growing movement to preserve the history of Latin jazz. "When it comes to jazz, I've read biographies dating back to the 1930's with big repositories of photographs and documents," he said. "In Latin jazz there are few collections of significance."
The practical challenges Mr. Fernandez encountered during four years of work on the exhibition taught him, he said, that conservation shapes history. "We met people who said, 'I used to have this instrument, but I didn't know it was important, so I threw it away.' " Other sources had extensive collections of film and photographs, but didn't know their provenance, and the film was of dubious quality.
The short film in the exhibition -- which includes brief but tantalizing scenes of the bandleaders Perez Prado and Mongo Santamaria -- features Mr. Sanabria as one of its chief narrators; Mr. Sanabria also co-produced "The Palladium: Where Mambo Was King," a documentary for the Bravo channel that was first broadcast last June. 
It's noteworthy that Latin jazz is breaking into America's big cultural institutions, but it is perhaps even more meaningful that it is becoming a greater part of college jazz education. Jazz programs in universities all over the country are starting Latin-jazz ensembles. 
Justin DiCioccio, assistant dean at the Manhattan School of Music in New York, created a full-fledged Afro-Cuban jazz curriculum within the jazz division when he started there four years ago. He began with an Afro-Cuban jazz orchestra, led by Mr. Sanabria, who also teaches a class on history and percussion in Latin music. (For the last decade Mr. Sanabria has filled a similar role with the Latin jazz program at the New School University.) The Manhattan program now has two different smaller Latin combos and provides private lessons. 
Some well-recognized young players in New York from Latin-music backgrounds -- John Benitez, Miguel Zenon, and Luis Bonilla, for example -- have enrolled at Manhattan to start or finish degrees; their presence enlivens and alters the school. 
"Up until recently even professional jazz musicians were not playing Latin jazz correctly," said Mr. DiCioccio, who is a drummer as well as an educator. "They just didn't understand the importance of the clave. The Latin music that most young people were coming up with was a fusion kind of thing -- a salsa approach, or a rock approach, as opposed to the deep tradition of the son clave and the rumba clave."
Latin jazz is a history of border-crossings between white, black and Latin cultures: Examples range from Handy's sojourn in Cuba to the Cuban conga player Chano Pozo's entry into the New York jazz world in 1947, to the jazz and mambo scenes in New York intermingling because the clubs for each kind of music were set close together. Mr. O'Farrill sees the possibility, and the need, for a new kind of border crossing, this time on the part of audiences. 
"I think it's important that the Latino community not be scared of institutional culture," he said. "It's been too long that we've allowed this kind of high culture-low culture mentality to permeate us." 
If the concern is about bringing in sufficient audiences to support Latin jazz in a high-culture setting, however, there should be little to worry about. All of Jazz at Lincoln Center's 21 Latin-jazz-themed concerts since 1991 have sold out. "It's like it was in the 50's again," said Chris Washburne, a trombonist professor of music at Columbia. "The jazz record companies start saying, 'All right, you're a jazz musician, jazz isn't selling, do a Latin album.' And I've played in Latin-music concerts at both Lincoln Center and Carnegie that have sold out. The thing is this: Latino culture in general supports music. It's part of Latino society."

HEADLINE: Peso's Devaluation Gives Argentina Cost Advantages 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
Over the last six months, Andres Prieto, president of the Argentine subsidiary of Oracle, has been doing something highly unexpected here: hiring, not firing.
 Admittedly, it has been only 20 software technicians so far, but Oracle has plans to take on another 100 in 2003. 
 The drastic devaluation of the peso in January is finally giving the country's service sectors and some of its export industries a cost advantage over even the most competitive of their competitors.
And that, along with other tentative signals like a rise in industrial production, a growing trade surplus and a partial relaxation of the yearlong freeze on savings account balances, is giving some analysts hope that the economy is finally bottoming out after a four-year slump. 
During the recession, in which the economy has contracted by more than a fifth, the long-suffering Argentines have watched in horror as even their once-proud middle class has slid relentlessly toward poverty, their savings have lain frozen in the banks and the Argentine peso, once pegged at one to the dollar, has lost almost three-fourths of its value.
"Today in terms of price-quality, we are very competitive with India," Mr. Prieto said. "Just a year ago, the costs of developing software projects in Argentina were prohibitive." 
According to Jorge Cassino, president of a trade association for Argentine software companies, Argentina's programmers, who have a reputation for being creative, exacting, well educated and bilingual, cost $10 to $15 an hour -- $5 an hour less than in India and only 10 to 15 percent of what their American counterparts cost.
"That means a U.S. company can make huge savings by farming out programming to an Argentine company," Mr. Cassino said.
Oracle can use the help -- it has had six consecutive quarters of falling sales and profit margins -- and it has been expanding the use it makes of other Latin American units as well, starting projects in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Paraguay. 
According to Pedro Lacoste, a partner at APL Economia consultants in Buenos Aires, the weak Argentine peso is also helping a wide range of other industries, including agribusiness, which accounts for 70 percent of Argentina's exports; steel and aluminum; advertising; and film production.
Mr. Lacoste says the renewed activity in these areas is a first sign that an economic rebound is on the way.
After shrinking by 22 percent in the last four years, more than it did during World War I and the Great Depression, Argentina's economy appears to be stabilizing. By September, the trade surplus had surged to $11 billion, and fears that the peso's loss of value would reignite hyperinflation have ebbed, largely because wages have effectively been frozen in peso terms, keeping a tight lid on consumer spending.
Inflation is running at about 1.5 percent a month, according to Exotix Ltd., a London-based emerging markets brokerage firm -- a manageable rate by Latin American standards. While industrial output has not caught back up to where it was before the devaluation, it has climbed every month for the last six, including a 2.7 percent jump in August.
"The economy hit bottom three or four months ago," Mr. Lacoste said. "The question now is just when and by how much it will rebound."
That, he said, very much depends on politics. Eduardo Duhalde, the caretaker president since January, has called for elections in March, and his successor is to take over in May. But Mr. Lacoste and others say elections should be held earlier, as the current government has no popular mandate to tackle the country's most urgent problems.
Unemployment has hit a record high of 24 percent, and more than half of the population is living below the poverty line, which the government defines as enough income to afford basic food and housing. For a family of four, that level is about 400 pesos ($108.25) a month.
To unlock the economy's potential, the banking system must be restructured and foreign debts renegotiated, economists and analysts say. 
Contracts with Argentina's utilities, most of them foreign-owned, must also be reworked. They have generally not been allowed to raise their rates for electricity, gas, water and telephone service to take account of the peso's fall in value, but their debts are still largely owed in dollars. 
But a cheap peso works to the double advantage of some sectors in Argentina. Not only is labor cheaper now, but some industries are particularly well equipped, thanks to a decade when the peso's parity with the dollar made importing capital goods affordable.
The film industry, for example, is booming.
Austral Films, a Buenos Aires studio, has opened representative offices in Los Angeles and Madrid to encourage film producers to shoot in Argentina.
Juan Jose Jusid, a partner in Austral and a film director, said his latest film, "Apasionados" ("In Love"), a $2.5 million Argentine-Spanish co-production shot last year, would now cost just $450,000 to make in Argentina. 
Austral has also begun producing commercials, because the demand is high and the government can no longer afford subsidies for feature film production.
Maria de la Paz Marino, Mr. Jusid's partner at Austral, said that during the years when the peso was worth one dollar, "the movie industry equipped itself with the latest technology and served its apprenticeship -- now we have years of know-how."
Across town, at a Chilean-owned postproduction house, Videocolor, the studios are buzzing with work on commercials shot in Argentina for Renault, Coca-Cola, Sony, Budweiser and Toyota.
About 25 commercials a month are being produced for export, five times last year's levels, according to Videocolor's commercial manager, Jose Luis Cabrera. "We must make the most of it, because to keep up this level of technology you have to invest, and all that equipment must be bought in dollars," Mr. Cabrera said. "In five years, this technology we have will become obsolete."
What are the chances Argentina's economy will pick up again soon?
"Over the last month I have received more visits from foreign private equity funds than in the rest of the year," Mr. Lacoste said. "And it's not simply because it's springtime in Buenos Aires."
But he acknowledges that Argentina's fate depends on being able to successfully conclude drawn-out negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package.
With $8 billion in payments to multilateral lenders like the World Bank coming due before May, there may be as little as $1.5 billion left in the central bank's reserve vaults when the next president takes office.
In addition, if the global economy continues to slow and neighboring Brazil slips into a widely feared debt crisis of its own after its presidential election runoff on Sunday "risk aversion to the region would undoubtedly grow," Mr. Lacoste said.
"Argentina will have to learn to 'vivir con lo nuestro' -- live with what we've got," he said. "I wouldn't recommend it, but we may have no option."

HEADLINE: Toronto Exchange Is Still Set to Go Public 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
South of the border, the NASD has yet to go ahead with its planned public offering for the battered Nasdaq stock market. And the New York Stock Exchange, which had talked about demutualizing in the late 1990's, currently has no plans to list itself. But in Canada, TSX Inc., the holding company for the Toronto Stock Exchange, is moving forward with plans to become a public company around mid-November.
 The Toronto exchange, which will celebrate its 150th anniversary on Thursday, is plowing through the same choppy waters as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, with new listings down sharply and trading activity stagnating. Canada's benchmark S&P/TSX composite index is down around 18 percent this year, as the New York Stock Exchange composite has dropped 19 percent and the Nasdaq has slid 32 percent. 
 While the brokerage firms that are the Toronto exchange's present shareholders initially expected to price the stock issue at 17 to 23 Canadian dollars, for a total of 371 million to 531 million Canadian dollars ($236 million to $338.6 million), the price target was recently lowered to 14 to 17 Canadian dollars.
Still, Barbara Stymiest, TSX's chief executive, said in a recent interview that she was undeterred by the markets' turbulence. Canada's growing economy and the sophistication of the country's financial markets should lure investors, she said.
But besides volatile markets, the Toronto exchange faces the challenge that dozens of its most heavily traded stocks are also listed on United States exchanges, siphoning sizable trading volume.
"We have both the advantages and disadvantages of being next to a market that's 20 times our size," said Joe J. Oliver, president of the Investment Dealers Association in Toronto, which represents Canada's brokerage industry.
The Toronto exchange's 3,841 listed companies -- two-thirds of which trade on a separate TSX Venture Exchange, a market for small, more speculative stocks -- have a market value of slightly over 1 trillion Canadian dollars ($635 billion).
Despite the difficult investment climate, TSX's revenues from listing and trading fees and other services rose to 107.2 million Canadian dollars in the six months ended June 30, up 24 percent from the period last year. Earnings almost doubled, to 27.6 million Canadian dollars.
Holders of 21.6 million shares of TSX, or 64 percent of the total, have indicated that they will sell their stock. No single shareholder will be allowed to own more than 10 percent of the exchange, though TSX has left the door open for an approved "strategic investor" to acquire a bigger stake later on.
With ownership of the exchange set to pass from a cozy club of brokerage firms to a wide circle of institutional and individual shareholders, "we'll be completely free to focus on our sole objective, which is to build a stronger Canadian capital market," Ms. Stymiest said.
Some investors, however, were less sanguine than Ms. Stymiest about the offering's prospects.
Donald Coxe, chairman of Harris Investment Management, a Chicago-based unit of the Bank of Montreal, said that "what you're buying is something most Canadians don't believe in." Still, he added "because of Nasdaq's collapse, there is room for another stock exchange."
And Douglas Davis, president of Davis-Rea Ltd., a Toronto portfolio manager, said, "I'm not knocked out by it." With many of the exchange's existing shareholders included in the underwriting syndicate, Mr. Davis said the coming stock offering was likely to be priced to favor sellers rather than buyers. "It will favor investors only if the business thrives and grows," he added. "It depends whether the market turns."
Mr. Davis said he was also concerned about growing competition for listings of Canadian stocks and trading in their shares, both from American exchanges and from electronic trading services.
Seventy-eight companies now have listings on both the TSX and the Big Board, including the country's biggest banks; natural resource giants like Alcan and Barrick Gold ; and the five companies spun off by the breakup of Canadian Pacific.
Another 71 Canadian companies are "interlisted" on the Nasdaq and 29 on the American Stock Exchange, which is also owned by the NASD. As Mr. Davis sees it, if trading on private electronic networks grows, "the TSX's business will have found its long-term weakness."
Ms. Stymiest, who described the competition for listings as a "battleground," said the Toronto exchange still accounted for an average of 60 percent of trades in these interlisted stocks. "We continue to win," she said. "We have the most liquid market." The TSX, she added, is "faster, better and cheaper than our competition."
The exchange is also working on a plan to help Canadian and European brokers shop around for American stocks among the various stock exchanges and electronic trading systems in the United States. "The brokers would be assured that clients are getting the best price," said Richard Nesbitt, president of the TSX Markets unit.
Some experts, however, see the Toronto exchange's future mainly as a kind of natural resources version of the technology-heavy Nasdaq.
Mining, oil and gas stocks now make up 28 percent of the main Toronto board's listings and 48 percent of listings on the TSX Venture Exchange.
During the dot-com boom, said Mr. Coxe of Harris Investment Management, the TSX "was trying to constitute itself as an alternative to Nasdaq.
"But now that's all flamed out. It's going back to rocks and trees that make Canada unique," he continued.
According to Mr. Oliver of the Investment Dealers Association, "the natural resource area has been one in which Americans have included the Canadian marketplace in their thinking." More than half the world's publicly traded miners already trade in Toronto.
The TSX also hopes to attract more business by ploughing its own furrow in the area of corporate governance. While the New York Stock Exchange has proposed rigorous new standards and disclosure requirements in the wake of the Enron and other corporate scandals, Ms. Stymiest says that voluntary guidelines and the discipline of the market are more effective in preventing such abuses.
"What seems softer is in fact tougher," Ms. Stymiest said in a recent speech. "When people see a guideline, their usual focus seems to be -- not how to get around it -- but whether to do it." If they decide not to follow the guideline, "the tough part is explaining why," she said. If companies do comply, the view is that "they might as well do it right."
On the other hand, "when people see a rule, they seem to look for ways to comply that will have the least impact on what they're already doing," Ms. Stymiest said. "The rule becomes the maximum that's required, rather than the maximum that's possible."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Thursday about a planned stock offering by TSX, parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange, included an incorrect price projection supplied by the company. In its revised prospectus, TSX projected an offering price of 17 to 19 Canadian dollars a share, not 14 to 17.

HEADLINE: Turkish Government Takes Steps to Shut Popular Islamic Party 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Just 10 days before national elections, Turkey's chief prosecutor moved today to outlaw the most popular political party, a moderate Islamic group whose leader had already been barred from running for office. 
 The case seemed unlikely to be decided before the elections, which take place on Nov. 3 -- and the more immediate question was whether the legal troubles of the beleaguered party, called Justice and Development, would hurt its standing at the polls. Public opinion surveys show it with roughly 30 percent of the vote, far ahead of its nearest competitor. 
 "I say this clearly: this closure case will in no way damage our party," said its chairman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the popular former Istanbul mayor who founded the party less than a year ago. He called the move to shut down the party "another heavy blow to Turkish democracy."
Last month, the nation's highest electoral board disqualified Mr. Erdogan from running because of a conviction in 1998 for reading a poem that a court said incited religious hatred.
The nation's avowedly secular political leadership and business community view him with deep suspicion, at a time when Turkey's long relationship with the United States is especially important because of the Bush administration's vows to disarm Iraq, Turkey's neighbor to the southeast. 
Mr. Erdogan, 48, who had stood a good chance of becoming Turkey's next prime minister, denies that his party espouses an Islamic agenda.
Despite Mr. Erdogan's roots in political Islam, he staged his political comeback over the last year with a carefully thought out, moderate, pro-Western image. 
Though barred last month from running, Mr. Erdogan retained the title of party chairman. 
That appeared to be the basis for the court case filed today: Sabih Kanadoglu, the chief prosecutor, said in a statement carried by the Anatolian news agency that the party had not complied fully with a court decision barring Mr. Erdogan from being a founding member of the party.
Mr. Kanadoglu was quoted as saying that the party was trying to "deceive the law" by allowing Mr. Erdogan to remain as chairman. 
Murat Mercan, a party spokesman, said tonight that he believed that the ruling would only anger Turkish voters, who polls show are disenchanted with most mainstream political leaders because of corruption and the nation's poor economic performance. 
"Turkish people, after all, would not find this case a reasonable one," Mr. Mercan said. "Therefore it may even increase votes for the party."
Mr. Erdogan's troubles date to his recital of a poem during a political speech in 1997 while mayor.
"The mosques are our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiers," he said at the time.
A court ruled that the words incited religious hatred and sentenced Mr. Erdogan to prison for 10 months, stripped him of his office and barred him from politics. He served four months in 1999.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Strength in Semiconductor Shares Leads a Broad Rally

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks steamed ahead yesterday, shaking off an earlier decline, as investors snatched up companies like Intel on budding hopes for a sustainable upswing in the market.
 "There is a lot of cash out there, and I think the market acts like a million bucks," said Michael Murphy, head of equity trading at Wachovia Securities. "People are buying on the dips and putting some money to work." 
 The market languished in negative ground much of the session before rallying late in the day. Investors are debating whether the rise is a short-lived rally in a bear market or the start of a new bull run. 
"There's a great deal of apprehension, and there's a great deal of hope," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "You have an intersection between hope that the rally will continue and apprehension that this is another false start. The atmosphere seems to be thick with that conflict."
Intel, a Dow component and a Nasdaq heavyweight, shot up almost 7 percent and led the semiconductor sector higher after it fell a day ago on a bleak forecast from Texas Instruments. Other technology giants, including Microsoft, added to the upward momentum.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.43 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,320.23, after losing more than 1 percent earlier. It hit its highest close since Aug. 29.
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average advanced 44.11 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,494.27, after dropping more than 1.8 percent earlier. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.98 points, or 0.67 percent, to 896.14.
Advancing stocks beat declining stocks by a ratio of 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. More than 1.61 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board and more than 1.59 billion shares on Nasdaq in moderate trading.
The market shrugged off mixed economic readings. The Federal Reserve's beige book report, an anecdotal survey showed the economy was in the doldrums in the early autumn, held back by a listless job market and soft retail sales.
But Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, sounded an upbeat note in a speech earlier in the day. He said that most of the surge in productivity rates since the mid-1990's appeared likely to remain intact in coming years.
Intel jumped $1.04, to $16.16. There were gains for other companies involved in chips, as Applied Materials soared $1.32, or 10 percent, to $14.41, and KLA-Tencor rose $2.18, or 7 percent, to $32.71.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index climbed 7.84 percent after a drop of more than 6 percent the day before.
Other technology shares rose. Microsoft climbed $1.53, or almost 3 percent, to $53.20. Hewlett-Packard gained 51 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $14.39. Both stocks helped lift the Dow. 
SBC Communications emerged as the big loser on the Dow, falling $1.20, or more than 4 percent, to $25.85. Morgan Stanley downgraded the Baby Bell group of local telephone companies, including SBC, citing the recent rally in the sector's stock prices. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Bloomberg News) -- Treasuries rose yesterday as declines in sales at companies like Xerox and Eli Lilly suggested that the economic expansion remained weak.
Yesterday, the Treasury priced $27 billion of new two-year notes to yield 2.14 percent. In when-issued trading by late in the day, the yield had increased to 2.16 percent.
The current-issue two-year note was up 3/32 , to 99 16/32 , yielding 2.14 percent, down from 2.19 percent on Tuesday.
The 10-year note rose 8/32 , to 101 6/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.23 percent from 4.26 percent. The 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 103 8/32 ; its yield was unchanged.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: 7th Victim Dies In Baltimore Arson Tied to Drug Fight 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
An East Baltimore man who was badly burned in an arson fire that killed his wife and five of her children died today.
 The man, Carnell Dawson Sr., 43, had been the sole survivor of the Oct. 16 fire, which the authorities said was set in retaliation for his wife's repeated confrontations with drug dealers outside the family's home. 
 Mr. Dawson, who had jumped from a second-floor window to escape the flames, died this afternoon at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore. 
Darrell L. Brooks, a 21-year-old who once worked as a clerk for the Baltimore City Council and lived a few doors from the Dawsons, has been arrested. The police said Mr. Brooks kicked in the door of the Dawsons' home after 2 a.m., poured out gasoline and ignited the fire. He was being held without bond on first-degree murder, arson and numerous other charges.
Mr. Dawson's death came on the eve of a funeral for his wife, Angela M. Dawson, 36, and five of her children, ages 8 to 14. Mrs. Dawson also had an 18-year-old daughter who did not live at the house.
After the fire, in tense meetings and at rallies and vigils attended by hundreds of people, ministers and residents called on the city to increase police patrols in the neighborhood, improve its schools and housing and strengthen drug treatment, recreation and economic development efforts.
On Monday, Baltimore's mayor, Martin O'Malley, said Maryland had agreed to provide more than 100 state troopers to patrol city thoroughfares, hire 75 more parole officers and provide more jail space to help the city fight drug-related violence. Mr. O'Malley said he was also pushing for more protection of those who report drug dealing.

HEADLINE: 2 Yugoslav Aides Are Fired for Sales of Fighter-Jet Parts to Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Yugoslavia has fired a senior military official and the director of the state trading company Yugoimport as a result of NATO's accusations that a Bosnian Serb company exported military hardware to Iraq via Belgrade.
 Officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia and the United States have released few firm details about the case, which appears to be focus on the violation of the United Nations arms embargo rather than the military significance of any sales. 
 After searching the offices of Orao, a state-owned company in the semiautonomous Serbian republic within Bosnia, NATO peacekeeping troops said on Tuesday that they had found proof of ongoing exports to Baghdad. 
The American Embassy in Bosnia accused Orao last month of selling spare parts and services to Iraq for its Soviet-era MIG-21 warplanes, continuing a longstanding trade that began when Bosnia was a republic in a larger, socialist Yugoslavia.
But the company, which in the 1980's was part of a Yugoslav industry that armed Iraq against Iran (as did companies in the United States, Britain and France), does not appear to have heeded the warning.
When NATO soldiers raided the Orao factory, they found a document dated Sept. 25 telling five staff members to remain in Iraq and remove all traces of the company's involvement there, diplomats in Bosnia said.
Military analysts said that even if the spare parts kept aging Iraqi aircraft in good condition, they would hardly help Saddam Hussein's military defend against the high-technology weapons that the United States could deploy.
One Western diplomat said the only significant question was whether assistance from Orao was decisive in helping Iraq to put antiquated planes in the sky at all.
"Given that Saddam has had 10 years of sanctions, how does he keep his old equipment going?" the diplomat asked. "If Orao is sending in spare parts, they would be very useful in keeping his decrepit air force flying."
But the United States has not specified whether this is part of its accusation.
"The U.S. expects the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Yugoslavia, to undertake the necessary steps to immediately halt any ongoing cooperation with Iraq, to conduct a thorough investigation and to hold accountable those responsible," said the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher.
Yugoslavia's response was immediate, as it hopes next month to be admitted as a junior partner in NATO, the first step for aspiring members of the alliance.
After a special meeting this evening, the government dismissed Ivan Djokic, a deputy defense minister, and Jovan Cekovic, the head of Yugoimport, declaring them ultimately responsible for the shipments.
"Regardless of how significant this case is," a Yugoslav government official said, "we have to demonstrate our complete rejection of any cooperation with Iraq at this time. We need American support so we have to act decisively."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ISLAMISTS; 
U.S. Labels Indonesian Faction as Terrorist

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
The United States today formally declared a Southeast Asian radical Islamic group suspected by the Bush administration of involvement in the Bali bombing to be a foreign terrorist organization.
 In addition, Australia and the United States called for the group, Jemaah Islamiyah, to be added to the United Nations list of formally declared terrorist organizations. 
 Under pressure from the Americans and the Australians, the Indonesian government, which as recently as two weeks ago said the group did not exist in its country, expressed support for having the group placed on the United Nations list.
The leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, an Indonesian cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, was arrested last weekend at his hospital bed in his home city, Solo. 
Western governments and Indonesia's Asian neighbors viewed the move by Indonesia today as a welcome change of heart by the government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali on Oct. 12, which killed more than 180 people, senior officials here hesitated to label the group a terrorist organization, but they slowly moved in that direction, finally doing so today in a letter to the United Nations.
The United States and Indonesia's neighbors -- Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines -- have argued for some time that Jemaah Islamiyah was linked to Al Qaeda.
At the United Nations today, Australia submitted information outlining the group's history and its connection to attacks in Indonesia before the Bali bombing, as well as a plan to blow up the American Embassies in Singapore and Malaysia.
The Indonesian government's letter supports the Australian request. The United States and Indonesia's key Asian neighbors also backed the Australian initiative. Malaysia is expected to do so on Thursday.
"The significance is political," a Western diplomat said of Indonesia's move. "It is the first time that Indonesia has publicly associated itself with a Western initiative" on the question of terror. The practical effects of the United Nations listing, and the separate designation by the United States, will probably be minimal, the diplomat said. Officially, the designations impose financial and travel sanctions on the group, but Western governments have little influence on the group's finances.
The Bush administration, poised for a month to declare the group a terrorist organization, waited until Indonesia recognized its serious nature. The administration made its designation under Executive Order 13224, which gives the government broad authority to freeze assets held by terrorist organizations and their members in the United States. 
Much of the background information on Jemaah Islamiyah that the United States and Australia used for declaring it a terrorist organization came from the interrogation by the Central Intelligence Agency of a Qaeda operative, Omar al-Faruq.
Mr. Faruq told his interrogators that Mr. Bashir had provided money, explosives and men for terrorist acts including a plan to blow up the American embassies here and in Malaysia and Singapore in December 2001, American officials said.
Mr. Faruq also alerted his interrogators to a plan, which he said Mr. Bashir had helped to organize, to attack the American embassies here and in Malaysia on the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, the American officials said.
Mr. Bashir, 64, who is called the intellectual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, has maintained that he was not involved in terrorist activities and has blamed the United States for the Bali blast. From his hospital bed he issued what he called an oath on Tuesday in which he repeated his previous denials of terrorist links.
Western intelligence officials describe the operational head of the group, an Indonesian known as Hambali, or Riduan Isamuddin, 36, as an acolyte of Mr. Bashir. Despite efforts of various intelligence agencies to find Hambali, his whereabouts are unknown, they said.
Indonesian investigators said today that they were looking for three male Indonesians as suspects in the Bali bombing.
"There are three sketches of possible suspects," said Made Mangku Pastika, the police chief in charge of the investigation in Bali. "They are males and Indonesians."
But Mr. Pastika said the men were not "official" suspects. He declined to give details about them for fear, he said, of harming the investigation.
State Department officials said Washington's announcement was not the result of any single event. Yet in a statement on Jemaah Islamiyah released today, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell specifically mentioned the Bali bombing.
"It is an example of how terrorism threatens democratic institutions, undermines economies and destabilizes regions," Secretary Powell said. "The world's response to these heinous crimes must be comprehensive and steadfast."
State Department officials said the group did little fund-raising in the United States. They also acknowledged that many terrorist groups had changed their operations to avoid having their assets frozen.
"This is not the be-all and end-all that's going to take them off the map," a senior State Department official said. "There's a lot of hard work ahead of us."

Scientists who study climate change can sometimes sound as if they have their heads in the clouds, with all the talk of invisible gases and nefarious hydrocarbons. Here, the search for atmospheric explanation is more down to earth. 
 A team of scientists at Rutgers University is looking at the land in New Jersey -- the transition from farms and forests to strip malls and subdivisions --for clues about the state's weather in the past, and how future development could affect the climate 100 years from now. 
 "How would our local weather be different with a different land use?" said Alan Robock, a professor of meteorology who is leading the multidisciplinary team of urban planners, historians and biologists. "That's the question." 
It's certainly not news that what's on the ground has an impact on what's in the sky. Deforestation in the Amazon has been studied for years in South America. Scientists have also shown how cities can often generate their own weather, creating so-called heat islands that spawn storms or change the paths of storms that come along. A parking lot absorbs heat differently, and channels water runoff differently, than a golf course.
But researchers say that the Rutgers study is one of the most ambitious attempts in the nation to pull all those strings together into one regional model. Half of the project looks back at how population growth and the sprawl of development over the last century have made for a different weather pattern. (An astonishingly detailed 17-foot-long map of New Jersey created in the 1880's figures in that part of the story, along with a hard-working graduate student.) The project's other half looks forward, at how the state's communities and residents could be affected by long-term climate change as a result of local land-use decisions in years to come.
The idea is not that New Jersey is an island, the researchers say, making its own little weather in splendid isolation, or that the global atmospheric system doesn't matter, but rather that in the end, weather and climate is like politics: it's all local. People and climate connect not in equations or theories, but on the ground. 
"Say you build a new 100-acre development and then you get 10 inches less precipitation than normal -- what will be the effect of that?" said Ying Fan Reinfelder, an assistant professor of geology who is working on the water-flow portion of the climate model. "What's the effect on ground water, and on stream flow? One side of this is climate; the other are man-made changes. We want to link them."
The Rutgers project, which is partly financed by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, has huge potential implications for the debate about open space and suburban sprawl, state officials and environmentalists say. If a housing development or a new shopping center can be scientifically linked to regionwide effects on water supply or weather, for example, then the battles over development and zoning that now seem purely local will be transformed. Regulators and courts will have a powerful new scientific tool, they say, as global warming becomes an aspect of urban planning becomes an aspect of politics.
"We've long known that better land-use practices reduce the costs of cleaning up our water and cleaning up our air," said Bradley M. Campbell, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection. "This work makes clear that good land-use policy is essential to stabilizing our long-term climate, as well."
Environmentalists say that the interconnections are the key, because the model is expected to show how residents many miles from a proposed development project can be affected by something they had perhaps never even heard of.
 Gov. James E. McGreevey struck a similar note on Tuesday, when he told a conference on so-called smart growth that state government -- from transportation to economic development -- would coordinate to fight the sprawl that he said threatened New Jersey's future. 
"A study like this can really change the way we think about land use in New Jersey," said Barbara L. Lawrence, executive director of New Jersey Future, a research and planning organization that focuses on development issues. "To the extent that science can document changes that go way beyond the border of a municipality, you can build a case for more regional planning."
Scientists who are leading the project say that their ultimate goal is to produce a kind of scientific tool kit that planners could use to envision, through the grinding out of a few hundred million equations, multiple versions of the state's future based on land-use and climate trends.
"Once we get our tools working, we can say, 'What if the future of New Jersey 100 years from now is this, or what if it's this other plan -- how will that affect the climate?' " Professor Robock said. "We'll be able to do those experiments in the next couple years and maybe that can give information to policy makers that will actually help them decide what the future development will be like."
But there are historical puzzles to be pondered, as well, and that's where the old map and the graduate student figure in.
In the 1880's, Prof. George H. Cook, who later had a college at Rutgers named after him -- which, in the fullness of time, came to employ Dr. Robock, among others -- led a team of topographers who crisscrossed New Jersey, recording and measuring as they went. In the annals of Victorian-era science, it was an amazing feat that few other states apparently ever attempted or completed. The Cook map -- really multiple maps created over nine years -- is 17 feet long when fully assembled and only a bit less accurate than a photograph taken from space.
Paul Stuart Wichansky's Ph.D. dissertation is aimed at figuring out how the changes since Professor Cook's time have altered the state's climate. More to the point, he'll be running the same weather through the two very different New Jerseys, really: the current state, captured by satellite, and the version Dr. Cook saw in the 1880's, when farms dominated the landscape. 
The computer, stocked with all that science knows about how land conditions can alter wind and water evaporation and runoff and albedo (how different surfaces reflect or retain heat), will replay history. 
Mr. Wichansky spent a year in the Rutgers Library creating a digital version of the Cook map that could be fed into the school's climate modeling program. The huge map was divided into 3,774 individual cells, each of which had to be put into the computer one by one. He has just started his computer runs. 
"I feel like Prof. George H. Cook is speaking to me through his maps," Mr. Wichansky said. 
At the backdrop of the climate work here is the unavoidable reality that a record-breaking warm trend -- short-term or long-term, no one can say -- is under way. The 12 months through the end of September, in particular, was the warmest in New Jersey since the 1890's. Mr. Wichansky said that part of what he was looking for in his results were clues about how much of that warming effect was a result of atmospheric changes, and how much came from the ground. 
"The land cover change project may enable us to quantify how much of this warming may actually be due to changes in the land surface itself as a result of human modifications," he said.
Some New Jersey environmental officials say they think that the results of the Rutgers project will be illuminating about how land and climate fit together, but that information, in the end, might still be problematic. 
"It's one thing for the state to say you have to control this amount of polluted runoff," one senior state official said. "It's another to say you have to maintain this forest cover or this result will occur far away. That's not the traditional bailiwick of environmental regulation. We'll have to evolve ourselves to get to that point."

Planners Urge Decisions on Downtown

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
DELAYED and diverted by the race for governor, interagency rivalries and a bit too much wishful thinking, the planning process in Lower Manhattan must begin showing results soon if it is to counter the very real threat that downtown could lose the financial-service industry, its economic backbone. 
 This was the collective warning delivered Tuesday night -- in bits and pieces and in slightly more politic language -- by a half-dozen chairmen and chairwomen of the New York City Planning Commission, past and present, whose experience goes back to the days before the World Trade Center was built. 
 Given their involvement with earlier attempts to resuscitate Lower Manhattan, they made compelling witnesses. The setting of their forum, organized by the Skyscraper Museum, was 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the 1950's answer to the question of what could be done to save downtown. 
"Time's a-wasting," said Donald H. Elliott, the planning chairman in the Lindsay administration, from 1966 to 1973. He is now a partner in the law firm Hollyer Brady Smith & Hines. 
"Many of us are concerned about dispersion, the lack of leadership and a sense that everything's on hold until after the election," Mr. Elliott said. "The time has come for a serious narrowing down of issues. If you want the private sector to build millions of square feet, they've got to be convinced that the environment they build into is going to work."
Mr. Elliott and five of his successors spoke with varying degrees of candor about issues that politicians prefer to avoid, like: why does the commission have no formal role in planning the single most important site in Manhattan? 
"The city planning agency needs a seat at the table," said Sylvia Deutsch, who led the commission from 1987 to 1989, the last years of the Koch administration. She said the planning chief "should by statute" serve on the 16-member Lower Manhattan Development Corporation board, to which the mayor and governor appoint eight members. The corporation is working with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on the trade center site. 
"The setting up of state authorities by governors is often useful but it has the potential of making unified city planning an impossibility," said Ms. Deutsch, now an adjunct professor at New York University. 
Buttonholed after the forum, Amanda M. Burden, the current chairwoman, sidestepped the issue at first by saying that city planners are "working very closely" with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. "Whether that has to be formalized or not is not critical," she said. 
But when pressed just a bit further about the utility of a guaranteed city planning seat on the board, she answered, "I wouldn't say no."
Implicitly acknowledging that the city has little control over the trade center superblock, the planning alumni scarcely mentioned it in the 90-minute gathering, though Herbert J. Sturz, who served from 1980 to 1986 under Mayor Edward I. Koch, spoke of a prospective museum on the site that would merge the New-York Historical Society and the Museum of the City of New York.
There was almost no talk of design. Instead, the focus was on infrastructure, particularly expanding or extending transit lines to bring commuters directly into Lower Manhattan. 
"If we don't make these investments, we will encounter a catastrophe in the next decade, decade and a half," said Joseph B. Rose, the planning chairman for all eight years of the Giuliani administration. He is now a partner in the Georgetown Group real estate company but still sits on the commission.
THE alumnus with the most at stake in Lower Manhattan is John E. Zuccotti, whose tenure, 1973 to 1975, bridged the Lindsay and Beame eras. He is now chairman of Brookfield Properties Corporation, which owns the World Financial Center (100 percent of two towers and 51 percent of the other two) and 1 Liberty Plaza, on either side of the trade center site. 
In that role, Mr. Zuccotti champions a super express subway from the trade center site to Jamaica, Queens, using the Long Island Rail Road right-of-way or existing subway tunnels for much of its route. He said it could be built for $1.9 billion, contrasting it with a $15 billion price tag on the Second Avenue subway. "It's not real to think about projects that will exceed the cost capacity of the government," he said. "All it does is distort planning."
Ms. Burden offered her own vision of where short-term investment might do the most good: redeveloping the East River waterfront and creating "green rivers" of parks and open space throughout downtown.
She recalled the decision 19 years ago by the Battery Park City Authority, of which she was then vice president, to construct a generous esplanade in the earliest phase of development, though "there was nothing around it but sand," as a way of encouraging private investment. 
"We needed to show," she said, "what public life could be like."

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler Has Big Profit Gain, but Is Pessimistic 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler said today that net income more than tripled during the third quarter because of aggressive cost-cutting at Chrysler and elsewhere in its operations. But it issued a pessimistic forecast for sales of cars and light trucks in the United States next year, blaming economic and political uncertainty.
 Further, DaimlerChrysler said it expected to have an underfunded pension liability of $3 billion for North America by the end of the year, sharing in the woes that have afflicted General Motors and Ford Motor as falling stock prices reduce the investments that feed their retirement funds. 
 DaimlerChrysler said it earned $881 million during the quarter, after adjustments for one-time costs, compared with $281 million for the period a year earlier. That was well above analysts' expectations of about $800 million for the quarter, historically the most difficult of the year for auto manufacturers because of the cost of introducing new models. 
As a result, DaimlerChrysler said it was raising its profit forecast for the full year to about $5 billion, a target that analysts said the company could easily meet, given that it earned $4.6 billion during the first three quarters of 2002.
Even so, the company's share price fell 81 cents today, to close at $37.05, on the New York Stock Exchange. During a conference call with journalists and analysts, conducted from the company's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, the chief financial officer, Manfred Gentz, said he expected overall sales in the United States to drop significantly during the coming year, possibly below 16 million vehicles. 
By contrast, auto companies will sell about 17 million vehicles this year, thanks in large part to wide-ranging incentive programs. But Mr. Gentz noted that sales had already softened this fall and said he expected the trend to continue. 
"We have to assume the total market in 2003 will be below 2002," Mr. Gentz said. "Most of the relevant car markets in the world are down. Europe is down. Germany is down for the third year in a row. Japan is certainly down."
Mr. Gentz added that there was uncertainty in the United States, with coming elections and the question of whether there will be war with Iraq. Should Mr. Gentz's prediction be right, sales in the United States would be the lowest since 1998, when auto companies sold 15.5 million vehicles. Analysts pointed out, however, that Mr. Gentz had a history of being cautious and they said his forecast seemed overly dire. 
"That's way too pessimistic," said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. Mr. Spinella's forecast calls for sales next year of about 16.6 million vehicles. He noted that DaimlerChrysler, like other auto companies, began this year thinking that auto sales would fall precipitously, and had to increase its sales forecast several times throughout the year as incentives propped up the market.
Mr. Gentz said the outlook would prompt further cost-cutting at DaimlerChrysler, including the Chrysler unit, which posted strong results that showed further evidence that its turnaround program had taken hold.
Chrysler had an operating profit of $321 million, in contrast to a loss of $264 million in the quarter a year ago.
The Chrysler performance came despite higher incentive costs, which translated to 16.3 percent of revenue, up two percentage points from a year ago. "To a certain degree we have to follow our competitors," Mr. Gentz said. "We can't have empty showrooms." 
Lately, Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, has vowed not to join other Detroit auto companies in flooding the market with incentives, and the company's per-vehicle incentive expense has already dropped this fall.
The Chrysler performance helped to offset a 2 percent decline in operating profit at Mercedes-Benz, which earned $782 million during the third quarter. Mr. Gentz said, however, that he was optimistic about Mercedes-Benz, because of expected demand for the new version of the E-Class sedan, which just went on sale in the United States, and a freshened version of the flagship S-Class.
Mr. Gentz said DaimlerChrysler's revenue grew 1 percent, to $35.5 billion, during the quarter. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was flat at $111 billion.
He said the company would decide at the end of the year how it would finance a shortfall in its North American pension plan, which includes not only workers at Chrysler but those at Freightliner, its heavy-truck operation in Portland, Ore., and at the Mercedes-Benz North American operations. The $3 billion is far less than the underfunded pension liabilities at Ford, with $6.5 billion, and G.M., where the pension liability could grow to $20 billion by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Carmakers Losing Ground To Imports Despite Deals 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
The billions of dollars that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have spent during the last year on the most generous sales incentives in automotive history have not bought them what they wanted: a bigger share of the market.
 The latest offers -- for everything from Chevrolet Cavaliers to Cadillac Escalades and Ford Focuses to Jaguar S-Types -- include zero percent loans, with no money down and no monthly payments until 2003, or else thousands of dollars in cash rebates. The deals are available not only on leftover 2002 models, but also on the newest cars and trucks. 
 In all, Detroit carmakers are spending an average of $3,764 a vehicle, or 14 percent of the selling price, on all manner of incentives, according to CNW Marketing Research, a firm in Bandon, Ore. That is twice as rich as the average deal on Japanese and Korean brands. And plenty of imports, including Lexuses and most BMW's, are selling well without any incentives at all. 
Indeed, analysts say that Detroit's deals have proved all but powerless against the imports' reputation for quality, durability and high resale value. Over all, Detroit has lost roughly another 1.6 percentage points of market share this year, with sales by G.M., Ford and Chrysler falling to 61.7 percent of the market for cars and light trucks in the United States. 
The domestic carmakers are failing to attract committed import buyers or to keep their own customers from defecting. Only 12 percent of customers who have purchased Detroit's vehicles this year were replacing a Japanese or European vehicle, according to data from AutoPacific Inc., an industry forecasting firm in Tustin, Calif. By contrast, 43 percent of people purchasing Japanese vehicles, and 32 percent of those buying European models, were replacing an American vehicle. 
"The numbers are all going the wrong way for Detroit," said George C. Peterson, AutoPacific's president. The data on defections is virtually unchanged from five years ago, despite the Big Three's efforts to improve their vehicles' quality and introduce attractive new models, he said. 
Customers like Randall C. Meachum, a 50-year-old manager for a telecommunications company in Lawrenceville, Ga., exemplify Detroit's problem. Zero percent financing on Cadillacs could not draw him into a G.M. dealership when he bought a Lexus sedan last month for his wife, even though he had to take on a loan with 4.9 percent interest.
The Lexus is one of five Toyota-brand vehicles that Mr. Meachum owns. He switched to imports in the mid-1990's after owning more than 30 G.M. and Ford vehicles over the previous decades.
"They still don't make a car I like," he said.
By continuing to focus its marketing on deals, Detroit may only be making matters worse for itself -- a warning that no one is delivering as sternly as Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Chrysler. Lately, Mr. Zetsche has tried to wean Chrysler, part of DaimlerChrysler, from incentives as generous as Ford's and G.M.'s, matching their deals only selectively.
"I see it as like a drug," Mr. Zetsche said in an interview today. "It might give you short-term relief, but long term, it is extremely harmful. The problem is that all parties involved get used to it, and it only works if you are increasing it all the time. Inevitably you run against some wall."
G.M. introduced the zero percent financing plans a year ago in an effort to energize sales after the Sept. 11 attacks, and it has repeatedly revised and renewed them. Though executives acknowledged this week that G.M. might, nonetheless, fall short of its goal of 29 percent of United States sales by the end of the year, they insisted that the incentives had generated showroom traffic, brought attention to G.M.'s lineup of vehicles and improved the credit profile of its customers.
"The drive towards zero financing is superb for us," said William J. Lovejoy, group vice president for sales, service and marketing. By shifting its marketing emphasis to loans, G.M. has been able to cut its leasing business in half and reduce the strain on its financing operation. (A high volume of trade-ins is depressing the prices of used cars, but for now that is a problem for car dealers, not carmakers.)
Depending on their creditworthiness, consumers can drive away from a G.M. showroom knowing they will spend nothing on their new car for the rest of the year. Less than a month into the 2003 model year, the company's television commercials promote deals on every vehicle in its lineup, except its Hummer sport utility vehicles.
Mr. Lovejoy said that the deals were likely to be a feature at G.M. for months to come. But their effectiveness is already diminishing. G.M, is forecasting that auto sales, which have run at an annual rate of 17 million so far this year, will dip to 16 million through the rest of the year.
At best, analysts say, the deals have been a holding action, helping the Big Three tread water in a market that officials acknowledge would collapse without incentives. 
G.M., despite its relentless efforts, has gained just one-tenth of a percentage point of market share this year, according to statistics from Autodata Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. (The figures do not include sales at Saab, the Swedish auto company that G.M. acquired in 2000.) Market share for Ford, which has matched G.M.'s offers, has slid 1.7 percentage points this year. Chrysler, third in sales among the domestic manufacturers, has actually picked up two-tenths of a percentage points.
That performance has come at a heavy cost. According to CNW Marketing, Ford spent $3,894 a vehicle on incentives last month, G.M. spent $3,862 and Chrysler spent $3,636. CNW's figures include sales incentives paid by carmakers both to dealers and to consumers. The automakers say that the numbers are too high, but decline to provide data.
There are special deals available on some import brands, too, but for the most part the numbers are much smaller and the incentives are not the centerpiece of marketing.
Toyota, which has offered zero percent financing in some parts of the country, averaged $2,209 a car in incentives last month, while Honda spent $1,577. Yet over the course of the year, Toyota has built its market share three-tenths of a percentage point, to 10.4 percent of United States sales. Honda also has added three-tenths of a percentage point, giving it 7.3 percent of the market.
Many analysts conclude that the Detroit carmakers have no chance of attracting import-brand customers. 
"The economy is bad, and the natural assumption that companies make is to lower prices" to draw customers, said Aradhna Krishna, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan's School of Business Administration in Ann Arbor. "But emotionally, people are shaken up. They are looking for dependability, reliability and consistency. And that affects their purchase decisions more than everything else."
Surveys by CNW show that buyers of Asian-brand vehicles -- a growing percentage of them built in American factories -- have a distinctly different profile from Detroit's customers. They are wealthier and better educated, less likely to enjoy the car-buying process and far more concerned with a vehicle's performance than its sticker price. 
The Big Three say that the quality of their vehicles has significantly improved, as measured by industry surveys from J. D. Power & Associates. Detroit still owns 76 percent of the market for light trucks, including minivans and sport utility vehicles, where it makes virtually all of its money and analysts see the best hope for attracting import owners. 
Executives delight in stories like that of Meredith Rackoff-Muldoon of Melville, N.Y., who chose a Jeep Liberty sport utility made by Chrysler over a Honda CR-V last May, even though she and her husband, Michael, had previously leased a Honda Civic.
"It's definitely roomier and has a more solid feel" than the CR-V, said Mrs. Rackoff-Muldoon, 31. "We're thrilled with the Jeep." The only incentive on the Liberty was a $500 rebate for recent graduates; she had just finished graduate school.
Mr. Zetsche of Chrysler said such customers supported his determination to wean customers off incentives, though Chrysler would have to remain diligent about cost-cutting to keep prices competitive.
"At the end of the day, it's in the best interest of the customer to have five years of a happy ownership experience, than to have one day of satisfaction at getting a good deal," he said. 
Experts doubt that G.M. and Ford will follow suit any time soon. Robert Kurilko, vice president for product development and marketing at Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers buying advice to consumers, said he expected those companies to offer 72-month interest-free loans and to extend the deals to less creditworthy customers before they stop.
"They're going to ride it until the horse is dead," he said.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Police Chief Faces a Huge Challenge 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
The afternoon that William J. Bratton was confirmed as police chief, a man was beaten to death in the South-Central section of this sprawling megalopolis.
 Robbie Hanzy, an unemployed member of the Rolling 60's Crips gang, was killed by his brother Alton, also an unemployed member of the Rolling 60's, the police said. The fight, the authorities said, was precipitated by an afternoon filled with alcohol and by two men with nothing better to do. 
 The killing was the 97th homicide this year in this part of the South-Central neighborhood, a precinct of fewer than 12 square miles, population 185,000. It is by any standard, the bloodiest area in the West, infested with gangs, narcotics and armed teenagers. The area is on pace for 120 homicides this year, a 43 percent jump from last year and a 240 percent increase since 1998. The three-precinct South-Central area reported 197 homicides through Oct. 18. 
Homicide in the city as a whole is up nearly 19 percent from last year. The reason, the authorities say, is the re-emergence of gang warfare.
"The Gaza Strip probably has more deaths, but this is a busy area, and the problem is gangs," said Detective Rudy Limos, the ranking homicide investigator in the 77th Station, which is within South-Central. "How you control it is beyond me." 
Violent crime is rising around the nation after a decade of striking decreases, and Los Angeles is among the leaders. If things hold to form, this city of 3.8 million people will earn the title of the Murder Capital, succeeding Chicago.
A beleaguered citizenry has turned to Mr. Bratton, regarded in some corners to be the most innovative police executive since J. Edgar Hoover and in others to be a man of enormous ego who took too much credit for the precipitous drop in crime in New York City, where he was police commissioner for 27 months. At his confirmation hearing this month, Mr. Bratton seemed well aware that his stewardship of the demoralized and scandal-plagued department may very well be the standard by which his legacy is judged.
"This department will be my last police department that I will have the opportunity to work with and lead," Mr. Bratton told City Council members. "I would like to see it as the capstone of my career."
The circumstances he walks into here are the inverse of what he walked into in New York in 1994. The crime rate is skyrocketing, not inching downward, as it was in New York. The economy is busting, not booming. Federal, state and local tax money is drying up, and fewer officers, not more, are on the streets. At the same time, a steady stream of violent parolees is finding the way back to the old neighborhoods.
Moreover, Mr. Bratton takes over a damaged force that is operating under a federal consent decree that punishes overly aggressive officers. By many officers' accounts, the beat cop has virtually stopped working.
"Members of this department are demoralized," said Cmdr. Richard Roupoli, assistant commander of the South Bureau, which includes many poor and violent precincts of Los Angeles, including South-Central.
"We disbanded our gang units two years ago and then reinstituted them with new people without extensive gang knowledge," Commander Roupoli said. "At the same time, we've got multiple gang wars going on. The result are the murders we're seeing now."
When it was learned in late 1999 that a renegade gang unit, the Rampart Division, was planting evidence, racially profiling and, in some cases, unjustifiably shooting suspects, all gang units were disbanded, and the city accepted a consent decree that among other provisions uses monitors to weed out corruption and wrongdoing. In a few months, years of street intelligence was lost, along with the reassigned officers. A strict discipline system was put in place, and nearly 1,000 officers left to work elsewhere. A result, officers said, has been a steadily rising homicide rate.
"It stems from an oppressive discipline system," the commander of the robbery-homicide unit, Capt. James Tatreau, said. "Since Rampart, every complaint made, whether by a chronic complainer or nut, meant that it would follow a cop through his career and enter into the mix of promotion or special assignments. 
"The cops' solution?" Captain Tatreau said. "Stop being a cop." 
Mr. Bratton said his first priority after being sworn in on Oct. 28 would be ending the smile-and-wave approach to crime fighting. He said he wanted policing based on the so-called broken-windows theory. That idea holds that small quality-of-life crimes eventually encourage greater lawlessness. If graffiti and broken windows are tolerated, for instance, eventually prostitution and drug dealing and companion violence will find their ways to the street corners.
It is a concept that Mr. Bratton instituted with great success in New York, where the homicide rate once topped 2,200 a year, almost four times its current level. 
It is hard to know whether the strategy can translate here. Los Angeles, sprawling over 463 square miles, is a city where community policing is often little more than the lights of a helicopter washing over bedroom windows. New York's five boroughs add up to 309 square miles. New York has 39,000 police officers for a city of eight million people, and Los Angeles has 9,000 officers for four million. 
"You can only hope he's going to have some kind of effect," Detective Limos said. "Because we don't have many answers." 
After a decade of declines in crime across the country, crime rates not only here but also in other major cities may have no place to go but up, said Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.
"It's a bad time right now," Mr. Travis said. "The economy is weakened. State and local budgets are tight, and that hampers overtime flexibility and new hires. There are 600,000 people coming out of prison every year. Four times as many parolees were released this year than 20 years ago. At the same time, transitional services are cut and people are dumped on streets."
The mix, especially here, is a witch's brew. Jobs are disappearing, and welfare changes are leaving marginal people in the lurch. Moreover, 1,000 people a year return to the city streets from prison after having been locked up in the get-tough-on-crime 90's. With violent unrehabilitated felons back on the streets and many officers heading for suburban work, the streets are volatile. 
"If Bratton can turn it around in this climate, it says he's a great police manager," Mr. Travis said.
Mary Phipps, a grandmother from South-Central whose bedroom window faces a wall scarred with graffiti of the simmering war between Bloods and Crips factions said: "Things are out of control. First it's these gangs. And then it's the police out of control, and now it's the gangs again. There has to be someone to put it in balance." 
At any given time in Los Angeles County, 112,000 young men and women are listed as gang members or "wannabes" in a database created by law enforcement officials.
As of Oct. 5, Los Angeles had 517 homicides compared with 436 last year. The police said 75 percent were gang related.
"If we could get rid of the gangs, we'd be living in heaven," Detective Limos said.
In the county, with more people and a seemingly endless sprawl, homicide is also increasing, but at a rate nearly three times slower than in the city. 
"There is a whole latitude of policing within the law," Lt. Bob Rifkin, a supervisor in the gang unit of the County Sheriff's Department, said. "But society has to decide the balance between safety and civil rights. How much of one are you willing to sacrifice for the other?"
A gang member in Compton, one of 3,000 parolees there, laid out the thinking of the criminal mind in terms of the disarray in the Police Department, as opposed to the Sheriff's Department. "If you're going to mess around," he said, "it's better to do it outside the sheriff's area and in the Police Department's."
It is not as though the county is without problems, too. Take the case of Jose Sanchez, 19, who the police said had two things going against him. One was the telltale dead eye that he neglected to cover with a mask before he carjacked and beat a stranger and, second, the wisecrack smile that never left his face. Sheriff's deputies executed a morning raid against him and his crew, netting drugs and automatic weapons.
"I ain't afraid of prison and I ain't afraid of you," Mr. Sanchez said as he left his mother's house in handcuffs. "I was just on my way to school."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE MEDIA; 
National TV Focuses on Sniper, but Local Stations Pick Up the Slack on Political Coverage

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
Menacing images of cross hairs dominated the screens of the national television newscasts on Tuesday night, as did the chilling words from the Washington sniper's letter: "Your children are not safe anywhere at any time."
 But when residents in Sioux Falls, S.D., tuned to the 6 p.m. local news on KELO-TV, the CBS affiliate there, they encountered a far different world view: First, they saw a brief account about a nearby tanker crash, then a much longer report about pledges by the candidates for United States Senate not to produce negative political advertisements. 
 So it goes throughout the battleground states of the midterm elections. Robbed of the chance to capitalize on broad themes that set agendas in the national media, the political parties have had to rely on piecemeal coverage market by market to get messages across. 
Democrats, and to a lesser extent Republicans, say the sniper news coverage has hindered their ability to seize the focus on national issues that will help lift their candidates in the battle to control the House and Senate. Still, they said, those races are receiving more than adequate coverage from local television stations, partly because the Washington-area shootings are far removed from their broadcast areas.
"Local media is talking about the local races," said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter. "If you turn on a television in South Dakota, you're going to see political ads and the debates are getting covered."
Even so, a successful, national theme can galvanize an entire party in a midterm election, as Newt Gingrich proved in 1994, when the Republicans' "Contract With America" helped promote candidates across the country and ultimately gave the Republican Party control of Congress.
In the absence of such a national campaign, the results can be less overwhelming. "Without the national wave, you're cherry picking," Mr. Rothenberg said. "You could cherry pick with 2 or 3 seats. But netting 6, 7, 8, 12, 15 is really hard to do."
With Republicans running behind a strong president who is weighing war with Iraq, analysts said the onus is on the Democrats to build nationwide momentum around economic issues.
"The fundamental issue for the Democrats is whether they can get people to go into the voter booth and say 'Gee, my 401k is down because of George W. Bush's policies,' " said Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant who was the spokesman for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. "To get people to make that connection, you need to break through nationally."
According to Andrew Tyndall, a consultant who tracks network news coverage, the half-hour evening newscasts on NBC, ABC and CBS -- watched by a combined audience of about 30 million people -- devoted 76 minutes to the sniper case last week. Iraq, the second-most covered issue that week, commanded 28 minutes. The 2002 Congressional races were covered for 5 minutes.
Economic news has not been at the top of Mr. Tyndall's list of the 10 most-covered topics since July.
The 24-hour cable networks -- Fox News Channel, CNN and MSNBC -- have essentially offered a similar news mix. Even many of the political programs that help set the tone of the election -- NBC's "Meet the Press," ABC's "This Week," CNN's "Crossfire" -- have devoted considerable time to the sniper in recent weeks.
But each side said local news, along with the heavy political advertising spending, is helping to offset the loss of attention at the national level.
While the sniper story had the nation's attention, Steve Schmidt, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, "it's not impinging on anybody's ability in Congressional races in Arizona, in Alabama, in Mississippi, to get their messages out."
Station news directors said their local political races often make for more compelling television than the Washington sniper story. 
Mark R. Millage, news director of KELO in South Dakota, said the campaign season in his state, featuring several tight races, was "almost like a sporting event, a prize fight," adding that "they're entering the 15th round."

HEADLINE: Officials Seek Changes in Rules For Sept. 11 Business Program 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Businesses that were in the World Trade Center should get more money than other businesses from a program granting relief from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, a group of officials said yesterday.
 Under the current rules for the aid plan, called the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program, small businesses that were in the trade center when it was destroyed are treated the same as small businesses on the blocks around them, the officials said as they called publicly for different rules for the program. 
 "It only makes sense that businesses destroyed totally are treated differently from business that remained physically intact," said one of the officials, Alan J. Gerson, chairman of the City Council's committee on Lower Manhattan redevelopment, who also represents the area. 
Another council member, Domenic M. Recchia Jr., said of the companies that were in the trade center, "They have nothing to go back to." 
Under the program, all businesses that have up to 500 employees and that are in the area between Chambers Street and Rector Street on the north and south and Broadway and the Hudson River from east to west -- the trade center and the blocks immediately around it -- are equally eligible for the program's maximum grants of up to 25 days of lost revenue.
The two council members spoke at a news conference outside City Hall. They were joined by the speaker of the Council, Gifford Miller; the speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, and about 75 owners of businesses that had been in the trade center or were in Chinatown.
A spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, which runs the program with the city's Economic Development Corporation, said his agency was "focused on helping World Trade Center tenants." That focus, he said, was a reason for recently increasing the maximum business recovery grants for those in and around the trade center.
The spokesman, Michael Marr, also suggested that "partisan politics" was "at play" in yesterday's news conference. All those backing the changes in the programs were Democrats.
The legislators also called for expanding the boundaries of another program, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant Program, which provides up to $5,000 per worker to businesses with up to 200 employees that sign new or renewal leases in the area as far north as Canal Street. That, the legislators say, covers only part of Chinatown, though the portion of Chinatown north of Canal Street was hurt just as hard by the decline of tourists and other visitors. Thus, they said, eligibility for the program should extend as far north as Delancey Street.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
SECURITY COUNCIL GETS U.S. PROPOSAL ON DISARMING IRAQ

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
The United States formally presented the full Security Council today with a draft resolution that includes a threat of military action against Iraq, sharply increasing the pressure on France, Russia and China to agree to a tough measure to force Baghdad to disarm. 
 The administration's step followed six weeks of wrangling among the five veto-bearing members of the Council that did not yield agreement on linking a proposal for tough weapons inspections in Iraq with a threat of military force to back them up. 
 The United States submitted its draft to all 15 Council nations to show its reluctant allies, France and Russia, that it had sufficient support among the 10 other members.
American diplomats calculated, but without any guarantees, that neither France, Russia nor China would veto the latest resolution. But the move today forced the pace and put pressure on the five to decide soon how they would vote. 
"You're either with us or against us" was the message that Washington was sending to the other permanent members, an administration official said today. 
France, supported by Russia, has opposed the American draft because it includes a legal basis for a military attack if Iraq fails to disarm. France has favored a two-stage approach, which would leave the authorization of force to a second resolution, a position Russia and China favor. 
The United States action today came after France and Russia, and less forcefully China, criticized the American proposal yet again in closed negotiations on Tuesday. 
American officials said they were carrying out a strategy that Mr. Bush outlined on Sept. 12 when he first challenged the United Nations to confront Iraq, saying that if the world organization would not act to disarm Iraq, the United States was prepared to do it alone. 
American diplomats argued that the negotiations among the five veto-bearing countries were among the most arduous ever for a resolution. American and British diplomats insisted they had made significant concessions to the complaints from France and Russia in the draft they presented on Monday. Britain will co-sponsor the resolution. 
"The moment has come to give an added sense of urgency to this question," said the American ambassador, John D. Negroponte.
The draft presented today underwent only minor modifcations in negotiations since late Sunday.
The full Council will return for discussions on Friday, and decided today to meet on Monday with Hans Blix, the head of the United Nations weapons inspections team, extending the negotiations into next week. 
The Russian ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, made an unusual display of irritation as he went into the meeting. Visibly angry, he said he was "preoccupied with the real problem," the hostage crisis in Moscow.
"That's the sort of real threats we experience these days," Mr. Lavrov insisted, suggesting that the threat posed by Iraq's weapons programs was less immediate. 
He said Russia opposed the American draft because it still included an automatic authorization for the use of force and imposed "unimplementable, unrealistic" demands on inspectors and Iraqi officials.
When asked if Russia had assured the United States that it would not use its veto, Mr. Lavrov said: "The short answer is no. But this was never discussed."
He dismissed suggestions by American diplomats that his views did not represent the thinking of President Vladimir V. Putin. "In case someone has any doubts, what I'm presenting in the Council is not an invention of my own," he said. 
The closed meeting this afternoon with all 15 Council members was the first time the 10 rotating members, who do not hold vetoes, had officially seen the United States draft. They have complained openly about being excluded from the talks, and American officials said today's move was in part to mollify them. 
Under the terms of the United Nations Charter, a Council resolution is adopted by nine votes in favor and no negative vote from the five permanent members. As they emerged today with the text in their briefcases, the nonpermanent ambassadors were noncommital. 
Making an informal count, administration officials said they were confident of the support of Bulgaria, Colombia, Guinea and Norway and believed they could secure the votes of Singapore and Cameroon. Syria and Mauritius were expected to vote against it. As a result, Ireland and Mexico emerged as pivotal votes. 
Mexico, whose president, Vicente Fox, has enjoyed a warm friendship with President Bush, has been frustrated with the lack of progress with the administration on immigration and other bilateral issues. Mexico has very vocally backed France's demand for the two-stage approach.
Moments after meeting tonight with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Mexico's foreign minister, Jorge G. Castaneda, spoke positively of the new draft, although he said he had not read the very latest version.
"We think that with the French, the Russians and the Chinese, we have been able to generate important progress on the issue of two stages," he said in a telephone interview from Los Cabos.
Secretary Powell, who is also in Mexico for an economic conference of Asian and Pacific nations, said the new draft was a product of the United States having "listened carefully" to suggestions from other countries. He said the United States would listen to any proposed changes as long as they did not violate the objective of threatening "consequences" against Iraq.
"It's not a fiat that we have put down," he said, but he did not specifically say the United States would make any further changes.
The permanent members have the choice of voting in favor, abstaining or vetoing. With the support of Britain assured, American officials were calculating that if they secured seven votes from nonpermanent members, France would almost certainly acquiesce in the final hour. The last time that France vetoed an American resolution was in 1956.
President Bush is to meet on Friday at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., with President Jiang Zemin of China. He is also to speak on Saturday with President Putin at the meeting of Pacific rim nations in Mexico.

HEADLINE: Xerox Reports a Profit, but Revenue Is Down 6% 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Xerox, offsetting a 6 percent slump in sales with a 13 percent cut in costs, said yesterday that it had earned $105 million, or 5 cents a share, in the third quarter.
 That was in contrast to a loss of 5 cents in the period a year ago, and beat analysts' estimates for the quarter by 3 cents. 
 "We've been really tough-minded on costs, and our margins are exceeding everyone's expectations," an ebullient Anne M. Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox, said in a telephone interview after her conference call with analysts. "Our new products and lower prices are indicative of a new Xerox." 
Ms. Mulcahy reassured investors that 2002 would be a profitable year, the first for Xerox since 1999. But the reassurance did not buoy the company's stock. Shares of Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., closed at $6.41, down 29 cents.
Many factors damped ardor for Xerox shares. Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson First Call, noted that Xerox had beaten earnings expectations four consecutive times, and that some analysts were more cynical than impressed. 
"Xerox wouldn't be the first company to low-ball earnings guidance in order to look good," he said. 
Xerox also announced a $3 billion shelf registration -- a notification that it might issue that amount in new equity or debt. New shares would dilute existing ones, and Xerox already has about $9 billion in debt coming due in the next three years. Ms. Mulcahy said she had no immediate plans to issue new shares or bonds, but some investors might have sold just in case.
This quarter, job cuts resulted in a 6-cent charge against earnings. In the fourth quarter, Xerox will probably write off pension obligations, and take further charges for job cuts. 
"They have hugely improved their balance sheet, but it is still an unholy mess," said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman & Reid, who rates Xerox shares a buy.
Sluggish sales remain the big reason for Wall Street's thumbs-down vote on Xerox. Third-quarter revenue was $3.79 billion, down from $4.05 billion a year ago. About half the decline came when Xerox exited the low-price printer market last year, and dropped many unprofitable customers in developing markets. But leery investors are not appeased.
Timothy M. Ghriskey, a principal in the money management firm of Ghriskey Capital Partners, had been considering buying Xerox shares. But after yesterday's report, he decided not to. 
"They've controlled expenses, but we've seen 10 quarters of sliding sales," he said. "We keep coming back to, 'where's the growth?' "
Ms. Mulcahy insists that order rates are picking up and that "we're seeing momentum on new products."
Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said that as recently as July companies were still cutting their capital spending plans. 
"The expected economic pickup never came, they are husbanding cash, and they are not buying business equipment," said Mr. Kelly, who is neutral on Xerox stock. 
Xerox is in good shape to grab share when customers do spend again. It has a number of new products that analysts say are priced to compete with Canon and Ricoh, Xerox's main rivals.
Xerox cut 1,600 jobs this quarter, and more job cuts are expected soon. Xerox generated $611 million in cash in the quarter. And earlier this week, Xerox announced that GE Capital would provide as much as $5 billion over the next eight years, enabling Xerox to continue to finance equipment leases for customers.
"I give Xerox the best chance of all my fallen angels for turning itself around," said Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, a corporate bond research service. 
Xerox has restated several years' worth of sales and earnings and paid a $10 million fine, thereby ending a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of its accounting. Indeed, no analyst asked about accounting fraud during the conference call.
"It was so nice," Ms. Mulcahy said. "Finally, an earnings conference that focused on the business."

HEADLINE: Hicks Nix Blix Fix 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
North Korea proudly announced in 1994 that it had begun withdrawing plutonium-rich fuel rods from one of its nuclear reactors, which the world knew would enable the Stalinist government to build a half-dozen bombs. Coupled with its threat to turn South Korea's capital, Seoul, into "a sea of fire," this threat to the nonproliferation treaty deeply worried Bill Clinton's Pentagon.
 Tough-minded negotiators were needed to head off the dictator Kim Il Sung's plan. Two senators steeped in arms control were selected to go to Pyongyang: Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn. They prepared to board a military transport plane, but the dictator refused them permission to enter his country; he had a different kind of intermediary in mind. 
 Enter Jimmy Carter. Within a month after the rejection of Lugar and Nunn, our former president was in the dictator's office, in front of CNN cameras, announcing -- as only an unofficial emissary, of course -- that he had personally worked out a deal to defuse the crisis. In return for suspending plutonium production, the Koreans would receive free oil, a light-water nuclear reactor said to be less dangerous, and the top-level diplomatic contacts it long sought.
"It was kind of like a miracle," breathed Jimmy Carter about his supposed conversion of the North Korean leader from lion to lamb on live TV. Ignoring the protests from realists in this space and all over about appeasement and lack of verification, the Clinton administration embraced Carter's "miracle." After all, hadn't the North Koreans agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, headed by the sternly unfoolable Hans Blix?
As we now know, the Carter-Clinton crowd was taken to the cleaners by a totalitarian regime that snatched our payoff and secretly kept on building nukes. When confronted this month with indisputable evidence of years of double-crossing us and the world, the Communist North headed by Kim's dictator son said, in effect, "Sure we did -- and your nosiness means that the deal is now nullified." 
With the arrogance of successful con men, they now want to sell us the same phony bill of goods again: more oil and food and "safe" reactors in return for more empty promises of shell-game inspections. The so-called unilateral cowboys of the Bush administration won't buy that. (Suggested Variety headline: Hicks Nix Blix Fix.)
Instead, at his Crawford, Tex., ranch, the president will lay it on the line to his visitor from China, Jiang Zemin: Do you want a loose cannon on your border loaded with nukes? Or will you, with exquisite Chinese subtlety and Communist camaraderie, put the economic and diplomatic squeeze on your hungry neighbor lest it gain the destructive power to threaten China's Asian sphere of influence? 
America and its allies will not use our military to take out the Pyongyang gang for the simple reason that North Korea already has the conventional troop strength and artillery power to inflict horrendous casualties on the South (including 40,000 U.S. tripwire troops) as well as in Japan, which Pyongyang will soon be able to reach with nuclear missiles. 
That strategic fact of life and death invites the question that coolly consistent sophists love to ask: If we are disinclined to attack the nuclear buildup in North Korea, why are we hot to attack a somewhat less imminent threat of mass destruction from Iraq? 
Saddam Hussein is a recent, serial aggressor, while totalitarian North Korea has not launched an invasion in the past half-century. Moreover, the potentially high human cost of wiping out the Korean threat should be an unforgettable lesson to every nation: The world must not allow Iraq to gain the level of destructive power that appeasement and misplaced trust permitted North Korea to achieve. 
Our failure to demand intrusive, relentless inspection of North Korea in the past decade has made everyone more vulnerable to the spread of terror weaponry. (Libya's secret nuclear work relies on Korean know-how.) 
The U.S. has learned its lesson from Pyongyang's duplicity. If oil-fixated France and Russia should awake to the danger of Saddam and join with us at the U.N. to stop him while he's readily stoppable, that would turn the proliferation tide. It's a long shot. It would be kind of like a miracle.

HEADLINE: Longshoremen Accused of Slowdown in West 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The association of West Coast port operators said yesterday that it had complained to the Justice Department that the dock workers were engaging in a "concerted, systematic work slowdown."
 The group, the Pacific Maritime Association, asked the government to act, asserting that productivity had fallen to 34 percent below normal in Oakland, Calif.; 29 percent below normal in Portland, Ore.; and 27 percent below in Seattle. 
 Joseph Miniace, the president of the association, said, "The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is playing games with the U.S. economy, and inflicting economic pain and hardship on scores of companies and their employees." 
On Sept. 29, the maritime association closed 29 West Coast ports and locked out 10,500 longshoremen, accusing them of engaging in a slowdown. On Oct. 8, President Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and asked a federal judge in San Francisco to order the ports reopened and the longshoremen back to work.
Several economists estimated that the port shutdown had cost the economy at least $1 billion a day.
In response to the association's complaint, the Justice Department sent the association and the union a letter that said, "These are serious allegations."
The letter, from Deputy Assistant Attorney General Shannen W. Coffin, noted that the injunction reopening the ports required that work continue "at a normal and reasonable rate of speed," and without the union's interfering with "the orderly continuance of work." Mr. Coffin noted that the injunction also ordered the union "not to engage in any slowdown or any other kind of work stoppage." 
He asked the union and maritime association to provide information regarding the accusations of a slowdown. If the Justice Department concludes that the union is engaged in an unjustifiable slowdown, one option it has is to ask the judge to cite the union for contempt.
Steve Stallone, a union spokesman, insisted that there was not a deliberate slowdown, although he acknowledged that cargo handling was slower than usual, saying the main reason was extraordinary congestion.
"We're not engaged in a slowdown," Mr. Stallone said. "Even if we wanted to mess up productivity on the docks, we couldn't do half as good a job as the Pacific Maritime Association has done with the logistical disaster they created through the lockout."
Mr. Stallone said the docks were so congested with backed up cargo and trucks that lower productivity was inevitable. Union officials said safety concerns, especially during this period of unusual congestion, were also lowering productivity. 
The association said the reasons cited by the union -- safety and congestion -- could not account for what it termed a sudden and major drop in work levels at several ports. The association said the drop in productivity was far smaller -- 9 percent below normal -- at the nation's largest port, Los Angeles/Long Beach.
The association accused the longshoremen of taking unjustified sick days and accused the union of not providing full crews of workers and delaying the dispatch of workers. Union officials said the ports were so busy that it was hard to furnish all the workers needed.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Current Deficit May Be as Much as $1 Billion 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city's current budget could be as much as $1 billion out of balance, echoing concerns that fiscal monitors have been raising since he and the City Council agreed to it in June.
 It was the first time that Mayor Bloomberg had said that the current deficit could be as much as $1 billion. "If you want to use the number a billion dollars -- could be, it could be a lot less than that," he said in an interview on radio station WOR. 
 If the city were to fall $1 billion short this year, it would deal a severe blow to its plans for closing the giant budget gap that is looming next year. 
Here is why: the Bloomberg administration is currently struggling to cut $1 billion in city spending next month. The mayor has said all along that he hopes to use that money to plug a gap in the 2004 fiscal year, which begins July 1, which he estimates at $5 billion to $6 billion.
Time is money, so starting early is important: a $1 billion cut beginning this year would save the city $2 billion by the end of next year.
But if the current budget is $1 billion out of balance, the city will have to use the savings generated by next month's budget cuts immediately. That would leave the city $1 billion further away from closing next year's formidable gap.
It was not supposed to be that way. When the mayor first announced his plan for $1 billion in midyear cuts in July, he said, "My expectation is that we will not have to use it in 2003, but I think it's prudent to have it."
But in the radio interview yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg said that the city now expected to collect less money in tax revenues in the next eight months than it had originally anticipated.
The size of this year's deficit, he said, "depends on how things work out, how much help we can still get from the federal government, and from state government and from the unions and from the economy."
Nearly as soon as the ink dried on this year's budget, fiscal monitors warned that it could be out of balance. Within weeks of its adoption, the city comptroller's office, the state comptroller's office and the state's Financial Control Board all warned that the budget relied on at least $1 billion in revenues and savings that might not materialize. 
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, said that the 7.5 percent cut was intended not only to get a head start on next year's deficit, but also was an insurance policy if this year's budget fell out of balance.
"Under the city's charter, the budget is updated throughout the fiscal year, but the amounts are obviously more severe during a fiscal crisis when you are facing successive $5 to $6 billion deficits," he said.
The City Council now estimates that there are $995 million in risks in this year's budget. Tax collections could fall $320 million short, Council officials said; the city had counted on them to grow by 5.2 percent, but they are now expected to grow by 3.8 percent.
The mayor has yet to realize $252 million in savings from the city's union contracts, and the city has not received the $175 million in airport rents it is counting on.
Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, said that everything from tax increases to layoffs would have to be considered as the city moves to close its budget gaps.
"We're going to be choosing between bad, worse and worst," Mr. Miller said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Hails Output Gains in Sluggish Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, hailed the continued strong growth in business efficiency today but gave no hint as to whether the central bank might consider cutting interest rates when it meets in two weeks.
 Mr. Greenspan spoke shortly before the Fed said in its beige book report on regional economic conditions that the economy in most parts of the country was sluggish, with retail sales weak and manufacturing activity slowing. 
 Economists said the lack of a signal from Mr. Greenspan about the Fed's intentions and the muddled outlook for the economy left open the question of whether the central bank would cut rates for the first time in 11 months when it meets on Nov. 6. 
Analysts predicted a month ago that the Fed would probably cut rates before the end of the year. Since then the stock market has recovered some of its losses, the economy has avoided any sharp deterioration and several Fed officials have signaled that they view the current level of interest rates as low enough to keep the halting recovery from last year's recession on track. The Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate is at 1.75 percent, a 40-year low.
The beige book report, which surveyed economic conditions in September and early October, found that retail sales were weak or down in nearly all areas of the country, an indication that consumer spending, which more than any other single factor has kept the economy afloat, may be running out of steam. It said automobile sales had slowed from very high levels and that tourism was mixed.
The report said that manufacturers cited "tough," "stagnant" and "sluggish" business conditions in most places, and noted that manufacturers remained reluctant to invest in plants and equipment. Economists say the economy is unlikely to rebound until businesses are willing to increase capital spending.
Mr. Greenspan had nothing to say about current economic conditions. In a speech to a conference sponsored by the Labor Department and the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, the Fed chairman focused on the growth of productivity, or output per hour, a measure of the economy's ability to produce more for less and the primary determinant of its capacity to expand without generating inflation.
Mr. Greenspan, an optimist about productivity over the long run, marveled at how output per hour had continued to rise at a robust pace even as the economy struggled to put the recession behind it, defying the historical trend of big productivity increases accompanying especially strong economic recoveries. The trend, he said, was "remarkable and encouraging."
Mr. Greenspan noted that productivity growth over the last year "will almost surely be reported as one of the largest advances, if not the largest, posted over the past 30 years." 
He acknowledged that the surge in productivity could taper off. But he listed several reasons it could continue for some time, and pointed to recent studies that concluded that the growth rate in output per hour was probably sustainable at about 2.5 percent a year. At that level it would be below its annual rate of 4.8 percent for the year ended in June, but well above its 1.5 percent annual rate from the mid-1970's to the mid-1990's.
Mr. Greenspan said much of the improvement appeared to stem from the pressure on companies to reduce costs at a time when low inflation has made it all but impossible to raise prices. He said companies seemed to be trimming corporate excesses that had built up during the rapid expansion of the 1990's.
He said the recent surge in productivity might reflect a delay in the ability of companies to take full advantage of their heavy investments in new cost-saving technology toward the end of the 1990's. In the short run, he said, adopting new technology can disrupt businesses as they learn how to use new machinery and software, with the full benefits only visible after a few years.
But Mr. Greenspan did not directly address the the fact that productivity gains can restrain employment growth, increasing the odds of a jobless recovery. 
He touched on the pressure that relentless cost-cutting places on employees, noting that "more demanding workloads eventually begin to tax workers and impede efficiency."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS; 
McAuliffe Describes Jeb Bush As the Democrats' Top Target

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman, said today that his No. 1 goal in the Nov. 5 elections was to defeat Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida and that his No. 1 worry was whether Senator Jean Carnahan, Democrat of Missouri, could hold her seat.
 "Jeb is gone!" Mr. McAuliffe declared brazenly, brushing aside the determination of the White House to protect the president's brother. "There won't be anything as devastating to President Bush as his brother's losing in Florida." 
 At a lunch today with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. McAuliffe said he was thrilled that Mr. Bush planned to campaign almost nonstop until the election, because that would focus attention on domestic issues, where Democrats believe that their strength lies.
More than any other factor, he said, the Democrats' success in turning the economy into an issue would determine whether the party regained control of the House.
"They made a huge strategic error," Mr. McAuliffe said of the White House. "It will force him to talk about the economy."
Mr. McAuliffe said that after Mr. Bush's recent trip to Minnesota, Senator Paul Wellstone, the Democrat, climbed two points in the polls. 
"We hope George Bush goes to all our highly contested races," the Democratic leader said.
As part of the focus on the economy, Mr. McAuliffe said the party would pay for commercials in each area where Mr. Bush campaigned. 
"Wherever President Bush goes," he said, "we're on TV before he gets there, while he's there and the day after, every city." 
The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Marc Racicot, said last week in the same forum that he was not worried about domestic issues and the economy, because the Democrats had been impotent in outlining their economic program. Mr. Racicot said he expected Republicans to retain control of the House and take back the Senate.
Disputing that, Mr. McAuliffe asserted that the Democrats would retain control of the Senate by at least one seat, and possibly as many as three. He conceded that winning the six net seats needed to take over the House was "tough, but it's doable."
He added that he was worried that if the Democrats failed to take over the House, which they lost in 1994, many incumbent Democrats would retire.
Mr. McAuliffe said the party would make its strongest gains in the governors' races, particularly in Florida. He based his enthusiasm about Florida on polls that show a dead heat between Mr. Bush and Bill McBride, the Democratic candidate.
The national party will make an all-out commitment of money and campaign workers to help Mr. McBride, Mr. McAuliffe said. The goal is not only to avenge Al Gore's failure to capture the state in 2000, but also to set the stage for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2004.
"To have a governor in a state in a presidential year for money, message, mobilization," he said, "will help us tremendously. I cannot tell you the impact of us having the governor of Florida heading into the '04 presidential."
Mr. McAuliffe was more subdued about Missouri. The most recent poll, by American Viewpoint, a Republican pollster, shows former Representative Jim Talent, the Republican, leading Mrs. Carnahan, 49 percent to 41 percent. Earlier polls by Democratic pollsters had Mrs. Carnahan ahead.
"This is her first real campaign, full-blown, all-out campaign, and there's a lot of money in that state," Mr. McAuliffe said. "Jean's is probably the race that we all worry about the most."
He had earlier called Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey the weakest Democratic candidate. Mr. Torricelli later withdrew. 
Mr. McAuliffe called Mr. Talent "a very good campaigner" and noted that after he lost the governor's race in 2000 by one point, he had maintained his political operation.
"She's going to pull it out," Mr. McAuliffe said of Mrs. Carnahan. "But it has really tightened up."
A spokesman for her campaign, Dan Leistikow, said, "We've always known this race would be very close, but we think Senator Carnahan is in a strong position."
Mr. McAuliffe said he was concerned that fears about the sniper could suppress turnout in Maryland and said he approved a suggestion by Gov. Parris N. Glendening to call up the National Guard on Election Day.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Art Fairs

"ARMORY PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW 2002," Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, North Pavilion, 11th Avenue at 39th Street. Hours: Today through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Monday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $15. Information: (212) 645-6440. The organizers of the Armory Show, which began six years ago in the Gramercy Park Hotel and now fills two piers on the Hudson every February, are bringing forth a spinoff, the Armory Photography Show 2002. Its 83 participants will include contemporary art galleries, including Barbara Gladstone, 303, Matthew Marks, David Zwirner, Team, Greene-Naftali and Lelong, as well as stalwarts of the photography scene like Fraenkel, Howard Greenberg, Julie Saul, Robert Mann and Klotz-Sirmon -- a combination that promises to reflect the way the medium's widespread and expanding presence. A broad range of modern and contemporary material -- some of it freshly minted -- will be presented, along with some videos and occasional single-artist shows and installations (Roberta Smith).

Museums

"AMERICAN ANTHEM: MASTERWORKS FROM THE AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM," 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Jan. 5). The last of three shows celebrating the American Folk Art Museum's new building, "Anthem" displays more than 250 objects in the museum's collection, and in the cleverly designed new digs the show really comes on strong. It displays some of folk art's most esteemed icons, among them the "Flag Gate," a weathered farm gate of painted wood in the shape of an American flag; a pair of spiffy lady-and-gentleman portraits by Ammi Phillips; a spirited carousel horse from Coney Island carved by Charles Carmel; and a life-size baseball player at bat, carved by Samuel Anderson Robb. For the first time, the show includes the work of 20th-century self-taught artists in context with earlier folk art in the collection. Also for the first time the museum demonstrates its recently expanded collecting interests beyond the United States, showing the work of 20th-century self-taught Europeans like Adolf Wolfli, Madge Gill and Carlo Zinelli. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5 for students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

* "RICHARD AVEDON: PORTRAITS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 5). Just eight years after the last Richard Avedon show, here's a survey of portraits. The fashion analogy is obvious: the repackaged product, a clever campaign to market the same old goods. But the show is gorgeous: a pitch-perfect mix of modest-size, big and unbelievably big prints, each an exquisitely made object. Whatever else the works might be, they are unforgettable. Celebrity only partly accounts for their status. Mr. Avedon brings other factors to bear: a sense of spectacle, clinical precision, energy, movement even in static head shots (the figures often seem so tense they look ready to jump out of the pictures) and an irrepressible attraction to power. His career dovetails with the era of the paparazzi, the tell-all media and the obligatory scandals and secret sufferings of the rich and fashionable. You might say he raised this cultural fixation to a neurotic art. The trade-off with him is always between style and substance. It's the conflict of our culture. No wonder his pictures are so embedded in our imagination. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* JUDY CHICAGO: "THE DINNER PARTY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 9). This exhibition welcomes back Ms. Chicago's extravagant installation banquet of ceramic plates and handmade table runners dedicated to 39 women. A feminist landmark, it is joining the permanent collection 22 years after its first appearance at the museum. It is amazing to see. Made with the help of hundreds of volunteers from 1975 to 1979, "The Dinner Party" sums up the first stage of feminist art, reflects the late 70's rematerialization of the art object, and is startlingly prescient of the art of the late 80's and 90's in its ambition to be both aggressively visual and politically charged. Despite being almost as much a part of American culture as Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, W.P.A. murals and the AIDS quilt, it retains much of its original revolutionary fervor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Smith).

* "CULTIVATED LANDSCAPES: REFLECTIONS OF NATURE IN CHINESE PAINTING WITH SELECTIONS FROM THE COLLECTION OF MARIE-HELENE AND GUY WEILL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 9). This show is basically a rotation of the permanent collection, of the kind required to protect light-sensitive silk scrolls and ink-painted album pages. But the Met has a flair for turning necessity into a virtue by reintroducing work along thematic lines and introducing fresh material to lend a sense of event. Such is the case here. At the center of the reinstallation is a group of splendid Ming and Qing dynasty paintings recently given or promised to the museum by the New York collectors Marie-Helene and Guy Weill. They are a genuine attraction in themselves and a logical link in the continuum of this museum's Chinese holdings. Hours and admission: see above (Holland Cotter).

* "DRAWING NOW: EIGHT PROPOSITIONS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 6). This generous sampling of work by 26 young artists provides a sweeping, even opulent view of drawing at the threshold of the 21st century. The variety of techniques and materials, the mix of large-scale feats of draftsmanship with clusters of framed works, the broad spate of sources (from American quilt patterns to Japanese anime to 19th-century illustration) and the range of narrative ambition create an exhilarating sense of possibility. The division of the work into eight different approaches, or propositions, balances coherence with diversity. Some of the artists illustrate rather than fully embody the curators' categories and there is an excess of fashionable, even overexposed artists from a handful of hot galleries. Nonetheless, "Drawing Now" is required viewing for anyone remotely interested in today's art. It sets a standard for future shows of its kind. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; until 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Smith).

* "EXPOSED: THE VICTORIAN NUDE," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 5). For the latest overview of British naughtiness, you may once again go to (where else?) Brooklyn, for this show of not very prudish Victorian art. "Exposed" has even more naked women without pubic hair than the last Vanessa Beecroft show at the Gagosian Gallery. The naked young maidens here, shackled to a rock or draped over the oars of a ship (the boatmen bravely stare straight ahead) or riding horses or just standing there with anacondas wrapped around their bodies are Andromeda, the Sirens, Godiva and Harmonia. The artists include Sargent, Frederic Leighton and Herbert Schmalz, whose "Faithful Unto Death" presents half a dozen or so naked damsels, loosely bound to herms, awaiting lions in the Circus Maximus. Lawrence Alma-Tadema imagines apple-flushed Victorian women soaking in a Roman plunge bath. Fortunately, the show does not stint on genuine pornography. Perfume and underwear advertisers today clearly have nothing on the feisty Victorians. The show ends with works by Walter Sickert and Gwen John, artists at the turn of the last century who dispensed with the kinky fantasies of antigravitational breasts and painted what they really saw. From Alma-Tadema to Ms. Beecroft and cold cream commercials. From John and Sickert to Lucian Freud (who could never be confused with Herbert Schmalz). Hours and admissions: See above (Kimmelman)

* "FACING THE MASK" AND "RECENT ACQUISITIONS: SELECTIONS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION," Museum for African Art, third floor, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through March 2). The Museum for African Art, formerly of SoHo, makes the leap to a new home in Long Island City, with a very beautiful if surveyish show, "Facing the Mask," which happens to be all about moving. Some of the moving is physical, some psychological and spiritual, and it is embodied in more than 70 stunning masks, no two alike, from across sub-Saharan Africa. Some were used for popular entertainment; others were moral forces incarnate. Their purpose was transport, and they are supplemented by films of masquerades in action. Also on view is a selection of work from the museum's still small but growing permanent collection. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

"ADOLPH GOTTLIEB: A SURVEY EXHIBITION," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3271 (through March 2). Gottlieb's painting has not aged as well as that of his colleagues Pollock, Rothko and Newman. His journey leads from 1930's representational pictures that resemble those by his friend Milton Avery to the gridded pictographic works of the 40's to the iconic circle-and-burst paintings of the late 50's, which have been his most memorable works. In the 1960's his canvases expand and brighten under the influence of Color Field painting. This 31-painting exhibition casts an illuminating light on a period of tremendous creative ferment in Western art. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ (Ken Johnson).

"MOVING PICTURES," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). This survey of photography with a small selection of video, film and installation art appended may be the largest exhibition of its kind in a major New York museum. Drawn almost entirely from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, it has a snappy yet unobtrusive design by Hani Rashid and ably surveys the expansion of contemporary art by camera-dependent media from the late 1960's to now. It begins with works by Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman and Robert Smithson, then moves up the museum's ramp through photographs by Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky, concluding with video and film by artists like Stan Douglas, Shirin Neshat and Pierre Huyghe. An added attraction is the foam-lined, cavelike video galleries perched at the top of the spiral, which give the show a giddy, Hall of the Mountain King finale that seems to say, "Onward and upward with video." Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (Smith)

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Dec. 1). The Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the world's oldest surviving art school (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection of works to instruct its students in the discipline of drawing. Those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance, with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Wicked doings in the Bible, sex in mythology, the ordered schematics of French architecture and the pomp and circumstance of the French court are some of the subjects covered in the drawings, which should send any aficionado to the Frick on the run. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Glueck).

* "THE THAW COLLECTION: MASTER DRAWINGS AND OIL SKETCHES, ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1994," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 (through Jan. 19). This selection of more than 100 European drawings and oil sketches is the latest update on a personal collection that Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, have been depositing at the Morgan in increments since 1975. The last such show in 1994 left everyone a bit light-headed it was so good. This one has a lot going for it, too, including work by Rembrandt, Ruisdael, Degas and the incomparable Samuel Palmer. A cluster of 19th-century German and Scandinavian works give the proceedings a piney, Romantic air. Nearly half the show is plein-air oil sketches, which the Thaws have recently been acquiring in depth. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "BILL VIOLA: GOING FORTH BY DAY," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). An ambitious meditation on the epic themes of human existence, this frescolike video installation consists of five panels, shot using the latest technology and projected simultaneously on the walls of one huge gallery. Each deals with a specific theme: rebirth, journey through life, disaster, death and resurrection. Inspired by the works of Renaissance painters like Giotto and Luca Signorelli, the show relates as much to still painting as it does to the moving images of cinema and television. Except for a few scenes, the action is almost in slow motion, suggesting the stasis of looking at paintings and allowing the viewer to shift attention from panel to panel without losing focus. The liveliest scene is "The Deluge," in which a series of ordinary street events occurs before the facade of a Classical-looking house. They are interrupted by a tumultuous flood pouring out of the building's apertures that sends people running for their lives. The work was mostly shot before the Sept. 11 disaster, but is amazingly prophetic of it. If some of the imagery is corny, it is still a deeply felt and provocative piece of work. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* "WINOGRAND 1964," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Dec. 1). In 1964 the photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed the United States in a slow, black 1957 two-door Ford Fairlaine, taking nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. Here are around 150 of them, most never shown before. Some are not terrific. Winogrand was a hit-and-miss artist, and the show could have been edited. But others are great, and together the images add up to a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. A poor skeptic, Winogrand clearly saw the fragility and the preciousness of what binds people together. Many of the pictures seem fragile, too: they're fleeting stories sometimes so provisional as to be barely coherent, irreducible, like life, to a simple message. Winogrand captured how America once again transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

GEORGE BASELITZ, "Paintings and Drawings From the 1960's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Nov. 2). Before this German Neo-Expressionist started turning his canvases upside down, he made earthy, saturnine paintings and drawings right side up. His gnarly, muddy pictures from the 60's of people and animals have an evocative, primordial quality and sometimes, as in a small ink portrait of a bare-chested Antonin Artaud, a strange delicacy (Johnson).

MARKUS LUPERTZ, "Semiramis," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Nov. 16). Titled after the Babylonian Queen Semiramis, creator of the legendary Hanging Gardens, Mr. Lupertz's paintings, in which rectangles of florid, clotted Abstract Expressionist painting are set off within internal borders, might be a meditation on beauty and decadence. Superficially, these medium-size canvases by the head of the Dusseldorf Academy of Art resemble the paintings of Howard Hodgkin, but they are animated more by oblique irony than by lyrical hedonism (Johnson).

GYORGY ROMAN, "A Survey," Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 327-0441 (through Nov. 9). This Hungarian painter (1903-1981) had an incredibly adventurous life. Rendered deaf and mute by a childhood bout with meningitis, he went on to become a professional boxer, a candy-maker's apprentice, a world traveler and a novelist. An unpredictable mix of Expressionism, Primitivism, Symbolism and political allegory, his earthy paintings have one eye on war, pestilence and nostalgic memories, the other on the formal and material possibilities of painting itself (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

LARRY BROWN, Sears-Peyton, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 966-7469 (through Nov. 16). Spheres, globes and molecular models drift and tumble through space in Mr. Brown's semi-abstract paintings. The artist, an erstwhile pure abstractionist, grounds his cosmic vision in glazed, sensuously painterly surfaces and contains it within compressive compositions (Johnson).

JITISH KALLAT, Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074 (through Nov. 2). This young Indian artist made his New York solo debut three years ago with work that looked so fully resolved it was hard to imagine where he might take it from there. An answer comes in the new paintings here, in which he has expanded his scale, clarified his compositions and varied his palette. As before, he addresses political subjects -- AIDS, poverty and sectarian violence -- that have a very specific meaning in India, but are also of urgent concern elsewhere (Cotter).

EDDA RENOUF, "Time Lines," Joseph Helman, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 929-1545 (through Nov. 6). Ms. Renouf, who started exhibiting her work in Europe in the early 70's, makes Minimalistic multi-panel abstract paintings, in which rubbed-in shades of red, orange or blue create textures like worn denim. These fields are subtly activated by geometric designs made by selective removal of threads from the canvas. Ms. Renouf means her work to be about time, but its effect is more of elegant, dry formality (Johnson).

CLIFFORD ROSS, "Hurricanes," Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through Nov. 2). When a hurricane hits the coast of Long Island and most reasonable people are indoors safe and dry, Mr. Ross is up to his waist in the ocean shooting the waves. In his large, eerily lucid black-and-white photographs, the thrashing surf appears magically frozen into otherworldly landscapes (Johnson).

PETER WAITE, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through Nov. 2). Mr. Waite's moody photo-derived paintings of modest suburban houses are made with a nice, economical touch that simplifies detail and delicately outlines forms to slightly cartoonish effect. A touching nostalgia calls to mind Edward Hopper. There is an up-to-date conceptual program, too: each home displays an American flag, making the series a meditation on patriotic kitsch (Johnson).

JUDITH WESTPHALEN, Jan Van der Donk, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 691-5973 (through Nov. 21). This Peruvian painter (1922-1976) was a participant in Latin American artistic and intellectual circles. A four-decade survey of works on paper reveals a sensibility of urbane delicacy. Throughout, the artist engages in a dialogue with Cubism and Constructivism, producing compact compositions of layered, translucent planes in muted hues, shot through with cool, spacey light (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

"TRUE MEDIUMS," Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-3768 (through Nov. 2). This fine exhibition features works by psychic mediums who used drawings to materialize receptions from the great beyond. It's not otherworldly imagery so much as the drawing itself that fascinates. Included are ghostly faces drawn with extreme delicacy by Fernand Desmoulin; mandalas like stained-glass windows by Norma Oliver; colorful, stratified landscapes by Agatha Wojciechowsky; and calligraphic flowers penciled by Helen Butler Wells (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* "THE AGES OF MANKIND: TIME TO HOPE," Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 932-7347 (through Nov. 24; daily, 9:30 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m.). All but unheralded, this show seems to have dropped into New York like an unbidden gift, and what a gift: 100 superb examples of Spanish religious art, which is some of the most rapturous and wrenching religious art ever made, seen in a perfect setting. They include Romanesque madonnas, Gothic crucifixions, paintings of saints by El Greco and Goya, and a handwritten letter by St. Teresa of Avila, all from churches, monasteries and museums in the Spanish provinces of Castile and Leon. The images, among them life-size polychrome sculptures, are sexy, gruesome and, above all, theatrical, projecting big, primary emotions. The effect is gloriously intense (Cotter).

* "BETWEEN WORD AND IMAGE: MODERN IRANIAN VISUAL CULTURE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Dec. 7). This no-frills exhibition is about the dynamics of cultural borrowing, the inseparability of art and politics, and the interplay of modernism and Islamicism. It begins with painting and sculptures from the 1960's in which Western styles and Iranian themes merge. It continues with riveting photographs documenting the arrival of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And it concludes with art that the revolution produced: political posters inspired by both the Western counterculture and militant Islamic ideology. Depending on the amount of reflective synthesis you're willing to do, the results can seem richly layered, or disjointed and undercooked. But the materials and the ideas on display are fascinating (Cotter).

Last Chance

* WILLIAM ANTHONY, "Once More With Feeling," Dorfman Projects, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-2272 (through Wednesday). Mr. Anthony directs his comical faux-juvenile vision at masterpieces of art. Drawn in scrawly pencil lines and colored by smudgy brushwork, his sock-puppet versions of works like Hieronymus Bosch's "Ship of Fools," Picasso's "Frugal Repast" and Andy Warhol's portraits of Edith Scull are delightfully goofy. And in some cases, like "Sigmund Makes the Scene With Some Cezanne Bathers, Thereby Screwing Up Their Sex Lives," they are almost profound (Johnson).

RUSSELL CROTTY, CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766 (through tomorrow). Mr. Crotty's astronomical interests are realized in his best show yet. Using a fine-point black pen, he draws landscapes with starry skies on white, beach ball-size spheres. Suspended on thin wires, seven of these globes hover through the gallery, creating the ambience of a Minimalist sculpture installation. The artist's drawing simultaneously dissolves the surfaces into illusory spaces and pulls you in for close inspection of the finely textured surfaces (Johnson).

* KAFFE FASSETT, "Pattern as Obsession," Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 343-2161 (through tomorrow). Notwithstanding the exhibition's title, this London artist is less obsessed than delightfully inventive in using the domestic arts of knitting, needlepoint, rug hooking and sewing to produce colorful, optically absorbing essays in patternmaking. A funky, folk-art-like quality is belied by the sophisticated play with harmony and dissonance (Johnson).

* EDWIN HALE LINCOLN, "No Record So True," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through tomorrow). Lincoln's magnum opus was a 20-year project culminating in 1914 in a 400-picture catalog called "Wild Flowers of New England." It is a fascinating blend of science, Modernist aesthetics and New England Transcendentalism. Each of the 199 platinum prints shown here is a luminous, perfectly composed marvel of austere beauty and botanical passion (Johnson).

LAURENT MILLET, Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7600 (through tomorrow). Using cardboard, found sticks, wire and paint, this French photographer cobbles together semi-abstract sculptures and then photographs them standing in shallow water at the beach. His pictures are more than documents of whimsical ephemera, as each offers a puzzling conflation of the real and the illusory. Mr. Millet's project is an engagingly wry, low-tech investigation of epistemological uncertainty (Johnson).

* JIM SHAW, Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, and Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, (through tomorrow). At the Swiss Institute, Mr. Shaw, who sometimes assumes the role of other artists, presents work supposedly by a mediocre abstract painter named Adam Goodman. Goodman, we're told, supports himself as an illustrator under the pseudonym Archie Gunn. Goodman, we're told, is a believer in O-ism, a discount version of Mormonism, which inspired not only his abstractions but dozens of anonymous thrift-store paintings (all by Mr. Shaw, too, of course), on view at Metro Pictures. These are comically clumsy pictures of strange beings, obscure rituals, torture, stagecoaches and much else that makes blissfully little sense. It's all very funny, and as usual with Mr. Shaw, a sly, sardonic take on the mythologies of American art and high-low taste
(Kimmelman).

JAVIER TELLEZ, White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-2347 (through tomorrow). Mr. Tellez was born in Venezuela in 1969. His parents were psychologists, and as a child he was familiar with the environment of psychiatric hospitals. That environment is the raw material for much of his work, including the installation that makes up this show. The gallery has been filled with hundreds of toy-size trucks made from bars of soap and boxes of psychiatric medication. There is a captivating but disturbing video of patients in a Venezuelan hospital pushing a giant beach ball from one ward to the next, and finally over the institution's wall. He also has a beautiful piece in the "Queens International" at the Queens Museum, through Nov. 3 (Cotter).

* 25TH-ANNIVERSARY BENEFIT SELECTIONS EXHIBITION, Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through tomorrow). Nearly 400 drawings by artists who have previously exhibited at this valuable institution over the last 25 years create an initial impression of wondrous creative fertility. With extended looking, one starts to feel a certain leveling decorousness, but there are intriguing oddities, like Stavit Allweis's picture of a wild-eyed girl in a pool of water, a kind of surrealistic fairy painting (Johnson).

HEADLINE: DINER'S JOURNAL 

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
It takes courage to put together a menu without a steak on it, or any beef at all, for that matter. It especially takes courage to put together such an uncompromising menu at the corner of Broadway and 88th Street.
 But despite this neighborhood's reputation as a culinary wasteland (or maybe because of it), tables at Aix, Didier Virot's new restaurant, which opened just a few weeks ago, have been awfully hard to come by. 
 Aix is Take Two for Mr. Virot, formerly the executive chef at JoJo and sous-chef at Jean Georges. His first solo effort, called Virot, earned two stars in The Times in 2001 from William Grimes but was short-lived, a victim partly of an inhospitable site in the Dylan Hotel near Grand Central Terminal and of the economic slowdown. At Aix, Mr. Virot has reassembled much of his Virot menu and his Virot cast, including his pastry chef, Jenhangir Mehta. He has also scaled back prices and has adopted a more casual, easy-going atmosphere for his restaurant.
But Mr. Virot thankfully has not pandered to some preconceived notion of what this neighborhood wants. The menu pulses with complexity. He marinates tuna with cucumber and coriander before serving it with sheep's milk yogurt, and makes cannelloni with crabmeat, celery root and clams, serving it in a sweet red chili broth. Still, you don't have to think to enjoy lighter-than-air gnocchi floating on a creamy emulsion with slivers of Jerusalem artichoke for contrast, or supple, luscious foie gras crusted in pistachio, with a sweet mound of potatoes and quince.
Mr. Virot pairs fish with earthy vegetables that give the dishes pungence and body while supporting the star. Roasted sea bass has enough rich flavor to stand up to a piquant olive sauce augmented with carrots and salsify, while daurade, despite its delicate texture, matches up well with the husky flavors of radishes and yellow wax beans. And while beef is not an option, Mr. Virot offers a fine venison loin with a quince beet strudel.
Mr. Mehta is an adventurous pastry chef, who is in top form with dishes like airy licorice pannacotta and a buttery apple brioche with rosemary.
While Mr. Virot has basically stuck to his guns, he has made one concession to the neighborhood. Many of the children in attendance at dinner one recent evening were no doubt pleased to hear the waiters reciting dishes just for them: grilled chicken or penne with tomato sauce.
Aix, 2398 Broadway, at 88th Street, Manhattan, (212) 874-7400. Appetizers, $8 to $16; main courses, $14 to $28; desserts, $8.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Is Under New Scrutiny 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Credit-rating agencies, investors and bankers are voicing growing concern about the Hong Kong government's finances, citing a huge budget deficit, a stagnant economy and falling consumer prices. 
 The pessimism has begun to hurt local stocks, which slipped 0.2 percent today. And some speculators in futures markets have begun placing modest bets that Hong Kong will have to devalue its currency. Budget problems are even prompting talk of an increase in the territory's flat 15 percent tax on salaries, a tax regime beloved of conservative economists in the United States. 
 The strongest international warning so far came today from Standard & Poor's, which said it might lower Hong Kong's rating for long-term local-currency debts, now at AA-. The rating is unchanged for now, the agency said, and the rating for Hong Kong's long-term foreign-currency debt, now A+, is not at risk.
Antony Leung, Hong Kong's financial secretary and third-ranking government official, promised this afternoon that a task force would solicit the public's views on the territory's fiscal problems. "The government is determined and has plans to tackle the budget deficit," Mr. Leung said. His office said tonight that those plans would be put before a committee of the legislature on Friday.
The budget deficit is equal to 5 percent of economic output and is widening, in large part because revenues have fallen by 30 percent, hurt by a slow economy and a steep decline in property prices; land sales are an important contributor to the government's finances.
The government has four options, none palatable, to curb the deficit. One is to cut spending; it is already doing so on a limited scale, even to the point of small cuts in the wages of civil servants. But this approach risks making economic growth here -- now around 1 percent a year -- even more anemic, or even tipping the economy into recession. 
Another option is to raise taxes sharply, which might also crimp economic growth and might risk prompting more companies to leave Hong Kong, relocating elsewhere in Southern China or moving to Singapore in search of low taxes.
A third option is to step up land sales, but that may depress property prices even further, angering wealthy developers and middle-class condominium owners. 
The fourth option is to devalue the Hong Kong dollar, making exports more competitive and lowering the cost to international companies of basing their Asian operations here. But this policy would make imports like gasoline much more expensive, and might roil financial markets long used to a stable currency. 
At the present exchange rate of about 7.8 to the United States dollar, Hong Kong is the world's most expensive city to live in, even surpassing Tokyo and Osaka, according to a study released in July by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. Apartment rents are higher than in Manhattan.
But prices are falling. Hong Kong said on Tuesday that its consumer price index was 3.7 percent lower in September than a year earlier, among the most severe deflation reported worldwide this year. Still, they are not falling fast enough to make the territory competitive with nearby large cities in Southern China, where rents are about a third of the levels in Hong Kong. 
The currency-board system Hong Kong uses, in which each Hong Kong dollar in circulation is backed by foreign currency held in reserve, has kept the exchange rate pegged at a steady rate but has made it hard to use interest rate cuts to stimulate spending.
Chew Ping, the associate director for Asian sovereign debt ratings at Standard & Poor's, said that with the public opposed to either higher taxes or lower government spending, breaking the currency's peg to the American dollar may become an option. "If the fiscal position continues to deteriorate, the pressures on the peg will intensify," Mr. Chew said. 
Moody's Investors Service said in a report on Sept. 27 that devaluation could bring long-term economic benefits, but warned that there would be short-term financial problems. Moody's said its outlook on Hong Kong's ratings was stable, and it made no change today. 
Paul Coughlin, the managing director for Asian sovereign and corporate debt ratings at Standard & Poor's, said Hong Kong still had considerable financial strength, including sufficient built-up reserves to cover another five years of budget deficits at their present size. It could then borrow to cover the deficits for another four or five years and still be no deeper in debt, relative to the size of its economy, than many Western European nations, Mr. Coughlin said. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which maintains the currency peg, also has one of the world's largest hoards of foreign exchange. The Hong Kong dollar has been roughly stable against the American dollar since 1983, withstanding an assault by speculators during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, when many other countries devalued.
Some prominent economists here say Hong Kong must go on running large budget deficits to restart economic growth, while defending the currency peg. "As long as the path to a balance after five years is spelled out, that's all we need to see," Ajay Kapur, the chief Asian equities strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said.

HEADLINE: WPP Revenue Falls About 3% As Profit Outlook Worsens 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Raising the prospect of a renewed downturn in the advertising industry, the WPP Group said today that its revenue had fallen in the third quarter and that its profit outlook was worsening, not improving.
 Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, has tended to offer a gloomier outlook than his peers, and has largely been proved right, winning the respect of investors, analysts said. His frankness stands in sharp contrast to the recent muddled messages from some rivals, these analysts said. 
 The Interpublic Group of Companies, for instance, recently caught investors off guard with two pieces of bad news: Earnings would fall well below expectations for the third quarter and the full year because problems at its motor sports division were much worse than had been thought, and a restatement of earnings for the last five years would include charges almost twice as large as it led investors to expect back in August. 
Sir Martin, by contrast, has been steadily guiding analysts to lower their earnings and profits expectations, and WPP has so far avoided surprising the market. He has been saying all along that any recovery in advertising spending would probably be gradual. 
But the timing of that hoped-for recovery has remained elusive. Sir Martin says now that he does not expect it until 2004, when the American presidential election and the Olympic Games may pry open advertisers' pocketbooks.
WPP said today that business was no longer headed downward sharply, as it was in the months after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but neither was it turning robustly upward.
"Falling share prices in the summer on both sides of the Atlantic and increasing unemployment has had an impact on consumer confidence, suggesting a potential 'double-dip' recession," the company said in a statement accompanying its revenue figures today.
Frederik Kooij of J. P. Morgan Chase said many advertisers were in a wait-and-see mode. "A lot of companies are hiding behind the uncertainty of war with Iraq, and which direction the consumer is going, as a reason for not pressing the button on advertising spending," he said.
Like some of its rivals, WPP spent lavishly on acquisitions in recent years, and accumulated a lot of debt in the process -- $:1.3 billion ($2 billion) at the end of the third quarter, up from $:978 million ($1.5 billion) a year earlier. The bulk of it, $:806 million ($1.2 billion), was run up to pay for capital spending, acquisitions and bonus payments related to those acquisitions, the company said.
Exchange-rate fluctuations also hurt WPP, turning what would have been a 2.3 percent gain in total revenue into a decline of nearly 3 percent for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Revenue in North America, flat in dollar terms, fell by 6.8 percent when converted to British pounds. 
The company also said its operating profit margins would probably turn out to be smaller in the second half of the year than in the first.

Co-ops Are Trying to Refinance Without Penalties

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Like homeowners taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates to reduce their monthly payments, co-op corporations are anxious to refinance underlying mortgages on their buildings. But many co-ops face a hefty penalty if they pay off the current loan before its term expires.
 Lenders have responded by offering what are called "forward commitment/early rate lock" agreements as a way to help co-ops avoid or minimize prepayment penalties. 
 Prepayment penalties are typically either an amount equal to what the lender would lose in interest payments as a result of the prepayment or a percentage of the outstanding principal of the mortgage. 
The forward commitments, which result in a small increase in the interest rate for the loan, generally run for 2 to 10 months but could stretch to one year. Industry professionals said the number of co-ops using such commitments was growing and included 860 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, with 156 apartments, and Park City Estates, a five-building complex of 1,049 apartments on 98th Street in Rego Park, Queens.
Last February the National Cooperative Bank began offering forward commitments of up to six months, said Edward Howe, senior vice president at the bank's Manhattan office. The bank has used forward commitments on a dozen loans, including a $24.5 million mortgage to Park City Estates.
Gregg Winter, president of Winter & Company Commercial Real Estate Finance, a Manhattan mortgage brokerage firm, said that for some co-ops the forward commitment could dovetail with the expiration of the current loan, eliminating the prepayment penalty. For others it could delay the closing to a point in the existing loan when the prepayment penalty could either be paid or reduced, said Mr. Winter, whose firm has done 10 such deals including the one at 860 Fifth Avenue.
Borrowers pay a premium to lock in the current low rate for several months. It amounts to an interest rate increase of two to five basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point) for each month of the extension.
For example, Mr. Winter said, a co-op that locked in a 5.6 percent rate and delayed the closing for 10 months could get the first four months free and then be charged 5 basis points a month for the remaining 6 months.
Borrowers must also pay a deposit of 2 to 3 percent of the loan, which is refunded when the loan closes and forfeited if it does not close.
Mr. Howe said that some banks, including NCB, offer to add the prepayment fee to the principal of the new loan. Other strategies available to borrowers include paying the forward commitment premium as a one-time fee, rather than increasing the mortgage rate, and negotiating a more lenient prepayment penalty on their new loan.
He said that his bank worked with Park City Estates to lock in a rate of 5.55 percent in August on a 10-year, $24.5 million fixed-rate mortgage with an additional $3 million line of credit, and that it was delaying the closing until December. That is when the prohibition lifts for the co-op to repay its old $13 million mortgage, which carried a 7.9 percent rate. The co-op also borrowed $4 million as an additional line of credit.
Robert I. Oziel, the lawyer for Park City Estates Tenants Corporation, said that in refinancing, the co-op would pay a $600,000 prepayment fee that would be paid off in 18 months because of the new loan's reduced interest rate. The co-op's monthly mortgage payments will be $120,622, an increase of $7,800, which Mr. Oziel said was offset by the $7.5 million more the co-op will receive and use to improve the complex and to invest in high-yield securities.
Mr. Winter said that in the case of 860 Fifth Avenue the co-op took a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage in June for $6.7 million, locking in a 5.95 percent interest rate, but delayed the closing for four months until last Friday. It replaced the co-op's existing $4.6 million loan, which had a 7.15 percent interest rate and would not expire until December 2003.
Les Tanner, the chairman of the board at 860 Fifth Avenue, said the co-op not only got the lower interest rate and borrowed additional money for ongoing capital improvements, but also reduced its annual mortgage payments by $16,000 to $404,000 as well as its prepayment penalty by $50,000, to $286,508. And it was done without raising residents' monthly maintenance cost, Mr. Tanner said, adding that, "it was a win-win."

Shares Slump as Doubts About the Recent Rally Increase

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell for a second day in three yesterday amid concern that gains made in the last two weeks have driven prices higher than justified by the outlook for corporate profit growth.
 Viacom and International Paper dropped as analysts advised investors to sell shares. 
 Duke Energy slipped after saying earnings might be lower next year. 
"We've actually heard some companies that have knocked down fourth-quarter earnings and are cautious," said Matt Brown, who helps oversee $18 billion at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.64 points, or 1.5 percent, to 882.50, with Household International recording the biggest loss. Household International fell $3.62, or 14 percent, to $22.83, on concern that it may face higher borrowing costs.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 176.93 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 8,317.34. Twenty-seven of its 30 components declined. The Nasdaq composite index shed 21.52 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,298.71.
Stocks extended declines during the afternoon after a West Virginia jury found the Union Carbide unit of Dow Chemical responsible in thousands of asbestos-related deaths and illnesses. Other companies with potential asbestos liability, like 3M and Georgia-Pacific, also fell.
"Once we started falling, no one wanted to get in the way," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company in Boston. "The asbestos situation doesn't help."
Five stocks fell for every four that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, while nine declined for every eight that advanced on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Some 1.70 billion shares traded on the Big Board, 13 percent more than the three-month daily average.
Viacom, owner of the CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon television networks, dropped $2.86, to $44.32. Richard Bilotti, a Morgan Stanley analyst, lowered the stock to underweight from equal weight, saying advertising revenue will not grow more than 7 percent in 2003. 
The company also has exposure to asbestos lawsuits through CBS, which was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995. Viacom spent $21 million in litigation claims in 2001.
Shares of Omnicom Group slid $4.27, to $59.13, after Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock. 
International Paper declined 90 cents, to $36.84. A Prudential Securities analyst, John Tumazos, expects the company to announce cost reductions to offset soft demand, lower-than-anticipated selling prices and $100 million in pension expenses. He lowered his recommendation to sell from hold.
Duke Energy shed $1.06, to $19.08. The company said earnings in the third quarter plunged 71 percent as power prices tumbled and energy trading slumped. The company said profit might fall in 2003.
Dow Chemical dropped $2.57, to $24.97. The asbestos verdict could expose the company to millions of dollars in punitive damages. Dow said it added $64 million in reserves for lawsuits in the third quarter, bringing the total to $344 million.
3M, which has settled some 200,000 lawsuits related to asbestos over the last 20 years, slid $3.63, to $125.73. Georgia-Pacific, which has costs of $132 million this year from lawsuits related to asbestos, lost 85 cents, to $11.65.
AOL Time Warner, Tyco International and Bristol-Myers Squibb gained after restating quarterly results. AOL Time Warner rose $1.02, to $14.55. Tyco gained $1.55, to $15.49. Bristol-Myers rose 38 cents, to $24.17.
 Treasury bond prices rose. The 10-year note climbed 27/32, to a price of 102 1/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.12 percent from 4.23 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond jumped 14/32, to 104 11/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.08 percent from 5.16 percent.

HEADLINE: Small Card, Big Spender 

BYLINE:  By Thomas Hine; Thomas Hine is the author of the forthcoming "I Want That! How We All Became Shoppers."

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Inside your wallet or deep in your handbag, your credit cards are at war with one another.
 The moment of truth comes at the moment of purchase, when you're about to meet your needs, realize your desires and jump-start a sputtering economy. Often there is a moment of fumbling about as you shuffle through a deck of identically sized plastic cards, grabbing the first one, regardless of its balance or interest rate. 
 Of course, the credit card companies have only themselves to blame for these crowded wallets; for years they have deluged consumers almost daily with solicitations and offers of new cards. Now, not surprisingly, the companies have decided to introduce new kinds of cards that seek to stand out from the pack. 
Some of the new cards are small and ready for your key chain, like the new half-sized Bank of America Visa. Others are kidney shaped with a little case of their own, like the latest Discover card. Or, like the Discover Clear Platinum card, they are normal size but translucent and bumpy. Like the original Coca-Cola bottle, which was designed to be recognizable purely by touch, these are products for shoppers who are groping in the dark.
All these new designs indicate that the credit industry wants us to think about spending in a new way. Until only a few years ago, a credit card was a credential, something to be guarded and kept secure. One still sees this heritage in the design of the standard green American Express Card, which has the secure look of currency or a stock certificate. Yet the business end of a credit card has long since ceased to be the front, with its raised letters and numbers, but the back, with its magnetic strip filled with information.
Nowadays credit cards are best understood as part of a gesture. You don't proffer it to a person to approve your purchase. You swipe it through a machine to process the sale. The process reflects the way people want to shop: faster and more aggressively. Ubiquitous computer technology makes it easier.
So after decades of trying to convince us that their plastic is gold, platinum or titanium, credit card issuers are now positioning their products as embodiments of fun and freedom. Cards are even migrating to the key chain, where the action is.
One that's already there is the Mobil Speedpass, introduced in 1997. It uses a small radio transponder to communicate with an electronic system located in the gasoline pump; wave the pass near the pump and the cost of the gas is magically deducted from your checking account or added to your credit card bill. Supermarket discount cards, also usually attached to a key chain, have bar codes that when passed over scanners qualify shoppers for discounts and allow the supermarkets to track purchasing patterns.
Key-chain credit cards are the obvious next step. The fight among card issuers for wallet space promises to be like the fight among toothpaste makers for supermarket shelf space. The brand wars have moved from the aisles of the grocery store to our pockets and purses.
If one takes the long view -- the very long view -- these new cards are part of a trend to make purchasing less portentous and more routine. The introduction of low-value coins late in the Middle Ages encouraged commerce by making it possible for many more people to purchase many more things. The introduction of ready-to-wear clothing a century and a half ago freed shoppers' imaginations -- and their spending. Credit and charge cards are only about half a century old; the first credit card, Diners Club, was issued in 1950.
Since then credit cards have become ubiquitous, allowing just about anyone to buy just about anything just about anywhere. Especially in the current climate, free-spending consumers are seen as heroes, the basis of almost all hopes for economic recovery. And while we may have vague misgivings about what we'll do when the bills arrive, in the meantime we embrace every innovation that lets us shop as fast as we can.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Airport-Related Business in New York Hit Hard by 9/11, With 10,000 Jobs Lost 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Since the World Trade Center attacks, La Guardia and Kennedy Airports have suffered larger economic losses than most other major hub airports in the country, a new study has found.
 Those losses permeate almost every aspect of the two airports' business, from cargo and passenger traffic to hotel vacancies, and have caused the elimination of 16.5 percent of all airport-related jobs in the city since September 2001 -- almost 10,000 jobs. That is by far the largest percentage loss of any industry in the city, including the securities industry, which has lost 9 percent of its jobs since then. 
 The study, to be released next week by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonpartisan policy research group, demonstrates just how economically powerful the airports are and how widely blows to their business are felt. Almost 1,000 jobs disappeared, for example, in the city's trucking and warehouse industries from August 2001 to August of this year, in large part because those companies are heavily dependent on the airports. 
According to the Queens County Economic Development Corporation, 28 percent of all unemployment claims in the city that were directly related to the terrorist attack have come from Queens residents, many of those from airport-related layoffs.
Jonathan Bowles, the chief researcher for the center, said that part of the explanation of the downturn in airport business was the same nationwide and even worldwide: the sagging economy, security concerns, a steep drop in business travel. He added that other factors, like poor access to Kennedy and La Guardia and low wages paid to their workers, had plagued the two airports long before Sept. 11 and significantly hurt their ability to bounce back over the last year.
"If we don't start addressing these issues in the long term," Mr. Bowles said, "then the city is going to lose business, and it's going to lose more jobs."
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, commercial operations at Kennedy declined 17.7 percent from October 2001 through July of this year. Only three other major hub airports did worse: Boston Logan, Los Angeles International and Ronald Reagan Washington National, which was shut completely from Sept. 11 until early October 2001, the longest of any airport.
Six hubs performed worse than La Guardia, which lost 15.5 percent of its business during the 10 months after the attack, the study found.
Mr. Bowles said that although some evidence suggested that business at the city's two airports has begun to pick up slowly along with the rest of the economy, their performance after Sept. 11 showed that they were still poorly positioned to compete with other big airports -- particularly the closest one, Newark Liberty International Airport -- for what experts believe will be significant growth in airport business over the next decade.
Newark is 15 miles from Midtown, slightly less than the 16 miles to Kennedy, but it "is almost universally perceived" as easier to reach, the study notes. This partly explains, for example, why a majority of the overnight delivery business has shifted from Kennedy to Newark over the past 10 to 15 years.
Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which controls the three airports, said he would not comment directly on the study, but he emphasized that the authority has worked for a long time on the airports' problems. The authority is committing more than $9 billion to Kennedy to add, among other things, millions more square feet of cargo space and $1.9 billion to build the AirTrain to link the airport to the subway and commuter rail lines.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall a Bit More Than Expected 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, a report released today by the Labor Department showed, indicating that the economy might be growing enough to limit a rise in unemployment.
 "We've gone from a deteriorating labor market to one that is treading water, but we still haven't gone to one that is creating a lot of new jobs," said Tim McGee, chief economist at the U.S. Trust Corporation in New York, a unit of Charles Schwab. 
 Unemployment applications declined 25,000, to 389,000, for the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department reported. The decline may have been exaggerated by statistical adjustments for the Columbus Day holiday on Oct. 14, which came later than in recent years, the agency said.
Claims this month have averaged 397,000 a week, down from the September average of 425,000. The number of people collecting benefits in the week ended Oct. 12 was the lowest in six weeks, and the insured unemployment rate, which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 2.8 percent in the week ended Oct. 12 from 2.9 percent the previous week.
Economists had expected claims to fall to 405,000 last week from a previously reported 411,000 a week earlier, based on the median of 32 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.

HEADLINE: Oil Companies' Results Are Hurt By Low Margins in Some Units 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Several major petroleum companies said today that their third-quarter results had been hurt by lower profit margins in their refining and marketing businesses. 
 The Marathon Oil Corporation's profit in the July-September period was nearly halved at $87 million, while Sunoco reported a third-quarter loss of $9 million. 
 ConocoPhillips, the nation's third-largest integrated oil and gas company, said its $116 million loss was largely a result of one-time charges related to the August merger of Conoco and Phillips. 
But with demand for refined products increasing and refining margins beginning to improve, results should be better in the fourth quarter, said Fadel Gheit, a Fahnestock & Company petroleum analyst. 
"I think the worst is over," he said. "Demand is picking up for seasonal reasons and the economy is hopefully picking up. Industry conditions are not so great, but they're improving." 
The threat of war with Iraq adds uncertainty to the picture, Mr. Gheit said. 
ConocoPhillips said $572 million in one-time charges led to the quarterly loss of 24 cents a share. Excluding those charges, the Houston-based company reported earnings of $456 million, or 94 cents a share, meeting the expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Comparisons with the year-earlier period were not relevant because of the merger of the two companies. 
ConocoPhillips said revenue was $15.7 billion, compared with $6 billion a year ago. 
Marathon's third-quarter profit was equivalent to 28 cents a share. That compared with $170 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $8.5 billion, up from $8.3 billion a year ago. 
Philadelphia-based Sunoco Inc. reported a loss of $9 million in the third quarter, or 12 cents a share, far below analyst expectations of 40 cents a share. Sunoco earned $92 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue for Sunoco, which has to buy crude because it has no exploration or production division, was $3.8 billion for the quarter, up from $3.6 billion in July-September last year.

An Economy Out of Whack Has a Friend

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
The news media's interest in Ms. Grubman was so high -- you may judge for yourself how much things have changed since 9/11 -- that the Suffolk County sheriff threw open his jail the other day to reporters and photographers. On the Lizzie Cell Tour, they got to see such fascinating items as the shower and toilet she will use and the baggy uniform she will wear for the next two months.
 Later, a Grubman spokesman all but held his nose in discussing this spectacle. But maybe the Suffolk officials hit on something worth imitating in New York. Why not conduct tours of places that are normally off-limits to the public? This would be done for a fee, substantial but not exorbitant, that would go to the municipal treasury. It obviously needs every dollar it can find. 
 Surely, there is no shortage of New Yorkers and out-of-towners willing to pay a reasonable sum to look around Rikers Island or to see the detention facility next to the Criminal Courts Building, the one commonly known as the Tombs.
Tourists could be charged separately to stroll the "bridge of sighs," the midair walkway connecting the courthouse and the jail. The way things are going, this may prove to be the only bridge toll Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will get away with. For an extra dollar or two, visitors could even feel what it is like to be handcuffed. It might be billed as the Law and Order Tour, to give it a show biz flourish.
The concept could then be extended.
Ever since the mayor put his new Department of Education in the Tweed Courthouse, that sumptuous building has essentially, and unreasonably, been closed to the public. How about letting in paying visitors, perhaps while the bureaucrats are out to lunch (no pun intended)?
In fact, Mr. Bloomberg could contribute selflessly to the cause by permitting tours of his East Side town house. Wouldn't you want to see how a billionaire lives? For an extra charge, the mayor could offer his services as a guide now and then. Never on weekends, to be sure, because then we might find out if he is in town, and that is supposed to be the greatest secret since the Manhattan Project. But if Fiorello La Guardia could read the funny papers, can't this mayor lead a tour?
No one suggests that hoards of cash can be produced this way. But the city's fiscal distress is so severe that officials may be forced to seize upon any revenue source in sight, no matter how unorthodox. Since taxes are a dirty word, especially on the eve of the election of a governor, perhaps the city should consider an array of new fees. "Fees" doesn't seem to scare politicians as easily as "taxes."
ONE idea that could yield a good deal of money is an annual parking fee for all vehicles registered in the five boroughs. As of last year, there were slightly more than two million, according to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles.
It has long been a mystery, to me anyway, why the automobile is the one piece of personal property that may be left on the street, and without charge except at parking meters. At home, we have no room for an old chest of drawers. To suggest that we be allowed to park it curbside outside our building would be to invite ridicule. Make that a car, though, and no one has a problem.
A flat parking fee of perhaps $50 a year per vehicle, or less than a dollar a week, would raise more than $100 million while hardly putting a great strain on owners. That sum is far from enough to close the mayor's budget gap. But it's a start.
So is a surcharge on chewing gum, which is a major cause of all those hideous splotches that carpet New York sidewalks. Or a substantially higher fine for littering. Or a special charge on law firms and financial companies that are permitted to clog city streets with lines of limousines waiting for hours outside their doors. Or fees for sidewalk sketch artists and similar entrepreneurs taking up precious public space without paying for the privilege.
The list of possible charges could go on, but you get the idea. And one day, when the city is returned to fiscal well-being, it can honor the person who inspired these innovations by declaring Lizzie Grubman Day.
It could be celebrated with a motorcade of sport utility vehicles -- driven in reverse, of course.

HEADLINE: A Fight Over Farms Ends, Opening Way to Wider Europe 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
A rift between France and Germany over aid to farmers was resolved today, allowing the leaders of the European Union to begin talks on integrating 10 new countries into their club by 2004.
 The project of enlarging their world eastward -- the "big bang," as it is called here -- will create an economic and political entity with the third largest population in the world after China and India, and larger than the United States, Canada and Mexico combined. 
 European leaders and European Union officials congratulated themselves on the progress they have made so far and on the historic importance of the moment.
"This is much more than enlargement," Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign affairs representative, said in an interview. "This is the reconciliation of Europe, where 100 million citizens will become part of the institutions of one European Union." 
The European Union is also in the midst of negotiations chaired by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president, to draft a new Constitution for the new Europe. At one point he even suggested a name for it: the United States of Europe.
The cost of expansion, at $42 billion over three years, is considered relatively inexpensive -- less than half of the European Union's current annual budget. But there is intense wrangling over who will pay what. And the latest European Union survey of its citizenry showed that only a slight majority support expansion.
The entry of the 10, most of them formerly Communist countries with dysfunctional economies, will further strain western European governments now struggling with the slowest economic growth in a decade. Many member countries are reluctant to finance the vast infrastructure projects that are needed in Central and Eastern Europe. Most contentious was the farm support program, which consumes almost half the European Union's budget.
There had been dire warnings that the farm issue could derail the summit meeting.
Denmark, which currently holds the six-month-long presidency of the European Union, had threatened to keep the 15 heads of state and government in Brussels for as long as it took to hammer out an agreement. "There is no reason to hide that this will be a very difficult summit," Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark told Reuters.
But the difficult issue was finessed rather easily after President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany unexpectedly reached an agreement on payments to farmers, clearing the way for final negotiations on the European Union's move to the east.
Essentially, France, which receives more aid for its farmers than any other member, agreed that beginning in 2007, the European Union will pay French farmers progressively less in direct aid. The money that would have gone to French farmers will instead finance a phasing-in of payments to farmers in the new member states.
France and Germany agreed to give new members 25 percent of the farm aid that the other 15 receive, beginning in 2004 and increasing by increments of five percentage points every year. Overall farm spending, would be capped at 2007 levels, adjusted for inflation. In explaining the French concession, France's foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin stressed that the decision had been made to show the "solidarity" and "responsibility" of Europe.
As he left the meeting with Mr. Schroder, Mr. Chirac stressed to reporters that budget controls should not be restricted to agriculture. France is in favor of "putting a ceiling on, stabilizing agriculture spending after 2006," Mr. Chirac told journalists. "There's a common will to control spending in all areas, not only in agriculture." Earlier this week, Mr. Chirac demanded that Britain renegotiate a multibillion dollar "rebate" that it receives from the European Union every year. The "rebate" was secured in 1984 by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who argued that Britain paid far more into the European Union budget than it got back in subsidies.
Mr. Chirac met separately with Britain's current prime minister, Tony Blair, before the full meeting formally opened this evening. British officials have said repeatedly that the rebate is "not negotiable," at least until the next budget negotiations four years from now.
Apart from disputes over financing, a number of political issues are clouding the summit meeting. One is the exclusion of Turkey from the list of new members, which includes Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The European Union position is that Turkey, the only Muslim candidate for membership, needs to improve its human rights record and make other political reforms before negotiations can begin. At a news conference today, Mr. Rasmussen praised Turkey for laws adopted in August to abolish the death penalty in peacetime, permit greater freedom of expression and increasing the rights of ethnic Kurds. But he said Turkey now has to put those reforms into effect.
Turkey will receive a date for its admission into the European Union "if and when Turkey fulfills the criteria," Mr. Rasmussen said. "It is up to Turkey itself." Asked whether it was appropriate for the United States to pressure the European Union to admit Turkey, Mr. Rasmussen said, "I have not registered any pressure from the United States."
The United States is displeased that the European Union has not set a date for Turkey, a crucial NATO ally that shares borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria.
"Turkey is not ready," Mr. Solana said. "The United States must understand that putting Turkey into the European Union is not like putting Mexico into a free trade agreement. We treat Turkey far better than you treat Mexico."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE VIEW FROM ASIA; 
U.S. and Its Asian Partners Strain to Form United Stand on North Korea

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials struggled today to develop a common strategy on North Korea with Asian partners amid increasing signs of criticism by South Korea, Japan and China that Washington was being too confrontational in its approach.
 There were also indications today of disagreements within the Bush administration over whether to declare as "dead" the 1994 accord in which North Korea promised to stop building nuclear weapons in return for economic benefits from the United States, South Korea and Japan. 
 Last week, the United States disclosed that North Korea had acknowledged the existence of a program to develop highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon, and that the North Korean government considered the 1994 agreement "nullified."
Administration officials later said that the United States would scrap the entire agreement, negotiated during the administration of President Bill Clinton, but that this would not be acknowledged publicly. 
These comments set off alarms in Japan, China and South Korea, where officials said the 1994 framework should be preserved and renegotiated to take North Korean concerns into consideration. They called on the United States to continue to negotiate with North Korea over its demands, which include a request that Washington promise not to use nuclear weapons against it.
Today, a senior State Department official, briefing reporters here, said that although Washington would not enter into negotiations with North Korea until it took action to dismantle its nuclear facilities, contacts of a lesser sort were not being ruled out. He also did not rule out more substantive talks between other countries and North Korea, which have been continuing.
"We're in a mode of listening to what the South Koreans say," the official said. "It's important not to assume that there are polar positions."
 The North Korean official news agency reported Friday that a Foreign Ministry official who was not identified said the country was seeking a non-aggression agreement with the United States, long an aim of the North, as a solution for the nuclear issue. 
The United States has said that at least one part of the 1994 agreement -- the presence of international inspectors at a plutonium plant where nuclear weapons were being made before the accord was signed -- must remain in force.
But today the State Department official asserted that no decision had been made on whether other parts of the agreement should also be kept alive, including the next scheduled shipment of fuel oil to North Korea by the United States, which Washington had made a part of the deal. A shipment is due later this year.
The official said he and others were careful to avoid what he called "that four-letter word," by which he meant "dead" -- the term used by others to apply to the 1994 accord.
On the other hand, he said the Bush administration had no interest in negotiating yet another agreement with North Korea similar to the 1994 pact, now that it has proven it would not live up to the previous one. "We bought that horse one time before," he said.
Nonetheless, the official's comments appeared to be intended to assuage the concerns in Asia, especially in South Korea, that the tough talk in Washington was cutting off all avenues to ending the stalemate with North Korea peacefully. Japan and South Korea regard military action against North Korea as unrealistic, since North Korea has a million troops on its border with South Korea and could easily retaliate against South Korea with artillery, rockets and missiles.
The comments from administration officials came as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met today with the South Korean foreign minister, Choi Sung Hong, and other representatives of 19 Asian and Pacific nations, plus Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Preparations are also under way for a meeting on Friday between President Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China. White House officials say North Korea will be at the top of the agenda for that meeting.
The official said today that there were differences between the United States, South Korea and Japan about how to approach North Korea. Although the Chinese are reported to favor negotiating with North Korea, the official said the Chinese were also concerned about the dangers of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
President Bush is expected to arrive at this Baja California resort on Saturday, about the same time that a hurricane is expected to hit the region, though probably not near here.
In another sign of disagreement between South Korea and the United States, a top South Korean cabinet official who had his own contacts with North Korea said this week that James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, had mischaracterized North Korea's response when he said North Korea viewed the 1994 agreement as "nullified." In fact, said the South Korean official, Jeong Se Hyun, North Korea did not go quite that far.
Today, Mr. Kelly said he had not seen Mr. Jeong's report. But he said his recollection of North Korea's position on nullifying the accord was "the full fidelity version" of what had been said.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Group Is Formed to Oppose the Expansion of Casino Gambling 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
With support from state and municipal officials, regional business groups, church leaders and residents, a coalition of casino opponents announced today that they had formed a statewide nonprofit group to fight the expansion of casino gambling.
 In a news conference at the Capitol attended by several state lawmakers and Connecticut's attorney general, the newly formed Connecticut Alliance Against Casino Expansion announced that its primary goal was to prevent the construction of a third casino in the state. 
 The group's president, Jeff Benedict, said there was an immediate need to organize before more Indian groups in Connecticut were given the federal recognition they need to move ahead with casino projects.
"State laws can be enacted that can make casinos very unprofitable and unwelcome here," said Mr. Benedict, a lawyer, author and recent candidate for Congress who ran on an anti-Indian-casino platform in the state's Second District. "Our job is to work with the governor and the Legislature to form that policy." 
That eastern Connecticut district includes the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans, each of which operates a hugely successful casino. Together, they produce billions of dollars in annual revenue, including millions for the state in taxes. 
The impetus for the anti-casino coalition quickly formed this summer, after a third Connecticut tribe, the Eastern Pequots of North Stonington, won federal recognition in June. Recognition by the federal government gives tribes the sovereign status of a foreign government and allows them to build casinos in states where gambling is legal. 
Several other tribes, in Bridgeport, Kent and other parts of western Connecticut, also have petitions for recognition pending before the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the United States Department of the Interior. The Eastern Pequots have been unable to move ahead with their casino plans because of a lawsuit filed by Attorney General Richard Blumenthal on behalf of the state, seeking to cancel the bureau's decision to bestow recognition.
Richard Velkey, chief of the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, which expects to receive a preliminary decision on federal recognition next month, said the new coalition was treating tribes unfairly for its own special interests. "They speak as though they're for the people, and yet the people in Bridgeport were for a casino," he said. "If a manufacturer would come into the state of Connecticut and bring in 15,000 jobs, would these people be up in arms?"
The anti-casino group said it would try to repeal the state's "Las Vegas nights" law, which allows church bingo and raffles and provided the legal precedent for the Mashantucket and Mohegan tribes to open casinos. The group said it had raised $75,000 in the last few weeks.
"We are now poised to take control of gambling policy in Connecticut and to take the initiative away from the moneyed interests who have backed so-called tribes pushing casino expansion," said State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich.
Nicholas H. Mullane II, North Stonington's first selectman, said the new group would help make people more aware of the negative social and economic impact of casinos. "They take away from a lot of the other commercial endeavors in the state of Connecticut," Mr. Mullane said. "It's a regressive form of business that really has no redeeming value."
Though other anti-gambling and anti-casino groups have been around for years, members of the coalition said theirs was the only statewide group specifically opposed to more casino gambling. 
Connecticut is one of many states where local communities have confronted the prospect of casino gambling. In Maine, where casino gambling is illegal, nine towns are holding referendums on whether to support the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot Indian tribes' efforts to change the law and build a $500 million casino. The State Legislature will probably also take up the issue next year. 
In Iowa, 10 counties, including Dubuque on the Mississippi River, are holding casino referendums. Many northern California communities are also struggling with decisions on proposed casino plans.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Is Backing Another Map For Council 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
A day after a government commission released its first draft of a new map of City Council districts, an alternate plan favored by the Bloomberg administration surfaced.
 The existence of the second plan suggested that the often-competing agendas of the ethnic groups, community representatives, voting rights advocates and elected officials with something to lose or gain in redistricting would not be easily resolved. 
 Commission officials have repeatedly emphasized that the plan released on Wednesday, a proposal for new Council district boundaries to reflect the population shifts of the last decade, is very much a work in progress. Indeed, there had been discussion of releasing both the official plan and the alternate for public review and comment, but officials ultimately decided to release only one. 
"The commission has reviewed numerous alternatives, including plans vetted by individuals and outside organizations," said Richard C. Wager, communciations director for the commission. "The plan put forward by the commission is a culmination of these submissions as well as the determinations of the individual commissioners. And we feel as a commission that this is the fairest proposal of changes to put out at this time."
But the commission's plan is really a Council plan, some officials said, intended to keep incumbents in office. In that plan, an official who has reviewed both proposals said, "No one's in trouble."
The alternate plan for the city's 51 Council districts is in some ways more reflective of the population shifts that have occurred in the city's neighborhoods, said officials who have seen it. 
Both plans propose 29 districts with nonwhite majorities, but the administration's version would place a larger group of Asian residents within a mixed Asian-Latino district in Brooklyn, in an effort to strengthen Asian political influence there, the officials said. They said the plan would consolidate more of the Park Slope neighborhood, now split among districts, into one, which some think would strengthen the influence of that neighborhood's gay and lesbian community. And it would create an additional district with a majority Hispanic population in Queens.
Some advocates would tend to agree with a need for more Hispanic-majority districts. According to an analysis prepared by Angelo Falcon, senior policy executive of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Districting Commission's proposed plan would decrease the number of districts with a Hispanic majority, despite the large increase in the Hispanic population over the last decade.
"Latinos are the fastest growing part of the city's population, so for most people it's logical that there be more Latino districts," Mr. Falcon said. "To see the population grow and have the city say that there will be fewer districts is very discouraging. It's basically like saying to Latino voters that your vote doesn't count as much as that of others."
In addition, Mr. Falcon charged, the plan appears to manipulate the size of the districts in a way that dilutes the Hispanic vote. The charter allows a 10 percent deviation from the ideal population for a district, in this case 157,025 people. That means the combined deviation of the smallest district and the largest must be no more than 10 percent from the ideal. According to Mr. Falcon's analysis, the average population for Hispanic districts was 159,436, above the ideal, while the average population for districts with a majority of white or black residents were both below the ideal.
"By having larger districts, the effectiveness of the average Latino voter is significantly diluted compared to smaller white districts, whose votes would count for more," Mr. Falcon wrote in his report.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: GAPS IN SECURITY; 
Report Finds U.S. Unprepared for Next Terrorist Attack

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Despite months of preparations and the spending of millions of dollars, the United States remains extremely vulnerable to a major terrorist attack, particularly at its seaports, power plants and oil refineries, a panel of national security experts has concluded.
 The panel, in a report to be released on Friday, contends that local and state police officials still have little access to intelligence on terrorism suspects, that only a tiny fraction of ships and containers entering American ports are inspected and that most emergency workers are ill equipped to handle biological and chemical attacks. 
 "A year after 9/11, America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil," says the report, which was sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. "In all likelihood, the next attack will result in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to our lives and economy. 
"The need for immediate action is made more urgent by the prospect of the United States going to war with Iraq and the possibility Saddam Hussein might threaten the use of weapons of mass destruction in America."
The panel includes several members from the United States Commission on National Security -- including its co-chairmen, former Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman -- and its dire warnings reprise some of the conclusions of that earlier group. 
In March 2001 the commission released a report predicting that a major terrorist attack on American soil was likely and that the country was unprepared to respond.
"We don't blame anyone for this, because it takes a long time to turn a country like this around," Mr. Rudman said in an interview. "But this involves large amounts of money and many locales. And everyone has to be on the same page. You can't assume that because the president signs a bill in the Rose Garden, everything will be fixed."
Other members of the current group included two former secretaries of state, George P. Schultz and Warren M. Christopher; two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe, retired, and Gen. John W. Vessey, retired; a former F.B.I. director, William H. Webster; and the president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Harold E. Varmus.
The report contends that "in virtually every major city and county in the United States," police, fire and other emergency workers lack equipment needed to communicate during an emergency -- a problem that plagued New York City emergency workers after the attack on the World Trade Center.
The panel also found that most local police and fire departments did not have chemical protection gear, portable detection equipment for chemical, biological or nuclear agents or adequate training programs for dealing with such attacks. Local police departments also do not have access to terrorist watch lists provided by the State Department to immigration and consular officials, the panel found. As a result, "The cops on the beat are effectively operating deaf, dumb and blind," and "known terrorists will be free to move about to plan and execute their attacks," the report contends.
The report also focuses heavily on the vulnerability of America's seaports, asserting that the intensive efforts to improve airport and air cargo security in the wake of last year's attacks have overshadowed the potential for attacks through shipping containers, boats and container trucks.
Ninety-five percent of the trade from outside North America to the United States moves by sea, the report says, yet vulnerability studies for the nation's 50 largest ports are still years from being completed. A catastrophic attack at one of those ports could shut down American trade and cripple a large portion of the nation's economy, it concludes.
"If an explosive device was loaded in a container and set off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in U.S. ports each day," the report says. "A three- to four-week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container industry to its knees."
The report recommends establishing 24-hour operations centers in every state to link local and federal law enforcement agencies; developing global standards for security at loading centers for containers; strengthening security at oil refineries and power plants; and increasing federal spending to help local governments buy equipment and improve training.
"The federal government will have to help," Mr. Rudman said. "It's going to take a fair amount of money."

WITH PROFIT DOWN 71%, DUKE ENERGY TO CUT 1,900 JOBS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Duke Energy said yesterday that its third-quarter profit plunged 71 percent because of weakness in the economy, forcing it to cut 1,500 regular positions and 400 contract workers. Duke's chief executive, Richard B. Priory, said the move would save Duke about $100 million a year. The company, based in Charlotte, N.C., said net income for the third quarter was $230 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $796 million, or $1.01 a share, in 2001. Revenue fell to $4.21 billion, down from $4.78 billion a year earlier. Duke also said it had been subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and by a federal grand jury about its energy trading activities. The company said it was cooperating with all of the governmental agencies.

HEADLINE: Lower Medicare Payouts Concern Bush Officials 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials say they have become deeply concerned that a cut in Medicare payments to doctors, to be announced next week, will prompt many doctors to limit their participation in the program, reducing access to health care for the elderly.
 Medicare payments to doctors were cut 5.4 percent in January, and Medicare officials said that next week they expected to announce a further cut of 4.4 percent, effective on Jan. 1. 
 Asked to describe the likely effects, Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Medicare program, said: "You'll have mad doctors. There will be access problems, and seniors will feel it." 
The cuts result from a formula specified in the Medicare law. The Bush administration says it has no discretion to halt the cuts, a contention disputed by doctors and by some influential lawmakers. 
In March, doctors in a dozen states said, in interviews with The New York Times, that they were refusing to take new Medicare patients because Medicare was paying them too little to cover their costs. A second cut will accelerate the trend, doctors said this week.
Many private insurers link their payments to the Medicare fee schedule, compounding the effects of any cut in Medicare reimbursement.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said this week that he and Mr. Scully were "very concerned" about the impending cut.
Administration officials said President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., and his senior political adviser, Karl Rove, had taken an interest in the cut, in part because the administration did not want to alienate doctors or the elderly two weeks before Election Day. Democratic candidates are always hunting for evidence to back their argument that Republicans want to cut Medicare.
Dr. Harold M. Sokol, 46, a lung specialist in Albany, said: "My rent, my malpractice insurance premiums, my nurses' wages -- indeed, all our expenses -- have gone up, but Medicare payments are going down. How can we make ends meet? Who will want to do this job? It will be harder for Medicare patients to find physicians willing to treat them."
Doctors fault Congress and the administration. The cuts stem from a formula adopted by Congress in 1997. In his budget request in February, Mr. Bush assumed that the cuts would take effect and did not try to halt them. Congress has considered several bills to increase doctors' fees, but it adjourned last week without passing any of the legislation. Chances for action in a lame-duck session are uncertain.
Proposals to aid doctors have bogged down for three reasons:
*Consumer advocates and some lawmakers insist that before Congress increases Medicare payments to doctors, it must help Medicare beneficiaries struggling with the high costs of prescription drugs. Congress cannot agree on how to provide drug benefits.
*Hospitals, nursing homes and health maintenance organizations say they too face severe financial problems and should get higher Medicare payments if Congress increases payments to doctors. That would significantly raise the cost of any legislation.
*A dispute is raging over whether the Bush administration can unilaterally postpone the cuts in payments to doctors, without action by Congress.
Since March, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has repeatedly urged Mr. Scully to increase payments to doctors, to correct "technical errors" in the payment formula. Some White House officials have made similar suggestions.
But Secretary Thompson said, "We don't have the statutory authority" to avoid the cut planned for next year.
In an interview this week, Mr. Scully said: "Medicare's physician fee schedule has a glitch in it. It's clearly broken, and it needs to be fixed. We've scoured the earth to find a lawyer who says we have the authority to fix it administratively, but the lawyers cannot find a way. This question has been examined at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the White House counsel's office."
Robert B. Doherty, senior vice president of the American College of Physicians, which represents doctors specializing in internal medicine, said: "We're heading toward a collapse. If Congress does not establish a predictable, reliable method to update Medicare payments to keep pace with inflation, there won't be enough doctors willing to accept large numbers of Medicare patients."
In the last two years, health care providers have spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying Congress to increase their Medicare payments. Lawmakers say doctors and home care agencies appear to have the strongest case because Congress has actually cut their payments, not just slowed the rate of growth.
Medicare uses a fee schedule to pay doctors. The fee schedule specifies payments for more than 7,000 services ranging from routine office visits to complex surgical procedures. Payments are updated each year, using a formula that allows total spending to rise with Medicare enrollment and economic growth, among other factors.
Doctors say they have been shortchanged for several years because the government underestimated economic growth in the late 1990's and the number of people who would be in Medicare's fee-for-service program. As H.M.O.'s withdrew from Medicare, people returned to the original fee-for-service program, increasing enrollment more than expected.
In effect, said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, the calculations of the annual Medicare update left out the cost of caring for one million people.
Medicare officials say that if they acknowledged and corrected these mistakes, by increasing payments to doctors in 2003, they could expose the government to lawsuits demanding back pay for errors in previous years.
But doctors note that the Medicare law says "there shall be no administrative or judicial review" of factors used to compute their payments.
AARP, the lobby for the elderly, said Congress should not increase Medicare payments to health care providers unless it authorizes drug coverage for beneficiaries. But the organization also told Congress, "Errors or miscalculations in Medicare payment formulas should be corrected."
In June, the House passed a bill to provide prescription drug benefits to the elderly. The bill would increase Medicare payments to most health care providers, including doctors, who would receive an increase of about 2 percent in each of the next three years. The Senate has taken no action on the bill.
Darrin T. Ocke, a spokesman for the Medical Society of the State of New York State, said: "If Congress stops the erosion of Medicare payments, doctors will renew their commitment to the program. But if it's not fixed, there is a real likelihood of major service disruptions after Jan. 1."

HEADLINE: Has China Become an Ally? 

BYLINE:  By Kenneth Lieberthal; Kenneth Lieberthal is a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Michigan. He served as senior director for Asia on the National Security Council from 1998 to 2000.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

 BODY:
American relations with China have improved in a way that few could have imagined when the Bush administration entered office and declared China a "strategic competitor." Now signs of serious cooperation are everywhere. 
 China has worked with the United States on the global counterterrorism effort, will not be the spoiler on a new United Nations resolution on Iraq, has recently adopted stringent regulations on dual-use missile technology exports and other proliferation issues, and is discussing cooperation with the United States on North Korea. 
 Meanwhile, the White House did not oppose Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympic games, supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization and even acceded to Beijing's concerns about Islamic terrorist activities in the country's northwest Xinjiang region, putting a key group there on the United States' terrorism list. 
President Bush's decision to host Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, at the Crawford ranch today is another sign of good relations.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang will then attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Mexico, where Mr. Bush will see the leaders of our allies Japan and South Korea. The special treatment for Mr. Jiang highlights the remarkable development of United States-China relations, especially since Sept. 11.
The key reasons for this improved relationship are clear. In the wake of the World Trade Center attacks, Mr. Bush welcomed China's cooperation in bringing Pakistan into an anti-Taliban coalition and obtaining a strong United Nations resolution on terrorism. Mr. Bush has made counterterrorism the central focus of American foreign policy, and China has consistently and usefully remained on the right side of this issue. 
Equally important, China's leaders have been eager to stabilize the relationship. They want to avoid confronting the United States, especially when their domestic agenda is full with succession and other issues. They also count on American trade and investment to help keep their economy growing fast enough to maintain domestic stability.
In general, China has adopted a more confident overall approach to foreign policy. Beijing seems now to feel accepted as a major, respected actor in the international arena. It is actively pursuing multilateral approaches to trade and security issues and is rapidly opening its economy to increased foreign investment.
Its foreign policy is increasingly pragmatic, nuanced and consistent, eschewing the petulant stances that seemed in times past to reflect an underlying inferiority complex. In the last year, China has skillfully evaluated and acted on its opportunities for strategic cooperation with the United States.
Yet we should not forget that this relationship has long been characterized by wide swings of emotion, from amity to anger. It may be too early to say that the relationship has stabilized for the long term. Here are three notes of caution. 
First, the counterterrorism effort that now provides the foundation for strategic cooperation could become a source of serious friction. China has no love for Saddam Hussein, terrorism or nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, but it worries about American tactics in dealing with these issues. If the United States attacks Iraq without United Nations approval, for example, Beijing will be deeply shaken.
Beijing worries too about the aftermath of an invasion of Iraq. The effects of a war and occupation could undermine governments from those in the Middle East to Pakistan to Indonesia. 
Beijing also fears a spike in energy prices. It has no strategic oil reserve and is a substantial oil importer. High energy prices could produce an extremely unwelcome drag on China's economic growth.
Indeed, on several fronts, China may find that it will need to distance itself from American policy. Beijing is also very much aware that in the name of counterterrorism the United States has vastly increased its military strategic posture all around China's periphery. It has established a military presence in Central Asia, developed military ties with Pakistan and India and strengthened its relations with Russia. Against this background, strategic cooperation could in time slide toward mutual suspicion. 
Second, there are vociferous critics of cooperation in both countries who have been silent but could raise their voices should circumstances change. In Washington, conservative Republicans have been loath to criticize a conservative Republican president, even over warming ties with China. And liberal Democrats have had trouble finding their footing on China's human rights record in the wake of new national security concerns. But they, along with those in the administration who hold dark views of China as a potential military adversary, would become vocal should relations with China begin to unravel.
In China, debate continues over America's long-term goals and China's security. Should serious leadership rifts develop over domestic issues, policy toward the United States could well become part of the political battle. The Chinese military is already highly suspicious of America's recent enhancement of its military power in areas surrounding China, its increased military contacts with and arms sales to Taiwan, and its adoption of pre-emption as a core strategic doctrine.
Third, the Taiwan issue is both hopeful and treacherous, as rapidly growing economic ties across the Taiwan Strait are being matched by an escalating arms race on both sides. The possibility of disaster cannot yet be discounted.
 A merican interests require that we support the maintenance of Taiwan's democratic freedom, prosperity and security. We also have long-standing commitments, affirmed by the Bush administration, not to support a Taiwanese bid for independence. President Bush declared early on that he will do "whatever it takes" to defend Taiwan. But the administration has not taken initiatives to increase the chances of a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues. 
These issues are intertwined and, although both sides value cooperation, they will remain central to America's relations with China long after the Crawford visit is over.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICANS; 
One Seat Shy of Control, Lott Battles for Senate

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Trent Lott was at the AQ Chicken House in the Republican heart of Arkansas today, ostensibly to rally support for Tim Hutchinson, one of the Senate colleagues he was most worried about losing. 
 But Mr. Lott was campaigning as much for himself as for Mr. Hutchinson. 
 "I'm going to make it a little personal," Mr. Lott said as he met with the Republican faithful in the state's rapidly growing northwest corner. "Do you want somebody who knows about Arkansas and is your neighbor? I guarantee you Tim and Arkansas will be better off working with Trent Lott as the majority leader from Mississippi than -- let me just say the words -- with Tom Daschle from South Dakota." 
The crowd jeered at the mere mention of Mr. Daschle, the Democratic leader.
Mr. Lott's name is not on any ballot this year, but he is running as hard as anyone -- and has much to win or lose. The battle for control of the Senate will determine the reach of Mr. Lott's political power and either fulfill or puncture his dream of presiding over the Senate while Republicans control the White House and the House of Representatives.
Mr. Lott, who was elected leader after Bob Dole resigned from the Senate in 1996, is also trying to salvage his own reputation among Senate Republicans and with the White House. His job seemed in jeopardy last year after many Republicans blamed him for not doing enough to stop the defection of Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, which gave Democrats control of the Senate.
Mr. Lott has sought to consolidate his Senate support, and last week Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, a potential challenger, made it known that he would not oppose Mr. Lott for leader. Allies of Mr. Lott say that for now he has a "comfortable majority" to be re-elected Republican leader, whether Republicans win or lose control of the Senate. 
Still, Mr. Lott is clearly trying to develop better relations in his caucus by demonstrating that his zeal to win back control of the Senate for Republicans is unflagging.
Should Republicans succeed and complete the trifecta of controlling the House, Senate and White House, Mr. Lott has an ambitious agenda. That agenda is a chief element of his sales pitch as he tries to pick up that one additional Senate seat that will allow him to reclaim the title of majority leader, which was snatched from him when Mr. Jeffords, now an independent, left the Republicans. 
"We will come out of the gates next year fast," Mr. Lott promised.
Confirmation of 50 or more judges nominated by President Bush is high on his list. Making permanent the 10-year tax cuts Congress approved last year is another priority. He said he would pass the Republican version of prescription drug coverage for older Americans, bar a form of late-term abortion opponents call partial-birth abortion and protect gun rights.
"Give us a chance," Mr. Lott implored the crowd at the AQ Chicken House, a restaurant known for pan-fried chicken off Sam Walton Boulevard, a street named for Bentonville's favorite son and the founder of Wal-Mart, its economic lifeblood.
"For two years with President Bush in the White House and with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, I believe we can do things our states and our country would need that would make a difference for generations to come," Mr. Lott said.
Republican senators and others on Capitol Hill say Mr. Lott has at least quieted his critics by effectively countering Mr. Daschle in the legislative arena as well as by his aggressive fund-raising and support of Republican Senate candidates.
"I think most members agree that he has done as good a job as can be done," said Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a member of the party's leadership.
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Republican campaign effort, conceded that Senate Republicans were in shock for months after Mr. Jeffords defected. But he said that Mr. Lott seized on the gridlock to give Republicans a sense of purpose about retaking control. 
"This election has moved beyond party loyalty to the need to revive the Senate as an effective institution," Mr. Frist said.
Democrats say Mr. Lott's pitch to have Republicans consolidate control of government can help them energize their voters as well. 
"That frightens people," said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, adding that Americans like divided government.
Referring to the prospect of Republican control of Congress, Tovah Ravitz-Meehan, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, "Nothing makes our base get out and work harder and longer." She said much of Mr. Lott's campaigning lately had been confined to the Southern tier of states because his style of conservatism might not play so well elsewhere.
Mr. Hutchinson, however, contended that Mr. Lott's appeal would help, particularly in this rock-ribbed Republican section of Arkansas. Mr. Hutchinson knows he will win the area, which he represented in Congress. But he said he needed to run up a big margin here to counter the Democratic strength elsewhere of his opponent, Attorney General Mark Pryor.
"This is a very Republican part of the state, and they get it here," Mr. Hutchinson said about the fight for Senate control. "I think that will be big part of the motivation for a high voter turnout."
Mr. Lott's personal political action committee has contributed about $1.3 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, exceeding his own goal of about $700,000. He has given the maximum allowable to almost every competitive Senate candidate.
"I am praying for a chance to do what is right for our country," he told the Arkansans.

HEADLINE: Dead Parrot Society 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A few days ago The Washington Post's Dana Milbank wrote an article explaining that for George W. Bush, "facts are malleable." Documenting "dubious, if not wrong" statements on a variety of subjects, from Iraq's military capability to the federal budget, the White House correspondent declared that Mr. Bush's "rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy." 
 Also in the last few days, The Wall Street Journal reported that "senior officials have referred repeatedly to intelligence . . . that remains largely unverified." The C.I.A.'s former head of counterterrorism was blunter: "Basically, cooked information is working its way into high-level pronouncements." USA Today reports that "pressure has been building on the intelligence agencies to deliberately slant estimates to fit a political agenda." 
 Reading all these euphemisms, I was reminded of Monty Python's parrot: he's pushing up the daisies, his metabolic processes are history, he's joined the choir invisible. That is, he's dead. And the Bush administration lies a lot.
Let me hasten to say that I don't blame reporters for not quite putting it that way. Mr. Milbank is a brave man, and is paying the usual price for his courage: he is now the target of a White House smear campaign.
That standard response may help you understand how Mr. Bush retains a public image as a plain-spoken man, when in fact he is as slippery and evasive as any politician in memory. Did you notice his recent declaration that allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power wouldn't mean backing down on "regime change," because if the Iraqi despot meets U.N. conditions, "that itself will signal that the regime has changed"?
The recent spate of articles about administration dishonesty mainly reflects the campaign to sell war with Iraq. But the habit itself goes all the way back to the 2000 campaign, and is manifest on a wide range of issues. High points would include the plan for partial privatization of Social Security, with its 2-1=4 arithmetic; the claim that a tax cut that delivers 40 percent or more of its benefits to the richest 1 percent was aimed at the middle class; the claim that there were 60 lines of stem cells available for research; the promise to include limits on carbon dioxide in an environmental plan. 
More generally, Mr. Bush ran as a moderate, a "uniter, not a divider." The Economist endorsed him back in 2000 because it saw him as the candidate better able to transcend partisanship; now the magazine describes him as the "partisan-in-chief." 
It's tempting to view all of this merely as a question of character, but it's more than that. There's method in this administration's mendacity.
For the Bush administration is an extremely elitist clique trying to maintain a populist facade. Its domestic policies are designed to benefit a very small number of people -- basically those who earn at least $300,000 a year, and really don't care about either the environment or their less fortunate compatriots. True, this base is augmented by some powerful special-interest groups, notably the Christian right and the gun lobby. But while this coalition can raise vast sums, and can mobilize operatives to stage bourgeois riots when needed, the policies themselves are inherently unpopular. Hence the need to reshape those malleable facts.
What remains puzzling is the long-term strategy. Despite Mr. Bush's control of the bully pulpit, he has had little success in changing the public's fundamental views. Before Sept. 11 the nation was growing increasingly dismayed over the administration's hard right turn. Terrorism brought Mr. Bush immense personal popularity, as the public rallied around the flag; but the helium has been steadily leaking out of that balloon.
Right now the administration is playing the war card, inventing facts as necessary, and trying to use the remnants of Mr. Bush's post-Sept. 11 popularity to gain control of all three branches of government. But then what? There is, after all, no indication that Mr. Bush ever intends to move to the center. 
So the administration's inner circle must think that full control of the government can be used to lock in a permanent political advantage, even though the more the public learns about their policies, the less it likes them. The big question is whether the press, which is beginning to find its voice, will lose it again in the face of one-party government.

HEADLINE: Days of Diplomacy 

 BODY:
Deep in the heart of Texas, the Bush family is offering some high-powered hospitality to Jiang Zemin. In a trip reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping's visit to Houston in 1979, the Chinese president has toured NASA's Johnson Space Center, been feted by George H. W. Bush, the onetime ambassador to Beijing, and spoken at the presidential library in College Station. Today he will visit the presidential ranch in Crawford and enjoy some Texas barbecue with George W. Bush. 
 The visit, a prelude to this weekend's summit of Pacific rim leaders in Mexico and a swan song for the 76-year-old Mr. Jiang as he prepares to relinquish power, comes at an opportune moment. From Iraq to North Korea, the two nations face a range of difficult diplomatic challenges. By working together to resolve them, Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang can consolidate the constructive relationship that has been developing between the United States and China in recent months. 
 Relations have improved significantly since the early days of the Bush administration, when the confrontation over an American spy plane threatened to rupture ties. China remains wary of American power, but Beijing's emphasis on economic growth helps account for the thaw. 
Annual trade between the two countries has reached the $100 billion mark. The commitments to invest in China announced this week by Exxon Mobil and Anheuser-Busch are emblematic of the relationship. Hu Jintao, slated to become leader of the Chinese Communist Party next month, supports further economic liberalization. 
Beijing's cooperation in pressing North Korea and Iraq to dismantle weapons of mass destruction will be a crucial test of China's maturity as a global power. It does not suit China to have an erratic North Korean regime in possession of nuclear weapons. Nor does China, which relies on oil imports, want to see Saddam Hussein in a position to destabilize the Persian Gulf region.
Over the weekend, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Cabo San Lucas, Presidents Bush and Jiang will have the opportunity to add Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan and South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, to their discussions about North Korea. These four countries must present a united front in demanding that Kim Jong Il abandon his nuclear weapons program. President Bush must also bolster Mr. Koizumi's determination to tackle Japan's financial crisis, an ongoing drag to global economic growth.

HEADLINE: McCall Faces a Struggle To Emerge From Behind 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
It had been almost a week since the first of two news articles mentioned that Sikhulu Shange would love to hang a "McCall for Governor" sign in his shop window in Harlem, if only he had one.
 But Mr. Shange, the owner of the 125th Street Record Shack, had yet to be enlisted in the effort to elect H. Carl McCall. "Not a sign," he said yesterday. "Not even a call." 
 To be sure, one lone placard is a small thing in the flurry of a statewide race. But since Mr. McCall began his run for the governor, his campaign has been criticized for being slow to respond in far more significant situations.
It took five days for him to put an end to the two-inch headlines about letters he had written on state stationery pitching his relatives' resumes by apologizing and releasing all such letters.
It took six weeks from the time his Democratic opponent dropped out of the primary, thus allowing the Clintons to abandon their public neutrality, for him to plan an evening of events with former President Bill Clinton.
By that time, Wednesday, Mr. McCall's showing in the polls was so poor that the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, announced that there would be no significant money coming his way unless he shrunk an 11-point gap in the polls to 6 or 7 points. In another hint at internal disorganization, Mr. McAuliffe said the McCall campaign had failed to provide him a list of potential donors. The McCall campaign manager, Allen P. Cappelli, said he would not comment, in the interest of "moving forward." 
The McCall campaign is perceived to be so soporific that in recent days, several news commentators have even pondered whether Mr. McCall could come in third, after the Independence Party candidate, Tom Golisano. Some political scientists dismiss that notion as unrealistic, but in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 3, that the question has been raised at all seems ominous for Mr. McCall.
Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, has had trouble getting across the kind of clear argument voters need to oust an incumbent, strategists say. In recent weeks, he has all but abandoned the story of how he overcame his humble circumstances, a story that tested well with audiences. Instead, he has displayed the innate caution that led some observers to suggest, early in the campaign, that he did not have the desire it would take to win. At a Crain's Breakfast Forum, he proposed the same solution for everything from state budget woes to sluggish economic development: appoint panels of experts.
His education plan, which involves stock words like parental involvement and smaller classes, has not had the sizzle of Mr. Golisano's proposal to spend state lottery money on college tuition for good students.
Even though Mr. McCall denounces Gov. George E. Pataki daily and in no uncertain terms, some Democrats have expressed frustration, saying that the governor has not been taken to task for what they see as his failings.
Shirley O'Connell, a state Democratic committeewoman from Plattsburgh who has been involved in the McCall campaign, expressed mild disappointment.
"I think he's genuinely a nice, nice person," she said of the comptroller. "The fact that he's a gentleman sometimes keeps him from being aggressive as somebody else might be. Sometimes, the way politics is, you have to be aggressive and maybe a little bit nasty."
The campaign's money woes have been well documented, but some strategists say he did not husband what he had, spending too much during a primary he was winning.
"He has had everything but a clear and concise focus and an effective organization," said Philip J. Friedman, a Democratic consultant. "And that's something that Pataki has had from Day 1 and Golisano has had in the last three or four weeks."
But Mr. McCall's many friends, who have helped shape him into the perfect Democratic standard bearer with the sterling resume, have been quick to come to his rescue.
"Carl's presumption is, I guarantee you, in the back of his brain, these guys will take care of it, they'll deliver," said Hank Scheinkopf, one of several Democratic consultants the campaign hired, then sloughed off. "Who would let him down? He's Carl McCall, the golden boy."
Mr. Cappelli said the Mr. McCall campaign's field operation was "humming along."
"We're going to talk about progressive isssues that people care about -- that make a difference in people's lives," he said. "Pataki's failure on education, his failure on the economy, his lack of leadership in difficult times, Carl McCall's experience."
But as they are doing all that talking, Mr. Shange is waiting for his sign.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: COMBATING TERROR; 
More Talk on Attacks Than Taxes at Trade Forum

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell bumped into his Russian counterpart, Igor S. Ivanov, at a morning kaffeeklatsch today, and all they could talk about were the sniper suspects in Maryland and the hostages in Moscow.
 "Terrible, terrible," they said, commiserating and contemplating man's inhumanity to man. 
 It was another small sign that the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here in Mexico has turned from a discussion on trade to a forum on threats. 
Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, canceled his trip to the meeting to deal with his hostage crisis. That decision will cost President Bush, who arrives Saturday, a chance to directly lobby the Russian leader to support American plans for action against Iraq.
Kim Dae Jung of South Korea arrived to find his agenda refocused on North Korea's nuclear weapons. Corporate executives and consultants who wanted to talk international trade finance sometimes had to talk amongst themselves.
Such intertwining of foreign and financial policy, of capital and counterterrorism, was the real theme today for the conference's 21 member nations. The tensions of high finance on high alert are a lasting effect of last year's attacks on New York and Washington. The direct costs of the attacks have been estimated at $30 billion, and the economic ripples may soon outreach the initial shock wave.
Given the new and immediate threats around the globe, Secretary Powell said, the trick is to make the world's borders a barrier to terrorist groups while making them translucent for trade. "To make the flow of trade, finance and communication more secure," he said, the world must enhance its "security from global terrorism."
Secretary Powell said that while President Bush would try to stay focused on issues of trade and social development at the conference, "of course, we'll spend some time on the crises of the day." Those crises, he said, included Iraq and "the kinds of terrorist attacks that afflict so many countries today," including three other conference members -- Russian, Indonesia and the Philippines -- this month alone.
The foreign ministers at the conference adopted a joint statement tonight that pledged to "suppress the financing of terrorism" and strengthen security procedures for air travel and shipping. Along those lines, they are working on ways to monitor charities and nonprofit organizations and other money-transfer mechanisms that often go ungoverned.
They are also trying to create a global electronic network of customs and passport records, while trying to keep those security measures from unduly disrupting trade and travel. And they have plans to try to limit the economic fallout from terrorist attacks, especially attacks against energy grids and pipelines, computer links, telecommunications and transportation.
The Bush administration has been pushing such topics on its partners in the group since the Sept. 11 attacks. But Secretary Powell somewhat tempered that agenda today with his reminder that helping the poor was also part of government's mandate, even in a world racked with terror.
"When people see hope in the future, when they see an opportunity to make a living," he said, "then there's no room for anger, no room for the type of terror activity we see."

HEADLINE: HOSTAGE DRAMA IN MOSCOW: THE MOSCOW FRONT; 
Chechens Kill Hostage In Siege at Russian Hall

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Friday, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Chechen rebels threatening to blow up a Moscow theater with as many as 700 hostages, including three Americans, turned over the body of a young woman on Thursday in a sign of their resolve and turned a rocket launcher on two other women who escaped the theater Thursday afternoon.
 The grenades fired at the two women who managed to flee caused thundering explosions in the streets outside the music hall, which has been surrounded by scores of Russian soldiers and police. 
 As a gray dawn broke this morning on the second full day of the hostage crisis, the guerrillas abruptly set free 7 unidentified hostages and pledged to release some or all of the 75 foreign hostages held in the crowd.
A top official of Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, said for the first time that talks with the captors were being held under "a tense atmosphere" and that releases of others, including children, may be possible.
It was unclear whether the rebels, who have conducted only fitful negotiations with the government through intermediaries of their own choosing, had shifted to direct talks. 
The intelligence official, deputy director Sergei Ignatchenko, said talks had been set back by the bursting of a hot-water pipe which had flooded the first floor of the three-story theatre. The hostage-takers have charged that the incident was a ploy by intelligence agents and have refused to let repair crews into the building.
This morning's new releases and the pledge to set foreigners free were nevertheless a rare sign of progress in a situation which had appeared all but intractable only hours before. The previous evening, the rebels' had insisted that they would set no more of their captives free, and some had said in a videotape made public during the day that they intended to die as martyrs, taking hundreds of hostages with them.
The Chechens, who are demanding an end to Russia's war in the separatist republic, had earlier released 12 other hostages, including a British citizen who was said to be seriously ill, bringing the total freed to 39.
The 75 foreigners still in captivity included three Americans and a fourth who held an American green card, the American ambassador said.
In a midday statement on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin denounced the assault as one "planned in foreign terrorist centers," and he said he would not travel to Mexico this weekend for an economic summit meeting, where he had planned to meet with President Bush.
"We will not yield to these provocations," Mr. Putin said. 
The guerrillas, who said they numbered 25 men and 25 women, showed no sign of yielding either. 
The group chillingly underscored their threats in two videotapes delivered anonymously on Thursday to the Moscow bureau of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news channel that has often broadcast taped messages from leaders of Al Qaeda. 
In one of the tapes, apparently made before Wednesday night's assault, a man wearing a black wool cap said the rebels were on a "martyrdom operation with orders from the military commander of the Republic of Chechnya."
"I swear by God we are more keen on dying than you are keen on living," he said. 
In a second tape, five women wearing veils stood before a banner proclaiming in Arabic, "God is great." 
"We have chosen this path, the path of struggling for the freedom of the Chechen," one woman said. "It makes no difference for us where we will die. We have chosen to die here, in Moscow, and we will take the lives of hundreds of the infidels with us." 
The tapes and the statements may point to a foreign terrorist role in the hostage crisis, as Mr. Putin indicated. Chechen militants fought alongside Taliban and Qaeda members in Afghanistan, and experts say the separatist movement in Chechnya has been financed in part by Middle Eastern and Asian groups tied to Al Qaeda and terror. But Chechnya itself is a province of mostly moderate Muslims, with pockets of extremism.
Bolstering the charge of foreign involvement, Russian news services reported that the guerrillas had placed telephone calls to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, but the reports did not make clear the source of the information or when the calls might have been made. 
Underscoring their seriousness, the guerrillas have wired the theater's supporting pillars, seats and even themselves with plastic explosives, according to hostages released from the theater and others speaking from inside on cellphones. 
The rebels said they would blow up the building unless Mr. Putin agreed to withdraw Russian forces from Chechnya, the renegade province that has been the scene of two wars in the last decade. A pro-rebel Web site with a spotty record of truthfulness, www.kavkaz.org, has given the Kremlin seven days to comply.
The 700 captives, who sat down Wednesday evening to a popular musical only to find themselves in a life-and-death drama by the second act, made it clear on Thursday that they believed time to end the standoff peacefully was running out. 
"We beg you to take a sensible decision and to halt military actions in Chechnya," said Prof. Maria Shkolnikova, a heart specialist sent outside the theater briefly on Thursday to issue a statement on behalf of the hostages. "There have been enough wars." 
"Today we have ended up in a life-or-death situation," she said, reading from a handwritten letter. "We have parents, brothers, sisters and children. We greatly value their lives. We beg you to resolve the issue by peaceful means." 
In a midday cellphone call Thursday to the news radio station Echo Moskvy, she pleaded: "Please start doing something. Start troop withdrawals, or they will begin killing us."
The rebels allowed two Jordanian doctors to remove the body of a Russian woman, about 20, who was shot in the chest sometime after the terrorists stormed the southeast Moscow theater complex about 9 p.m. local time on Wednesday. 
A flurry of unverified reports said the woman, who was not identified, had been killed for refusing to end a cellphone conversation, for refusing to sit down and for trying to escape.
The rebels allowed Red Cross workers into the theater, a onetime cultural center for a ball-bearing factory, to attend to a young hostage thought to have appendicitis who was later freed and to treat one captor who suffered from peritonitis.
They also demanded audiences with a string of public figures who they indicated would give their demand a fair hearing, including an award-winning Russian war journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, and three deputies in the Russian Parliament. 
One deputy, Irina Khakamada, was allowed such an audience and later went to the Kremlin, but it was not clear whether she carried any new demands or messages from the rebels. 
She told journalists that she had seen no explosives, but a second deputy who had gone to the theater, Iosif Kobzon, said he had talked to a woman who held a remote-control device and boasted that she could blow up the hall by pressing its button. 
The leader of the group identified himself to intermediaries on Thursday as Abu Bakr. It was not clear whether he was in fact a rebel commander named Movsar Barayev, who has been identified on the pro-rebel Web site and by some who have seen the Jazeera videos as the head of the guerrilla force. 
The Russian journalism Web site gazeta.ru on Thursday identified Mr. Barayev as the nephew of a Chechen warlord, Arbi Barayev, who was notorious for kidnapping and ransoming foreigners at the height of Chechen lawlessness in the late 1990's.
In Washington, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Bush had called Mr. Putin to express solidarity and to offer "whatever Russia needed" to address the crisis. 
At the United Nations, the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the hostage-taking as "a heinous act."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT; 
Gore Calls U.S. Vulnerable To More Bioterror Attacks

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Former Vice President Al Gore said today that a "dangerous weakness in our health care system" made the United States vulnerable to terrorist attacks using anthrax, smallpox and other biological weapons.
 Mr. Gore said the threat of such attacks created an urgent need for federal, state and local officials to upgrade the public health system so doctors and hospitals would be better prepared to treat victims of a biological attack. 
 "Much attention has been focused on mobilizing public opinion for war," Mr. Gore said, "but not enough attention has been focused on mobilizing America's first line of defense against biological warfare, our public health system." 
Mr. Gore, who won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote in the 2000 presidential election, is considering another bid for the White House. His speech today, at George Washington University, was the latest evidence of his effort to prove that he would be a viable candidate in 2004. In recent weeks, he has also given speeches on Iraq and the nation's economic problems.
While Congress and the Bush administration have taken steps to upgrade the public health system, Mr. Gore said, they have not done enough.
"The small-scale anthrax attacks of a year ago found that our public health system is in a state of disrepair," Mr. Gore said. "This past summer the uncoordinated response to outbreaks of West Nile virus reminded us again how inadequate our public health system is."
Aides to Mr. Gore said he believed that an immediate infusion of $10 billion was needed to upgrade the health system.
Jerome M. Hauer, an assistant secretary of health and human services, said the Clinton-Gore administration bore much of the responsibility for the current problems.
"We are in a process of catching up," said Mr. Hauer, a former director of emergency management in New York City. "I briefed President Clinton on bioterrorism, but we could never get Donna Shalala, his secretary of health and human services, to understand that this was a threat. We saw no substantial gains in preparedness until George Bush became president and Tommy G. Thompson became secretary."
As an example, Mr. Hauer said, "under the previous administration, the goal was to have 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine by 2005, but we will have 160 million new doses by 2003."
Mr. Gore noted that his father, Albert Gore Sr., who served in Congress for 32 years, was an architect of the Interstate highway system. Just as the nation built highways to enhance national security in the cold war, Mr. Gore said, Americans must bolster the public health system today. With public health, as with highway construction, he said, steps taken for the purpose of national defense will benefit civilians for decades to come.
Mr. Gore denounced Mr. Bush's record on health care, saying the president had done little to expand health insurance coverage, guarantee patients' rights or lower the costs of prescription drugs.
But, Mr. Gore said, the goal of broader insurance coverage, a high priority for the Clinton administration and for Mr. Gore's campaign in 2000, "must now take, temporarily, a back seat to the urgent need" to prepare people for the possibility of an attack with biological weapons.
"We need a new National Defense Public Health Act to address this imminent threat," Mr. Gore said. 
Specifically, he said, doctors and nurses need better training, and the federal government should establish a nationwide network linking public health agencies.
"Rapid communication of information about dangerous disease outbreaks is an essential part of a national bioterrorism response," Mr. Gore said. "But many public health agencies lack equipment as basic as a fax machine or an e-mail account."
Mr. Gore said health costs were soaring and health insurance coverage eroding. State budget crises, resulting in part from "mismanagement of our national economy," have prompted state officials to cut Medicaid, the health program for poor people, and more cuts are likely, he said.
William A. Pierce, a spokesman for the Heath and Human Services Department, said the Bush administration had approved state Medicaid initiatives providing coverage to two million people and improved health benefits for six million others.

HEADLINE: Durable Orders and Consumer Confidence Fall 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The nation's hard-hit manufacturers suffered another drop in demand for their products while consumer confidence slid to the lowest level in nearly 10 years, according to reports issued today.
 Housing, however, remained one of the few bright spots as sales of both new and existing homes posted strong increases in September. 
 The Commerce Department said that orders to factories for big-ticket durable goods fell 5.9 percent in September, the biggest decrease in 10 months and the third decline in the last 4 months. The new weakness was led by a huge plunge in orders for communication equipment, but the declines were widespread across most industries. 
Consumer confidence as measured by a University of Michigan survey declined to 80.6 this month, the lowest level since 1993, as Americans were unnerved by the falling stock market and rising concerns about a possible war with Iraq.
The decline was the fifth consecutive one and raised worries that consumer spending, the biggest prop holding up the economy, could be in danger of faltering.
"Unless the downward momentum is quickly halted, the accumulated loss in consumer confidence could tip the economy back into recession," said Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan survey.
The brightest spot for the economy continued to be housing sales, with new-home sales rising 0.4 percent in September, to a record annual rate of 1.021 million units, while sales of existing homes were up 1.9 percent, to an annual rate of 5.4 million units.
Both home and car sales have been strong this year, reflecting the Federal Reserve's decision to keep a crucial interest rate at a four-decade low. But private economists worried about what could take up the slack if consumers decide to take a breather.
"The economy is creeping ahead, but only just barely," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "As long as another shoe doesn't drop, we'll probably be fine."
The worse-than-expected 5.9 percent decline in orders for durable goods followed news earlier this week of a fourth consecutive monthly decline in the index of leading economic indicators, indicating weakness for the next six months, and the Fed's latest survey of business conditions showing sluggish sales and a lackluster job market.
The 5.9 percent drop in orders for durable goods in September came after a 0.6 percent decline in August and a 4.5 percent drop in June. Only July posted an increase during this period, a gain of 8.5 percent.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said factories were struggling to mount an "uneven recovery" with "uncertainty regarding the stock market and possible war in the Middle East" continuing to impede business investment.
Analysts noted that orders for nonmilitary capital goods, considered a barometer of business investment plans, fell 12.6 percent in September.

HEADLINE: Graduate Assistants at Cornell Vote Decisively Against Autoworkers Union 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
In one of the biggest defeats for the fast-growing movement to unionize graduate students, Cornell University announced yesterday that its graduate teaching and research assistants had voted overwhelmingly against joining the United Auto Workers.
 The vote, which took place on Wednesday and Thursday, was 1,351 against union representation and 580 in favor. 
 In the organizing drive, the U.A.W., which represents thousands of white-collar workers across the nation, sought to make Cornell the second private university, after New York University, to have a graduate assistants' union.
"Graduate students at Cornell voted against a union because they feel they have it pretty good and the university has treated them pretty well," said Allen MacKenzie, a graduate research assistant in engineering and a co-founder of At What Cost?, a group opposing unionization. "That doesn't mean things are perfect, but they see other avenues for change."
Mr. MacKenzie said many students disliked the union's political views, especially on environmental issues, citing its opposition to stricter fuel economy standards for cars.
Robb Willer, a graduate student in sociology and an organizer for the union, attributed the defeat to a fear of change. "It's a national movement that like all national movements will experience wins and losses," he said. "But there's still a lot of activism to improve the standard of living for graduate students."
Cornell's president, Hunter R. Rawlings III, had spoken out against unionizing, but fought against it less vigorously than did officials at Yale and Columbia. Graduate students at Columbia and Brown have voted on the issue, but the ballots have been impounded while several schools ask the National Labor Relations Board to reverse its landmark 2000 decision, involving N.Y.U., that gave graduate assistants at private universities the right to unionize.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
The October Rally Extends to a Third Consecutive Week

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Optimistic that Wall Street will be able to extend its October rally, investors sent stocks sharply higher yesterday, giving the market's three major indexes their third consecutive winning week.
 Analysts said investors were generally feeling upbeat after strong gains in the previous two weeks and were putting aside fears -- at least temporarily -- that Wall Street's current advance is a bear market rally that will give up its gains. 
 "The market definitely has been feeling the path of least resistance in the upward direction," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "It's almost a regardless-of-the-news type of rally." 
"The broader market is definitely in rally mode, and today is no different; we're basically having a drift up," he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 126.65 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 8,443.99. That came after a drop of 176.93 points Thursday on investor concerns that a rally in the previous two weeks was too much, too soon.
Other markets also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 32.42 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,331.13, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.15 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 897.65.
All three gauges had their third consecutive winning week, a feat not seen since the period ended Aug. 23. The Dow finished the week up 1.5 percent, while the Nasdaq rose 3.4 percent and the S.& P. climbed 1.5 percent.
The market lurched up and down on mixed economic reports before climbing in the afternoon.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that new-home sales rose 0.4 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million, the highest rate on record. Economists predict 2002 will be the best year ever for sales of both new and existing homes.
But another Commerce Department report showed a 5.9 percent decline last month in orders to United States factories for durable goods. The drop, the biggest in 10 months, was much larger than the 2 percent decline analysts were expecting.
And the University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment for October decreased to 80.6 from 86.1 in September, the lowest level since 1993, according to Dow Jones Newswires. Economists were expecting a reading of 81.3.
"The big picture economic and earnings data has been so-so, but the market is holding its own," said Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator at Prudential Securities. "The data suggests we shouldn't be going up, up and away, so we're getting a sloppy, sideways kind of action."
Analysts said investors had become more hopeful after the two-week rally as better-than-expected earnings bolstered stocks. Since hitting a five-year low on Oct. 9, the Dow has gained more than 1,000 points.
But stocks remain vulnerable to bouts of profit taking as investors worry about the market's long-term recovery. Lingering uncertainties including a possible war with Iraq also continue to pressure the market, analysts said.
Gainers included Starbucks, which jumped $1.48, to $23.93, after the company slightly raised its guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year.
Household International rose $1.26, to $24.09, after the company, a provider of consumer loans, said it raised $900 million in two securities offerings.
Pharmaceutical companies got a boost after Lehman Brothers upgraded their stocks. Wyeth gained $1.24, to $34.50, and Schering-Plough jumped $1.23, to $20.35.
Cigna, the insurance and financial services company, tumbled $24.21, or 38.1 percent, to $39.39, after it warned that third-quarter and full-year earnings would be lower than expected, citing higher costs.
Amazon dropped 56 cents, to $19.30, after the Internet retailer reported a narrower third-quarter loss. --------------------

Treasury Prices Up
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury prices rose yesterday after reports showed durable goods orders and consumer confidence fell more than expected, adding to evidence an economic rebound is slackening.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 8/32, to a price of 102 9/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.09 percent from 4.12 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 1/32, to 104 12/32. The yield was unchanged at 5.08 percent.

HEADLINE: 8,000 California Birds Killed in Bid to Stop Virus 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: LOS ALAMITOS, Calif., Oct. 24 

 BODY:
Trying to contain a month-old outbreak of a deadly bird virus known as exotic Newcastle disease, state and federal agriculture officials have killed more than 8,000 birds in Southern California, including thousands of chickens, dozens of household pet birds, several peacocks and four ostriches.
 The devastating infection has not spread to California's commercial poultry operations, most of which are in Northern California, but Canada, Taiwan, Poland and South Korea have already banned imports of most poultry products from the state. The European Union has imposed an embargo on live poultry, hatching eggs and fresh meat from poultry and game birds from the United States until the infection is brought under control, officials said. 
 Officials from the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture have established an emergency Newcastle disease task force on a military training base in Los Alamitos, about 30 miles south of Los Angeles. 
The group now includes 171 officials to inspect hundreds of homes and small farms in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties where the infection is feared to have spread. So far, 73 premises have been quarantined in an effort to contain the virus.
Dr. Richard E. Breitmeyer, the State of California's chief veterinarian, said he had seen hopeful signs in recent days that the spread was slowing, although he is far from ready to declare the virus contained.
"We're not finding a lot of cases of massive die-offs," Dr. Breitmeyer said. "Those occurred two to three weeks ago when birds were literally dying in front of our eyes."
He said he had been startled by the number of people in the Los Angeles metropolitan region who keep chickens and other fowl on their property as pets or sources of food.
"The sheer volume of these backyard birds has been eye-opening to us," Dr. Breitmeyer said. "Some of these birds, including chickens, are like pets to these people. It's amazing how emotionally attached people get to them."
The disease was first spotted in late September by a private veterinarian in Compton, a low-income Los Angeles suburb. A client brought in a sick chicken with symptoms similar to those of Newcastle disease: sneezing, weight loss and lethargy. The chicken soon died and was submitted to the state laboratory for testing, where results came back positive for Newcastle disease. State animal health experts quickly moved to try to assess the extent of the infection and began door-to-door inspections of homes and farms raising birds.
Newcastle disease devastated California's poultry industry in the early 1970's, when 12 million birds were destroyed. The disease was traced to imported parrots and macaws from Central and South America, which came in contact with birds from nearby commercial poultry operations. Since then, federal agriculture officials have set up inspection and quarantine stations at the borders to try to keep diseased birds out. But wild birds and smuggled exotic species and fighting cocks occasionally arrive carrying the virus.
The disease is often transmitted at bird shows, cockfights and swap meets and can be carried by humans, although it does not make people sick.
In that regard, it is like foot-and-mouth disease, which is debilitating to livestock but has little effect on humans, Dr. Breitmeyer said. The response by the authorities is similar: kill all the diseased animals and any that might have come in contact with them, then quarantine the premises until the virus is eradicated by disinfectants.
Dr. Breitmeyer said he was not certain how the disease was transported to California this time, but he said the strain here was genetically similar to a viral strain seen in Mexico in 2000 that led to the destruction of 13 million broilers.
Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said he had warned member farmers to impose stringent biosecurity measures at their poultry farms, disinfecting workers when they arrive and leave and giving them laundered coveralls for each shift. Still, migratory birds can transmit Newcastle disease, he said, and there was no assurance that it would not spread northward to California's $2.5 billion poultry industry, with catastrophic economic results.
"When Newcastle gets into a commercial flock, you might as well kill them all," Mr. Mattos said.
When inspectors find a diseased bird, they immediately quarantine the premises and remove all birds on the property, which are quickly killed using carbon dioxide gas. Then investigators trace the movement of the birds to try to locate other diseased flocks. Owners are compensated with state money based on the market value of the birds, although that often leads to difficult negotiations, Dr. Breitmeyer said.
"We try to determine a fair value for the birds, but it doesn't take into account the emotional value they might have to the owners," he said. "But most people are being surprisingly cooperative when we make clear to them how devastating this is to poultry."

HEADLINE: Retailers Like Business Gifts And the Profits They Generate 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Did you really think corporate perks were out?
 Just in time for the executive who wants to remember colleagues, but is unsure about the rules, Saks Fifth Avenue has issued its new holiday corporate gift catalog, the first one the retailer has published, featuring desktop knickknacks from sterling silver flashlights for $125 to Baccarat bulls for $890. Engraving costs extra. 
 Analysts report that department stores, faced with flagging demand for clothing, are generally turning more to gifts, and that Saks is no exception. Now, besides overhauling its stores' gift departments, Saks is taking on Tiffany, which previously had the market for corporate gifts pretty much to itself -- with, of course, an occasional exception like, say, a pair of his-and-her jets from Neiman Marcus. But Tiffany's, the store with its own special corporate gift catalog, has always been the one to beat. 
To Eric Beder, the director of research with Ladenburg Thalmann, the Saks catalog is part of a changing emphasis at luxury department stores toward gifts: one-size-fits-all and the more "unique," the better. And a big part of the gift market is business customers: chief executives giving to special underlings, events coordinators giving to suppliers and manufacturers giving to top salesmen.
"There's a new focus on gifting, on companies coming out with new distinctive boxes, to further leverage the brand names," Mr. Beder said. "The market for corporate gifts is huge, with incredibly high profit margins."
Mr. Beder says that in contrast to regular store merchandise, 40 percent of which is eventually marked down, corporate gifts sell at full price or not at all -- no sales. So in January, executives will not be getting a chance to buy the New York City toile box in earthenware (Tiffany's) for less than the $75 asking price. Or the Saks doghouse- and-bone sterling key chain (for kennel owners and other dog fanciers) for $60.
At Saks, the new catalog is part of the strategy of Christina Johnson, the chief executive. Ms. Johnson, who took over in February 2000, said she wanted to make Saks more of a destination for gifts. And now, the store has released its first corporate catalog.
"We've never done this before, and we'd like to turn this into a $30 million to $50 million business over the next five years," Ms. Johnson said. That sounds like a lot, but it is not when compared with the total $16 billion-a-year corporate gift market cited in the trade magazines. But that number includes the world's supply of shirts, plastic drinking mugs and tennis balls that are embossed with company logos.
These are not exactly hallmarks of Tiffany -- nor of Saks, where the offerings start with a giant money clip of solid 18-karat gold ($450) on the cover of the new pewter-colored booklet. Saks has placed its money on pewter to rival Tiffany's distinctive cornflower blue boxes. "It's not as iconic as Tiffany's -- yet," conceded Ms. Johnson, "but we're building."
For the less generous boss, there is also a silver-plated computer mouse ($35) or a red nubuck mouse pad ($25), not to mention the Christofle silver-plated Pebble of Peace $85, with the word in 32 languages, inspired by Clara Halter, who designed Le Mur Pour la Paix, or the Wall for Peace, in Paris. 
Ms. Johnson has pulled out the stops at Saks. The company has just hired a separate corporate gift sales staff, with three regional offices in the East, Midwest and West.
This week, Mark L. Aaron, Tiffany's vice president for investor relations, played down the role of corporate gifts in his company's overall earnings profile. "It's only 5 or 6 percent of the total," he said. However, Tiffany reported earnings of $708 million in the first half of 2002, so even 5 percent -- $35 million -- is not exactly chicken feed.
Linda Buckley, also speaking for Tiffany, said its silver and bone-china Christmas tree ornaments always sold well, along with silver styluses for hand-held computers ($65). Pens with the Tiffany "T" logo are also top sellers, she added.
The difference between the corporate gift catalogs, according to Saks, is that Saks does not have to keep its offerings to its own branded products. The company can, and does, offer Burberry raincoats, for example. But Tiffany argues that because it sells only the Tiffany brand, there is an exclusivity to the products they offer.
But in the Saks catalog there are exclusive items that are sold only by Saks. And there are other items, like the Christofle pebble, which the company says are offered only by the manufacturer -- Christofle itself -- and by Saks.
Ms. Johnson pointed to the $200 Dunhill sterling "decision maker," an inch-and-a-half-wide spinner engraved with "Today," "Tomorrow," "Yes" and "No."
But perhaps the most original gift is shown on the last page of the catalog: an old-fashioned snow globe -- the kind you shake and the white stuff begins to fall -- with your company's very own skyscraper inside.
Even with your own building sculpted inside, the globes are just $35 apiece. The only caveat is that you have to order at least 1,500 of them.

HEADLINE: Families Humanize 9/11 Aid Forms; 
Testimonials to Victims Offered Alongside Cold Numbers

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
For many people, applying to the federal Victim Compensation Fund figured to be something of a clinical exercise, a statistical blur in which thousands of families would compute the lost earnings of loved ones, then wait for the government to mail out checks.
 But for many families and friends of victims, and lawyers who did not even know them, the application process for the government effort to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for every Sept. 11 victim has yielded something far more unexpected and indelible: the impulse to create intimate minibiographies about the dead, based on interviews, photos or videotapes. 
 One lawyer has secured several sworn statements from survivors, to stitch together a haunting 15-page narrative about a Port Authority manager who saved at least 60 people. Another lawyer has produced a 10-minute movie that includes a ballad written and sung by a victim's adolescent daughter. Still another lawyer has been reading David McCullough's "John Adams" every night for inspiration. 
For the families, the most important motivation to assemble these narratives may not be the push for more compensation, though they certainly may have that effect. Instead, the real value may lie in their timeless and therapeutic resonance in telling the full story of life, love and loss beyond cold, raw numbers.
And, personal reckonings aside, these narratives may have historic significance, too. By creating an archive of lump-in-the-throat words, images and sounds, they may provide the richest and most elegiac account of what happened in the doomed buildings on Sept. 11, and what the people who died there meant to their families.
"You submit these binders, and you realize that there are real people buried in there," said Paul A. Scrudato, a lawyer in Manhattan who wrote a poignant 11-page narrative about Mario Santoro, an emergency medical technician, for his widow, Leonor Ramos-Santoro. "So you want to get it right, because in 20 years, the only thing that she'll care to read, or want her daughter to look at, is this story."
The extent to which these materials will eventually become public is not yet clear. In an interview, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master in charge of the fund, said that all applications would remain confidential "now and forevermore" unless individual families decided to release their own applications to, say, a library or university.
Even so, Mr. Feinberg said that he, too, had been touched by the efforts to put the narratives together.
"As often as not, I receive information that may not be directly pertinent to the computation of the claim, but is considered by the family member to be essential to understanding the person," he said. "It is absolutely heart-rending, and it is very emotional."
Nothing in the statute that created the multibillion-dollar fund encourages families to compile these stories. Nothing in the regulations that Mr. Feinberg drafted. Nothing in the fund's 33-page application form, which makes a 1040 income tax return look elementary by comparison.
And since Mr. Feinberg has said that he will be more flexible in evaluating economic losses than emotional ones, some lawyers and families concede that these narratives may not make a big difference. Some families may also be loath to submit a collage of visceral memories to government officials they do not know, for a fund they may not trust.
"Some families are somewhat embarrassed to apply for monetary relief under the act, as they are already economically secure," said Robert M. Hebble, a Manhattan lawyer who represents several families. "Moreover, they do not want their lives publicly exposed to any greater extent than they have been already."
Still, those who have proceeded with the narratives say that the experience, while painful, can be cathartic, even inspiring.
Aaron J. Broder, a lawyer who practices in Manhattan, has been studying Jefferson's tributes in "John Adams" to stretch his literary muscles. Maura V. Laffan, who practices law on Long Island, said that she has been thinking about Faulkner, Henry James and others "who have looked very closely at the human condition," because the narratives are "probably the most important pieces that I'll ever write."
And while Nina Barnes, the closest surviving relative of Durrell V. Pearsall Jr., a firefighter with Rescue Company 4 in Queens, has not yet applied to the fund, she has written a one-page essay to help her lawyer, Marc S. Moller. In spare language, she recounts how she used "to walk him in his carriage, feed, diaper and baby-sit for him" and how Mr. Pearsall, a burly football player, once appeared in a Tostitos commercial with Bill Parcells.
"I called him my 'Movie Star Cousin,' " she wrote.
Some narratives offer details about what happened inside the World Trade Center. Take the story of Frank De Martini, the Port Authority's construction manager, which was written by Roberta G. Gordon, a lawyer with Bryan Cave L.L.P. in Manhattan.
Shortly after the north tower was struck, Mr. De Martini found an escape route for about 40 people -- including his wife, Nicole -- who were trapped on the 88th floor. Then, Mr. De Martini and one of his employees climbed the stairs to the 89th floor.
"With the door to the stairwells all locked or jammed, and hearing a blow-by-blow account of the terrifying events unfolding on still-working radios," some survivors who had huddled in one room "were holed up waiting for rescue," or certain death, the narrative said. But eventually, Mr. De Martini, his body "covered in soot, his hair turned grey from the smoke and his eyes completely red," forced his way in and guided people to safety, before leaving to help more people on other floors, she wrote.
While Mr. De Martini's narrative is adorned only by a family photo on the cover of the application, other presentations are more elaborate. There are scrapbook items like the "Missing" posters that once blanketed Lower Manhattan. There are recordings of songs like "Hero," by Enrique Iglesias and "I Will Remember You," by Sarah Maclachlan.
E. Drew Britcher, a lawyer in Glen Rock, N.J., who belongs to Trial Lawyers Care, a national consortium offering free legal services to Sept. 11 victims, is submitting his clients' applications on CD-ROM's. In his narrative about Maria Theresa Santillan, a customer-service representative for Cantor Fitzgerald, he included baby pictures, video clips of her fiance and even references to the fact that her cousin, Judy H. Fernandez, also worked at Cantor and died on Sept. 11.
"They wanted whoever was looking at their claim to not just be seeing that their family member was not Claim No. 42796 or whatever, but that this was a special person," said Mr. Britcher, who recently submitted the Santillans's application.
One video narrative that is not yet finished is the one that Chris Placitella, a partner at Wilentz Goldman & Spitzer, in Woodbridge, N.J., has put together for Lorie Van Auken, whose husband, Kenneth, was a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. So last week, Mr. Placitella, who also belongs to Trial Lawyers Care, invited Mrs. Van Auken and another widow, Patty Casazza, for a preview.
There were wedding pictures, bar mitzvah pictures, vacation pictures, sentimental pictures of the arbor and deck that he built.
But there was also no escape from the horror of Sept. 11. -- not when the narrative included Mr. Van Auken's harrowing, halting voice mail message. "I'm in the World Trade Center. The building was hit by something. I don't know if I'm going to get out. I love you."
And not when the narrative included the song "Daddy's Little Girl," which was written by Sarah Van Auken, now 13. "Daddy, are you there? 'Cause I've, I've looked everywhere. Maybe you'll appear, somehow whisper in my ear."
As she watched her husband's life unfold on screen, Mrs. Van Auken crumpled tissue after tissue to dab away the tears. "It's ripping your heart out," she said. "But I'm glad I'm doing this, because it's something you'll have forever."
Then, almost as abruptly as it began, the video was over. And for the next minute or so, no one said anything.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Second European Union Ruling To Block a Merger Is Overturned

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
For the second time this week, a European Union court has overturned a decision by the union's antitrust regulators to block a corporate merger. The decision today intensified pressure on the European Commission, the union's executive body, to change the way it assesses proposed mergers.
 Today's decision by the Court of First Instance, based in Luxembourg, involved the proposed purchase of Sidel, a French bottle maker, by Tetra Laval, the packaging conglomerate best known for its brick-shaped long-life packaging for milk and juice. The court said the regulatory decision to block the deal was based on "insufficient evidence and some errors of assessment." 
 The language of today's ruling was less harsh than two previous annulments issued by the court -- one on Tuesday involving a proposed combination of two French electrical products makers, Schneider and Legrand, and one in June involving two British travel companies, Airtours (since renamed the MyTravel Group) and First Choice Holidays. 
In the Schneider-Legrand case, the court said the commission's blocking decision was littered with obvious errors, omissions and contradictions, and the way it was reached infringed the companies' rights. In the Airtours-First Choice case, the court said the commission had failed to establish that the deal would create collective dominance in the market. 
The string of defeats in court for the union's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, comes at a time when the Bush administration has made antitrust enforcement a low priority, leaving Mr. Monti as the principal watchdog on international mergers. Some antitrust lawyers in Brussels said they were concerned that the losing streak would weaken enforcement in Europe as well. 
Mr. Monti told reporters today that neither his authority nor his resolve had been undermined by the court decisions. "If anything, they reinforce my determination," he said. "I will not watch our world- class reputation for 10 years be washed out by this."
Still pending before the court is an appeal of one of Mr. Monti's biggest decisions: to block General Electric's proposed takeover of Honeywell last year. And the commission has not yet concluded its antitrust investigation of Microsoft. Both these matters could be affected by today's ruling in the Tetra Laval-Sidel appeal.
Mr. Monti's objections to that deal centered mainly on concerns that Tetra Laval could leverage its strength in carton packaging, using it unfairly to win dominance in the plastic bottle market as well.
Leveraging concerns are central to both the Microsoft inquiry and to Mr. Monti's objections to the G.E.-Honeywell merger. In Microsoft's case, the Windows operating system's ubiquity is said by critics to give the company an unfair advantage in other software markets like those for servers and mobile phones. G.E.'s leading positions in jet engines and aircraft finance and Honeywell's in avionics could be used unfairly to reinforce each other, the commission said.
In its ruling today, the court said leveraging was a legitimate issue for the commission to take up, setting an important precedent. But the court said the commission had failed to make a persuasive case that it was a danger in the Tetra Laval-Sidel deal. 
Mr. Monti played down the impact of today's ruling on the bigger cases. "Just as it would be hard to compare G.E.-Honeywell with the Tetra Laval-Sidel case, the comparison with the Microsoft case is unjustified," he said. 
He called attention instead to the timing of the decisions that have been annulled. His office began examining the Schneider-Legrand and Tetra Laval-Sidel deals just when work on the G.E.-Honeywell deal was reaching its climax, leaving his office swamped with work, Mr. Monti said. The Airtours-First Choice decision also came at a time of peak merger activity. 
"During the merger wave, the task force was working under incredible conditions," he said. 
Mr. Monti said his staff began looking for ways to improve its procedures months ago. "We started the review when the merger regulation had no critics," he said. 
One aspect of the present system that many lawyers applaud is its speed. Under current rules, a full investigation of a merger must be completed within five months. But that can pose problems in complicated cases, Mr. Monti said. "If our deadline passes and we haven't ruled, then the merger must automatically be approved," he said. "The United States competition bodies don't have such a sword of Damocles hanging over them."
He said he was considering proposing that companies be allowed to stop the clock in complex cases.
Mr. Monti also plans to propose naming a chief economist to oversee major merger assessments, and to use a devil's advocate system in which teams of officials in his office search for weaknesses in their colleagues' work before a decision is published. 
But he also wants the court that reviews his decisions to make changes. Court appeals can take so long -- often two years or more -- that a decision to revive a blocked deal may be moot by the time it is rendered. Mr. Monti is in talks with the Court of First Instance about how to move cases along.
He has proposed a separate chamber, or possibly a whole separate court, just to handle antitrust cases. But for now, the talks have centered on making better use of a fast-track procedure set up last year for less complicated cases. 
Tetra Laval and Sidel may be the first beneficiaries of the fast-track process. Sidel's chief executive, Gerard Stricher, said today that his company now hoped to complete the deal with Tetra Laval quickly.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
North Korea's Response

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a press release yesterday from the United Nations mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea):
 The Bush administration listed the D.P.R.K. as part of the "axis of evil" and a target of U.S. pre-emptive nuclear strikes. This was a clear declaration of war against the D.P.R.K. as it totally nullified the D.P.R.K.-U.S. joint statement and agreed framework. 
 In the long run, the Bush administration has adopted it as its policy to make a pre-emptive nuclear strike at the D.P.R.K. Such moves, a gross violation of the basic spirit of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, reduced the inter-Korean joint declaration on denuclearization to a dead document. 
Its reckless political, economic and military pressure is most seriously threatening the D.P.R.K.'s right to existence, creating a grave situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Nobody would be so naive as to think that the D.P.R.K. would sit idle under such a situation.
That was why the D.P.R.K. made itself very clear to the special envoy of the U.S. president that the D.P.R.K. was entitled to possess not only nuclear weapons but any type of weapon more powerful than that, so as to defend its sovereignty and right to existence from the ever-growing nuclear threat by the U.S. 
The D.P.R.K., which values sovereignty more than life, was left with no other proper answer to the U.S. behaving so arrogantly and impertinently. 
The D.P.R.K. has neither need nor duty to explain something to the U.S. seeking to attack it, if it refuses to disarm itself. 
Nevertheless, the D.P.R.K., with greatest magnanimity, clarified that it was ready to seek a negotiated settlement of this issue on the following three questions: 
*Firstly, if the U.S. recognizes the D.P.R.K.'s sovereignty; 
*Secondly, if it assures the D.P.R.K. of nonaggression; and 
*Thirdly, if the U.S. does not hinder the economic development of the D.P.R.K.
Nowadays, the U.S. and its followers assert that negotiations should be held after the D.P.R.K. puts down its arms. This is very abnormal logic: Then, how can the D.P.R.K. counter any attack with empty hands? Their assertion is little short of demanding the D.P.R.K. yield to pressure, which means death. . . . The D.P.R.K. considers that it is a reasonable and realistic solution to the nuclear issue to conclude a nonaggression treaty between the D.P.R.K. and the U.S. if the grave situation of the Korean Peninsula is to be bridged over. . . .

 Before heading downtown to HSBC Arena for a Buffalo Sabres hockey game, Mr. Golisano and his campaign workers dined at Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar, which calls itself "home of the chicken wing." Members of the Independence Party-backed campaign fairly bubbled while awaiting portions of the city's best-known food. 
 Mr. Golisano's campaign has saturated television stations in Western New York with advertisements since late summer, making his face nearly as recognizable as that of the new Buffalo Bills quarterback, Drew Bledsoe. At the same time, H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller and Democratic candidate, has all but stopped advertising in the region, with his face seen more often in Gov. George E. Pataki's commercials than in his own. 
The region's economic downswing has steadily blurred traditional party lines. The Buffalo mayor, Anthony M. Masiello, a longtime Democratic state senator, also ran on the Republican line in 2001 and recently endorsed Governor Pataki for the second straight time. A former Masiello ally, Steve Pigeon, recently ousted as Erie County Democratic Party chairman, has been Mr. Golisano's primary aide during upstate campaign swings. "The area's not ripe for just any independent candidate," Mr. Pigeon said, "but it's perfect for Golisano's candidacy." 
Mr. Golisano also visited the Pohlman Foundry, which opened in 1889 and closed last week. In 1998, the foundry employed 80 people and still had 41 on the payroll until last week. The company, a producer of large iron components, was bought in 1998 by Lionheart Industries, which now has its headquarters in Oklahoma.
Mr. Golisano blamed what he called New York's heavy burden of taxes, insurance premiums and workers' compensation rates for the closing of Pohlman and many other small factories. "It's a very common story," he said. "The state's approach is to hit only certain situations. You have to attack the problem in broader terms. These issues hurt every business." 
Mr. Golisano cited the state's planned assistance to Adelphia Communications Corporation, to help the troubled cable television company build a headquarters in Buffalo, until the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and its founder, John J. Rigas, and three sons were indicted on federal charges. "We were ready to hand them a $150 million check," Mr. Golisano said. "They went bankrupt just in time."
Many in the crowd at the Anchor Bar were more concerned with the hockey game than an appearance by the candidate.
"His commercials kind of stretch the point," said Richard Book, a 69-year-old retired chemist who described himself as a staunch Democrat. "He says he can bring jobs here, but the state legislature is notorious for ignoring us. How is he going to do those things without the legislature on his side?"
Andy Sutton, 35, was more optimistic. "This is a very depressed area," Mr. Sutton said while keeping an eye on the full parking lot at the Anchor Bar. "It's time for a change."

As Expected, S.E.C. Splits On Accounting Board Head
The new board overseeing the accounting profession got off to a troubled start when the members of the Securities and Exchange Commission split over the qualifications and competency of the board's new leadership. They voted 3 to 2 to approve the selection of William H. Webster, the former director of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., to head the new board.
 While the three Republicans on the commission hailed Mr. Webster for his integrity and extensive background in law enforcement, the commission's two Democrats said he lacked the credentials to head an accounting board. They emphasized that he had no recent experience in accounting issues and lamented the perception that the Republicans had caved to the accounting profession, whose lobbyists had complained that an earlier choice of some of the commissioners, John H. Biggs, had been too aggressive as a reformer. Page A1. 

Dow Industrials Soar 126 Points
Investors sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 126.65 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 8,443.99. The Dow and the market's two other major gauges have had three consecutive winning weeks and investors are hopeful that the October rally will continue. The Nasdaq composite index rose 32.42 points, or 2.5 percent, to end the week at 1,331.13, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.15 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 897.65. C4.

Service Companies May Gain in Iraq
Though Iraq's future is hazy, energy companies have begun to weigh the roles they might play in the revival of Iraq's huge but dilapidated oil industry. According to a new report by Deutsche Bank, oil field services companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton could be the early winners, but the prospects for oil companies themselves are less clear. C3.

Factory Orders and Confidence Fell
Orders to factories for big-ticket durable goods fell 5.9 percent in September, the biggest decrease in 10 months, the Commerce Department said. In another report, consumer confidence, as measured by a University of Michigan survey, declined to the lowest level since 1993. The bright spot in the economy continued to be housing sales. C4.

Williams Says False Data Provided
The Williams Companies said its traders provided phony information to a journal that compiles gas price indexes used by the industry in sales contracts. It was the third company to admit lying about energy prices. C2.

Buffett to Leave Gillette Board
Billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett plans to resign from the board of Gillette to focus on his own business, Berkshire Hathaway. The move immediately raised questions about whether Mr. Buffett, who is one of Mr. Gillette's biggest shareholders, had become disenchanted with Gillette and toiletries. Mr. Buffett, who plays his cards very close to his vest, declined to discuss his decision. C2.

Wynn Resorts Raised $450 Million
Wynn Resorts, the casino company founded by Steve Wynn, raised $450 million in an initial offering after cutting the share price as much as 43 percent. The company sold 34.6 million shares at $13 each, below the $15 to $17 proposed and the $21 to $23 set earlier. C14.

Verizon Earns $4.4 Billion
Verizon Communications said that it had earned $4.4 billion in the third quarter, largely from selling assets and investments. The profit of $1.60 a share was more than twice the $1.9 billion, or 69 cents a share, Verizon earned in the quarter last year. C14.

Bids Are Too Low for Houghton
All the bids Vivendi Universal received for its Houghton Mifflin publishing unit fell short of the $1.7 billion that Vivendi had set as a minimum price, a person involved in the discussions said. C14.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Cuts Its Rating Of Ford Debt To Record Low 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Executives at the Ford Motor Company tried to persuade investors this week that it was focused on its restructuring and planned to accelerate its comeback plan. 
 But today, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, cut Ford's long-term debt rating to its lowest level ever, citing competitive pressures that it fears will hinder the company's efforts. Further, S.& P. said the outlook for Ford remained negative, a designation that analysts said concerned them more than the downgrade, which had been expected. 
 The downgrade is another indication that Ford's recovery will not be easy, given the economic environment. The auto industry this year has had to rely on incentives to prop up sales in the face of a slowing economy and stiff competition from imports. In addition, carmakers are facing increasing pension liabilities. Those issues, analysts said, could hamper Ford's recovery efforts. 
"The issue that's overhanging the industry is what happens to the consumer," said Steven J. Bocamazo, vice president for fixed-income security research at Loomis, Sayles & Company in Boston. "If the headwinds go against Ford as far as industry fundamentals, it makes it that much more difficult for Ford with its restructuring plan."
Last week, S.& P. also downgraded the long-term debt rating of General Motors. But the rating agency maintains a stable outlook on G.M. and on Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
The agency's action capped a week in which Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., and its chief financial officer, Allan D. Gilmour, met with investors in New York and Boston, assuring them the company was accelerating a plan to return to profitability, after losing $5.5 billion in 2001. 
Ford executives have promised that the company will earn $7 billion a year in operating profit by 2005, and earlier this year they started a program that calls for layoffs, plant closings and spending cuts. 
But analysts contend that the program is not aggressive enough.
"The fact that they are aiming higher just wasn't sufficient" to delay the downgrade, said Scott Sprinzen, the automobile industry analyst at S.& P. "There is still such uncertainty about their ability to deliver amid the environment that they face."
S.& P. cut Ford's long-term debt rating one notch, to BBB, two steps above junk status, from BBB+. It affirmed its A-2 rating on the short-term debt of Ford and Ford Credit, the company's financing unit.
The BBB rating is a sharp contrast to the image that Ford maintained in the 1980's and the 1990's as the best managed of the Detroit carmakers. Ford held a rating of at least A on its long-term debt from 1984 through October 2001, when it was downgraded to BBB+. 
In announcing today's downgrade, S.& P. said it was concerned about the "adequacy of Ford's restructuring efforts." It said the benefits of the moves could be offset by a weaker car market. Many analysts expect October sales to soften significantly from the brisk pace of 17 million vehicles so far this year. 
They say consumers are losing interest in the extensive incentive programs, including zero percent financing and hefty rebates, that have helped spur sales. Moreover, S.& P. cited Ford's dwindling market share, which is down 1.7 percentage points this year, to 20.5 percent; that is five percentage points lower than four years ago.
The rating agency is also concerned about underfunded pension liabilities, a reason that it also cited in last week's G.M. downgrade. Ford expects to end the year with a $6 billion pension shortfall, double that of the smaller DaimlerChrysler. G.M. expects to end the year with a pension liability of almost $20 billion 
In discussing its negative outlook, S.& P. warned that Ford could be in danger of a further downgrade if the agency doubts that Ford can achieve a pretax profit in 2003, apart from its Ford Credit financing operations. 
Analysts said today's downgrade would have little immediate effect on Ford's long-term borrowing costs. The automaker had $162 billion in outstanding loans as of Sept. 30. It will need to borrow from $22 billion to $32 billion next year to finance its operations. But company executives said Ford expected only $7 billion to $15 billion of that money to be raised through unsecured bonds. That would be down from $22 billion this year. Ford has not said precisely when it will tap the bond market.
Analysts say they expect Ford to rely significantly on asset-backed securities, which would be a cheaper source of financing than the bond market. But the company is not expected to shift all of its borrowing to asset-backed securities, because it does not want to rely too much on a single source of financing. "The point they are trying to make," said a fixed-income securities analyst at a major Wall Street firm, "and we agree, is that they have some flexibility." 
The analyst, who was among those attending Ford's meetings with investors, praised the effort Mr. Ford and his management team are making to be forthright with Wall Street. The company has used the meetings, some which have been broadcast over the Internet, as a method of disclosing more steps Ford plans to take in its revitalization drive.
This week, for example, Mr. Ford vowed to increase cost-cutting by another $1 billion, from the $7 billion already announced, although he did not cite specific areas where the cuts would take place. 
Mr. Ford also said members of the Ford family were considering purchasing more common shares as a way to build confidence in Ford's turnaround.
Although Ford has been a publicly traded company since 1956, the family has voting control through special Class B stock.

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
The development of modern Buddhism is traced to a mix of Eastern and Western influences.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Although the historic Buddha, Prince Siddhartha Gautama, is said to have lived approximately 2,500 years ago, Buddhism is often viewed as the most modern of world religions. 
 Nontheistic, nondogmatic, nonviolent, emphasizing individual practice rather than institutional membership or obligations, the Buddhism expounded by, say, the Dalai Lama fits nicely with a modern, largely Western world view based on science and respect for the individual. Maybe that explains why it seems to attract so many physicists and psychotherapists. 
 Is this modernity surprising? Not really, because this Buddhism is itself a modern creation, a late-19th-century development deeply influenced by Western ideas even while emerging as a counterweight to Western colonial domination. 
That, at any rate, is the intriguing point made by Donald S. Lopez Jr., a leading scholar of Buddhism, in his introduction to "A Modern Buddhist Bible: Essential Readings from East and West," just published by Beacon Press and excerpted in the fall issue of the Buddhist review Tricycle.
Professor Lopez, who teaches Buddhist and Tibetan studies at the University of Michigan, describes how a handful of cosmopolitan Buddhist intellectuals from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Thailand, Burma (now Myanmar), China and Japan created this modern Buddhism. They were aided, curiously enough, by an American, Col. Henry Steel Olcott. 
In 1875, Olcott co-founded, with Helena Blavatsky, the Theosophical Society for the study and propagation of an esoteric religious knowledge drawing on spiritualism, Eastern religions and 19th-century science. Five years later, Olcott and Blavatsky went to Ceylon where he embraced Buddhism and was soon founding a Young Men's Buddhist Association, publishing the first "Buddhist Catechism," trying to unite all the different forms of Asian Buddhism around a common denominator of beliefs and encouraging the leaders and intellectuals who would reshape Buddhism for their time. 
Naturally, this new Buddhism presented itself as a return to the authentic teachings of the Buddha. The Buddhism of the Buddha's experience of enlightenment was seen, Professor Lopez writes, as "most compatible with the ideals of the European Enlightenment, ideals such as reason, empiricism, science, universalism, individualism, tolerance, freedom, and the rejection of religious orthodoxy -- precisely those notions that have appealed so much to Western converts." 
In effect, this modern Buddhism distanced itself from the actual Buddhism surrounding it. It rejected many ritual elements, Professor Lopez writes, implicitly conceding the charges of Western officials and missionaries that Buddhist populations were ridden by superstition and burdened by exploitative monastic establishments: "The time was ripe to remove the encrustations of the past centuries and return to the essence of Buddhism."
That essence was to be found in Buddhist texts and philosophy, not in the daily round of "monks who chanted sutras, performed rituals for the dead and maintained monastic properties."
The pervasive Buddhist practice of venerating images and relics of the Buddha, which Christian missionaries had considered idolatry, was de-emphasized. Traditional lines dividing monks and lay people were blurred. Important roles were restored to women. The fundamental Buddhist concern to bring an end to suffering now encompassed support for social justice, economic modernization and freedom from colonialism.
Central to modern Buddhism was meditation, an emphasis, Professor Lopez says, that "marked one of the most extreme departures of modern Buddhism from previous forms," which had made meditation only one of many spiritual activities and not necessarily the highest, even within monastic institutions.
Meditation now became a practice recommended for everyone -- and also "allowed modern Buddhism generally to dismiss the rituals of consecration, purification, expiation and exorcism so common throughout Asia as extraneous elements that had crept into the tradition," he writes.
The emergence of modern Buddhism, as Professor Lopez describes it, played out a little differently in each Buddhist land. It did not touch Tibetan Buddhism, for example, until the Dalai Lama left Tibet and interacted with a Western audience.
Professor Lopez also notes that this idea of periodically reforming Buddhism from inevitable decline by returning to its roots was found within the tradition itself. But a Westerner reading this history cannot help but think of another religious response to modernization, the Protestant Reformation, with its claim to restore a pure primitive Christianity, its emphasis on equality rather than hierarchy and its rejection of sacrament and ritual in favor of individual piety and introspection. 
Protestant as well as Enlightenment ideals were of course very much part of the Western modernity that these Asian Buddhist thinkers were coming to terms with. After all, the British arrived in India, where Buddhism had begun and once flourished, centuries after it had died out there. So they found "Buddhist texts, artifacts and stupas," Professor Lopez said in a phone conversation, "but no Buddhists." 
Thus Buddhism, he said, was a screen on which Europeans could project many of their own notions: the British in India, for example, sometimes calling the Buddha the "Luther of India" because he had supposedly challenged the Vedic priesthood and its rituals just as Luther had the Catholic priesthood and its sacramentalism. 
Not only did British ideas of Buddhism reflect Victorian anti-Catholicism, he said; sometimes they carried a whiff of anti-Semitism, too: Buddhism could be admired because, unlike Judaism, Christianity and Islam, it had no Semitic origins.
Professor Lopez, it should be emphasized, is not questioning the authenticity of this modern Buddhism; he wants to give its creators, who have often been dismissed by scholars, their due. 
Of course, his account does give the lie to the idea that the Buddhism the West -- and even some of the East -- now knows is the one true Buddhism, rather than one of the many Buddhisms that have evolved as an ancient teaching has interacted over two millennia with different cultures. 
But that idea should be disturbing only to those who believe that great religious traditions can remain immutable and untouched by history.

HEADLINE: RETRACING A TRAIL: POWER OF ILLUSION; 
Those Seeing White Vans Rest Easier. So Do the Drivers.

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

DATELINE: ROCKVILLE, Md., Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Until the final moments of the three-week reign of sniper terror in the Washington area, there was one image, one all-consuming clue, seared into the minds of a panicked public: the white van.
 White vans were pictured on wanted posters everywhere. Their drivers were stopped four, five, six times a day. They were forsaken by some, who rented or borrowed other vehicles because they simply could not take it anymore: the constant traffic stops, the swooping in of gun-wielding police officers, the stares from other drivers and pedestrians, the snooping around their license plates and sneaky peeks into their rear windows to check for rifles and other signs of sniping. 
 Each shooting and each day that passed without an arrest brought a new flood of tips and witness accounts involving white vans and trucks, seemingly fed by the earliest witness accounts. 
Witnesses to some of the first shootings were able to describe only a glimpse at a fleeing white vehicle, information that the police quickly released and eventually used to put together composite sketches. So there was nothing but a white van -- and before that, a white box truck -- to look for. With no description of the killer, many people, gripped with fear of another attack and seizing on any detail in their personal lookout for the sniper, were in a kind of white-van haze. 
Even at the very rest stop in Myersville, Md., 50 miles north of here, where two suspects were caught on Thursday while they snoozed in a blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice, it was a white van that had the overnight janitor so suspicious that he had walked over to it earlier to check it out. 
In Clinton, Md., at the apartment complex about 40 miles south of here that one of the suspects, John Allen Muhammad, had listed as a recent address, a resident said she was skeptical that a sniper had ever been there. "Where's the white van?" said the resident, Barbara Hardy, as reporters descended on the neighborhood. 
For a time, the police themselves were so focused on white vans and trucks -- there are roughly 100,000 on the roads of Washington and its suburbs -- that they may have overlooked the vehicle they really needed to find. In fact, officers in Washington stopped the blue Caprice, ran a check on its license plates and then allowed the two men to proceed only a couple of hours before one of the sniper killings.
The police say they cannot rule out the possibility that a white van or a white box truck was used at some point during the killing spree. But with the two suspects now definitively linked to the Chevrolet, the sight of a white van no longer strikes fear or instills suspicion, and driving one has certainly become less stressful.
"Darn right I'm glad it's over," said Sinclair Skinner, who drives a white van for his dry-cleaning delivery service but parked it two weeks ago after being stopped by the police twice in one day, and rented a car. "The police were stopping people, people were asking me all kinds of questions. Finally I said: 'Look, I'm not involved in anything. I'm not the Taliban. I wasn't in the gulf war. I'm a pacifist. I listen to Pacifica Radio.' "
A white box truck was the first type of vehicle sought in the sniper investigation, as a result of a witness account at the scene of a shooting in Olney, Md.
There, at the Leisure World Plaza shopping center, Sarah Ramos, 34, was gunned down as she sat on a bench in front of a post office. The only witness to that shooting, the third of five killings on Oct. 3, described a white box truck leaving the scene "at an unusually high rate of speed," said Derek Baliles, a public information officer for the Police Department here in Montgomery County.
The next day, an unidentified 43-year-old woman was shot in the parking lot of a Michael's Craft Store in Fredericksburg, Va.; she survived. Witnesses there described seeing a white van with a ladder rack on the roof leaving the scene, a piece of information that was broadcast and quickly put everyone on the lookout for white vans.
Over the course of the next several days and the next several shootings, more descriptions of white vans emerged from witnesses. By Oct. 15, the police had enough information to release composite sketches of two white vans: a Chevrolet Astro and a Ford Econoline. At that point, the white-van frenzy was in full swing. 
Then, after the sniper wounded a man at a Ponderosa restaurant in Ashland, Va., last Saturday night, the police staked out a telephone booth not far away, from which they believed the sniper had already called them at least once. Two men driving a white van were arrested after stopping at the phone booth to make a call. As it turned out, they were simply illegal immigrants, who were turned over to immigration authorities. 
Meanwhile, the police, including all 1,000 officers on the Montgomery County force, the lead agency in the investigation, combed the area for white vans. When a van was stopped, several police cars often surrounded it, and officers drew their guns, sometimes telling the drivers to come out with their hands up and then ordering them to lie face down on the ground.
The white van, said Officer Baliles, "was the best lookout we had." 
"I still think we did the right thing," he said. "It inconvenienced some people, but no one complained. They complied. In some cases they brushed the dirt off their faces and their shirts, and they thanked us."

 BODY:
Paul Wellstone often seemed out of step. He called himself a liberal when many used that word as a slur. He voted against the Persian Gulf war in his first year in the Senate, and this month opposed using force against Iraq.
 Senator Wellstone, 58, who died in a plane crash today while campaigning for re-election, fought for bills favored by unions and advocates of family farmers and the poor, and against those favored by banks, agribusiness and large corporations. 
 This year he was the principal opponent of legislation supported by large majorities of Democrats and Republicans that would make it more difficult for people to declare bankruptcy. He argued that the measure would enrich creditors at the expense of people "in brutal economic circumstances." He advocated causes like national health insurance that even many of his fellow liberals abandoned as futile. 
Mr. Wellstone was a rumpled, unfailingly modest man who, unlike many of his colleagues, lived on his Senate salary. He was married to the former Sheila Ison for 39 years, having married at 19 when he was in college. His wife and their 33-year-old daughter, Marcia, also died today in the crash.
When Mr. Wellstone arrived in the Senate in 1991, he was a firebrand who thought little of breaking the Senate tradition of comity and personally attacking his colleagues. He told an interviewer soon after he was elected that Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican, "represents everything to me that is ugly and wrong and awful about politics." 
But as the years passed, Mr. Wellstone moderated his personality if not his politics and became well liked by Republicans as well as Democrats. Bob Dole, the former Senate Republican leader who often tangled with Mr. Wellstone on legislation, choked up today when he told a television interviewer that Mr. Wellstone was "a decent, genuine guy who had a different philosophy from almost everyone else in the Senate."
Mr. Wellstone was also an accomplished campaigner. Though he had never held elected office, he pulled off a major upset in 1990 when, running on a shoestring budget, he defeated the incumbent Republican senator, Rudy Boschwitz. He beat Mr. Boschwitz in a rematch in 1996. This year, he reneged on a promise to limit himself to two terms, ran for re-election and seemed in the most recent public polls to have pulled slightly ahead of his Republican challenger, former Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul.
His opponents always portrayed him as a left-wing extremist. Mr. Boschwitz's television commercials in 1996 called Mr. Wellstone "embarrassingly liberal and out of touch." This year, Mr. Coleman said the senator was "so far out of the mainstream, so extreme, that he can't deliver for Minnesotans."
But on the campaign trail, Mr. Wellstone appeared to be so happy, so comfortable, so unthreatening that he was able to ward off the attacks.
For years, he had walked with a pronounced limp that he attributed to an old wrestling injury. In February, he announced at a news conference that he had learned he had multiple sclerosis, but he said the illness would not affect his campaigning or his ability to sit in the Senate. "I have a strong mind -- although there are some that might disagree about that -- I have a strong body, I have a strong heart, I have a strong soul," he told reporters.
Paul David Wellstone was born in Washington on July 21, 1944, and grew up in Arlington, Va. His father, Leon, left Russia as a child to escape the persecution of Jews, and worked as a writer for the United States Information Agency. His mother, Minnie, the daughter of immigrants from Russia, worked in a junior high school cafeteria.
Growing up, he was more interested in wrestling than politics, and he had some difficulty in school because of what he later found out was a learning disability. He scored lower than 800, out of a total of 1,600, on his College Boards, and this led him as a senator to oppose measures that emphasized standardized test scores. In an interview, he once said that even as an adult he had difficulty interpreting charts and graphs quickly but that he had learned to overcome his disability by studying harder and taking more time to absorb information.
Partly because of his wrestling ability -- he was a conference champion at 126 pounds -- he was admitted to the University of North Carolina and, galvanized by the civil rights movement, he turned from wrestling to politics. He graduated in 1965 and stayed in Chapel Hill for a doctorate in political science. He wrote his thesis on the roots of black militancy.
Married with children, he once said he did not have time to participate in the student uprisings in the 1960's. He is survived by two grown sons, David and Mark, of St. Paul, and six grandchildren.
But while he was not a student rebel, Mr. Wellstone did not fit in from the day in 1969 when he began teaching political science at Carleton College, a small liberal arts campus in rural Northfield, Minn.
He was more interested in leading his students in protests than he was in publishing in academic journals, and he was often at odds with his colleagues and Carleton administrators. He fought the college's investments in companies doing business in South Africa, battled local banks that foreclosed on farms, picketed with strikers at a meat-packing plant and taught classes off campus rather than cross a picket line when Carleton's custodians were on strike.
In 1974, the college told him his contract would not be renewed. But with strong support from students, the student newspaper and local activists, he appealed the dismissal, and it was reversed.
In 1982, Mr. Wellstone dipped his toe into the political waters for the first time and ran for state auditor. He lost. But he had made contacts in the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and he stayed active in politics. In 1988, he was the state co-chairman of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign in the presidential primary, and in the general election, he was co-chairman of the campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee.
Few thought he had a chance when he announced that he would run for the Senate against Mr. Boschwitz. Russell D. Feingold, now a like-minded liberal Democratic senator from Wisconsin, today had this recollection of dropping by to meet Mr. Wellstone in 1989:
"He opened the door, and there he was with his socks off, 15 books open that he was reading, and he was on the phone arguing with somebody about Cuba. He gave me coffee, and we laughed uproariously at the idea that either of us would ever be elected. But he pulled it off in 1990 and gave me the heart to do it in Wisconsin."
Mr. Feingold was elected in 1992, also with a tiny treasury.
Mr. Boschwitz spent $7 million on his campaign, seven times Mr. Wellstone's budget. To counteract the Boschwitz attacks, Mr. Wellstone ran witty, even endearing television commercials produced without charge by a group led by a former student. In one ad, the video and audio were speeded up, and Mr. Wellstone said he had to talk fast because "I don't have $6 million to spend." 
Mr. Wellstone toured the state in a battered green school bus, and in the end, he won 50.4 percent of the vote and was the only challenger in 1990 to defeat an incumbent senator.
He arrived in Washington as something of a rube. On one of his first days in town before he was sworn in, he called a reporter for the name of a restaurant where he could get a cheap dinner. When the reporter replied that he knew a place where a good meal was only $15, Mr. Wellstone said $15 was many times what he was prepared to spend.
He also made what he later conceded were "rookie mistakes." At one point, for instance, he used the Vietnam Veterans Memorial as a backdrop for a news conference to oppose the war against Iraq. Veterans' groups denounced him, and he later apologized.
But he soon warmed to the ways of the Senate and became especially adept at the unusual custom of giving long speeches to an empty chamber. Probably no one in the Senate over the last dozen years gave more speeches at night after nearly all the other senators had gone home.
His strength was not in getting legislation enacted. One successful measure he sponsored in 1996 with Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, requires insurance companies in some circumstances to give coverage to people with mental illness, but he failed this year in an effort to strengthen the law.
In a book he published last year, "The Conscience of a Liberal" (Random House), Mr. Wellstone wrote, "I feel as if 80 percent of my work as a senator has been playing defense, cutting the extremist enthusiasms of the conservative agenda (much of which originates in the House) rather than moving forward on a progressive agenda."
In a speech in the Senate this month explaining his opposition to the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, Mr. Wellstone stressed that Saddam Hussein was "a brutal, ruthless dictator who has repressed his own people."
But Mr. Wellstone went on to say: "Despite a desire to support our president, I believe many Americans still have profound questions about the wisdom of relying too heavily on a pre-emptive go-it-alone military approach. Acting now on our own might be a sign of our power. Acting sensibly and in a measured way, in concert with our allies, with bipartisan Congressional support, would be a sign of our strength."
Later, Mr. Wellstone told a reporter that he did not believe his stance would hurt him politically. "What would really hurt," he said, "is if I was giving speeches and I didn't even believe what I was saying. Probably what would hurt is if people thought I was doing something just for political reasons."
Mr. Wellstone briefly considered running for president in 2000, but he called off the campaign because, he said, the doctors who had been treating him for a ruptured disk told him that his back could not stand the travel that would be required.
Often, Mr. Wellstone was the only senator voting against a measure, or one of only a few. He was, for instance, one of three senators in 1999 to support compromise missile defense legislation. He was the only one that year to vote against an education bill involving standardized tests, and the only Democrat who opposed his party's version of lowering the estate tax.
Mr. Wellstone was one of the few senators who made the effort to meet and remember the names of elevator operators, waiters, police officers and other workers in the Capitol.
James W. Ziglar, a Republican who was sergeant at arms of the Senate from 1998 to 2001 and who is now commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, remembered today "the evening when he came back to the Capitol well past midnight to visit with the cleaning staff and tell them how much he appreciated their efforts."
"Most of the staff had never seen a senator and certainly had never had one make such a meaningful effort to express his or her appreciation," Mr. Ziglar said. "That was the measure of the man."

HEADLINE: Keeping U.S. No. 1: Is It Wise? Is It New? 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
President Bush's release of an audacious new strategy last month for defending America against future foreign threats stunned Washington and even some close allies. The 33-page document, titled the "National Security Strategy of the United States," ostensibly departed from what had been the longstanding conventional wisdom about American strategy. 
 Initially, expert scrutiny focused on the president's assertion that the United States would "not hesitate" to act alone and "pre-emptively" to thwart dangers from hostile states or terrorist groups armed with, or seeking, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. 
 More recently, however, analysts have been centering on the Bush doctrine's last chapter. America, it states, is the world's strongest nation, enjoying "unparalleled military strength," and will never again allow its military supremacy to be challenged as it was during the cold war. 
"Our forces will be strong enough," the document says, "to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States."
That is strong stuff, even by swashbuckling Texas standards. Containing rather than vanquishing enemies and maintaining a balance of power has been a mainstay of American foreign policy since the end of the Second World War. It is not surprising, then, that much of the reaction to what has been dubbed the "Hertz doctrine" ("We're No. 1") has been negative. 
"Almost every part of the Bush doctrine can be defended except that assertion," said Kurt Campbell, a Pentagon official in the Clinton administration who is now senior vice president of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "It not only says that we're Hertz," he said, "but that we're going to discourage strong market competition from Avis."
To much of the world, he argues, "the doctrine says: we know best." He continued, "At some point, even if you are democratic and wildly successful, we are going to discourage your growth." 
Ashton B. Carter, another Clinton Pentagon official and now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, called the statement "strategically unwise and utterly unnecessary."
"It makes a doctrine out of a physical fact," he said, "and puts it in everyone's face." 
Even Philip Zelikow, a former staff member on the first Bush administration's National Security Council who is close to senior White House officials, called the doctrine "aggressively opaque." "The policy implications of the idea are very unclear," he said.
Yet to Richard Pipes, a Harvard University history professor emeritus, such criticisms are off the mark. Whether or not the United States likes it, he says, "we wind up being responsible, and it's useful to remind people that we are aware not only of our power but of its responsibilities." Other nations must realize, he argues, "that we will not be intimidated or dissuaded from exercising power when our national security interest depends on it." What the pre-eminence doctrine says, he continues, is that "while we want to cooperate with the rest of the world, in the end we must decide."
If there is debate over the wisdom of the blunt policy statement, there is also disagreement over just how new it is. Although many have characterized the doctrine as radically different, several experts have argued that, in fact, it echoes earlier formulations of similar sentiments.
Consider, for example, the Pentagon's policy memorandum that was leaked to the press in March 1992, less than two years after the Soviet Union's demise. Touching off fierce debate at the time, the Defense Department asserted that America's prime political and military mission after the cold war was to ensure that no rival superpower would emerge in Europe, Asia or the former Soviet Union. 
America's primary national security goal, the Pentagon then argued, was to convince "potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests." Toward that end, the document maintained, Washington had to "discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order."
Mr. Campbell says that the doctrine led to resistance partly because it was aimed not at China, today's strategic preoccupation, but at Japan and Germany, democratic allies. "But what was then viewed as dangerously provocative has now crept into the national policy of the United States," he said. "It shows you what has happened in only a decade."
The 46-page policy statement in 1992, issued by Dick Cheney, defense secretary then and vice president now, was drafted largely by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the current deputy defense secretary, who was then undersecretary of defense for policy. 
But Bush Republicans, and the G.O.P. in general, have no monopoly on doctrines of pre-eminence, pre-emption or dissuasion. Variations on these themes were explored, albeit more obliquely, in an initiative unveiled in December 1993 by President Bill Clinton's defense secretary, Les Aspin. The policy, Mr. Aspin said at the time, would help the United States deal with a "Saddam Hussein with nukes," either in a "reactive" or a "pre-emptive" mode. 
Professor Carter noted that the Aspin initiative also spoke of "dissuading" states from challenging American might by acquiring weapons of mass destruction. "In our era," said Professor Carter, then an assistant secretary for the Office of Counterproliferation, "that concept translated as: don't even try."
In fact, some scholars maintain that President Bush's pre-eminence doctrine merely articulates what has been America's unstated policy since its inception.
John J. Mearsheimer, a professor at the University of Chicago and the author of "The Tragedy of Great Power Politics," argues that for nearly two centuries the United States has worked hard to be the most powerful state in the world and to prevent rivals from emerging. 
"The historical record is clear," he said. "The U.S. has gone to great lengths to be the dominant power on the earth, first by achieving hegemony in its own region and then by preventing the rise of a peer competitor in other regions like Asia and Europe."
In the 19th century, Professor Mearsheimer argues, the United States struggled for regional hegemony by conquering much of North America, justifying it by the notion of Manifest Destiny. Even before came the Monroe Doctrine, in which America's fifth president warned Europeans that "we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."
By the end of the 19th century, Mr. Mearsheimer said, America's regional hegemony had largely been established. The United States spent most of the 20th century ensuring that "no other state duplicated that accomplishment." 
After 45 years of cold war and containing the Soviet Union, the United States was clearly not eager to envisage a second round of bipolar politics, much less a multipolar world in which the desires of regional powers would have to be taken into account.
The impulse promulgated in the Bush doctrine is certainly not new, he said. "What is new here is that the United States has actually acknowledged what it does, rather than gussy up its impulses with liberal rhetoric." 
If the doctrine is clearly stated, however, just what that means is not. Many Pentagon veterans agree that asserting pre-eminence doesn't take policymakers very far in grappling with how to respond to, say, North Korea's acknowledgment that it is now openly seeking nuclear weapons.
"The issue is not whether we're the strongest nation," said Leslie H. Gelb, president of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. "We are, in fact, stronger even than the British Empire was at its peak. The issue is what can you accomplish through military power -- by being No. 1. And are you using this enormous power in the right way?"
On that score, he said, the Bush administration's record to date is mixed. Mr. Gelb gives the Bush team high marks for its policies on combating terrorism. But he is less impressed with other international initiatives, especially the administration's handling of its "muscular, tough, and essentially correct" stance toward Iraq.
"The diplomacy supporting the case for military action has not been well made," Mr. Gelb said, "which is key to employing the power they claim well."
Charles A. Kupchan, a National Security Council staff member in the Clinton administration and the author of "The End of the American Era: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Geopolitics of the Twenty-first Century," warned that the pre-eminence doctrine's "neo-imperialist overtones" could well cause "the very countervailing coalition that the administration says it is trying to avoid." 
"A country which has as much power as the United States must be concerned about how that power is used and perceived," he said. "If you combine pronounced military superiority with the absence of rhetorical and actual self-restraint, the United States risks setting itself against the rest of the world."
Michael Anton, a White House spokesman, counters that one of the document's virtues is that it states precisely and strongly what American policy is. "It's a lot like deterrence," he said. "You need to be absolutely clear that there will be a devastating response to aggression. Dissuasion, too, works that way. You can encourage other countries to channel their economic, political and human resources into more productive avenues and away from the military." 
But even Professor Mearsheimer, who applauds the administration for some of its straight talk, fears the blunt language about pre-eminence may backfire. "We should not be standing on the rooftop shouting that we're No. 1 and we plan to stay that way when we're trying to build coalitions against terror," he said. At such a time, he went on, "velvet gloves are essential for winning the war against terrorism and making American foreign policy work." 
He has a deeper concern: he challenges the notion that the United States, or any single power, can achieve global hegemony for any length of time. Eliminating competitors is not the same as dominating the world, he argues. "Even now, when we're the most powerful state on earth, we could not conquer and dominate China," he said. "They would put up a real fight."
Over time, Professor Mearsheimer said, China, given its population -- five times that of the United States -- and its growing economic might, will become more and more of a competitor: "Do we really want to prevent them from growing? The rhetoric, for all its clarity, is unclear on how to achieve it in the face of a rising power."
If global hegemony is the administration's real goal, he warns, "we will have our hands full and will ultimately fail."

HEADLINE: What Al Qaeda Learned in D.C. 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Does everyone feel safe now?
 There are good reasons why the sniper siege terrified Americans who were far from the line of fire, but they're not the reasons that have dominated the media babble. It's not that we all have relatives in Washington or knew a child slated to go there on a school trip. It's not that we were watching too much bad TV. Sure, cable dished out the story as if it were Gary Condit or shark attacks redux, with hapless CNN going so far as trying to add actors from CBS's "Crime Scene Investigation" to its already inept roster of profiling pundits. But however trivializing the style of presentation, the content was weighty. The reason that a USA Today/CNN poll this week found that the sniper was the second most highly watched news story in a decade, second only to 9/11, may be that Americans intuitively sensed that it could be the second most important story as well. 
 What made the story both scary and substantial was the mercilessness with which it exposed our permeability to a terrorist attack at home more than a year after 9/11 "changed everything." Whether this Muhammad was an Atta sympathizer or not, the fact remains that one or two gunmen were able to paralyze the capital of the most powerful nation in the world for three weeks, to the point of threatening the ability of citizens to carry out the most fundamental rite of democracy, freely walking into polling places on Election Day. Media critics complained that the sniper usurped more significant news stories like Iraq, Bali and Moscow, but in truth these are all strands of a single story. Each day that the sniper remained in charge was a day likely to embolden our foes, just as we prepare to expand the war on terrorism. "Even if the sniper isn't connected to Al Qaeda, he's showing our vulnerability," said John McCain when I spoke to him the day before the suspects were identified. 
After the bombing in Bali, Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, was moved to observe that it was "a wake-up call for the Indonesians." Are we sleeping through our own wake-up call? Relief that the killers seem to have been caught should not be confused with closure. We must not now forget that the failures of cooperation between federal and local law enforcement as the sniper piled up his kills were a replay of the turf wars between Rudolph Giuliani's cops and the feds after last fall's still-unsolved anthrax attack. The Pentagon, which may soon face the task of tracking down Saddam Hussein in a city of five million, made the mistake of tipping off the sniper of its air surveillance plans for the D.C. area. The syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin argues persuasively that the I.N.S.'s decision to release John Lee Malvo after his December 2001 arrest by immigration authorities was "in clear violation of federal law."
These are merely the leading indicators of a larger drift into complacency that is hardly limited to this one form of terrorism or a single city. Just how much so was cataloged yesterday by the Council on Foreign Relations, which released an alarming document with a most un-council-like title to match: "America Still Unprepared -- America Still in Danger." The report is the work of a bipartisan task force headed by Warren Rudman and Gary Hart and stocked with intelligence, military and foreign-policy heavies as various as the former F.B.I. superagent James Kallstrom, the Iraq hawk George Shultz and the former N.I.H. head Harold Varmus. "The next attack will result in even greater casualties and widespread disruption to American lives and the economy," they wrote. 
The facts back up their fears. They found that the nation's 650,000 local and state police still have no access to federal terrorist watch lists. They found minimal surveillance of the potentially explosive cargo containers transported to and within the U.S. by ship, truck and train. (We seem to be making the unwarranted assumption that Al Qaeda's next attack will again be by plane.) Though President Bush told the nation this month that a single "Iraqi intelligence operative" could with one "small container" wreak havoc with chemical and biological weapons, we are largely defenseless against such an attack: "Police, firefighters and emergency medical personnel in most of the nation's cities and counties are no better prepared to react now than they were prior to September 11."
The report, which can and must be read at www.cfr.org, does offer fixes, some of them fairly quick, for the shortfalls. Stopgap communications equipment for law enforcement officers can be purchased off the shelf. Local emergency centers can hire retired medical workers to be on call should Mr. Bush's dire warning come true. But most of these recommendations include the verb "fund" -- as in, someone will actually have to pony up for them, and soon. "The states are in dire straits and the federal government has to step in," says Mr. Rudman, a fiscally conservative Republican. "We have to do something. Give up a tax cut, pay a surcharge, something. This is a damn war we're involved in. We can't expect all this to materialize out of the air." Yet there is not a leader in either party who has the guts to call for such a sacrifice from America's taxpayers. Thus the federal government has authorized only $92 million toward the estimated $2 billion needed to secure our ports, at which 21,000 containers arrive each day.
Mr. Hart says that what united the entire task force was the feeling that there's "no sense of urgency and we have slipped back into business as usual." For him and Mr. Rudman, it's deja vu. In 1998, they had been put in charge of a similar Defense Department task force initiated by Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. In their January 2001 report, they foresaw terrorism on "American soil" leading to mass death; they proposed, among other possible protections, a department of homeland security. The Bush administration brushed off their recommendations, and the press, including The Times, largely ignored them, too. Even now, after 9/11 dramatized how prescient their findings were, the department of homeland security is still gridlocked in the Senate. Mr. Hart in part faults his own party's intransigence on civil service protections for what he considers an unconscionable delay.
Whether the new Hart-Rudman report will be ignored as the first was is as yet unknown. But the bizarre air of unreality in our public life right now doesn't fill one with hope. It's as if we can't seem to break the bad habits that led up to 9/11. In February 2001, the C.I.A. chief, George Tenet, testified before Congress that Osama bin Laden and his network were "the most immediate and serious threat" to the U.S. and that they were likely to stage "simultaneous attacks" producing "mass casualties." Few in government, including at his own agency, felt any great urgency about it then, and neither did the public. But did Mr. Tenet's parallel testimony of little more than a week ago have much more impact? Lest anyone forget, he said that Al Qaeda was "reconstituted" and "coming after us," fomenting a threat level as bad as that of summer 2001. 
In Washington, though, the threat level remains frozen at yellow. The Democrats have gone home to decry the economy. The president is off campaigning, too, outdoing even his predecessor in money raised and days devoted to sheer politics. Poor old Charlton Heston could be found waving his rifle to cheering crowds, defending his Second Amendment rights uber alles, even as a man with a rifle was bagging human game in the capital. Neither the president nor Tom Daschle wanted to do more than ask for a study or "take a look" at the terrorism-fighting possibilities of ballistics fingerprinting. Just before Congress left town, a long-overdue 9/11 investigative commission was scuttled once more -- by the White House, according to John McCain and other witnesses. Is ignorance bliss? "You can't prevent a repetition of an act of terror unless you know all the events leading up to it," the senator says. 
Speaking from his home state of Colorado, Gary Hart said, "The attitude is that it's not going to happen here." I had asked him if he agreed with my perception that terrorism seems a much less pressing threat when you talk to Americans outside the D.C.-N.Y. axis. "It's an East Coast problem, maybe a West Coast problem," he said, giving his take on the local mood. "And that's tragically mistaken. The next targets could be Denver, Cleveland, Dallas. The way you demonstrate a country's vulnerability is to attack it everywhere."
Certainly our enemies learned this month, as Mr. Rudman puts it, "how easy this kind of terrorism is to carry out." Did we?

HEADLINE: Pirate Haunt Where Bush Will Meet World Leaders 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico , Oct. 25 

 BODY:
This is Margaritaville. It is a strange place for a summit meeting, visited more by pirates than presidents, where American dollars are turning a natural paradise into a money machine.
 President Bush is coming here on Saturday for talks with world leaders at the Asia Pacific Economic Conference. He will be wrapped in a bubble of expensive isolation, as unnatural as the green golf courses here in the desert where foursomes pay $1,000 for a round. 
 As the president talks about uniting the world against Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, sun-baked American tourists will be gathering at the town's two most popular nightspots -- Squid Roe and the Giggling Marlin -- where drinks are sold by the yard and waiters feed customers tequila as if fattening geese for the kill.
Everybody dresses alike. Everybody speaks English. Everybody takes dollars. In its way, it is a truly international place. In the context of the forces of economic development that this global conference is promoting, that may be a good thing. For good or ill, those same forces are turning Cabo San Lucas into an international funhouse, a turbo-powered tourist mecca as far from Mexico as the dark side of the moon.
Mexico's own delegation is staying at a place called Las Ventanas, where a hamburger costs $15 and caviar is sold by the bucket. Massages for pets are available by appointment. The best rooms go for $2,200 a night, more than many Mexicans make in a year. Visitors feel as if they could be at any five-star resort anywhere in the world -- and that, apparently, is the point.
Down 1,100 miles of bad road from San Diego, where the highway running south from the California dream peters out into the Pacific, this was a beautifully isolated place 20 years ago. It is still staggeringly beautiful, where untouched by the hand of man.
But that road is now well paved. Daily flights bring more than half a million people a year, five times the local population. With the tourists came rampant development, along with darker forces like drugs and prostitution.
The first businessmen here were 16th-century pirates, who sacked the Spanish galleons coming from the Philippines. Their descendants are flourishing.
David Halliburton Jr. runs one of the oldest hotels in Cabo San Lucas, Twin Dolphin, and has been living here, on and off, since 1962, when he was 5.
"This was in some ways a forgotten paradise until a bunch of crazy Californians and a handful of Mexicans started developing and to some extent taming a wild area," Mr. Halliburton said. "In the last 15 or 20 years, you've seen an influx of people who don't see the beauty of the desert and the sea and have pretty much rolled right over it for profit.
"It was too much, too quick, too much money-grubbing and profit-taking, too many places extracting as much money out of their guests as possible, destroying everything and creating a world where there's no way of knowing where you are -- no history, no sense of place, all smoke and mirrors."
In some ways, then, this is a perfect place for a 21st-century global conference -- a pretty place rapidly becoming an artificial everyplace, and no place at all.
That sense of floating amid economic bubbles grew today when a gigantic inflated tent, suspended entirely by air pressure, collapsed at the conference site. It had been blown up to house a formal dinner for Mr. Bush and other world leaders Saturday night. No one knows why the bubble burst.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE NUCLEAR CRISIS; 
North Korea Demands U.S. Agree to Nonagression Pact

BYLINE:  By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
North Korea demanded today that the United States agree to a nonaggression pact before giving up its nuclear weapons program. 
 In a statement issued at the United Nations and in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, North Korea said that the Bush administration's inclusion of it as part of an "axis of evil" and Washington's policy of pre-emptive attacks amounted to a "declaration of war" that threatened North Korea's existence. 
 The North Koreans argued that they could not halt their program to develop nuclear arms without assurances that Washington would not launch a nuclear strike first. 
The statement, North's Korea's first formal response since the United States canceled a 1994 nuclear agreement, seemed timed to coincide with the meeting today at the between President Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China at Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex. 
On Saturday, Mr. Bush will attend the summit meeting in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, of the Pacific Rim countries, where he will meet with President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. Mr. Bush is working to forge a coordinated response to the crisis that arose after North Korea admitted it had been secretly working for years on building a nuclear weapon. 
In Crawford, a senior Bush administration official expressed extreme skepticism about the prospect of the United States entering a nonaggression pact with North Korea. 
"We have no aggressive plans on the Korean peninsula," the official said. He noted that North Korea has in the past linked talk of nonaggression to demands for the withdrawal of all American troops from the Korean peninsula. Washington has no plans to remove the 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea. 
The Bush administration has insisted that North Korea renounce all nuclear weapons before a dialogue can begin. 
North Korea's statement said that Mr. Bush's declaration last year including Pyongyang with Iraq and Iran in an "axis of evil" had in practice nullified the 1994 nuclear agreement. 
North Korean officials also concluded after the visit in early October of a senior American diplomat, James A. Kelly, that the Bush administration had "gone to the extremes" to block the tentative opening in recent months between the two Koreas, the North Korean statement said. 
"The U.S. attitude was so unilateral and highhanded that the D.P.R.K. was stunned by it," it said of Mr. Kelly's visit and referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name. 
Their reading of his message led North Korean officials to tell Mr. Kelly that their country "was entitled to possess not only nuclear weapons but any type of weapon more powerful" as a defense from an American nuclear attack. 
At a news conference at the United Nations today, the North Korean delegate, Pak Gil Yon, repeated this idea, saying North Korea felt it had the right to build a weapon "more powerful than a nuclear weapon based on enriched uranium." He declined to clarify further. 
North Korea said it was ready to seek a peaceful settlement if the United States would recognize its sovereignty in a pact barring military attacks, and "does not hinder" Pyongyang's economic development. The United States has maintained economic sanctions against North Korea.
But North Korea said it "values sovereignty more than life," and is "ready to die" to defend itself from American hostility. 
South Korean and American officials have been searching for common ground between their conflicting aims. South Korea wants a fresh round of talks with the North, while the Bush administration has demanded that the North dismantle its entire nuclear weapons program, as it promised to do in the 1994 agreement.
In meetings in Pyongyang earlier this week, Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's second-highest official, told South Korean officials that he would welcome a "peaceful solution through dialogue" to the nuclear crisis, provided the United States gave up its "hostile policies."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DOMESTIC SECURITY; 
U.S. Vulnerability to Terror Is Still High, Panel Concludes

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Former Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman, the co-chairmen of a panel on domestic security, sharply chastised the White House and Congress today for failing to enact sweeping measures to defend the nation against a catastrophic terrorist attack, which they predicted is virtually certain to occur. 
 The senators said that although the country should be on a war footing, it has become complacent about terrorism. They accused Washington of taking "symbolic" actions to bolster the nation's defenses while leaving more costly and far-reaching legislation -- including a bill to create a Department of Homeland Security -- tied up in partisan disputes. 
 As a result, the senators and their task force concluded, the country remains almost as vulnerable today as it was before Sept. 11, 2001, to a major attack against its sea ports, power plants, oil refineries, rail systems and urban centers. 
Referring to his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, Mr. Rudman, a Republican from New Hampshire, said, "It is time for action, and if you don't take it, there will be hell to pay for anyone who looks like an obstructionist."
Mr. Hart, a Democrat from Colorado, said he felt "outraged" at Congress's paralysis, contending that individual lawmakers from both parties had allowed their "polarizing agenda" to be more important than the national interest. 
"Our government teeters on the brink of not being functional, and I think in this case particularly the legislative branch," Mr. Hart said. 
Warning the nation against complacency, he called on President Bush to invite leaders from major industries to the White House and tell them it was their patriotic duty to protect their operations from attacks. 
"You have a new job and that is to help this country by protecting your specific industries," Mr. Hart said the president should tell corporate leaders. "We don't want a lot of foot dragging here. The issue isn't just your profits and losses, the issue is the economy of this country. And we expect you to cooperate and do what it takes."
The former senators made their harsh remarks during a news conference to release their panel's report, titled, "America Still Unprepared, America Still in Danger." The report, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, provided a grim assessment of the nation's preparedness to deter or respond to a major terrorist attack. 
The survey, conducted over the past eight weeks, found that: local police officials have limited access to intelligence reports on suspected terrorists; only a small number of ships and containers entering American seaports are inspected; most emergency workers are ill equipped to handle biological and chemical attacks; and fire and police officials in most cities do not have radios that allow them to communicate with each other. 
One of the report's central assertions is that deterring terrorism has become vital to protecting the economy, and that corporate leaders should therefore join government in defending major industries like energy, pharmaceuticals, finance and transportation.
"Terrorists have learned you get a very big bang for your buck, you get profound societal and economic disruption by engaging in this form of warfare," said Stephen E. Flynn, the project director. "If your adversaries were not aware of this prior to Sept. 11, they have that example now at the forefront. And it is only prudent that we assume that they are operating from that premise."
Gordon D. Johndroe, a spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland Security, said it was "absolutely not the case" that the nation is as vulnerable to a major terrorist attack today as it was a year ago. He argued that the administration has taken numerous steps to improve domestic security, including expanding pharmaceutical stockpiles, stationing inspectors at overseas ports -- including in Shanghai, it was announced today -- and pressing corporations to improve security screening of employees.
But Mr. Johndroe did criticize Congress for failing to enact the president's proposal to create a federal Department of Homeland Security and to pass spending bills that would allocate billions of dollars for security programs. Democrats have countered that Mr. Bush has obstructed the appropriations process by threatening to veto spending bills he considers too large.
In addition, legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security has been stalled by a dispute over workers rights. 
The Hart-Rudman panel -- which included two former secretaries of state, two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs and two Nobel laureates -- recommended that the National Guard be trained and equipped to play a lead role in responding to major terrorist attacks. 
The panel also called for establishing 24-hour operations centers in every state to link local and federal law enforcement agencies; strengthening security at seaports, oil refineries and power plants; and increasing federal spending to help local governments buy equipment and improve training.
"The world is divided between those who believe the worst is over and those who believe the worst is yet to come," Mr. Hart said. "Unfortunately, I fall into the latter group."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: EAST AND WEST AT THE RANCH; 
Bush and Jiang Vow to Cooperate on North Korea Issue

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Oct. 25 

 BODY:
President Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China publicly vowed today to work together to persuade North Korea to abandon its newest nuclear weapons project, though they carefully wended their way around the divisive question of whether China would take part in Washington's emerging strategy of economically isolating the North unless it complied.
 Their comments came during a break in a four-hour meeting here at Mr. Bush's ranch that was initially planned as a largely ceremonial farewell visit for Mr. Jiang as he gives up China's presidency, but which turned into a strategy session on how to deal with a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula and the disarming of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
 Mr. Bush said at a short news conference outside his home that the two men had agreed that Iraq had to "fully disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction." Mr. Jiang, however, carefully evaded answering any questions about Iraq. 
Mr. Bush's aides acknowledged continuing disagreements between China and the United States on Iraq, but said the two men had not discussed specifics of a United Nations resolution on Iraq. In the end, the aides believe that Beijing will abstain from any vote.
Mr. Jiang, as is his habit, stuck close to his prepared script today, using the visit to cement his reputation as the Chinese leader who defused tensions between Beijing and Washington after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. One participant in the meeting said the discussion had turned briefly to whether Mr. Jiang planned to retire from power fully when he relinquishes his title to a successor. 
"We raised that slightly," the administration official said, relating that Mr. Jiang, a master of cryptic understatements, said only, "Ah, yes, many people are talking about that." 
At every moment, Mr. Jiang sought to file down the edges of differences with Mr. Bush. Perhaps to signal that he does not have as much influence over North Korea as the White House hopes, he told reporters that he had been "completely in the dark" about North Korea's secret nuclear project. That statement raised some eyebrows because the administration believes that Chinese companies played a small role in selling technology to Pyongyang. 
But the desire to avoid divisive issues ran deep, and as soon as the two men finished a talk that lasted an hour or so, they and their wives jammed into Mr. Bush's white extended-cab truck for a tour of the ranch. That was followed by a lunch catered by one of Mr. Bush's favorite barbecue restaurants, which fed the two couples Southern fried catfish, barbecued brisket, black-eyed pea salad, and brownies, lemon bars and miniature pecan pies, known to children across Texas as pecan tassies.
Speaking in a helicopter hangar on the ranch to stay out of the drizzle, Mr. Bush was asked directly whether he would negotiate with North Korea while it was still developing nuclear weapons, the path that the North seemed to argue for today. 
The president never answered directly, saying, "We will continue to work with our allies." But his aides, speaking on background, said North Korea "would not be rewarded for bad behavior."
Mr. Bush, his aides have said in recent days, has no intention of repeating the path taken by the Clinton administration in 1994, when it agreed to provide energy to North Korea in return for its freezing of its nuclear programs. 
"We are at the beginning of a campaign to mobilize the world against this program, and I think we are making good progress," the official said, adding later that he expects a "strong statement" from the United States, South Korea and Japan on Saturday after Mr. Bush, on the edges of the Asian economic summit conference in Mexico, meets the leaders of both countries for the first time since the North Korean disclosure.
The administration was happy to hear Mr. Jiang declare, in very blunt terms today, that "China has always held the position that the Korean peninsula ought to be nuclear weapons-free." 
One official described the emerging American strategy this way: "We play the bad cop, the Chinese play the good cop, and the Japanese potentially play the sugar daddy whose investment in North Korea is at stake."
But it is far from certain that Mr. Bush will be able to sell that strategy. South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, who is also at the end of his presidency, has staked his legacy on a "Sunshine Policy" of economic engagement with the North that a senior administration official said today "hasn't turned out so well" given the North Korean disclosures.
The Chinese fear that any effort to deepen the North's economic isolation will lead to more illegal immigration to China and the risk of a North Korean backlash.
On Iraq, Mr. Bush stressed common ground, and steered clear of the differences at the United Nations.
"China supports Iraq's strict compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions," Mr. Bush said. He added, "I urged President Jiang to support a new Security Council resolution," but tellingly said nothing about his guest's response. Neither did Mr. Jiang, though the participant in the meeting said the two men had discussed Iraq "fairly thoroughly."
Mr. Bush made some specific references to human rights issues today, saying he offered Mr. Jiang "My views on the importance of China freeing prisoners of conscience, giving fair treat to people of faith, and preserving the rights of Hong Kong citizens."
Mr. Jiang was also ready for the human rights references that are now a standard part of any meeting like this one, and said he had told Mr. Bush that "China's human rights situation is at its best time, characterized by constant improvement."

HEADLINE: Top Venezuelan Commanders Support Chavez Against Rebels 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Commanders of key Venezuelan military garrisons declared their support for President Hugo Chavez today, dispelling fears of a barracks rebellion after a call for revolt by a group of dissident officers.
 "We declare our loyalty and support," Gen. Jorge Garcia Carneiro, the garrison commander in the Caracas region, said in a televised broadcast, "for the authority and leadership held by the president through the will of the people," 
 Gen. Alberto Gutierrez, the garrison commander of the oil-producing western state of Zulia, made a similar declaration of loyalty today. Other key unit commanders and the military high command have also opposed the rebels' call.
This appeared to strengthen Mr. Chavez's position in the face of the military dissidents, most of whom took part in the coup against him from April 11 to 14, which was ended by loyal troops.
"If they are thinking of trying another coup," the president said in a speech today, "if they attempt to attack our institutions with arms, then we will respond with arms," 
Since their broadcast on Tuesday, the rebels have been joined by several dozen fellow officers.
Camped in an east Caracas square and cheered daily by crowds of admiring supporters, they have become the focal point of a determined campaign by the populist president's civilian opponents to try to force him out of office.
"In this show, another coup is being cooked up," Mr. Chavez said, warning that his government would be forced to act. 
Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper democratically elected in 1998, refuses to step down. He has condemned his military foes as "fascist coup-plotters," portraying them as a disgraced minority with no authority and no troops under their command.
The political turmoil, which has shattered investor confidence in the oil-producing nation and pushed its economy into recession, poses a thorny problem for the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Cesar Gaviria, who is due in Caracas on Sunday on his latest peace mission.
Leaders of the dissident military faction said they wanted to meet Mr. Gaviria to explain to him that they were not proposing a coup but were opposing a president they considered inept, corrupt and dictatorial.
In their broadcast, the rebel officers accused Mr. Chavez of dividing Venezuelans with his confrontational rule, of fomenting poverty, class hatred and corruption, and of dragging the country toward Cuban-style Communism.
"We respectfully ask Gaviria to hear us out," said Rear Adm. Daniel Comisso, one of the anti-Chavez officers.
But Mr. Gaviria's representative in Caracas, Carlos Patricio Carvacho, expressed reservations about a meeting the rebels.
"When two or more military officers get together and talk about not recognizing the government, that's not normal and has to be viewed with a lot of caution," Mr. Carvacho said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Stronger With Lautenberg, Poll Shows 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and MARJORIE CONNELLY

 BODY:
The legal maneuvering that allowed former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg to replace Senator Robert G. Torricelli as the Democratic nominee on the ballot in New Jersey's United States Senate race has strengthened Democrats' chances of retaining the seat, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 Before Mr. Torricelli's ethical problems forced him to withdraw from the race on Sept. 30, many polls showed that Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee, had opened a sizable lead, causing Democratic leaders in Washington to worry that the race might cost the party its single-seat margin in the Senate. 
 But Mr. Lautenberg, a former three-term senator who entered the race just three weeks ago, now has the support of 48 percent of likely voters, while Mr. Forrester is favored by 36 percent, the poll found. Thirteen percent were undecided. The margin of error among likely voters was plus or minus five percentage points for each candidate. 
Among those who said they were undecided when Mr. Torricelli was still in the race, 67 percent said they now supported Mr. Lautenberg, versus 7 percent for Mr. Forrester. Twenty percent remained undecided.
Mr. Torricelli's departure seems to have shifted the focus of the race to issues that favor Democrats in New Jersey, where voters generally are moderate on social issues. And instead of Mr. Torricelli, who was viewed favorably by just 11 percent of registered voters, it allowed Democrats to run Mr. Lautenberg, who was viewed favorably by 46 percent and unfavorably by 21 percent.
Looking back to Mr. Lautenberg's days in the Senate, 52 percent said they approved of his performance, while 18 percent disapproved.
On the other hand, Mr. Forrester, a political newcomer, remained so unfamiliar to voters that half said they had no opinion of him.
The statewide poll was conducted last Saturday through Thursday with 772 registered voters. The margin of sampling error for all registered voters was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
While the survey describes an electorate more attuned to Mr. Lautenberg on issues like gun control, environmental protection and abortion rights, there were some encouraging signs for Mr. Forrester. By 51 percent to 37 percent, voters said they thought a fresh approach was more important than experience in the Senate. That view favors Mr. Forrester, whose only previous political experience was as mayor of the Princeton suburb of West Windsor 20 years ago.
Among the respondents most expected to vote -- those who voted in both 2000 and 2001 and said they would definitely vote in this election -- Mr. Lautenberg's lead was 48 percent to 41 percent, within the margin of sampling error. The fact that 13 percent of likely voters remained undecided with three weeks remaining also offers Mr. Forrester an opportunity, especially in a state like New Jersey, where in recent years many voters have made their choice late in the campaign.
"Yet another poll showing the race within the margin of error among voters most likely to vote," said Bill Pascoe, the Forrester campaign manager. "I think it's a very clear sign that voters are looking for a new approach instead of the failed policies of the past."
Mr. Torricelli's withdrawal was an issue for some voters. But the poll found that 62 percent of all voters thought Senator Torricelli made the right decision by quitting.
While 40 percent of all voters said they had been bothered by the fact that Mr. Lautenberg's name was added after the deadline for switching candidates, the issue has done little to help Mr. Forrester.
Keith Hahn, 32, said he was so upset by the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision to allow Mr. Lautenberg on the ballot -- after the deadline for replacing candidates had passed -- that he would cast "a protest vote" for Mr. Forrester.
"I think the whole thing was corrupt," said Mr. Hahn, a police officer from Edison and a registered Democrat, who was interviewed after the poll was conducted. "If we had a Republican governor, I guarantee it would have gone the other way."
But many voters simply seemed relieved that they no longer had to wrestle with their feelings about Mr. Torricelli, who was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee for accepting gifts from a donor.
Patye Tenbrick, 59, of Egg Harbor, said she switched her support from Mr. Forrester to Mr. Lautenberg as soon as the ballot change had cleared all the legal obstacles.
"Lautenberg is not a liar or a cheat," said Ms. Tenbrick, an independent, who said she admired Mr. Lautenberg's experience and position on social issues. "Forrester was just the lesser of two evils as far as I was concerned. It was either that or just don't vote. I was going to go in and vote for a man I didn't like just to keep Torricelli out."
Mr. Lautenberg's 12-point lead in the poll comes mainly from the support of Democrats, liberals and moderates, from people who live in Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic Counties, and from women and blacks. Mr. Forrester does best with Republicans and conservatives and in the central part of the state, where he is better known. Whites and men are evenly divided between the candidates. Independents, who make up a third of the likely voters, are split, with 40 percent for Mr. Lautenberg and 30 percent for Mr. Forrester, and women favor Mr. Lautenberg 49 percent to 30 percent.
The poll found that 12 percent of those who favored Mr. Forrester over Mr. Torricelli had switched their preference to Mr. Lautenberg. Six percent of those who supported Mr. Torricelli had decided to back Mr. Forrester.
Given the moderate nature of most New Jersey voters, the Forrester-Lautenberg dynamic appears to favor Democrats. While respondents were equally split between those who believe abortion should be generally available and those who favor more restrictions, 72 percent said they favored stricter gun control, a stance Mr. Lautenberg has supported.
And 92 percent of all voters agreed with Mr. Lautenberg's contention that the cost of toxic waste cleanup should be paid by the companies responsible for pollution. Mr. Forester's position, that tax revenues should pay for the cleanups, was supported by 6 percent.
Mr. Forrester has had limited success in putting the campaign's focus on terrorism, the prospect of a war against Iraq and questions about whether Mr. Lautenberg, 78, might be too old to effectively serve a six-year term. Only four percent of respondents mentioned defense, Iraq or war as their top concern.
When asked whether they were more concerned with a candidate's position on the economy or on the hostilities with Iraq, 69 percent of respondents said the economy was more important, compared with 14 percent who chose Iraq.
But 24 percent of all voters said they were concerned that Mr. Lautenberg's age might limit his effectiveness.
The battle for control of the Senate, which is the issue that has made party leaders in Washington most interested in the race, seems to have had little effect on it.
Although 38 percent said party control of the Senate mattered a great deal to them, the survey found that control of the Senate was equally important to voters supporting Mr. Forrester and those who favored Mr. Lautenberg.

How The Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday through Thursday with 994 adult residents of New Jersey. Of these, 772 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area of the state was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, and age.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New Jersey.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.
Registered voters in the poll were classified as likely voters on the basis of their answers to questions dealing with past turnout, intention to vote this year and attention to the campaign.

 JESSE JAMES
Last Rebel of the Civil War.
By T. J. Stiles.
Illustrated. 510 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.
 A photograph of Jesse James, taken in July 1864, captures a 16-year-old boy in the process of transforming himself into a killer. His rosy cheeks and delicate features, and the rakish tie he wears, contrast oddly with the hefty Colt pistol he clutches in one hand. Two more revolvers are thrust in his belt. The portrait might seem a harmless counterfeit if it had been produced at any time other than during the Civil War, with a boy none too convincingly imitating the look of a desperado.
In fact, as a member of a band of Confederate guerrillas operating in the contested borderlands of Kansas and Missouri, James had already seen men die violently. In the early summer of 1864, just after he had left his home in Missouri to join them, the guerrillas had ambushed a force of Union militia. They also assassinated at least eight civilians in Missouri that summer because they were believed to be Union sympathizers. Some were "slain before the eyes of their wives and children," according to a contemporary account. A slave was killed "for fun." It is likely that the boy in the photograph participated in at least some of these events. Indeed, by the time James sat for his portrait he may already have taken a life. According to one of his acquaintances, in June 1864, James and his older brother, Frank, a hardened bushwhacker (as the guerrillas were often called), had shot down a suspected Unionist. His first experience of war, as T. J. Stiles points out in his provocative, heavily revisionist biographical study, was not that of a soldier fighting as part of a disciplined army, but as "a member of a death squad, picking off neighbors one by one."
The passage of time, the efforts of tireless apologists and the judgment-free creations of popular culture have simplified and sanitized the life of Jesse James. His actions as a guerrilla during the Civil War have often been glossed over, with the emphasis placed instead on his later, hectic career as an outlaw. He has become the most folkloric of 19th-century badmen, with the fictionalized portraits of his life presenting a daring bandit who robbed arrogant railroads and banks, distributed loot to the needy and defied the powerful in the name of the powerless. In this narrative, James is too great a hero to be bested by conventional means. Having outwitted or outshot all those sent against him, he is brought down not by his foes but by the lethal sycophant Bob Ford. 
In "Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War," Stiles attempts to penetrate the layers of fabrications swaddling James to uncover something of the real man and his motives. As the editor of a series of anthologies on American history (including "Civil War Commanders" and "Robber Barons and Radicals: Reconstruction and the Origins of Civil Rights"), Stiles has developed considerable skills as a researcher, and he employs them quite impressively here, drawing on letters, newspaper reports, official documents, diaries and memoirs to recapture the complex and violent times in which Jesse James grew and flourished. Not surprisingly, the figure that emerges bears only a passing resemblance to the legendary outlaw. This James is far more ruthless and manipulative. He is an impulsive killer, forged by the corrosive experience of guerrilla warfare, Southern intransigence and his own appetite for notoriety. Even his depredations after the war, Stiles argues, were inspired less by proletarian anger than by the desire to play a visible part in the Southern effort to defeat the goals of Reconstruction. Had he lived a century later, Stiles asserts, "he would have been called a terrorist."
James's life was shaped by a series of disruptions and disappointments. He was born in rural Missouri in 1847, and might have grown up as the privileged son of a community leader. His father, Robert, was a charismatic preacher, a successful farmer (of hemp, corn, hogs and sheep) and a slaveowner. When Jesse was 2, his father departed for the California gold fields and died soon after arriving there. His mother, the indomitable Zerelda, hurried into a second marriage with a wealthy, older man. It quickly failed, and the family's fortunes never recovered. Zerelda's third husband, Reuben Samuel, was more pliant but less ambitious. 
The Civil War further devastated the family. Markets for farm products evaporated, cash disappeared, violence was a constant threat. Frank joined a group of guerrillas, and in the spring of 1863 brought them back to the family farm to rest after a series of raids. Union militia tracked the bushwhackers to the James farm, beat 15-year-old Jesse and tortured Reuben into leading them to the guerrilla camp. Most of the band escaped. If Jesse, having been raised in an adamantly anti-abolitionist family and very likely envying Frank's adventures, needed further incentive to go to war, the day's events provided it. 
The conflict he plunged into in 1864 had almost nothing in common with the vast struggle being waged elsewhere. Jesse's war was, as Stiles notes, "small-scale, intensely personal, and intensely vicious." Southern Kansas and much of Missouri were battlegrounds for abolitionist and anti-abolitionist forces. A vexing number of factions hunted each other through the region's canebrakes and forests, staging ambushes, assassinating suspected enemies, spreading terror. Bands of Confederate guerrillas, sheltered and protected by Missouri's large population of Southern partisans, fought Union militia, regular Army patrols, bands of abolitionist guerrillas and even on occasion local militia who were pro-slavery but devoted to the preservation of the union. The Confederate guerrillas frequently carried the fight into Kansas.
The niceties of battle never applied here. To fervent abolitionists, the southern frontiersmen of Missouri were, as the historian Michael Fellman explains in "Inside War," his study of the guerrilla campaigns in that state, examples of "impoverished barbarism," their degraded condition a result of the slave system. They were "beasts who had to be expunged if free white civilization were to be implanted." To pro-slavery firebrands, abolitionists were a morally corrupt "foreign foe," evil hypocrites attempting to reverse or destroy the God-given "natural, good order of society." In this absolute battle of good and evil, almost anything was permissible -- and even necessary. Crops, homes and entire towns were burned. Every man, armed or unarmed, was a potential combatant and thus fair game. Men were shot down in their fields, on their doorsteps, while on the road. Captives were routinely executed. As the war grew more bitter, even murder was insufficient. More and more mutilated corpses -- scalped or beheaded, bodies slashed or genitals severed -- were reported. 
Frank James had been among the several hundred bushwhackers under Quantrill who attacked, looted and burned the town of Lawrence, Kan., shooting down some 200 men and boys in 1863. In September 1864, Jesse and Frank, part of a group of bushwhackers led by the psychopathic Bloody Bill Anderson, held up a train in the town of Centralia, looted it and, when they found 23 unarmed Union soldiers on board, killed all but one. Several were scalped. Stiles vividly details the lengthy series of attacks, pursuits, ambushes and murders that the James brothers participated in until the war's end.
The collapse of the Confederacy in 1865 left the James boys and their fellow guerrillas feeling particularly vulnerable. Since they were not members of a recognized army, the possibility existed that they might be tried for their crimes by the radical Republican administration in Missouri. They might also face private vendettas, attempts by family members to avenge the dead. The actions of the new Republican administration in Missouri and throughout the South added further tinder to an explosive situation. The federal government was perceived as being determined to dismantle most Southern institutions, and to give blacks in the South an equal footing in political and economic life. "In the face of political revolution and private revenge," Stiles writes, "in the face of former slaves who now carried muskets and asserted their freedom, it was only a matter of time before the bushwhackers resisted." When they did so, Stiles notes, it was inevitable that they would use the same methods they had employed during the war, "ranging from robbery to intimidation to murder." 
It was at this point that the restless Jesse, who had seemingly relished the adventures and mortal gambles of the war years, began to become identified with the fury of a defeated South. Former guerrillas, including the James brothers, carried out what is believed to be the first daylight robbery of a bank in America in 1866, escaping from Liberty, Mo., with $58,000 after killing a bystander. Between this robbery and his death in 1882, James would take the lead in a long series of robberies of banks and trains. The violence of the war years would carry over into the robberies, leaving bank tellers, bystanders, railroad personnel and even some of his own gang dead.
Under other circumstances, these robberies would have been viewed as simple, if audacious, crimes. But in the turbulent, vitriolic atmosphere of the postwar years, they acquired a very different meaning. John Edwards, newspaper editor, self-proclaimed champion of Confederate causes and political activist, seized on James as the perfect example of a Southern patriot harassed and haunted by radical Republicans. Jesse James, who seems, Stiles suggests, to have craved fame, happily collaborated in his transformation into a wronged, defiant hero. He was an avid reader of local newspapers and even contributed heated letters defending his actions, denying his crimes and attacking perceived Republican abuses. "His robberies, his murders, his letters to the newspapers, and his starring role in Edwards's columns," Stiles writes, "all played a part in the Confederate effort to achieve wartime goals by political means." During the struggle in Missouri and the broader South in the 1860's and 1870's to repeal civil rights laws and seize control of local and state government, James provided a useful rallying point. In all of this, Stiles argues, James was more than a passive symbol: he was "a highly political man who was intensely aware of his effect on Missouri politics."
After the radical Republicans were largely driven from office in the mid-1870's, following sustained intimidation and violence directed at blacks and Northern officials, James became a man without a cause. He went on robbing because, apparently, he craved thrills, was too restless to settle down and could think of no better way to attract attention. By the time he was killed by a panicked member of his gang, his close identification with the Confederate cause had already begun to fade. The harsh specifics of his life and actions have gradually vanished, to be replaced by a rather generic narrative of a heroic figure defying abusive institutions and faceless enemies.
Stiles forcefully sets Jesse James in the context of his times, firmly identifying him as a violent and effective Confederate partisan. "Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War" is so carefully researched, persuasive and illuminating that it is likely to reshape permanently our understanding of its subject's life and times. James has become far more human, more complex and less admirable. Stiles works on a large canvas, and his descriptions of the events leading up to the Civil War in the West, the horrific guerrilla campaigns in Kansas and Missouri during the war and the complex political struggle after the war are clear and vivid. His portrait of the defeat of the more visionary aspects of Reconstruction and the destruction of the hopes of black Americans is restrained and moving.
Stiles has a large and very dramatic story to tell, and he does so with energy and conviction. But James often seems to get lost in a narrative crowded with outsize figures and events. The book frequently seems more like a record of the times in which he lived than of the man shaped by them. James himself remains a violent enigma. Thanks to Stiles's tireless detective work, we learn much about what he was not; what he was is less certain. We never quite understand why he excited such loyalty, respect and fear in his followers. The man behind the gun remains remote. 
He dressed well, was a canny publicist and politician, a superb horseman and supremely cool in action. He apparently found it hard to hold on to much of the money he stole. Little else seems certain. It may be that James's horrific experiences in the war closed off parts of his personality, suspending him in a kind of emotional adolescence. He seems to have been driven by a constant need for attention and for new and ever greater risks, suggesting that something of that defiant and slightly uncertain boy in the photograph lingered throughout his life. When Bob Ford finally shot him down, in his own home, he was unarmed. It was the first time that most of his acquaintances could recollect seeing Jesse James without his guns.

HEADLINE: Where Two Cultures Collided 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO; SIMON ROMERO writes about technology for The Times.

 BODY:
STANDING atop the windy limestone hill, I let my eyes wander from the stone walls of the San Buenaventura mission to the dry plains stretching into the horizon. Multitiered cumulus clouds occupying a distant quadrant of the sky threatened not a drop of rain.
 Save for the drought-resistant vegetation -- pinyon pines, prickly-pear cactuses and desert four-o'clock wildflowers with their brilliant displays of magenta blossoms -- the landscape around the Gran Quivira ruins has changed little since they were abandoned more than three centuries ago. 
 For about 50 years in the 17th century, Gran Quivira was an outpost for the Spanish Empire, an unlikely point of contact between Old and New World cultures on the frontier of what was then New Spain.
These days, Gran Quivira and its sister sites in the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument in central New Mexico, Quarai and Abo, form a remarkably well-preserved triad of ruins that provide visitors with insight into the origins of the Southwest. 
It is well known that New Mexico is rich in ruins, with sites like the multistoried masonry pueblos of Chaco Canyon and the Gila Cliff Dwellings. Faced with the array of choices when I visited in August, I did not know where to begin.
I decided to focus on the abandoned pueblos and missions near the Rio Grande, places that captured the austere beauty and complex underpinnings of early European forays in the New World.
The ruins in the Salinas Valley and those at two other sites, the Pecos National Historical Park, southeast of Santa Fe, and the Jemez State Monument, southwest of Los Alamos, were each striking in their own way, but I was most impressed by two sites, Gran Quivira and Quarai (pronounced KWA-rye.)
Each is in a remote location that made me wonder what motivated human beings to settle there. Their stone walls are evidence of colonial ambitions that were quickly undone by some of the very forces, like the horse, that Spanish authorities had released onto the surrounding scrublands and mountains. No wonder these limestone and sandstone structures have inspired awe in travelers for centuries.
"An edifice in ruins, it is true, but so tall, so solemn, so dominant of that strange lonely landscape, so out of place in that land of adobe box huts, as to be simply overpowering," was how Charles F. Lummis described Quarai in "The Land of Poco Tiempo" in 1893. "On the Rhine, it would be a superlative, in the wilderness of the Manzano it is a miracle."
The dry summer heat notwithstanding, exploring the ruins on foot was easy thanks to walking paths and self-guided tours from the National Park Service. Some trails, including a few at Quarai, were closed because of recent flooding, but most remained accessible. I virtually had the place to myself the day I saw the site, the only other visitors a couple crisscrossing New Mexico on Harley-Davidsons. 
Approaching the ruins of the mission at Quarai, near Punta de Agua, a small village of adobe and trailer homes, I was lulled by the soft wind blowing through the old cottonwoods surrounding the site. I wondered why such a tranquil place was abandoned.
About two centuries before Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore the Louisiana Purchase, the viceroy in Mexico City sought to increase the colonial influence in New Mexico by issuing an order in 1609 to concentrate Indians into settlements with a strong presence of the church.
Construction of the church at Quarai, the site of a community of Tiwa-speaking Indians, did not begin until 1626, under the supervision of Fray Alonso Benavides, but when completed in 1630 it was an expression of Spanish power. Quarai became the regional seat of the Inquisition and focal point of the rivalry between church and military.
Long after its abandonment in the 1670's amid persistent attacks by Comanches and Apaches swooping in on horseback from the eastern plains, Quarai remains imposing.
Part of the church's original flagstone floor still exists, and above are sockets that once held vigas, or roof beams, and painted corbels, the supports for the beams that spanned the church and supported the ceiling. The sandstone church still has walls that were once more than 40 feet high.
I exclaimed in amazement at what I saw and was surprised by the echo. The acoustics are superb; de Profundis, an a capella ensemble from Albuquerque, presents medieval and contemporary music each September in the church.
The remains of stone walls surrounding the church were once a large village of some 600 Tiwa-speaking people. That number remained steady during the Franciscan occupation lasting through the late 1670's, according to the archaeological consultant John P. Wilson, despite the rapid decline in the number of Pueblo Indians in New Mexico -- from 34,320 to 17,000 -- in the same period.
The kiva, the underground ceremonial chamber, was built to allow cool air to descend through a ventilator shaft while warm air and smoke rose out a hatchway. It was tolerated by colonial authorities and remains important in pueblo culture today.
I marveled at the ingenuity of the kiva's design, so close to the mission, a structure that seems ostentatious in comparison even long after its abandonment. The Tiwa's ability to incorporate Catholic practices into their belief system while adhering to their sacred rituals in part explains why their language is still spoken at the pueblos of Isleta, Picuris, Sandia and Taos.
Visiting the Salinas ruins was a lesson not only in history's tug on the present but also in economics. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of shells, dried buffalo meat and flints that were traded for items such as maize and salt. The Indians there were middlemen between settlements to the west and the Great Plains tribes before the Spanish arrived.
The expedition of Francisco Vaszquez de Coronado in 1540 to New Mexico was an early but unsuccessful effort to find the land of Quivira, fabled for it riches. Still, the allure of Quivira remained, and its name was eventually given to the settlement on the hill that I visited on a hot August day.
From its perch 6,600 feet above sea level, Gran Quivira reminded me of the ruins of the Moorish fortress Alcazaba in southern Spain. After the army of King Ferdinand took control of Alcazaba in the late 15th century, it built a church within its walls. The strategy was repeated at Gran Quivira, with a mission of blue-gray limestone.
However, the Spanish seem to have had less success in Gran Quivira than in Quarai, as shown by the construction of a second church at the pueblo in 1659 that was never completed. 
Unlike Quarai, near the village of Manzano, Gran Quivira is almost as isolated as in its flashpoint days. A solar-powered ranger station and visitor center are the only evidence of modern contact.
Ruins of the two churches, San Buenaventura and San Isidro, stand near a mound with evidence of pithouses from A.D. 700 and relatively more recent limestone remains of a small settlement. Evidence of communal life at the pueblo is seen in the shared-wall design of the excavated rooms.
Archaeologists say much of village life, like chores and gossiping, took place on the roofs of these rooms, though it was hard to picture Gran Quivira as anything but a refuge from the elements. The precarious nature of living on the margin of the world impressed me as I wandered through the small labyrinth of limestone walls.
Arriving at Gran Quivira from Mountainair along Route 55, a two-lane paved road that was almost empty, I was also reminded how immense the West is and how much larger it must have seemed, minus asphalt and four-wheel-drive, to the Tompiro Indians who settled here and the Spaniards who came to subdue them.
Colonial authorities wanted Gran Quivira because of its strategic location near large salt flats. They needed salt to process silver discovered in Hidalgo del Parral, in northern Mexico. Hence the name Salinas, Spanish for a place where water evaporates to leave salt. The Indians were forced into labor, gathering salt into leather bags that were then taken south to Hidalgo del Parral in caravans. But this salt-based trade did not last as a combination of exploitation, disease and drought overwhelmed Gran Quivira. In 1668, four years before its outright abandonment, about 450 people died of starvation in the pueblo.
As David Grant Noble wrote in his book "Ancient Ruins of the Southwest," some people migrated to more stable pueblos along the Rio Grande while others went south to join communities in the El Paso area, their culture absorbed into the places where they sought refuge.
The Spanish also suffered. The meticulously coordinated Pueblo Revolt of 1680 killed more than 400 Spaniards, including 21 of New Mexico's 33 missionaries. Thus ended Spain's early foray, its lonely churches left to crumble.
Rivaling the ruins were the scenic roads that connect them to other parts of New Mexico. The 25-mile trip from the town of Mountainair to Gran Quivira was especially striking as the high desert landscape unfolded around me. 
One day after trekking in Gran Quivira, I drove into Albuquerque as the sunset produced an explosion of orange and yellow color above a shimmering cityscape. The city's laid-back comforts were welcome. After a walk under a canopy of cottonwoods near the Rio Grande, I had delicious huevos rancheros at El Patio, a charming restaurant near the University of New Mexico.
Later, friends took me to listen to live jazz at an outdoor bar alongside the old Route 66, where we drank cold beer on a balmy summer night and absorbed the sounds of bossa nova. It was hard to recall the New Mexico of salt caravans and Comanche raids, of colonial ambition and Indian revolts.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Edward Durell Stone and the Gallery of Modern Art, at 2 Columbus Circle; 
An Architect Who Looked Both Forward and Back

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IN 1956 he unabashedly plunked down a large concrete grille in the middle of a row of East Side brownstones. His 1964 Gallery of Modern Art, at 2 Columbus Circle, was, in the words of a critic for Art News, "a turkey." And critics said that his 1968 marble tower, the General Motors Building at 58th Street and Fifth Avenue, seriously compromised the character of Grand Army Plaza across the street.
 But the complex, big-talking and romantic architect Edward Durell Stone was far ahead of his time in his views on the environment, city planning and historic preservation. Now Stone himself is becoming a cause, as preservation groups gird for a final battle over the Columbus Circle building, which has been vacant in recent years and seems headed for the dustbin. 
 Stone was born in 1902 into a well-to-do family in Fayetteville, Ark. He went to both Harvard and M.I.T., studied architecture in Europe for two years, joined an architectural firm in New York and got his big break in 1936 when he received the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art building at 11 West 53rd Street. Working with a museum trustee, Philip Goodwin, Stone developed a crisp glass and marble facade, at that time the most advanced architectural statement of European modernism in New York. 
Although Stone had traveled extensively in Europe sketching old monuments, it was a 1940 trip across America that awakened doubts in his mind about the doctrinaire modernism and urban policies that were changing the country. In his 1962 memoir, "The Evolution of an Architect," he wrote that he "was appalled by the devastation" caused by suburbanization, road blight and the demolition of historic buildings. 
Another change came in 1953, when he met Maria Elena Torchio on a flight to Paris -- and proposed to her before the plane landed. A fashion writer, she was the daughter of a Florentine father and a Barcelonese mother, and she alerted her husband to a richer sense of architectural beauty and the idea that pleasurable materials, forms and decoration were acceptable. 
Stone's United States Embassy in New Delhi, completed the next year, had fountains, a screen of gold-leafed columns, principal walls of perforated concrete grilles for shade and a surrounding pavement of marble and of river stones smoothed by the Ganges. Compared to the minimalist designs of the period, the new embassy was swathed in Edwardian luxury. 
In 1956 Stone reused the grille idea to remodel his old brownstone at 130 East 64th Street, using the grille this time for privacy. It was in that year that Huntington Hartford, heir to the A.&P. supermarket fortune, announced plans for a new Gallery of Modern Art on a trapezoidal site at Columbus Circle bounded by Broadway, 58th Street and Eighth Avenue. 
Hartford hired Stone, who developed a facade in soft white marble, supported on a Venetian-style arcade, with cutout porthole shapes at the corners to allow visitors to see out. Stone's rendering also shows the building festooned with long, hanging vines or plants and surrounded by thick trees -- but none of those additions were in the final plan. 
The combination of Hartford's tastes for traditional art and Stone's unusual design made the building seem erratic to contemporary critics. But although Alfred Frankfurter, writing in Art News in 1964, the year the gallery opened, called it "a turkey" with the "cheap glamour of a shoe emporium on Main Street," many critics were fairly amiable. Olga Gueft, writing in Interiors, called it an interesting exception "to the glittering ice-cage architecture" of contemporary New York. The building's principal sin was that it stood out from the sameness that had taken over New York architecture. 
Stone used his increasing success to espouse a series of ideas that would not become mainstream for years. In 1958 he was quoted in The New York Times as saying that suburban sprawl was desecrating the American landscape, and he called for the creation of a federal cabinet position, the secretary of the environment. 
In an article in The Times the following year he advised Americans to "beware of progress" because older things were almost always better than new ones. "The world of plate glass and aluminum that is upon us leaves the average mortal deeply unsatisfied," he said. In a speech to the Women's City Club in 1960 he criticized New York streets for having no place to sit. He suggested that cars be banned from Lexington and Madison Avenues and that they be replaced with vast flower gardens. 
Two years later he called for what The Times termed a "dictator of arts" and said, "We need someone who can say 'no' when people want to build a modernistic hot dog stand in a street of Colonial houses."
Such an idea was visionary at a time when even Penn Station could not be saved from demolition. Indeed, Stone later sought to salvage the columns from Penn Station and place them around Columbus Circle. 
IN 1966 Business Week said that Stone had a billion dollars of construction projects in his office, including the 50-story General Motors Building. Both this and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, completed in 1971, were long on rich finishes, including red carpets and marble, but short on the slightly eccentric quality of his earlier work. Stone died in 1978. 
Hartford had pulled out of the Gallery of Modern Art in 1969. Renamed the New York Cultural Center, it was operated by Fairleigh Dickinson University from 1969 to 1975. A year later, Gulf & Western Industries, with headquarters across Columbus Circle, bought the building as a gift to the city, intending that it be a visitors center and headquarters for the Cultural Affairs Department, which left in 1998. 
In the last several years, leading preservation organizations, including the Municipal Art Society, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the Historic Districts Council and Landmark West, have tried to get the Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold a hearing on the old gallery.
They have called in supporters, among them the architect and historian Robert A. M. Stern, who called the building "arresting and delightful" and added that "although it may seem out of fashion, that does not mean that it is trivial." 
But the commission's chairwoman, Sherida Paulsen, said that it had considered the issue in 1996 and declined to hold a hearing. She declined to comment on whether the commission might change its mind. 
Many preservationists are hesitant. Frank Sanchis, executive director of the Municipal Art Society, said that the organization's board is "severely divided in its opinion" even though it is lobbying for a public hearing. 
Mr. Sanchis said he strongly favors designation and considers the disagreement "an indication of the building's significance." 
This summer the city agreed to sell the building to the American Craft Museum, which is now at 40 West 53rd Street and was recently renamed the Museum of Contemporary Arts and Design. The cost of buying and renovating the Columbus Circle building, officials at the museum say, will exceed $30 million. 
The museum is now selecting architects. Holly Hotchner, its director, said that the marble exterior is in poor condition and that the new museum will have to have windows. 
Meanwhile, the preservation organizations are developing other venues for discussion and continue to try to persuade the landmarks commission to reverse itself. 
Arlene Simon, the president of Landmark West, said she is working on setting up a conference on Stone for early next year in cooperation with the American Institute of Architects. Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, said, "We'll raise as big a fuss as possible to save the building." 
Hicks Stone, an architect in New York and one of Stone's sons, said that although his father was never part of the preservation establishment, "he would have been very grateful for the renewed interest in architectural history." In contrast with his father, he said, he is not keen on historic styles. 'I love modern work," he said. "I prefer looking forward to looking back."
But he said he suspects that whatever replaces his father's building will be a lesser work. "I wish them luck," he said, "but once you get through with the tight budgets and the design by committee, everything is homogenized. You end up with pablum."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Man Ray's View of the Female Form

BYLINE:  By Helen A. Harrison 

 BODY:
'Man Ray, Voyeur/Voyant'
Hillwood Art Museum, C. W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Brookville, (516) 299-4073. Through Nov. 23.
 In the spirit of the Dada and Surrealist movements with which he was associated, Man Ray said that his art was designed "to amuse, bewilder, annoy or to inspire reflection," rather than to dazzle with its technical brilliance. His idiosyncratic, experimental approach to photography, his primary medium, broke the rules of darkroom practice in the service of an avant-garde sensibility that is generously illustrated here. 
 Organized by Laura Moakley, Registrar of the Long Island-based Man Ray Trust and a graduate student at C. W. Post, the show concentrates on photographic portraits and figures studies of women, although it also includes drawings, sculpture and two films from the 1920's, when Man Ray and his fellow Surrealists were routinely shocking the French bourgeoisie. Born Emmanuel Radnitsky in Philadelphia, he was an early convert to European modernism, and spent most of his working life in Paris, where he created the majority of the images and objects on view.
The excellent selection of well-known and seldom-seen material highlights both Man Ray's relationships with specific women and his long-term fascination with the female form as raw material. Nude and draped women are a staple of art, but Surrealism often emphasized a transgressive eroticism, as in "Spider Woman," which combines the cool composure of a fashion model with femme-fatale symbolism, and "Pebble," in which a single stone is set like a nesting egg in a model's armpit. In the famous photograph "Violon d'Ingres," a woman's body becomes that of a musical instrument -- literally an object, and metaphorically a tool for artistic expression. But unlike other Surrealists, Man Ray did not savage his female subjects. Even when fragmented, they are not butchered, suggesting an innate regard that counters Surrealism's pervasive misogyny.

'Tabletop'
Emily Lowe Gallery, Hofstra Museum, Hempstead, (516) 463-5672. Through Dec. 13.
The table itself, and many of the things that go on it, establish the theme of this group show by 36 members of the Long Island Craft Guild. In addition to a range of handsome vessels, dishes and other tableware, there are some non-utilitarian items, and several actual tables, as well as two paintings in which tables are pictured.
Among the most interesting pieces are those that use traditional craft materials or forms but defy the genre's conventions. In "I've Been Fed Putdowns," Arlene Absatz arrays strips of paper representing negative criticism on a handmade paper plate, serving up the unpalatable dish as a witty wall relief. 
Emelyn Garofalo's large bowl made of grain is useful only as a statement on the irony of abundant nourishment contrasted with hunger, represented by the small collection of bones it holds. 
Paul Chaleff's rectangular clay platters, with their thick brushstroke-like impasto, look more like abstract paintings than like serving pieces. Hilda Steckel's shallow dishes are certainly functional, but with glazes that suggest landscape imagery, they work equally well as paintings. 
Mary Abrams' Matisse-derived canvas, "The Flowered Tablecloth," uses the colorful floral fabric to animate a simple arrangement of fruit and crockery. In "Round Top," Stan Brodsky relies on a flat surface of somber tones to set off an austere group of objects. A departure for the painter, it suggests that he looked for inspiration to Morandi, the master of abstracted still life.

'Inside/Out'
Whitney Art Works, 414 First Street, Greenport, (631) 477-0745. Through Nov. 24.
This show should really be called "Outside/In," because the six artists' paintings, prints and photographs bring the landscape into the gallery. 
In the tradition of Thomas Moran, Deborah Guertz's black-and-white etchings capture the drama of waves breaking on rocky beaches. Her horizontal monotypes survey farm fields and dune vegetation, using rich colors and textures to describe the familiar scenes. Wendy Prellwitz, whose forebears also painted North Fork landscapes, is an economical artist whose simplified compositions effectively capture the sweep of open fields set off by distant trees.
In his acrylic painting, "Brooklyn Bridge," Courtney Jordan takes up an unusual and very effective vantage point in the bridge's ironwork. Instead of the iconic masonry arches, a cable anchor and conduits, dramatically foiled against a bleached-out sky, are the dominant motifs.
George Grant's paintings, with their flattened, stylized nature forms, recall the design principles of Arthur Wesley Dow and, like his work, tend to be overly mannered. The best are the three small studies of plants, which are eccentric and more spontaneous than the bigger compositions.
Stephen Longmire's large color photographs are printed full frame, but that doesn't mean they haven't been manipulated. Several are double exposures or superimpositions that emphasize pattern, but the most engaging is the atmospheric "Orient Point," with its ethereal glow of light through a thick fog that all but obliterates the shore. The beach is also the setting for Alice Garick's black-and-white photographic amalgams of portraiture and landscape.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Polish Treasures Visit a Kindred Culture

BYLINE:  By TED LOOS 

 BODY:
JUST days after beginning her job at the Milwaukee Art Museum in 1997, Laurie Winters was given a career-making opportunity.
 Russell Bowman, then the director of the museum, asked Ms. Winters, his new curator of European art, to propose a major exhibition that would match the ambition of the museum's new addition, designed by the celebrated Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, which was just then breaking ground. 
 "I surprised him by getting back to him less than a week later," Ms. Winters said by telephone recently. "I told him I wanted to bring a Leonardo here." 
The painting she wanted to display, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady With an Ermine" (1490-91), had been a slide-show favorite since her days in graduate school at the University of Michigan. But she also knew that the work, one of only three female portraits definitively attributed to Leonardo and preceding the "Mona Lisa" by about 15 years, was housed in Cracow, Poland.
"I remember thinking in school, 'I'll probably never get the chance to go to Cracow,' " Ms. Winters said. "But now I've been there eight times. Life has a way of doing these odd twists."
Those eight trips went into organizing "Leonardo da Vinci and the Splendor of Poland," an exhibition of 77 paintings from private and public Polish collections that went up last month in the museum's new wing. After it closes there it heads to Houston and San Francisco.
In addition to the Leonardo, the show features Hans Memling's "Last Judgment" (1467-71), a delicate work on wood panel that has never been shown in the United States, as well as five views of Warsaw by the Venetian master Bernardo Bellotto.
From the standpoint of local interest, Ms. Winters knew about Milwaukee's ethnic makeup. "There are roughly 600,000 people of Polish heritage here," she said. "When you add Chicago, it's 1.5 million people. That's a huge audience."
Prince Adam Karol Czartoryski, who was at the opening of the show, said that factor had helped him decide to lend "Lady With an Ermine" and seven other works from the Princes Czartoryski Museum in Cracow. The Czartoryskis are an ancient Polish family that rose to prominence in the 17th century. 
"It's a way of repaying these Poles for living here for so many years and not forgetting that they have a Polish name," he said.
Despite the connection, Ms. Winters didn't have ethnic boosterism in mind when she proposed the show. "It's not an exhibition about celebrating Polish culture," she said. In fact, the idea behind the show evolved.
"Initially, it started out as a kind of masterpiece exhibition," Ms. Winters said. "But as I began to travel in Poland and talk to curators and directors, I quickly realized there was a much more important story to tell about the whole history of patronage and collecting in Poland."
For many years, Poland measured its history in official partitions. From 1795 to 1918 the country disappeared from the map as an independent nation, carved up by its more powerful neighbors. After the ravages of Nazi occupation during World War II, Poland fell under Soviet dominance until 1991.
"One of the moments when this show became a mission for me was when I was with the director of the National Museum in Warsaw," Ms. Winters said. On their way into the museum -- which eventually lent 40 works to the show, more than any other institution -- the director pointed to the museum's concrete facade. "She asked me, 'Do you see all these indents?' " Ms. Winters recalled. " 'Those are from the Nazis. That's where they took target practice.' As Americans, we can't even begin to grasp what they've been through."
"Lady With an Ermine" managed to survive it all, but not without narrow escapes. The painting -- considered ground-breaking for the animated pose of the sitter, a Milanese noblewoman named Cecilia Gallerani -- was purchased by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski in 1798 on a trip to Italy.
In 1830 the elderly Princess Izabela Czartoryska, the first to publicly display the family collection, loaded the painting onto a horse cart to escape Russian invaders. At times it was hidden in cities like Paris and Dresden. The Nazis confiscated it from Poland during World War II, but it was returned to the family in 1946. Prince Czartoryski created the Princes Czartoryski Foundation in 1991, after Communism fell and the state returned the family's works.
"It's quite a history," Prince Czartoryski said. "The foundation has 840 works missing since the war, and that's just us. Poland has anywhere from 450,000 to 600,000 artworks missing." Among the foundation's lost works is a Raphael self-portrait bought along with the Leonardo.
"He could have taken the collection and sold it," Ms. Winters said. "Like his ancestor Izabela, he felt it was important to keep it in the public domain and help protect and preserve Polish identity."
Among the foreign masterpieces, "Leonardo da Vinci and the Splendor of Poland" also features 22 works by Polish painters, mostly from the 19th century, when there was a renaissance of native art.
"Works like the Leonardo show us where Polish art went to school," said Count Adam Zamoyski, a London-based historian and author of "The Polish Way: A 1,000-Year History of the Poles and Their Culture" (Hippocrene). "It's a clever way of explaining not so much Polish art but the course of art in Poland."
By the 19th century, with their economic base exhausted, the aristocracy couldn't afford to buy old masters. 
"Ironically, as Poland was beginning to disappear and the ruling class became politically impotent, they put more energy into being patrons of the arts," said Count Zamoyski, who is a cousin of Prince Czartoryski and serves on the foundation's board.
"You see these pictures which try to immortalize the state structure and national space that has been theoretically abolished," Count Zamoyski said. "A prime example of this is Chopin's music. It becomes the great spiritual home-away-from-home for Poles."
The exhibition features two works by Piotr Michalowski, considered the greatest painter of the Romantic era in Poland, including "Parade in Front of Napoleon" (1837).
"For about a decade, the Poles thought Napoleon was going to bring back Poland," Count Zamoyski said. "He has an otherworldly meaning in Polish iconography. He stands for the hope of a generation, just after Poland had been wiped off the map."
In organizing the exhibition, Ms. Winters has become something of a hero herself among art and civic leaders in Poland. "The exhibition has really caused a stir over there," she said. "It's telling a story they want told."
When "Lady With an Ermine" was crated at the Czartoryski Foundation for its trip to Milwaukee, the event was videotaped for Polish television. The painting also had an armed military escort to the airport. 
In addition to being a symbol of survival, the Leonardo has long been a straightforward tourist emblem on the covers of Polish guidebooks. 
At the Milwaukee Art Museum's gift shop, the tradition continues with mouse pads, coasters, posters and even a limited-edition Christmas ornament -- all emblazoned with the image of Gallerani and her furry friend.
Of course, it's not the first enigmatic Leonardo portrait to be a hit with both art cognoscenti and gift-shop patrons.
"It's moving up to icon, and I suppose I have to take some of the blame for that," Ms. Winters said. "We're helping to get her to that 'Mona Lisa' status."

HEADLINE: Two Political Veterans, but Only One Chair 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
WHEN Connecticut lost a Congressional seat because of a population decline, and voting districts were redrawn last December, the Fifth District race for the United States House was poised to be the toughest contest in the state this fall.
 It featured the rare combination of two incumbents seeking votes in 41 towns, often among an unfamiliar electorate, and had the potential to tip the political balance in the House to Democratic from the Republican-held majority. 
 Now, weeks away from Election Day, the contest between Nancy L. Johnson and James H. Maloney is not quite as pitched as promised, yet remains, next to the gubernatorial contest, the most closely watched in Connecticut.
A Quinnipiac University poll of Oct. 17 showed Ms. Johnson, a 10-term Republican whose Sixth District of 31 towns was melded into the new Fifth, leading by 56 percent to the 38 percentage of Mr. Maloney, a three-term Democrat. Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac poll, said that given the recent evidence, the race can no longer be considered a tossup. 
Yet political experts said it would be a mistake to discount Mr. Maloney, 53, a married father of three school-aged daughters and the oldest of 10 brothers and sisters, who is described by more than one as a "populist street fighter." Many recall his 1996 victory over Republican Gary Franks, who'd beaten him in 1994, despite his trailing Mr. Franks by some 17 points in the polls just weeks before the election.
Mr. Maloney also squeaked out a victory against Republican Mark Nielsen in 1998 by a few thousand votes. If the sport of politics leans toward boxing metaphors, Mr. Maloney, the experts said, is not yet down for the count.
The newly drawn Fifth District is bordered to the northwest by Salisbury and to the southwest by Danbury, featuring a crazy quilt of Republican small-town strongholds and the blue-collar cities of Waterbury and New Britain long favored by Democrats. This factor, the incumbency of both candidates and a high number of unaffiliated voters has made for a challenging campaign.
So far, it has been a contest marked by a fair bit of mudslinging, mostly over three issues: truth in campaign advertising, negative campaigning and the veracity of the candidates' voting records in Congress. Mr. Maloney's camp has accused Ms. Johnson of not voting for the programs she touts on the stump.
"She says one thing in Connecticut and then votes the other way when she gets to Washington," Mr. Maloney has repeatedly said of Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson's squad retorts that Mr. Maloney is still a greenhorn in Congress with few voting notches on his own belt.
"He's written one law to Nancy's 23," said Brian Schubert, Ms. Johnson's press aide. Those 23 bills include individual bills written by Ms. Johnson that are rolled into other legislation and signed into law.
Another high profile topic is the financial divide between the candidates. Ms. Johnson has raised $3 million, Mr. Schubert said and counts President George W. Bush and his father as fund-raisers. Mr. Maloney has raised $1.7 million, with help from former president William J. Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Indeed, the Fifth District is listed as the fifth most expensive congressional contest nationwide this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that tracks money in politics.
Yet Ms. Johnson, who is a left-of-center Republican and Mr. Maloney, a right-leaning Democrat, share many similar policy views, said Kenneth Dautrich, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut and director of its poll. Both are willing, for example, to consider privatizing aspects of the Social Security program while not supporting large-scale change to it, he noted.
They are divided on the issue of term limits, a potentially thorny topic for Mr. Maloney, who signed a pledge in 1998 that he would not serve beyond eight consecutive years. If elected in November, the term would be his last. Ms. Johnson, who refused to sign the pledge because she said he believed it is too difficult to be effective at the federal level without at least six to eight years experience, said Mr. Maloney had handicapped himself.
"People know you're there for the last time," she said. But Mr. Maloney said he stands by his decision.
"Congress suffers from people who serve too long and are more responsive to their fellow cronies in Washington that they are to the voters," he said.
If the race is said to turn on any one issue, Mr. Dautrich said, it is personality. Ms. Johnson, the mother of three grown daughters and the wife of a retired doctor, is the first Republican woman to serve on the Ways and Means Committee and the first and only woman to be chairwoman of two of its subcommittees. Her long history in Connecticut politics gives her, at age 67, a cachet of the elder stateswoman with very high name recognition, he said.
Yet Mr. Maloney stepped onto the international stage last year when he traveled twice to Russia to help broker the release of Jack Tobin, a Fulbright scholar studying in that country and imprisoned on charges of drug use and possession.
Mr. Maloney is not considered an "inside Democrat," but is instead something of a loner. By contrast, Ms. Johnson is perceived as a party favorite. 
"This can work to his advantage, actually," Mr. Dautrich said. "He can push his populist stance and note that he doesn't kowtow to anybody."
Mr. Maloney is not afraid to fight hard and bold in a campaign. For example he beat Mr. Franks in 1996 after running an ad featuring a rat scurrying through an abandoned building when it was revealed that Mr. Franks owned some severely decaying property in Waterbury. Mr. Dautrich recalled the ad as "vicious and really negative, but very effective."
Mr. Maloney also has huge support from labor unions, including the backing of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose Connecticut president, John Olsen, is also the chairman of the state Democratic Party. Mr. Maloney pointed out his efforts this summer in preventing the Stanley Works company from reincorporating. The New Britain tool manufacturer sought to relocate its business in name only to Bermuda to save money on taxes, a move that many employees believed would have increased outsourcing of work overseas, resulting in layoffs.
But Ms. Johnson said she too plans to work on a bill to prevent such corporate restructuring, but is aware of the need for a domestic corporation to protect itself from takeovers by foreign companies whose taxes are lower and work force is cheaper.
A huge difficulty for the candidates is that neither can point to the opponent and accuse with any gusto of being inexperienced, Howard Reiter, a UConn political science professor, said, as both are incumbents.
Stuart Rothenberg, who publishes a political report in Washington that is a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, suggested that Mr. Maloney should turn away from whose ads are most accurate and call attention to the slumping economy.
"If he can tap into public angst that the current economic plan is not working, this will sit well with Waterbury and New Britain and other areas in the Fifth with largely working class-voters," he said.
Mr. Rothenberg attributed some of Ms. Johnson's success in the newly configured Fifth District to her ability to move in all social circles.
"One minute she can be with a Republican garden club and the next she's in a bar in Waterbury drinking beer and slapping somebody on the back," he said, a dichotomy acknowledged with a chuckle by Ms. Johnson.
But charisma, polls and advertising aside, Mr. Reiter said that sometimes winning a House seat comes down to the most mundane factor: which party can mobilize the most people to get out and vote on Nov. 5.

Making a Move to the Island a Little Easier

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
FOR three days in May, John and Christi Ruggieri holed up in a motel in Huntington while Nichole, the oldest of their three children, attended cheerleader tryouts at Huntington High School. The family, then living in Freehold, N.J., planned to close on a Huntington house in September, but that would be too late for Nichole's cheerleading plans.
 "I had been cheerleading for three years, and I wanted to continue in my new school," said Nichole, 14. "My Dad said, 'Do you really want to do cheerleading?' I said yes. So we came in May." 
 Mr. Ruggieri, a New Jersey native, agreed to move to Long Island last year when his employer, Circuit City, asked him to manage the chain's newest store, in Brooklyn. Helping Nichole get adjusted to her new school was paramount, Mrs. Ruggieri said. A native Texan, she has been getting acclimated too. "I even got elected team mom for the cheerleaders," she said. 
Absorbing workers from outside Nassau and Suffolk has been identified as a key goal by the Long Island Association, which says that despite occasional spikes in unemployment, worker shortages loom as a major impediment to economic expansion on the Island.
Attracting people to live and work on Long Island has never been easy, however. Recruiters blame such factors as the cost of living, preconceptions about congestion and traffic, and the difficulty many newcomers experience in finding their way around the Island.
In recent years, however, companies have stepped up their recruitment efforts, often aided by real estate companies. New programs offer a kind of welcome-wagon approach intended as Miracle-Gro for the process of putting down roots in a new community.
The Ruggieris, for example, said their move to Huntington was made smoother through the efforts of the Long Island Relocation Center. A Northport unit of Daniel Gale Real Estate, the relocation center helps companies recruit and transfer people to the region more effectively by helping manage both the real estate part of the transaction as well as the psychological adjustment.
Marie Montchal, a Daniel Gale vice president, estimated that she had helped more than 1,000 people move to Long Island in the 10 years she has been head of the center.
While there are no statistics on how many people are recruited or transferred to Long Island each year, Ms. Montchal said most of the people she helps are professionals and managers. (Companies often invite hourly employees to relocate, but rarely pick up the cost.) 
Because more than half of the jobs offered to people on condition of relocation are turned down, according Ms. Montchal, she positions her service as way for companies to improve their recruiting and transfers.
"Over the past few years a good number of companies on Long Island have become more sophisticated in their recruitment and relocation polices, and for this reason are more successful attracting people from other areas," Ms. Montchal said. "We emphasize that companies have to address the issues around relocation before the employee moves in, not afterwards."
According to a 1996 member survey by the Employee Relocation Council -- whose member companies finance more than 300 household moves a year -- companies that do substantial employee relocating spend about $60,000 for each relocation of a current employee. Costs vary significantly, from an average $14,000 relocating recruits who rent their homes to upward of $75,000 for home-owning senior executives involved in long-distance transfers.
In addition to defraying costs associated with housing differentials, and reimbursing individuals for costs incurred in the move, many companies also woo would-be transfers with a package of services intended to make their move go smoothly. Traditionally, the package has included the services of job counselors and other professionals who help the employee's spouse find a job in the couple's new community. Increasingly, the package is engineered to help the entire family put down roots and to address the psychological impact of the move.
To entice employees to move, they also often throw in the services of relocation specialists like Ms. Montchal, who informally fill such roles as concierge, travel planner, transportation manager and neighborhood greeter. The Gale agency does this, Ms. Montchal said, at no extra charge when handling sales and rentals for the company.
"Typically, I work with someone who's been asked to move to Long Island and doesn't know anyone here, has no sense of what's what and who's where," Ms. Montchal said.
"We familiarize people with Long Island while they're still deciding whether they want to relocate here or not, or to stay beyond the terms of their contract," she continued. "If you just drop them onto the Long Island Expressway, you lose them. They're not going to move here if that's their Long Island experience."
To help newcomers adjust quickly, the relocation center's nine employees give advice on transportation, schools and cultural offerings, and help them recognize the nuances of various communities. The center also customizes packages containing neighborhood-specific information about museums, recreation and outlet shopping.
"We help people identify the best schools, get them the phone number of the utility companies, and do things you need done when you move," Ms. Montchal said. "Relocating is stressful. We try to reduce stress by providing information."
While the Ruggieris managed to fit in right away, other newcomers say they struggle with a sense of isolation that can last years. They blame cultural differences, regional sprawl, dysfunctional transportation and neighborhood insularity -- and, sometimes, their own shyness or homesickness.
Edmund and Shelly Sanctis moved from the San Francisco Bay area to the North Shore earlier this year when Mr. Sanctis accepted an offer to become president of Acclaim Entertainment, a video game company in Glen Cove.
After living several years in Burlingame, Calif., Mr. Sanctis said he found Long Island more diverse and less cohesive.
"In the Bay Area, if you're a software executive, you can assume everybody you meet is in the software industry," he said. "Everybody kind of plugs into that scene."
That commonality provides a kind of social shorthand but also creates what he described as "cultural myopia."
"There's more balance on Long Island, and that's a good thing," he said.
Leigh Jones, a journalist specializing in coverage of law firms and legal matters, moved to Long Island from Oklahoma City in 1999 to work at Long Island Business News in Ronkonkoma. She quickly felt isolated. 
"I was the only person on my managerial level at that job, so there weren't peers for socializing," she said.
As a renter in Bayport, she said she didn't meet many people in her neighborhood, either.
"I wanted to join an arts group, but didn't find out there was one right in my neighborhood until I moved away," she said.
The sense of culture shock can be sharp. Ms. Jones recalls taking her father out to dinner when he visited soon after she settled in. Their waitress spoke so brusquely that her father got up to complain to management.
"I talked him out of it," she said. "I explained that's how people talk on Long Island. People say what they need to say and that's it. They don't even pretend to be polite. If you aren't raised that way it takes some getting used to."
Ms. Jones has since taken a new job with the New York Law Journal, covering Long Island from Mineola. She said she was now more outgoing and as a result felt less isolated.
"I realized I'd have to create my own social network," she said. "I'm dating a guy I met in Starbucks. I just walked up and started a conversation."
In April Timothy and Judith Root moved to a condo in Port Jefferson from a home in Redmond, Wash., when Mr. Root accepted a job offer from BAE Systems, a satellite communications company. Mrs. Root said she was still adjusting to a more hurried lifestyle.
"You're driving along and people are tailgating you and honking," she said. "People get an attitude. I was taught to be courteous to people in public. Sometimes I don't find that reciprocated."
Scott Cerniglia, a store manager with the Best Buy chain, bought a house in Shoreham in July with his girlfriend after his company transferred him here from Boston. Mr. Cerniglia, born in Wisconsin and raised in Minnesota, said he thought population density put pressure on people.
Mr. Cerniglia declared that his immediate neighbors were the exception.
"I live in a great neighborhood, and everyone made us feel welcome from the start," he said. "The first weekend there was a block party. After that an invitation to someone's pool party arrived every weekend, it seemed. People bring you into the community as much as you want to be brought in."
Shelley Sanctis, whose husband is Acclaim's new president, said that despite many welcoming gestures from her neighbors, she still felt something was missing, though she found it hard to explain. 
"Maybe it's a sense of belonging," she said. "I know that doesn't happen quickly. People here seem more established than in Burlingame. They don't share the sense of being new in a community, and what it feels like to be the newcomer."

HEADLINE: Drums Along the Peconic 

BYLINE:  By JULIA C. MEAD 

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD 

 BODY:
RESIDENTS of Riverhead, the poorest town in Suffolk County, are forever trying to overcome negative perceptions of the place they live. The Town of Riverhead has spent considerable money and energy trying to reinvigorate the unincorporated hamlet of Riverhead, which straddles the Peconic River, as a commercial center and tourist destination.
 The effort has been a modest success, with the Tanger Outlet Mall and the Atlantis Marine World aquarium as its principal achievements. But Riverhead's most poverty-stricken, crime-ridden area -- the neighborhood called Riverside -- is entirely beyond the control of the Town of Riverhead. It is in the Town of Southampton, on the south side of the Peconic. 
 To distinguish its territory from Southampton's, Riverhead has installed new street signs along the border announcing when one enters or leaves Riverhead. It has tried to open discussions on splitting the Riverhead school district, which includes both sides of the river. Similarly, it wants the United States Postal Service to split its 11901 ZIP code. It has asked news outlets to stop describing the courthouse and jail, which are on the south side of the river, as being in Riverhead. 
A Riverhead town councilman, Edward Densieski, even wants to block the sidewalks on the bridges over the Peconic. The Traveler Watchman, a local weekly, reported that he told a town board meeting that "I'm not trying to fence out Southampton, but I would like to fence out the prostitutes, drug dealers, drug users and other vagrants."
The Southampton town supervisor, Patrick Heaney, told the paper the proposal "sounds like shades of East Germany."
Joey MacLellan, a Riverhead town spokesman, did not endorse Mr. Densieski's proposal. But he said Riverhead wants to make it clear that Riverside and Flanders, a slightly less blighted community east of Riverside, are Southampton's problem.
"The town has been working hard to revitalize its downtown, but for 27 years Southampton ignored those neighborhoods completely," Mr. MacLellan said. "So the board felt it had to do something."
Community activists in Riverside and Flanders contend that Riverhead's campaign shows too little appreciation for the south-of-the-river neighborhoods, whose residents spend their shopping dollars in downtown Riverhead and the outlet mall.
"It's cutting off Riverhead's nose to spite its face," said David Brewer, a Flanders resident and a founder of the Flanders-Riverside-Northampton Community Association.
But neighborhood residents, long accustomed to official neglect, are reacting with a mixture of gratitude and skepticism to indications that Southampton Town will no longer ignore an area that is in every way the opposite of the Hamptons stereotype.
Mr. Heaney, nearing the end of his first year as Southampton town supervisor, has been following through on a campaign promise to more closely focus town resources on the riverfront neighborhoods. Police patrols and building inspections have increased, and the town plans new streetlights and sidewalks, improvements to public parks, a long-term planning study and town acquisition of a crumbling, vacant building on the traffic circle that is the southern gateway to downtown Riverhead.
Riverside surrounds the traffic circle. Full of abandoned houses, littered lots and boarded-up storefronts, it is known as a place to drive through quickly on the way to somewhere else. Flanders has fewer vacant buildings and a few more middle-class homes. But both communities have suffered for decades from poverty, crime and and the absence of commercial development, sidewalks, playgrounds and other amenities that help give a neighborhood a sense of community.
"This area cries out for revitalization, and we are trying to be responsive," Mr. Heaney said.
Some community activists are encouraged. "I am cautiously optimistic," Mr. Brewer said. "It's been a long time since any attention has been paid to us."
The Rev. Roy L. Pennon, pastor of the Galilee Church of God in Christ in Riverside, said, "We've come a long way, we still have a long way to go, but I am very optimistic."
Dr. Pennon said his mostly African-American congregation of about 275 has begun speaking out and attending civic and government meetings. The congregation welcomes proposals to reduce crime, he said, and has plans to build a day care center in an abandoned house the church recently bought at auction. "In the last year, people here have really started to pull together," Dr. Pennon said.
Mr. Brewer also noted a rise in community spirit. "We were cut off and ignored," he said. "But we're starting to figure out there's strength in numbers."
South-of-the-river residents got a break last month, when at the urging of Southampton officials the state approved a one-shot equalization of the tax rate in the school district, shifting $1.8 million of the tax burden from Flanders and Riverside to neighborhoods inside Riverhead Town.
Riverside and Flanders property owners said they carried a disproportionate share of the tax load because more than half of the district's Southampton part is preserved land, and thus is removed from the tax rolls, and there is little commercial development. But the ruling has prompted Riverhead to consider suing, Mr. MacLellan said, and the Riverhead town supervisor, Robert Kozakiewicz, continues to talk up the idea of dividing the school district.
(Though downtown Riverhead is better off than the Southampton parts, the town-wide picture is reversed. The Suffolk County Planning Commission estimates last year's median family income in Riverhead at $59,131, the lowest of Suffolk's 10 towns. Southampton was in the middle of the pack at $68,861.)
While the two supervisors disagree sharply on the tax situation, both say they agree about the need for commercial development on the Southampton side of the river. They share support for a hotel and marina complex proposed on the south bank, and for an enterprise zone proposed on Route 24, the main road on the south side of the river.
"Anything we do would have a huge return for Riverhead," Mr. Heaney said, adding that Southampton will ask Riverhead business leaders for help in planning a "gateway park" on the Southampton side.
But some residents are not pleased with the prospect of more traffic and more buildings.
"I think it's very significant that Southampton can see we've been neglected and abused, but I believe it will take far more than a one-year tax rate change and some new street lights to give this community what it really needs," said Therese McGuiness, a Flanders resident and frequent critic of Mr. Heaney.
Ms. McGuinness contended that commercial development would only create more traffic and pollution and a greater sense of isolation.
"What kind of jobs are we talking about? Or is it just a mad rush to develop?" she said. "We don't have the roads and infrastructure to handle this. There just hasn't been adequate planning to address all of the inherent problems, and it will take a lot more than a few blue-collar jobs to get people out of poverty."
She argued that Southampton Town is suddenly interested in commercial development in the Riverside-Flanders area simply because it would not be welcome in the town's wealthier neighborhoods.
"None of this would happen if it wasn't an impoverished neighborhood," Ms. McGuinness said. "Change is coming. It's already here. But it's not all good."
Mr. Brewer said he too hopes the town will approach development with caution, but also hopes the hamlet study will lead to rejuvenation of Flanders's traditional maritime uses and rezoning to permit the creation of hamlet centers.
Dr. Pennon said a community-wide revitalization would raise hopes for eradicating the blights of drug abuse and unemployment.
"I think the self-esteem of this entire community is going to improve," he said. "It's long overdue."

A Giant Weapons Plant Is Renovated Into Offices

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
THE five flags of the permanent members of the Security Council still fly in front of what was an early site of the United Nations, in Lake Success in Nassau County, just east of the Queens border and 16 miles from Manhattan.
 The United Nations moved out in 1951, however, and the huge property was owned by a series of military contractors until it was sold by Lockheed Martin in 2000 for $21 million to a partnership called I.park Lake Success. 
 Now, the 1.4 million-square-foot complex on 94 acres has been renovated and serves primarily as an office park.
The mix of tenants so far is somewhat different from what the new owners had anticipated. More than half of the space at the complex has been leased, although not to the technology and dot-com companies that had originally been expected. Instead, I.park's tenants are predominantly concerns requiring offices with high-quality finishes and walled rooms. Such spaces bring in higher rents than open industrial space. 
"We are getting significantly more office tenants than we originally planned," said Lynne M. Ward, a principal of I.park Holdings of Greenwich, Conn., which is a partner in I.park Lake Success with Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund IV of Manhattan.
Richard J. Mack, a partner at Apollo, said: "The economy has dictated much of the tenancy. Many of the dot-com and technology companies didn't have the credit."
Of I.park's space, 550,000 square feet has been leased, 450,000 square feet is in negotiations and about 400,000 is still being marketed, Ms. Ward said. Most leases are for 15 years, and the space is being renovated to suit the tenants.
By a ratio of about three to one, Ms. Ward said, the space has been taken by companies seeking traditional office space rather than warehouses. The office tenants include AXA Advisors and Allstate Insurance. Such concerns require "a higher finish to their space and bring in a higher rent," she said. 
Offices at I.park rent for $23 to $25 a foot annually, plus utilities, while warehouse space rents for $12 to $15 a foot, not including taxes or common area maintenance charges. Leasing of the property is through Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island, a division of the national real estate company.
Two years ago, it was estimated that the partnership's total investment in the project would be $70 million, including the purchase price. Today, because of the quality of the office space being created, the projection is that the investment will total approximately $130 million, Ms. Ward said. Nevertheless, she said, "We will be making slightly more profit than we expected because of the higher rents." The start of leasing was later than expected because of the numerous permits required, since half of the property is in the town of North Hempstead and half in the village of Lake Success, Mr. Mack said. 
But the response has been strong, the participants say. "We have a product that most people don't have," said David C. Leviton, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield's Melville-based Long Island office. "Large blocks of space are available at reasonable rental prices, and every tenant is autonomous with their own air-conditioning units and entries."
He added that the wide placement of the steel supporting columns within the main building -- they are spaced 40 feet apart in one direction and 80 in the other -- enables companies to maximize the number of employees they can assign there. 
The ceilings are 16 to 22 feet high and hold many skylights, so there is a lot of natural lighting. Electricity is provided by a 30-megawatt substation connected to three separate Long Island Power Authority stations, reducing the likelihood of severe power failures.
SOME tenants are using on-site contractors to design and construct their spaces. These contractors include representatives from a Manhattan-based architectural firm, the Phillips Group, and a construction and telecommunications company doing business under the I.park name.
The property's buildings that are being leased have their original bricks, which have been cleaned, and energy-efficient glass windows have been installed. 
The north building -- a three-story, 92,000-square-foot office building that housed the United Nations -- includes the "link building," a section that connects to the 1,150,000-square-foot, single-story main building, where planes and submarine systems were built in the past. 
The single-story, 150,000-square-foot free-standing south building, which was once the foundry, is at the rear of the main building. A single tenant is in negotiations for the site.
The remaining property includes the power station, parking lots for 3,800 cars, two soccer fields that have been donated to the town of North Hempstead, a wooded area with several ponds and several smaller buildings that are used for storage.
The spaces that have already been taken range from 6,500 square feet leased to Cablevision for two studios to 165,000 square feet to The New York Times for a distribution center and warehouse. 
A 10,000-square-foot international food court is in the center of the main building, where the corridors were named by Lockheed Martin after streets in Manhattan, including Broadway and 42nd Street. Five 3,000-square-foot cafes, called pantries, are throughout the buildings. 
The north building, which has a penthouse, has been renovated in a post-modern style that has curved corners and other Art Deco design elements.
AXA has leased 45,645 square feet on the first and second floors. The 25,000-square-foot third floor, which has not yet been leased, looks out on the line of flags and a lawn where a memorial garden is being planned. It will rent for approximately $30 a foot. A 4,000-square-foot penthouse will either be part of the lease or be turned into a conference room for about 60 people, Ms. Ward said.
Tenants of the one-story main building include Allstate, which has leased 81,654 square feet for administrative offices and a claims office with a drive-in facility. 
Allstate, has four offices and 387 employees at I.park and "is a case study" of I.park's initial hope that because of the availability of large blocks of space, companies with operations in several locations would consolidate there because of its access to fiber optics and heavy-duty power supplies, Ms. Ward said.
Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which is across Lakeville Road from I.park, has leased 64,647 square feet for office and medical space and 27,418 square feet for warehouse use.
Another tenant in the main building is a financial institution that has leased 39,381 square feet as a backup facility, a use that more companies are investigating since the Sept. 11 attacks, realtors say. "We are starting to see companies coming out of New York City looking for backup facilities," Mr. Leviton said.
OTHER realtors marketing large space once occupied by military contractors say they, too, are getting inquiries about available space for backup offices for "disaster relief," but haven't signed leases yet.
"There have been some inquiries to date, but nothing we would consider imminent," said Arthur Stern, a partner at Cogswell Realty Group, a co-owner with the Rudin family of Manhattan in the 355,000-square-foot Long Island Business and Technology Center on 82 acres in Great River, which is the site of the former Northrop Grumman avionics facility.
"We get inquiries from time to time about possible disaster relief sites," said Jack O'Connor, executive vice president at Melville-based Grubb & Ellis. 
The real estate services company has been marketing property at Epcal, the industrial park at the site of the former Grumman plant in Calverton, where military aircraft was manufactured. 
One New York City company had been interested in 100,000 square feet at the park for backup, he said, but ultimately did not act. "The bottom line," he said, "is because of the economy companies are hesitant to pay two rents."

Building Upscale Rental Projects, Welcome or Not

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DESPITE high prices for houses and condominiums and the sharp declines in the stock market, home sales remain strong, propelled by low interest rates. The movement of buyers who might once have been renters into ownership is being felt by landlords of rental properties. 
 Even vigorous AvalonBay Communities, ranked fourth behind Equity Residential, Archstone-Smith and Aimco among 19 rental apartment real estate investment trusts, is having its first economic challenge. AvalonBay has announced a delay in its plan to build a 39-story, 588-apartment tower at its Avalon on the Sound project at the train station in New Rochelle, joining the existing 24-story, 412-apartment tower. AvalonBay said that because of economic conditions, construction is being put off until next year. 
 The company calculates that its average rents in the metropolitan New York area have fallen $24 a month, or 1.2 percent. Average rents for its properties were $1,934 in the third quarter of 2001, and $1,910 in the third quarter of this year. Average occupancy dropped 4.3 percentage points in that time, from 97.1 percent in the third quarter last year to 92.9 percent this year, and a vacant apartment remains unoccupied for about 23 days. 
A month's free rent is offered on a case by case basis to attract tenants, and turnover nationwide has increased from 60 percent of all units annually to 65 percent, running up losses for downtime and costs for more frequent redecorating between tenants. 
The tougher rental market has been reflected in AvalonBay's share price, which has been fluctuating in the upper $30's, not far above its low for the year, and about 30 percent below this year's high of $52.65. "This is the first time our share price has taken a sharp drop," said Bryce Blair, president of AvalonBay Communities, based in Alexandria, Va., "reflecting the extraordinarily weak fundamentals throughout the country and in our markets."
Still, the company says it has adequate capital to purchase sites for future development, removing them from the reach of rival developers at a time when property is scarce in upscale areas, where Avalon concentrates its developments.
Hewing largely to a business-as-usual strategy, Mr. Blair said, "we have $700 million worth of construction in 13 communities under way," producing 6 to 10 developments a year. In its 146 complexes with 42,914 apartments in 11 states, rents range from $1,000 for a one-bedroom unit in Northern California to $4,500 for a three-bedroom apartment at the 323-unit Avalon Harbor, near completion in Stamford.
AvalonBay communities tend to attract professionals of all ages and singles and couples with or without children who live there as temporary transferees or while scouting a permanent home or simply because they like the lifestyle. The average stay is 7 to 15 months, but some tenants stay for three to six years or more on renewable leases subject to annual rent increases of a minimum of 5 percent. Some of these rises have been temporarily suspended on a case by case basis as the economy has struggled.
The developments have 102 to 323 apartments, which may be located in a number of low-rise country-style buildings, an urban high rise or a single brick midrise wrapped around a center court and covering an entire city block. Amenity packages, including swimming pools, fitness centers, business centers, barbecue grills, flower gardens, indoor basketball and squash courts, concierges and security systems, can trigger an extra charge of $600 a year.
The company began in Connecticut in 1988 as a regional affiliate of Trammell Crow Residential, had an amicable disconnect from Trammell Crow in 1993 and merged with Bay Communities of San Francisco in 1998, when it went public as AvalonBay Communities. It has regularly battled and frequently slain the dragons of local zoning who object to rental properties within their municipalities, especially projects offering "affordable" units, a feature of many AvalonBay developments. 
"We like doing business where business is tough," said Mr. Blair. It is a phrase he repeats frequently, relating to what the industry calls high-barrier-to-entry communities -- the affluent suburbs of major cities where multifamily rental housing and affordable units are regarded as attracting an undesirable transient clientele whose way of life is considered antithetical to the towns' traditional single-family-home styles.
AN affordable housing law enacted in Connecticut in 1989 allows developers to build more units than they would otherwise be authorized if they set aside 20 or more percent of their apartments for low income tenants. Towns had to prove that the developments were harmful to the community in order to reject them, reducing the authority of local zoning boards and fueling resentment and lawsuits.
"Many of our markets require incorporation of an affordable housing component," Mr. Blair said, "in Massachusetts, Washington State, New Jersey, California -- but New England and the San Francisco Bay area have been the most contentious, and Darien and New Canaan in Fairfield County have been the most difficult in our history." 
In litigation drawn out over more than a decade, Darien finally capitulated last year and abandoned efforts to buy 32 acres to thwart an AvalonBay development. Site work has started on a 189-unit complex with 21 "affordables," set aside for families earning no more than 80 percent of the median income of the area or the state, whichever is lower. 
In an equally protracted case involving an approved referendum to condemn an AvalonBay site in New Canaan that was overturned in court, the company has ended up building on two sites. One site holds a recently completed office building, partly occupied by AvalonBay itself, and the other holds 104 new apartments, opened this month, with 21 affordables. The market rate for a three-bedroom unit (the only size left) is now $2,991, $300 less than when the building first went on the market, said Karen Loyd, the property manager, and 61 percent of the units have been leased. A three-bedroom unit at the affordable rate is $2,400, unchanged; a family of four taking such a unit could earn no more than $58,000 a year.
The Town of Orange tried to condemn AvalonBay property zoned for affordable housing in a five-year legal battle that ended when the court decided Orange's professed need for industrial development was a ruse to keep affordable housing out. Mitchell Goldblatt, the first selectman, said: "The town still doesn't want 168 apartments. The site is not appropriate for housing. It's surrounded by a tool and die company, a Pez factory and Wallach Surgical Devices."
Three lawsuits against AvalonBay by Milford over a proposal for 284 apartments are before an appeals court, on issues of a zone change, a sewer permit and a site plan, while Stratford has cited safety concerns in a suit against a 146-apartment complex.
Around the state, many towns have filed suits over what they characterize as inappropriate development that provides windfalls for developers, and such arguments have made inroads. In 1999 there were court rulings against three developers, favoring the towns of Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater on issues of environmental degradation, potable water and open space. Avalon subsequently withdrew an application in Newtown. 
"Those decisions reminded everyone that affordable housing is not a cakewalk for developers," said Timothy Hollister, a Hartford lawyer who specializes in defending projects that include affordable housing.
"What happened in 2000," he continued, "was a bipartisan effort studied in the Connecticut Legislature for six months" that had the effect of making projects with affordable units less attractive to developers. 
Samuel Fuller, executive vice president for construction and development at AvalonBay, said there was "no question that it minimized use of the law," as a legal wedge to overcome community opposition to multifamily developments. He added: "By reducing profitability, alternative uses for the land become more viable. Watering down the law has deterred us from doing a number of projects we had planned."
As successful as AvalonBay has been in producing a small but significant crop of luxury rental units at less than market rates, it has not, of course, done so for philanthropic reasons. While it still has affordables in projects that are under way, it has been moving in other directions. 
Danbury, for example, where AvalonBay has built 403 units in two projects and is shepherding a new 234-apartment complex through town boards, does not need more housing priced below market rates. "They want multifamily rental housing to encourage employment growth by providing places to live," said Mark Forlenza, AvalonBay's regional vice president for development. In New Rochelle and Jersey City, where revitalization has been ongoing and affordable housing exists, AvalonBay's luxury housing is seen as invigorating the local economy. As part of Norwalk's redevelopment, AvalonBay will build a 314-apartment complex, replacing a downtown Pathmark supermarket, without affordables.
The company keeps and manages its projects for about six years, when some may be sold, in order to avoid rises in maintenance and capital costs. Buyers, according to Mr. Blair, "may turn them into condominiums, but AvalonBay does not and will not do condos," he said, although other developers are converting to avoid the poor rental market. "It's an entirely different business," said Mr. Blair."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Connecticut and Westchester copies last Sunday about rental housing built by the AvalonBay company misstated its policy on eventual sale of its projects. While the company does sell its developments from time to time, it does not do so after six years; that figure is the average age of its properties. The company has kept most of the properties it has developed, in some cases for more than 20 years.

HEADLINE: A Delicate Balance: Community Facilities And Communities 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS have always lived shoulder to shoulder with their institutions. But for 40 years, the institutions have had more zoning muscle.
 Schools, universities, hospitals, medical offices, nursing homes, houses of worship and other institutions defined by law as "community facilities" are allowed to build far larger structures than would otherwise be permitted in residential areas. The planning theory is that they serve the general welfare, belong in neighborhoods rather than commercial districts and, by their very nature, need more space to operate efficiently. 
 The planning result, however, has agitated residents from Greenwich Village to Flushing, Queens, as they watch community facilities fill the skyline with bulky profiles and nearby streets with traffic. 
Two dozen neighborhood leaders joined together 12 days ago to form the Citywide Coalition for Community Facility Reform. They question why community facilities need to be up to twice as bulky as nearby buildings, why they are permitted to cluster in certain neighborhoods and even what constitutes a community facility.
At the same time, the City Planning Department is studying proposals for a series of changes in community facility zoning, working with Councilman Tony Avella of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning subcommittee. "The residential character of many neighborhoods throughout the city is being destroyed," he said.
Efforts to revamp the zoning did not get far in the past. Sylvia Deutsch, the planning director under Mayor Edward I. Koch, said she would have reduced the "very disruptive" bulk of community facilities outside Manhattan had Mr. Koch been re-elected. Joseph B. Rose, the director under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, hoped to open manufacturing zones to community facilities and increase restrictions on medical offices in residential areas.
Parking provisions and manufacturing zones are at the top of the agenda for Amanda M. Burden, the current planning director. "Community facilities provide vital services and are an important part of the fabric of our city," she said. "On the other hand, they, like other land uses, can sometimes have negative impacts on the neighborhoods in which they're located."
For the time being, the revisions will not address the issue of building bulk, though that is the lightning rod in Manhattan. The construction this year of the Kimmel Center for University Life at New York University, on Washington Square South, was one of the sparks behind the creation of the new citywide coalition. The 11-story structure will serve as the student center on completion early next year. Even under construction, it has claimed a prominent place in the familiar vista through the Washington Arch.
"Where arch and sky were previously dramatically framed by lower Fifth Avenue, this view now looks more like a blind alley," wrote Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and one of the organizers of the new coalition. "Many assumed that given the wealth of historic resources in close proximity to the proposed building, there would be some greater degree of regulation or control over such a large project. There was not."
With 149,700 square feet above ground, the center is 85 percent larger than a private development could be on the same site. In the R7-2 zone, a medium-density apartment house district, dwellings may have a floor area 3.44 times greater than the lot area (or 81,029 square feet in the case of this 23,555-square-foot parcel), while community facilities may have a floor area 6.5 times greater (or 153,107 square feet, just slightly more than the center will have).
From the perspective of New York University, the badly needed center followed the regulatory regime exactly.
"Within an R7-2 zone, this is considered appropriate scale," said John H. Beckman, the assistant vice president for public affairs, noting the presence of other large buildings on Washington Square. "The community facility is not a bonus within the Zoning Resolution. The community facility is a policy within the Zoning Resolution that contemplates the special needs and special contributions that certain institutions make to the life of the city."
"This is part of what we need and our students need to make this a functioning community," he said. "It's not as though we're newly arrived on the block. We've been here since 1831."
Shelly S. Friedman of Friedman & Gotbaum, a lawyer who has represented the building plans of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 92nd Street Y, Spence School and Council on Foreign Relations, said institutions do not face easy choices.
"The overwhelming concern is adjacency," he said. "Whether you're a hospital, a school or a cultural institution, you'd rather not be in two buildings if you could be in one." If institutions concentrate on a site, he said, they are criticized as too bulky. If they disperse into other properties, they are accused of taking over the neighborhood.
Indeed, it was partly to prevent the acquisition by tax-exempt organizations of large swaths of land -- particularly the most revenue-rich property in commercial districts -- that city planners adopted the generous community-facility zoning in residential areas. If institutions are allowed to construct extra space on smaller sites, so this theory goes, more surrounding property stays on the tax rolls.
When building height limits were proposed during Mr. Rose's tenure, the Greater New York Hospital Association was among the most outspoken opponents.
"The floor-to-floor heights for health-care facilities are higher than in residential buildings," Susan C. Waltman, the senior vice president of the association, testified before the City Planning Commission in 2000. "This is so because they must house operating rooms, special equipment, auditoriums and patient care areas with extensive electrical, plumbing, H.V.A.C. and other special service needs." Height and bulk limits, she said, would be disastrous.
Ms. Burden questions height limits generally -- though she said the image of the Kimmel Center rising over Washington Square "really takes your breath away" -- and said she would concentrate for now on "the impact of both religious institutions and medical facilities on low-density neighborhoods and the huge numbers of people visiting these facilities that were never meant to be regional."
Neighbors in a semisuburban section of Queens have spotted license plates from New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania on cars parked outside their homes, said Tyler D. Cassell, the president of the North Flushing Civic Association.
In 1990, he said, there were community facilities on seven lots in an eight-block area between Bayside and 34th Avenues, 146th and Union Streets. Today, there are at least 45, including the Evergreen Presbyterian Church, Masjid Hazrat Abubakr, Pillars of Faith Tabernacle and St. Paul Chong Ha-Sang Roman Catholic Chapel and Center.
AMONG the most visible is the Union Plaza Care Center, a nursing home built six years ago in an R-6 district, where a community facility may have 4.8 times as much floor area as its lot area; double the allowable density of residential development.
Though it is strikingly out of scale with its immediate surroundings, the building is no larger than several other institutional structures in the neighborhood, said Charlton Rhee, the assistant administrator.
More important, Mr. Rhee said, is that almost all of its 280 residents come from Flushing. "We feel that we're really an integral part of the community," he said. "The community actually wanted this facility and we generated quite a few jobs."
Less obtrusive on the skyline, but of equal concern to neighbors, are medical offices and houses of worship in existing buildings. "It's become economically viable to buy a one-family house on a small lot on a quiet residential street and all of a sudden have a facility that can fit 500 people and not provide parking," Councilman Avella said.
"They're parking at fire hydrants, intersections, other people's driveways," he said. "This has become quite a nightmare."
Community facility regulations specify that churches provide one off-street parking space for every 10, 15 or 20 fixed seats, depending on the residential district. "If you have a pew bolted to the floor, you fall under normal zoning requirements," Mr. Avella said. "If you have folding chairs, you don't have to provide one parking space."
A more subtle impact of community-facility zoning is in rear yards. A community facility can cover the entire rear yard of a property, which would otherwise have to remain open, up to a height of 23 feet. Doctors' offices are among those that have taken advantage of this provision.
"By far more rear yards have been overrun by optometrists than by major hospitals or private schools," Mr. Friedman said.
There is a further question of what happens if the community facility moves out. A study of rear-yard encroachments prepared in 1997 for Civitas, a civic group, found at least two instances in which the additions had been converted to residential use.
George T. Votis, the chairman of Galt Industries, recently proposed a rear-yard addition at 41 East 62nd Street. It was to have had a multipurpose room for auditions, rehearsals and occasional performances by the Philharmonia Orchestra of London -- in other words, a community facility. (Mr. Votis is the treasurer of the Philharmonia Foundation, the orchestra's fund-raising arm in the United States.)
Mr. Friedman, who usually represents community facilities, argued the other side on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, of which Ronald O. Perelman is chairman, owners of the adjoining building at 35 East 62nd Street. Speaking of Mr. Votis's proposal, Mr. Friedman said, "On that theory, I could allow the Boy Scouts to use my living room for a meeting once a month and on that basis build out my rear yard -- were I so fortunate as to have one."
The application has since been withdrawn, said Robert S. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Votis, "because the foundation did not like being the subject of litigation."
This case illustrates how tricky it can be to administer rear-yard additions. Add to that the complications of balancing institutional and residential needs when it comes to buildings' size, then throw in the constitutional questions posed by any attempt to regulate houses of worship, and it is clear how sensitive the issue of limiting community facilities can be.
Nonetheless, Ms. Burden said that when she was appointed chairwoman of the City Planning Commission nine months ago, after 10 years as a member, "one of the first questions I heard was, 'Are you going to do something about community facilities that nobody has had the nerve to do?' "
"Why not bite off pieces of it?" she said. "That's my approach."

DATELINE: MANALAPAN 

 BODY:
JERRY COLLINCINI, director of parks and recreation in this sprawling central New Jersey town, said he saw the trouble coming at least a dozen years ago as clearly as a batter sees a hanging curve.
 "From the smallest youngsters playing, we were identifying abuse and violence at sporting events as a huge problem, even back then," said Mr. Collincini. "For the most part, unfortunately, it was parents. You just wonder who the games are for." 
 This summer, the State Legislature and Governor McGreevey agreed on what is being called a sports rage bill that speaks to the fragile state of youth sports. The bill, one of the first in the nation to address this subject, passed with overwhelming support in both the Assembly and the Senate. It provides support for youth sports organizations that adopt codes of conduct for players, spectators and coaches. 
It also upgrades the crime of excessive abuse -- either physical or verbal, at events where the participants are under 16 -- from simple assault to aggravated assault, and can result in jail terms of up to 18 months or fines up to $10,000. It also allows leagues to ban violent or abusive players, spectators or coaches and requires them to take anger-management courses before returning.
"I would volunteer myself to be an umpire and I would find people just being plain obnoxious around kids," said a main sponsor of the measure, Senator Steven Sweeney, a Democrat who represents parts of Gloucester, Salem and Cumberland Counties. "A friend of mine took his daughter to a high school football game and he had to take her home because fans were cursing and just being abusive. There was no way to kick people like this out before."
Then he added, "But I admit, it's a shame that it has come to this."
Sports among school-age children never used to be so organized. But more and more, choose-up baseball games and touch football in the streets have gone the way of family cars with fins. In their place, organized youth sports have proliferated. An estimated 38 million children in the United States are involved in organized sports -- 19 million of them in soccer alone -- twice the number as in the early 1980's. Leagues, clinics and tournaments for all ages abound.
Over the recent Columbus Day weekend, for instance, Cape May County held the 10th annual George Pratt Memorial Soccer Tournament, the largest one in the state, in which more than 5,000 players from ages 8 through 14 participated on 356 teams. Even then, organizers said 150 teams had to be turned away for lack of playing fields.
"Soccer may be the biggest these days, but there is no let-up in other sports," said Bill Foelsch, the executive director of the New Jersey Recreation and Park Association. "Even cheerleading is going beyond rooting for football, with its own competitions. Girls are looking for more things, too, like field hockey. Little Leagues have no trouble filling fields."
Yet there is a darker side to the growing reach of organized youth sports, and much of it, say administrators, psychologists and even parents themselves, comes from overzealous parents. The National Youth Sports Coaches Association keeps a log of incidents, and these are some of the incidents from New Jersey that show up on its Web site:
*A baseball coach in Rockaway was fined $1,000 and placed on a five-day work program for grabbing a 13-year-old player by the shirt collar, yanking him to his toes and yelling and cursing in his face.
*In Hazlet, a parent and an umpire exchanged blows during a grade-school baseball game.
*A father in Manalapan punched and verbally abused a youth baseball coach who he said had not given his son enough playing time.
*A soccer game between 8- and 9-year-old girls ended in a fight among parents over where a coach could stand.
*A brawl among parents at a midget football game in Somerdale sent players and cheerleaders scurrying from the field to avoid being swallowed up in the clash.
*In Clayton, the mayor and the council are suing each other over how the youth football league should be run.
"I just hear stories again and again about police having to be called to an under-9 soccer game," said Enrique L. Meana, the youth director of coaching in New Jersey. "The stress to be No. 1 in the league, to have the best of everything, I think it is going to kill youth sports if it doesn't stop."
Though few clashes are as egregious as the fight among two fathers at hockey game in Massachusetts that left one of them dead, the potential is there, and the incidents are far from isolated occurrences.
To try to lower the temperature, Mr. Meana has asked his coaches not to keep standings and, if possible, not even to keep score in leagues where the children are under 10. If more than two teams are invited to play, he wants to call the events festivals rather than tournaments and to avoid giving trophies unless every participant gets one.
"I wanted to put that age limit up to 13, because to concentrate so much on winning at such young ages is harmful," he said, "but, then, I knew parents would look at me like I was crazy. Fortunately, some people understand. I think here in New Jersey we are often ahead of the curve."
While the state is now stepping into the fray, it is not the first entity to take action. Last month, the Nassau County Legislature on Long Island adopted a measure under which parents must agree to teach their children "that honest effort is as important as winning" and that "officials are important parts of the game" whose honesty is not to be questioned. They must not, that is, curse, scream at or threaten the referee. Earlier, Suffolk County, also on Long Island, adopted a similar measure.
As for the current push in New Jersey, the Youth Sports Research Council at Rutgers University has played a pivotal role.
The council, based in the university's Exercise Science and Sport Studies Department, was established in the mid-1980's, according to its director, Gregg Heinzmann.
At that time, Mr. Heinzmann said, there was a concern that youth sports leagues might not be able to get insurance and that coaches might have had to bear any liability. So, the State Legislature passed a bill exempting coaches from personal liability if they took a safety course. Since then, more than 120,000 volunteer coaches in have taken the course at Rutgers, and six other states have modeled courses after it. "That is a good thing," Mr. Heinzmann said. "But now we have another perceived crisis."
Although he supports the proposed measure to rein in overzealous parents and participants, he is also afraid of overreactions.
"I have not seen any credible studies that have substantiated the oft-repeated claim that violence in youth sports is escalating or reached epidemic proportions," he said. "There are two issues. One is clearly more children participating in organized youth sports, which could account for an increase in the absolute number of incidents we hear about. And then there is the plausible explanation that this has captured attention because we have a convenient term for it. There is road rage and airport rage and now sports rage. It has more to do with the rapid pace of life and overcrowding. There is nothing inherent in sport that suggests that this is unique to this activity."
Still, along with Senator Sweeney's bill, there is stark evidence that the state is reacting swiftly to the issue of sports rage: the recreation department in New Brunswick is finishing a sports complex with three baseball fields that according to Mike Blackwell, the recreation director, are designed to be sports-rage proof.
"The key is to keep parents away from the dugouts and home plate, so there won't be any incidents with players, umpires and coaches," Mr. Blackwell said.
At the new complex, a thick, green mesh behind the dugouts and home plate areas obscures vision to limit confrontations. In addition, the stands are positioned farther than usual down the first- and third-base lines so that spectators are a little bit more removed from the main action. Two of the fields are six feet above grade with decorative block around the main part of the field.
"Sometimes when I videotape games, I end up videotaping what parents are doing on the sidelines," Mr. Blackwell said. "I've been coaching 22 years and it has definitely gotten worse in my mind. You try to explain to parents what proper conduct is. But now, maybe we have to do things like this."
Then there is Mike Schapiro, a leader of the huge Mid-New Jersey Youth Soccer Association, which has 75 leagues and 900 teams. He distributes a different kind of videotape, and he initiated a different type of drill after he became appalled at the lack of civility at games involving even the youngest players.
"There was no respect for officials," he said. "Parents were just getting carried away and forgetting that this is supposed to be for the enjoyment of kids. I just felt we had to do something."
Two years ago, he started SAGE, or Set A Good Example, with a seven-step code -- Rule 7, for instance, shows ways to hold down the score of a game so as not to discourage the losing team. Every T-shirt, every trophy, every flier connected to the association has the SAGE logo on it. In addition, during a mandatory meeting with parents, Mr. Schapiro shows a 16-minute video entitled "Kids Come First" that begins with parents jeering on the sidelines and ends with an overload of testimony from children and psychologists imploring parents to cool it.
"In a way, it's a shame we have to have this, but I think here in New Jersey, we are trying to stay ahead of the curve," said Mr. Schapiro, who has set up a foundation called Kindness Counts (www.kindness-counts.org) to distribute the video to other leagues. "We figure if parents start respecting officials and coaches, then kids will, too. It's an epidemic and, frankly, I don't know why otherwise anyone will want to be a referee."
Just why the situation exists at all is a complex question, says Dr. Joel Fish, who runs the Center for Sport Psychology in Philadelphia.
"I think part of it is reflective of the greater importance of sports in our society over the last 15 or 20 years," Dr. Fish said. "In the 1950's or 1960's, you'd ask a kid for three heroes and at least two of them would be politicians or doctors or scientists. Now, at least two of them are athletes. So that filters back to the parents."
In addition, he points out how the changes in society are reflected in the lives of children. He says, for instance, that parents seem to want more structure in their children's play, largely because they are afraid of sending them to a playground unattended. What's more, Dr. Fish says, the league play allows parents -- in this era of two working parents -- a scheduled time to spend with their children.
"But it also increases pressure on winning and losing," he said. "That is a problem. Parents don't seem to think the play time is productive if there isn't this sort of end. There is this ranking of teams and sons and daughters at a younger and younger age. The stakes get higher and higher."
Consider, also, the steep rise -- almost 50 percent -- in the number of youth sports activities, fed largely by an increase in the number of girls playing sports.
For instance in Sparta, a town of about 18,000, there are 50 basketball teams for girls from grade four through eight, say Ginny Hafeman-Mohr, the town's recreation director.
"I think we've been able to start the girls in a healthier way," Ms. Hafeman-Mohr said. "We don't keep standings and don't give trophies, but everyone gets a participation pin. We stress learning new skills and healthy lifestyle and socializing with peers, and it has seemed to work."
She wonders, however, where the girls go when the leagues stop. "There are two lighted basketball courts in the center of town," she said, "and I have to admit, I've never seen girls playing pick-up there."
Whatever advantages the structure provides, many recreation directors and psychologists nonetheless lament the preponderance of supervised leagues over free play, especially for younger children. And they point to studies showing that as many as two-thirds of the youths who play in leagues stop participating in any sports -- even just in school yards -- by high school.
"It's hard to say whether they burn out on playing in leagues or through parental pressure," Dr. Fish said. "You hear a lot of parents talking about scholarships even before the kids are in high school. I'll admit, I have three kids, and when you talk about saving $150,000, it's a mighty inviting thought."
If the pressure from parents in team sports is great, it may well be worse in individual sports. Phil Birnbaum, a consultant to the tennis committee for the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, says as many as 20,000 boys and girls play high school tennis in the state.
"Parents may have sunk a lot of time and money in lessons," Mr. Birnbaum said, "and they don't want it wasted."
For his part, Mr. Birnbaum saw the pressure from parents beginning to build in the mid-1980's, when two parents started a brawl at the high school state championships at Princeton University, with one player having to stop play to climb over the fence and break it up.
"In football, at least you are on the sidelines far away from the game," he said. "In tennis, which is self-policing for the most part, parents come right up to the court, yelling, coaching, all sorts of things. I saw one parent tell his son to start a fight with an opponent."
To lower the tensions, at least at high school tennis matches, a rule now prohibits players and coaches from speaking in any language other than English on the court.
"We've had players curse in Russian at their opponents," he said. "Sometimes there is just too much pressure put on kids."
Despite the escalation in violence, no one is saying that leagues should be banned or that parental involvement is inherently a bad thing.
"More kids are getting out and staying healthier and learning life skills," Dr. Fish said. "There is a real connection between a healthy mind and a healthy body. Parents are right in wanting to get their kids out of the house to play. And it is good that this cuts across urban-suburban and socio-economic lines."
Indeed, cities and suburbs all over the state are clamoring for more playing fields. In New Brunswick, the new 15-acre Youth Sports Complex was reclaimed from a former brownfields site in the middle of the city. In Haddon Township, environmentalists and parents are embroiled in a dispute over how much of what used to be a forest tract should be taken for playing fields. More and more school bond issues have new gymnasiums in elementary schools.
"The challenge for us is to provide a balance," said Mr. Foelsch, the head of the state recreation association. "Sports can be such a good thing for kids in a complicated world. It's great that in Newark and in the rich suburbs there are parents now who want to volunteer their time to help. There is an explosion of activities for children."
He cautioned, "We just have to hope that the pressure from some parents doesn't ruin it all."

Helping Those Without

BYLINE:  By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

DATELINE: OSSINING 

 BODY:
JUST over three decades ago, local community groups here got together to offer children free camp physicals. Not only did they have far more boys and girls take advantage of the free checkups than anticipated, but they also discovered that many of the children examined hadn't had a physical in more than five years. Some had serious conditions that needed further treatment. 
 The event revealed the need for affordable local medical care and led to the start of Open Door, then a free clinic, whose mission embraced the concept that good medical care was a right rather than a privilege. The original practice, begun in 1972 and supported by volunteers, was run out of the basement of the First Baptist Church of Ossining. 
 This week, the Open Door Family Medical Center is celebrating its 30th anniversary. Physically, it bears little resemblance to the small clinic it once was. A full service, primary care practice with offices in Ossining, Sleepy Hollow and Rye Brook, the program serves more than 20,000 patients a year. 
The mission -- to serve the economically disadvantaged -- has remained the same. So has the need. Nearly half the patients seen at the three offices are without health insurance; those who must pay out of pocket are charged on a sliding scale. 
"We've always been committed to the most vulnerable residents in our community," said Lindsay Farrell, president and chief executive officer of Open Door Family Medical Center. "Thirty years ago that was an Afro-American population. The community has changed and we've had an influx of Latinos from Central and South America and the Caribbean as well. The organization has changed to respond to the changing demographics. But the economics of patients haven't changed. We're here for people who can't access the traditional medical system, the uninsured and the folks on Medicaid and Child Health Plus."
The number of Americans without health insurance rose to 41.2 million last year, an increase of 1.4 million, according to a report released by the Census Bureau last month. In New York, the percentage of those without health insurance is even higher than the national average. The Census Bureau reported that 14.6 percent of the population was without insurance in 2001; in New York almost 16 percent was without insurance. 
While there are no published figures of the number of uninsured in the county, Ms. Farrell estimated that in Westchester, the percentage is higher than the state average, given the densely populated communities in the southern parts of the county. Moreover, the figures do not include patients who are out of work and whose extended insurance is running out. Under the federal law known as Cobra, workers are allowed to continue policies for up to 18 months if they pay the full premiums. Nor do the figures include all undocumented immigrants.
Nearly 90 percent of Open Door's patients have incomes at or below the federal poverty level; 45 percent do not have health insurance. Traditionally, the patients who go to the medical center are poor. But Ms. Farrell said recently the medical group has been seeing more middle-class patients who have lost their insurance coverage. Cobra coverage for a family costs $600 a month, on average nearly two-thirds of the total average monthly unemployment check of $939, according to a recent analysis by Families USA, a consumer health care advocacy group in Washington. 
The medical center, with operating costs at roughly $10 million a year, is financed by federal, state and county grants, private foundations and donations and patient fees, including both Medicaid and other insurance payments, and from direct payments from patients.
A visit to Open Door belies the stereotypical image of a clinic that serves the poor. A staff of 13 doctors, 6 dentists, 4 nurse practitioners and 3 mental health counselors provide a range of services, including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, H.I.V. testing and care, mental health services and dentistry. The medical center is run with an emphasis on preventative care. Babies squirm in their mother's arms in the pediatric waiting room, waiting for checkups and immunizations. Women come for their annual pap smears and mammograms. Patients are educated about managing chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma.
Open Door stresses a team approach to treating illness. For patients who lack benefits, and for whom taking a day off from work means taking a day without pay, it is difficult to schedule visits to multiple doctors. Patients who are being treated for diabetes, for instance, can have their blood sugar measured, see an ophthalmologist, a podiatrist and a nutritionist under one roof on the same day. Patients with H.I.V. may see one of three H.I.V. specialists with the practice, but their visit might also include appointments with the dentist, a psychologist and a nutritionist. The medical center tested more than 2,000 people last year for H.I.V., and treats one third of the AIDS patients in central Westchester.
The expansion of Open Door has not been without controversy. In the early 1990's, the medical center wanted to open an office in downtown Port Chester. Village officials rebuffed the bid for the proposed location, saying that they feared Open Door would eventually buy the building and take it off the tax rolls. But some supporters of the medical center said that the village's opposition was rooted in fear that the new clinic would attract more Hispanics to the area, a charge that village officials denied.
The medical group eventually opened an office in neighboring Rye Brook, and last spring, Open Door added dental services to that office. Dr. Janet Bozzone, director of Open Door's dental program, said she was overwhelmed by the prominence of dental disease she found in communities here. 
"We're really in the third world here in Ossining and Port Chester," Dr. Bozzone said. "I had a little boy in the other day -- he had eight teeth and eight cavities."
Ms. Farrell said that the medical center still hopes to move into a building in downtown Port Chester. The center is also working closely with the Port Chester school system to open a school-based health clinic in the Edison School. Port Chester has high rates of unimmunized children, she said, and many children who suffer from asthma and diabetes. 
"In Port Chester, as in any community where there is a significant population of low-income families, many parents are working on hourly wages and don't have benefits," Ms. Farrell said. "They don't have health insurance, they don't have personal days, they don't have vacations, and it's difficult for parents to give up a day of work to bring their children to the doctor. Imagine the convenience for working parents of having a nurse-practitioner in the school, who can examine the child and send the prescription home in the backpack."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
New University Plan Could Help Biotech Corridor

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
GOV. JAMES McGREEVEY'S proposal to consolidate Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry and the New Jersey Institute of Technology into one system is apparently discomfiting to many in the academic world -- but many commercial real estate market specialists say they find the idea compelling. 
 The restructuring would raise the efficiency and prestige of the state's higher-education system and attract more research money, in the view of brokers. They say New Jersey's biotechnology "research corridor" would become markedly hotter property as a result. 
 The corridor is loosely defined as a string of research and development centers, biotechnology companies and labs clustered around academic institutions, stretching from Newark to Princeton.
"The corridor exists; it's important to the state economy," said Cushman & Wakefield's managing director for New Jersey, Christopher Kinum, "but is not being fully realized. There could be a tremendous confluence of resources between our educational institutions and biotech companies, generating nothing but good -- jobs, a revived economy, and more research that can provide cures for major diseases afflicting the world."
Mr. Kinum said the proposed restructuring of the university system is perfectly designed to spur development of more public or private research "compounds," or technical parks, like those that have proliferated near universities in California and Massachusetts.
The state now has such an enclave at the Technology Centre of New Jersey in New Brunswick -- near both Rutgers, the big public university, and the private Princeton University -- which was developed four years ago under the auspices of the state Economic Development Authority. It offers facilities ranging from tiny incubator spaces for start-ups to medium-sized offices and labs. 
Cushman is trying to position itself as a force behind the proliferation of technical parks here. The real estate firm recently established what it calls the Technology Enterprise Group to coordinate efforts to offer services for government entities, businesses and academic research organizations that want to develop research and development facilities, high-tech operations, incubator labs and the like. A former New Jersey secretary of commerce, Gualberto Medina, recently joined Cushman's East Rutherford office as the program's director.
"We are passing into a revolutionary period in the world economy," Mr. Medina said earlier this month. "This economy is now being driven by knowledge-based industries -- 'info tech' and life sciences. In New Jersey, which is one of the nation's foremost high-tech centers, it is also being driven by the integrating of these technologies."
Mr. Medina said more than 355,000 people, almost 10 percent of the state's work force, are employed in life sciences -- pharmaceutical and biotech companies -- or in the electronic technology field.
"The high-tech sector is going to determine the success of New Jersey's economy in the future," Mr. Medina said unequivocally. The proposed reorganization of higher education indicates that the McGreevey administration recognizes this, he added.
New Jersey already has the largest concentration of pharmaceutical company headquarters. Recently, real estate brokers have begun focusing on attracting biopharmaceutical companies, which are often small start-up operations working on cutting-edge medical research, or new and growing entities as the result of a merger.
THIS kind of enterprise may need assistance not only in locating space near academic resources but also in working with government agencies and programs intended to promote growth and in filling fluctuating space needs, brokers said.
For example, Grubb & Ellis is handling the real estate needs of MedPointe Inc., which last year acquired Carter-Wallace Inc., another nationally known pharmaceutical company. New, larger headquarters were quickly leased for MedPointe in Somerset, and last summer a 20,000-square-foot laboratory and research and development space was leased near Princeton, at Cedar Brook Corporate Center in Cranbury Township in Middlesex County.
The Cranbury building is "flex space," intended for flexible use and zoned for research and development, said Doug Petrozzini, the Grubb senior vice president who brokered the lease. The site received $4 million in improvements four years ago, when another business had moved in, and was easily adapted to suit MedPointe. "With more than a million square feet of space remaining at Cedar Brook," Mr. Petrozzini said, "the location also offers almost unlimited future expansion opportunity."
In Bergen County, by contrast, there is something of a trade-off for companies that are starting up or expanding, according to Insignia/ESG, which handles a great deal of business there: great location but older buildings. Currently, there are 107 life sciences companies between Paramus and Montvale and between Teterboro and the George Washington Bridge, according to Insignia/ESG's count. These include such well-established companies as Daiichi Pharmaceutical, Alteon, Quest Diagnostics, Bioreferences Laboratories, Alpharma, Pharmachem and Solgar Vitamin and Herb.
"Bergen County offers easy access to New York City and also Hackensack Medical Center and Newark's University Hospital research facilities," pointed out Jeffrey Babikian, Insignia/ESG's senior managing director in New Jersey. "This allows life science companies greater ease in professional recruitment, as well as the increased opportunity to foster collaboration between scientists."
Insignia/ESG recently brokered a lease for Memory Pharmaceuticals, which conducts research into learning and memory disorders. The company explicitly wanted access to teaching hospitals and a highly educated labor pool, and it leased 30,000 square feet in a 76,000-square-foot building in Montvale that can accommodate its plans to grow.
When a company is looking for start-up space or wants to expand, the stock of previously built laboratories might not seem as appealing as flex space that can be built out to suit it, Mr. Babikian said. On the other hand, he said, prebuilt space can provide a cheaper, faster alternative.
Growth often occurs in quick bursts for biotech companies, he and other market experts noted, making planning ahead a challenge.
Three years ago, Cushman secured a 12,000-square-foot space for Genta Inc., a new biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of anticancer therapies. Genta expanded its lease twice at Connell Corporate Center in Berkeley Heights, and today the firm occupies 93,000 square feet.
Jeff Heller, the Cushman broker who heads a team managing Genta's space requirements, said he was working with several other companies at the same level of maturity as Genta, and also with several start-ups. Beyond the basics in real estate services, Mr. Heller said, Cushman provides such companies with assistance in interviewing architects, engineers and interior design firms. 
For Genta, Mr. Heller said he had also arranged to introduce the company's principals to Henry Kurz, an account manager with the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission. "Through this introduction, we applied for and were approved for a Business Employment Incentive Program grant that will have significant economic benefits," said Gregg Siefert of Genta.
Mr. Kinum of Cushman described Genta as an incubator company that has grown into "a real company" and said New Jersey needs "many more Gentas."

HEADLINE: In Land of the Jobless, The Extreme Approach 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN 

 BODY:
YOU revamped your resume months ago, networked until you can't stand to look at a telephone and even hired a job coach. You still can't find a job. You're ready to wear a sandwich board to advertise yourself, or send a gimmick along with your resume. Maybe even work for no pay.
 You have company. In September, John Sawicki, 30, who has an M.B.A. and five years' experience as a product manager with Deutsche Bank in Manhattan, signed on with Novantech Solutions, a start-up in Palisades, N.Y., to work free. "Normally someone my age, with my qualifications, would have to be crazy to do this," he said. 
 With unemployment claims steady and companies still delaying hiring because of lower profits and the threat of war with Iraq, desperate times do not just call for desperate measures for job seekers like Mr. Sawicki. They shout for last resorts.
So when Mr. Sawicki, who lives in Brooklyn, learned that Novantech had openings -- albeit not the paying kind -- he did not hesitate. He had been attending graduate school part time while working at Deutsche Bank, but decided to finish his degree full time and try to find a more rewarding position in the technology field. Armed with an M.B.A. in finance and information systems, Mr. Sawicki had been job hunting since his graduation from Fordham University in August 2001.
Novantech's offer of a future salary when the company became profitable seemed attractive. Mr. Sawicki will be learning a new field and gaining marketable skills, and he could continue job hunting in case the company did not turn a profit. "I'd have to be crazy not to take their offer," he said.
Mr. Sawicki was interviewed on a park bench; the company does not have offices yet. But that is fine with him, as long as he can learn. He does a little bit of everything for the company -- marketing, recruiting, updating the Web site, for now, and eventually he hopes to manage projects. He works from his home three days a week while continuing to look for a paid position.
Sacrificing a salary might seem a little extreme, but at least it makes a good impression on a potential employer. Some job hunters, straining to stand out from the crowd, make the mistake of resorting to gimmicks that are more likely to rub hiring managers the wrong way. Christopher Jones, vice president for content development at HotJobs.com, tells the story of an applicant who sent a company a box of chocolates with his resume. Another made a stab at humor, asking a food company in his cover letter whether it was "hungry for a good worker." Yet another put a bag of sand and a gold coin in his packet, promoting himself as "buried treasure."
"That's taking a metaphor a bit too far in the job hunt," Mr. Jones said.
Well, that may not always be true. In creative fields like advertising or television, pushing the envelope is accepted, even admired. Robert Wilson, now a resident of Vermont, recalls his early days of job hunting, when he parlayed a hyped resume, a messenger-delivered follow-up letter and a half-dozen phone calls to the producer of "NBC Nightly News" into an audition, even though he had no on-camera experience.
"I heard that their consumer reporter was leaving, so I wrote and told them what that person had been doing wrong and what I'd do to improve the segment," Mr. Wilson recalled. Alas, he did not get the job.
Stuart Simons is hoping his artistic talent will give him a leg up in his job search. He has his own commercial-photography, illustration and digital-imaging company and went back to school for an M.B.A. Now he wants to sit on the other side of the creative desk. In September, he responded to an ad for a marketing manager with Kiehl's, a Manhattan cosmetics company.
Mr. Simons, a resident of Pound Ridge, N.Y., designed a label with a message styled after an advertisement on one of the company's shampoos and applied it to one of their shampoo bottles. Then he designed a custom box for the bottle and used his resume as packing material. On tissue paper covering the box, he wrote yet another message, about thinking inside and outside the box.
"The whole thing was pretty impressive," he said, although he is still waiting to hear.
The proliferation of such gimmickry comes as no surprise to Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations in the graduate school of management at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
"In a job market with few layoffs, people have a sense that there's something they can do to find a job," Mr. Chaison said. "But now, almost everyone at least knows someone who's been laid off, so job seekers feel they have to take extreme measures to be noticed. It's especially sad for people who are highly specialized and aren't able to relocate."
Sad or not, extreme measures can work if they are done right. Allison Hemming is president of the Hired Guns, a Manhattan temporary employment agency, and also the author of a book -- "Work It!"-- about job hunting, due out in February from Simon & Schuster. She said unusual tactics can "build buzz and get your name out there."
But she warns that the technique can backfire. An employer like an ad agency might reward confidence and risk taking, she said, but a more conservative company might find it off-putting or just plain weird.
Mr. Sawicki recently heard from a recruiter. "But the job is with a company that just announced more layoffs," he said. "So I'm hoping for the best and assuming the worst."

 TESTED: 2003 Land Rover Discovery

WHAT IS IT? Midsize sport utility

HOW MUCH? $34,995 base price (S model); $41,495 as tested (HSE, including $500 for cold-climate package that includes heated front seats).

WHAT MOVES IT? 4.6-liter V-8; four-speed automatic; permanent four-wheel drive; two-speed transfer case.

HOW THIRSTY? Rated at 12 m.p.g. in town, 16 on the highway.

FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE ALTERNATIVES: Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V-8, $34,550; Mitsubishi Montero Limited, $37,212; Mercedes-Benz ML500 ($46,015); Lexus GX 470 (estimated $45,000).
HAND-ME-DOWNS can be worthwhile, especially when they come from the Range Rover. For 2003, the Land Rover Discovery inherited a more powerful, less noisy engine and some cosmetic changes that tie the Disco closer to its patrician sibling.
To appeal to Americans' thirst for power, the new Discovery comes with the 4.6-liter V-8 from the previous-generation Range Rover. (The 2003 Range Rover, which starts at $71,865, upgrades to a BMW engine.)
The Discovery's new engine is rated at 217 horsepower, a 15 percent increase from last year's model. Torque is up 20 percent, to 300 pounds-feet. It took the old Disco 11 seconds to go a stop to 60 m.p.h., but the new one pares that to 9.5 seconds, Land Rover says, while losing only 1 m.p.g. in average fuel economy.
The V-8 responds pretty well, a reasonable accomplishment considering its age. The engine's basic design goes back 40 years -- the motor was once used in Buicks, before G.M. sold the tooling -- although it has been regularly updated.
But the engine is still pulling a heavyweight. With all available equipment, including a third row of seats, the Discovery weighs 4,900 pounds. That means some owners may yearn for still more power, particularly if they study the horsepower and torque figures of competitive vehicles that have more sophisticated engines of more recent design.
For an extra $1,000, customers can add forward-facing third-row seats that turn the Discovery into a seven-seater, with head restraints and three-point safety belts for everyone.
For 1999, a new suspension improved the Discovery's ride on pavement. The suspension has been tweaked again.
The front end has been restyled to give the Discovery a closer resemblance to the Range Rover. The most notable change is to the headlights. Instead of the previous rectangular design, the Discovery borrows circular "twin pocket" halogen headlights (a small lamp overlaps a larger one) from the new Range Rover.
Inside, the Discovery hasn't lost its distinctive upper-crust feel. But because Land Rover knows customers trading in sedans for sport utilities don't want noisy, truckish interiors, it focused on muffling engine and road noise as well as reducing those annoying squeaks and rattles -- British tradition be damned.
It is too soon to tell whether these changes will help the 2003 Discovery improve its standings in the quality rankings. Previous models scored well below average for both the industry and the luxury S.U.V. segment, in J. D. Power's initial quality and vehicle dependability studies. In an attempt to foster more good will, Land Rover gives Discovery owners free scheduled maintenance six times during the four-year (or 50,000-mile) limited warranty.
The result of this makeover is a more refined, more competitive, yet still distinctive sport utility. This is just what Land Rover needs because, as usually happens with models late in their life cycles, interest is waning. Sales fell 3.6 percent in 2001 and another 12 percent through September of this year. CHERYL JENSEN

The Search for Sure Footing in a Shaky Work World

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON

 BODY:
GREG DRISCOLL took little for granted before accepting the job of president and chief executive of Enerwise Global Technologies, an energy technology company. He interviewed the company's board members and its entire executive team and even spoke with middle managers. He then prodded people outside the company to get a sense of Enerwise's reputation in the industry.
 "In companies like this, everyone has an aggressive view of how fast it's going to grow, so you have to take that with a grain of salt," Mr. Driscoll said. "Today, things aren't always as they seem." 
 Satisfied with the answers he received, he took charge of the company, based in Kennett Square, Pa., last winter. The company began operating 18 months ago as a spinoff of Conectiv Inc. of Wilmington, Del. 
Job seekers and employees on different rungs of the corporate ladder are doing all they can to protect themselves from problems, economic or sometimes ethical, that have been dragging down many companies. Some executives, even those well below the level of chief executive, are trying to negotiate specific contracts and severance packages, or inquiring about liability protection. Others are working to improve their resumes and reputations in their companies, by taking courses, for example, or by volunteering for extra work assignments. 
The trends appear widespread, if too new to quantify, according to interviews with recruiters, outplacement experts, employment lawyers and corporate executives.
"It's pretty apparent that in today's marketplace, there's a flight to quality and safety," said Dale E. Jones, a managing partner at Heidrick & Struggles, the executive search firm based in Chicago. "People want to know where they're going, and how they can minimize the risk."
Employees at all levels have reason to feel vulnerable. As the economy has weakened, many businesses have made large-scale job cuts. Accounting scandals, like those at Enron and WorldCom, have led to thousands of additional layoffs.
As a result, trust in business is eroding. Only 45 percent of workers have confidence in their senior management, down from 50 percent two years ago, according to a nationwide survey, involving 12,750 employees from all major industries, that was conducted last winter by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, the consulting firm. 
In this gloomy business climate, employees are aiming to bolster their career prospects. With survival as the goal, many are trying to make sure they are seen as valuable players in their organizations.
"It causes you to think about your vulnerabilities and what you can do to shore them up," said Tom Ault, a senior vice president at Avnet Inc., an electronics components distributor in Phoenix that has cut its staff by 30 percent in the last two years because of the weak economy and a depressed semiconductor market. "If you stand around wringing your hands about circumstances, you're not going to get anywhere." 
As his jobs have changed and his staff has shrunk to 15 from 100 in the last two years, Mr. Ault has sought out a mentor, taken courses in leadership and strategic planning, spent more time with his boss to learn her expectations and volunteered for assignments beyond his job. His efforts have produced positive feedback from his boss and his customers. "I'm still here," he said. 
At some companies, employees are asking for written performance reviews or updates of past reviews so their accomplishments are noted in writing, said Jeffrey E. Christian, an executive recruiter and the author of "The Headhunter's Edge" (Random House). Mr. Christian advises workers to ask that such report cards include examples of personal ethics. "You can demonstrate that no matter what the company is doing, you're using ingenuity to run your business and be an employee in a respectable manner," he said. 
Getting protection in writing is important for many executives and managers these days, especially at distressed companies. Peter Oppermann, a senior consultant at the New York office of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, has been helping several troubled companies enhance executive severance packages. "We're asked, 'What can we do to give people a better sense of comfort?' " Mr. Oppermann said. "It's not industry-specific. It's not region-specific. It's a trend you see when things are not going well."
MORE executives, even at healthy companies, are seeking outside legal advice and asking about their rights to indemnification -- coverage of legal defense costs offered to corporate officers and directors.
In negotiating his recent offer to become executive vice president for sales and marketing at Formity Systems Inc., a software developer in Murray Hill, N.J., Simon Krieger hired a lawyer and asked for, and received, liability coverage as an officer of the company. "I hadn't asked about liability in the past, because I didn't think it was that important," Mr. Krieger said. "It didn't seem to be much of an issue before."
Executives and job candidates for senior positions are also requesting employment contracts. While the use of such contracts has been rising in recent years, they have often been reserved for top corporate officers, especially in the telecommunications, computer data and health care industries. "What is unusual today is that individuals much lower in the organization are asking for them to protect their income," said Romayne Berry, principal and chief operating officer of Tower Consultants, an executive search firm in Stuart, Fla.
Below the top tier, though, executives do not have the leverage they had a few years ago, when jobs were plentiful. Many requests for contracts, guaranteed bonuses and written criteria for success aren't being met. "Companies have less tolerance to negotiate those points," said Michael S. Sirkin, a partner at the Proskauer Rose law firm and a specialist in benefits and compensation law in New York. "They feel there are alternatives." 
Mr. Driscoll of Enerwise says that more job candidates are asking for employment contracts, even at middle-management levels, but that the company is not granting such requests, except to a few top executives. "There's more interest in downside protections," he said.
Mr. Driscoll's own contract with the company includes severance provisions and a guaranteed bonus.
Anxious employees and executives are going beyond asking for written protection. Some are also trying to keep their options open. While only 12 percent of workers say they are looking for another job or plan to leave their employers, an additional 44 percent are open to a move, according to a 2001 survey of 5,700 employees and managers by Towers Perrin, the human resources consulting firm. 
Tom O'Riordan isn't exactly looking for another position, but he keeps a toehold in the job market. As chief operating officer of Fila USA Inc. in Sparks, Md., he has spent four years helping turn around the American division of the company, the Italian sportswear maker. But the parent is now for sale, a situation that has prompted Mr. O'Riordan to update his resume, hear out recruiters and even go on a few interviews.
"I'm open and more diligent about pursuing some things, even though ultimately I'd prefer to make this work," he said. "At some point, I have to look out for me."
For many employees, avoiding risk is a priority. Even if they cannot get as many written protections as they would like, they are trying to protect themselves by bolstering their employability, asking tough questions and taking a harder look at employers, prospective and current.
Simon Choy, who became director of compensation and benefits worldwide for Tupperware last year, said he was scared off from a competing offer from a technology company when executives brought up severance before he asked. His extensive research on Tupperware, which included talks with sales agents and reading a history of the company, convinced him that Tupperware, based in Orlando, Fla., would give him the stability he craved. 
"I don't want to get into a short-term focus," said Mr. Choy, also director of human resources for Asia and the Pacific. "The bottom line is stability: a company that's solid, a company that's been around a while."

A Time When Greed Wasn't Good

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
 DAVID CALLAHAN, the author of "Kindred Spirits," argues that the values of today's business leaders are very different than those of the Harvard Business School class of 1949 -- many of them World War II veterans. Here are excerpts from an interview. WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. What do you mean when you write that this generation of business leaders was shaped by idealism?

A. These guys grew up in a very different America. They were shaped by the Great Depression and by their experiences in World War II. They came out of that with very modest expectations compared to business leaders of today. Many of them just wanted to be able to participate in the economy. They wanted good jobs. They wanted economic security. They wanted to build good companies. Very few of them thought they would become business titans. There was far less wealth in American society then than there is now. They believed that if they paid their dues, worked hard, developed good products, were creative and took risks, they would be rewarded.

Q. Why did these business leaders feel stifled by the first companies they joined after graduating?

A. The corporate culture of the 1950's was very conformist. These guys wanted to take risks and make things happen. They either went to companies where that was encouraged or went out on their own. Someone like Tom Murphy who was at Lever Brothers got involved in a very risky TV company because he wanted to make something happen. Mr. Murphy rose to the top of Capital Cities/ABC. Jim Burke went to Johnson & Johnson but only on his own terms -- that he could cut through some of the red tape. Peter McColough went to Haloid later renamed Xerox which was extremely risky. A couple of them became entrepreneurs.

Q. Why was there not more entrepreneurship as we know it today?

A. Entrepreneurialism was not really a big part of the American business world at that time. There wasn't a lot of venture capital. Remembering the Depression, people didn't feel comfortable taking risk. It wasn't feasible and it wasn't encouraged.

Q. So the class of '49 believed in what you call "patient wealth?"

A. Yes, they came from a time when nobody got rich quickly. The 1930's, 40's, 50's were the period of their youth and early adulthood and it wasn't a time when great fortunes were being made overnight. No one had that in their mentality -- go out and go public and make $1 billion.

Q. Did Harvard Business School really shape their values?

A. I didn't get a sense that Harvard was a place where they learned values. They learned how to run a business and deal with a variety of situations from the case studies. But their values came from growing up in the Depression and fighting in the war. They had low expectations.

Q. Fast-forward to today, when we have members of the baby boom generation and Gen X'ers running many companies. Are these younger business leaders somehow less moral than their elders?

A. I think business leaders of today grew up in an America that had enormous amounts of wealth. Many of them brought into the business world a profound sense of entitlement. They should get things sooner rather than later. Our society has become much more materialistic. Conspicuous consumption that would have been absolutely embarrassing for the 49ers is absolutely the norm today. Not only do people think they should make fortunes quickly, but there are also fewer restrictions on spending in a very conspicuous way. All this produces greed.

Q. Are you saying that baby boomers and Gen X'ers are greedy?

A. I'm hesitant to blame a particular generation. The values of extreme laissez faire ideology have deeply permeated our society. We've had 20 years of deregulation. We've been told that government is the problem, not the solution. Greed has been seen as O.K., even good. Conspicuous consumption isn't frowned upon. In this environment, it's not surprising that you get a corporate leadership class that is greedier than any group since the Gilded Age, the era of the robber barons in the late 1800's.

Q. How did the 49ers manage their wealth differently?

A. Most of the 49ers didn't do much with their money. They weren't buying houses in the Hamptons or building estates. Even though they made a lot of money for their time, their fortunes were much smaller than the fortunes a run-of-the-mill C.E.O. can make today. The reason is that corporate compensation and C.E.O. pay have gone through the roof. The 49ers would be embarrassed to take home the kind of pay packages that are commonplace today. They would have preferred to put that money back into the company and do something productive with it.

Q. Will there be a real backlash against recent corporate abuses?

A. Our attitudes toward corporate greed change in a cyclical way. The pendulum swings. After the Gilded Age, there was a real era of reform. The income tax was enacted. Other reforms were aimed at controlling corporate power. After the excesses of the 1920's, there also was a backlash. I think America is now headed for a new era of corporate reform. Greed is no longer "in."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS; 
Elizabeth Ngonzi and John Nandigobe

BYLINE:  By RICHARD LEZIN JONES 

 BODY:
THEIRS was a romance born in boom times. She was a business consultant, he a computer technology specialist. And when John Henry Nandigobe and Elizabeth Natasha Ngonzi began dating in 1999, the promise of their life together seemed as limitless as the prosperity all around them.
 Then came the bust. In the uncertain economic climate after Sept. 11, Ms. Ngonzi chose a career change. And then Mr. Nandigobe lost a job that had seemed secure only a few months before. 
 Forget having a wedding right now, friends said. Be prudent, their families told them. "Everyone said, 'You should wait,' " Ms. Ngonzi said. "We said it didn't make sense for us to put it off just because of this."
Ms. Ngonzi, who was born in Uganda, and Mr. Nandigobe, who was born in Wales to Ugandan parents, became acquainted in 1998, when one of her uncles introduced them at a gathering at his home in Plainfield, N.J. Then, after a chance meeting nine months later, they arranged to have lunch. "We went out for drinks, and it turned into a seven-hour date," Ms. Ngonzi recalled.
Ms. Ngonzi, 32, is a graduate of Cornell, Syracuse and the Culinary Institute of America. She loves preparing and sampling cuisines. She came to the United States at 4, a daughter of Hilda Rwabazaire Paqui, a deputy director in New York for the United Nations Development Program, and Dr. John Ruganda, an English professor at the University of the North in South Africa. Among friends she is known for her easy smile and for being painstaking about the tiniest details and for working doggedly to see them to fruition. 
"I'm a bit of a control freak," she acknowledged, sheepishly.
"A bit?" Mr. Nandigobe, 42, chimed in. He is a broad-shouldered, soft-spoken six-footer who studied at the Royal Institute of Engineering in Stockholm before coming to New York and taking a job at FXall, the online foreign-exchange firm.
When Ms. Ngonzi left her Manhattan consulting job with Arthur Andersen last year to fulfill her dream of opening a catering business in North Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Nandigobe, who is divorced, supported her decision. The business is called Amazing Taste! Self-employment proved a financial struggle. Still, when Mr. Nandigobe lost his job at FXall a few months later in a downsizing, they refused to see the situation as bleak. No, it meant that Ms. Ngonzi had gained a new, eager and very familiar employee. "All of this has just made us stronger," she said. 
And for their wedding, help arrived from far and wide. "We just prayed, and the blessings came," she said. Envelopes began arriving from Uganda bearing donations large and small -- equal parts a product of the African dowry tradition and a way of repaying Mr. Nandigobe, who had given aid to other Ugandans.
Ms. Ngonzi also found discounts on the Web on everything from D.J.'s to hydrangeas. And true to her nature, she produced a spreadsheet, outlining events in five-minute intervals.
Was there anything that she dreamed of that her budget simply would not allow? "Uh, a horse-drawn carriage?" she said.
The Rev. William D. Watley, who is the chief executive of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, led the ceremony on Oct. 19 at St. James A.M.E. Church in Newark, where guests arrived in suits or traditional African garb like the lavender shuka worn by the bride's mother. Later, for a reception at the Newark Museum, guests were treated to a multicultural menu designed by the bride. It included pad Thai, Jamaican curried goat and fior di latte. 
And Ms. Ngonzi need not have yearned for that horse-drawn carriage. The black Mercedes-Benz she chose seemed to suit her just fine. So much so, in fact, that Ms. Ngonzi said that she nearly skipped her own reception afterward. "We felt like telling the driver, 'Just take us home.' You know, let's just go pick up some Haagen-Dazs and be together."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH -- Thomas F. Marsico; 
Marsico Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THOMAS F. MARSICO calls managing money a "three-dimensional chess game." 
 He says he juggles three variables to pick stocks for the $670 million Marsico Growth fund: a company's competitive position, its sensitivity to regulatory or geopolitical risks and the macroeconomic environment in which it operates. 
 Missing from that list is rapid growth -- a characteristic he sought when he picked stocks as a fund manager at Janus Capital in Denver in the 1990's. He left that firm in 1997 to start his own company, but until the technology meltdown in 2000, he stuck to his high-octane style of picking stocks. Today, however, he says he avoids most technology companies, which account for less than 7 percent of the fund's assets, versus 20 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
"We believe that all technology companies have the risk of disruptive new technology," eroding market share, he said from his office in downtown Denver, with a view of the Rocky Mountains. 
Now he prefers slower, steady growers. 
"We're looking at companies that can provide unit growth, because they'll be more valuable than companies that need to increase prices to make money," he said.
That focus has helped minimize the fund's losses during the recent tough times for big stocks. The portfolio lost 7.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday. That places it in the top 9 percent of all funds that buy large growth stocks, which lost 15 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc. The S.& P. 500 lost 11 percent during that time.
The fund the lost 4.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 20.8 percent for its group and 17.4 percent for the index.
Mr. Marsico, 47, is the chief executive of Marsico Capital Management, the fund's adviser; its sale to Bank of America was completed in January 2001. He also manages the $1.3 billion Marsico Focus fund.
He uses no computer screens or Wall Street research to choose the 30 to 50 stocks in the Growth fund from about 400 primarily American companies with market capitalizations of at least $7 billion.
Over all, he aims to beat returns of the S.& P. 500 by three to five percentage points by selecting companies that provide consistent returns from easy-to-understand businesses.
The earnings growth rate of the portfolio companies is still relatively high, if not turbocharged. It was 21 percent a year in the last five years, compared with 9.3 percent for the index.
In analyzing companies' financial statements, Mr. Marsico looks closely at the appended footnotes. Generally, the presence of many footnotes means red flags, he said.
He also examines a company's ratio of debt to total capitalization. He prefers a ratio of less than 20 percent for the manufacturing and marketing sectors but allows more for financial services companies.
Mr. Marsico began buying shares of Porsche, the German automaker, in November 2001, paying 364 euros a share, on average. The stock, which trades on the Frankfurt exchange, is now at 488.5 euros.
He called Porsche "a great unit growth story, with the highest operating margins in the industry and little competition in the luxury performance car market." He expects earnings growth to average 15 percent, annualized, over the next five years.
 HE also likes the Fannie Mae, the biggest buyer of mortgages. He has been buying shares since August, paying $70.26, on average; they now trade at $68.50. Fannie Mae is benefiting from the strong housing market, Mr. Marsico said.
"Housing affordability is at an all-time high, given the current levels of employment and a low level of interest rates," he added. He projects annual earnings growth to average 13 percent over the next five years.
Consolidation has strengthened the market position of Tenet Healthcare, said Mr. Marsico, who began buying its shares in the spring of 2001. Tenet, which owns and manages hospitals, has growing numbers of patients in three medical areas -- cardiovascular, neurological and orthopedic -- that require high levels of care, he added. 
"When people are in hospitals for problems that require a lot of treatment," he said, "you can spread the fixed costs of the hospital visits over a higher revenue base."
He expects earnings growth to average 15 to 18 percent over three to five years. 
He paid an average of $30.49 for the shares, adjusted for splits. They now trade at $49.31.

Long After the Windfall, Back to Some Basics

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI; James Schembari is an editor at The Times. His column on the prime earning, spending and striving years appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: jimschem@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NOW that the money is gone, I have at least answered one question: How did it feel to be rich?
 It felt soothing. Financial pressures melted away, and my lifelong habit of squeezing a buck seemed to be over, much to the joy of my spendthrift family. 
 But the feeling was fleeting. The money that my wife, Christine, inherited last year didn't last long enough for me to wallow. It has all been "invested," our cash flow stinks and I'm back to begging the kids to turn off a light now and then. Do they think we bought stock in the power company or something? We didn't. 
A few months ago, when I first wrote about the inheritance that my wife received from her grandfather's estate, money the size of an average Wall Street bonus, I pointed out that our generation is expected to inherit at least $11 trillion in assets in the next 20 years. I spoke to Bibi Gaston, 43, a landscape architect from Lake Worth, Fla., who was inheriting about $100,000, and an artist, also from Florida, who asked that her name not be used. She was getting about $250,000.
Then I went to several advisers, asking them what all of us should do with our sudden wealth. Putting the money in the stock market -- for example, through the Section 529 education plans run by the states -- was the main answer.
Good advice at the time, but Christine and I didn't take it. Although we wrestled with what to do with the money, we put it temporarily in a money market account, earning about 2.5 percent interest. Ms. Gaston did the same thing. The 529 plans sounded good to me, especially one for our youngest child, Joseph, 7, who is the only of our four children not to have a mutual fund in his name. (We had opened funds for the others to help pay for college and never got around to Joe once he arrived in 1994. I have always felt guilty about that.)
But Christine had other ideas. She had long wanted to renovate our attic, turning it into two bedrooms to get our three sons out of the one room they shared. We decided to do that, which left about half the money. Christine then gave 10 percent to our church and, in another act of charity, bought me a used sports car for my 50th birthday, remembering that I had once told her that it had been my dream car. How could I disagree?
That left enough money for Joe and his siblings, but before I could get it into the 529 plan and a few stocks I had my eyes on, Christine had another idea. Why not invest the money in a vacation house? We can't go wrong with real estate, she said, and we would actually get some use out of it. After all, Christine's grandfather had made most of his money in real estate, so it seemed appropriate.
These moves were made before the stock market plummeted. I don't want to sit here and say my wife was a genius, so I'll have someone else say it.
"By not investing last year, you were either brilliant or lucky by avoiding one of the worst investment periods in decades," said Gerald Silver, a vice president at Salomon Smith Barney in New Brunswick, N.J. "But I'm cautious on real estate right now. The masses are pulling money out of the market and putting it into real estate. I'm not sure if you chased something that had already appreciated."
I'll spare my wife that assessment. Mr. Silver had advised me when we first received the money and, looking over how we ignored every bit of his advice, he took the high road and didn't yell at me. But he did say that I needed to relieve my guilt and fund that 529 plan for Joe. And if Christine and I were as smart as we claim, we would have taken advantage of the weak market to pick up some bargains, like Pfizer and General Electric.
"Big money is made investing in bear markets," he said. "I believe that anyone who can invest in high-quality companies will be a lot wealthier in a few years."
But wealth isn't always the issue. Ms. Gaston isn't much interested in the stock market, either. She said the money had given her the freedom to take the time to change her life. She said she plans to sell her house, maybe go to divinity school, "get away from material things and get in touch with my spirituality."
"The money my father left me allows me to breathe a bit more," she said.
Fine, Mr. Silver said, but she should first meet with a financial adviser to determine her short- and long-term goals.
"She is probably better off not making any drastic changes right now until she decides what lifestyle changes she wants to make," he said. "Then she needs to invest accordingly."
THE artist in Florida used $4,000 of the money to open individual retirement accounts for her and her husband, but the rest of the first $100,000 she inherited was spent to pay off her debts. She said she will receive another distribution from the estate this year and hopes to use some of it to take college courses. Beyond that, she has no plans for the money except to make sure there's enough for college for her two children.
Again, Mr. Silver suggested the 529 plans, urged her to put more into retirement plans and praised her for taking care of her debts. "Step 1 is pay down all the debt first," he said.
He saved his raised eyebrow for me. The car troubled him.
"When you get a windfall, you always have to spend something on enjoying yourself," he said, "but I probably wouldn't have spent as much on the car from a percentage basis."
Killjoy.

Restyling Your Portfolio for Europe's New Face

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
AN investment in emerging markets is often an implicit bet that they will someday join those of the developed world, allowing their businesses to benefit from sounder political, economic and financial systems. For many, that day may never arrive, but in the case of 10 European countries, it has been scheduled for the year after next. 
 The announcement this month that the European Union expects to admit 10 new members in 2004 is expected to provide fresh impetus for what is known as "the convergence play" -- investing on the belief that development in these countries will accelerate, approaching Western European levels as the entry date approaches. 
 Eight of the recommended countries are in Central or Eastern Europe and were either part of the Soviet Union or once in its sphere of influence: Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The other newcomers are the Mediterranean islands of Cyprus and Malta. 
Several of the countries have thriving stock and bond markets. Their performances over the last year stand out in bold contrast to returns almost anywhere else.
The largest of these markets, those of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, show gains in dollar terms for the 12 months through Thursday, according to indexes compiled by the HSBC Group. Poland was up 3.5 percent, Hungary by 32.6 percent and the Czech Republic by 40 percent. Of the seven smaller markets, the best was Slovenia, up 95.3 percent, and the worst was Cyprus, down 25 percent.
Three American mutual funds -- ING Russia, T. Rowe Price Emerging Europe and Mediterranean and Vontobel Eastern European Equity -- have more than $15 million in assets and concentrate their holdings in the emerging markets of Europe. But the ING fund focuses on Russia, and the T. Rowe Price fund had most of its assets in Russia, Israel and Turkey as of June 30, according to Morningstar, leaving only the Vontobel fund with a concentration in the European Union candidates.
With more than half of its assets in Poland and Hungary through June 30, the Vontobel fund returned 7.1 percent for the year through Thursday.
Three closed-end mutual funds trading on the New York Stock Exchange also invest in emerging European markets. They are the Central European Equity fund, the Morgan Stanley Eastern Europe fund and the Templeton Russia and Eastern Europe fund. All have gained at least 25 percent in the 12 months through Thursday.
Closed-end funds, which have a fixed number of shares, are traded throughout the day like stocks. Unlike mutual funds, they may be priced at discounts to their asset values. That is the case for the three emerging European funds.
WHILE markets languish elsewhere in the world, many Central and Eastern European economies are still expanding, aided by extensive investment in manufacturing by richer neighbors, most notably Germany. They have long been lured to the east by the prospect of European Union expansion.
A further recent attraction of these markets is the dominance of low-cost manufacturers that excel in lean times like these. Once the new countries join in 2004, reducing trade and employment barriers, the pace of investment is expected to accelerate.
"Convergence is an ongoing economic process, and political integration is part of that," said Mark Robinson, a manager of the Europe Convergence Equity fund for J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, a Luxembourg subsidiary of J. P. Morgan Chase; the fund is not available to American investors. "This is just the unfolding of capitalism," Mr. Robinson said.
One measure of the market economies' evolution, he said, is the ratio of private borrowing for mortgages and investment to economic output, he said. 
"It started off at the end of the Communist era with a financial sector that was zero percent of gross domestic product," he said. "Now credit to G.D.P. is 25 percent in Poland and nearer 50 percent in Hungary and the Czech Republic."
Some investors say that share prices already reflect the likelihood of European Union entry -- and that the easy money has already been made.
"From an investment point of view, the really interesting places in terms of convergence are further east: Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania," said Jerome Booth, a fund manager at Ashmore Investment Management in London, a specialist in emerging-markets portfolios. "Poland, Czech and Hungary, we know they're going to join."
Nevertheless, he said, currencies of these three Central European countries have remained strong against the euro, showing that "people from Western Europe are continuing to buy the story," he said. 
Once the 10 candidates join the European Union, their citizens will be granted the same rights as those in the senior member states, although some changes will be gradual -- including subsidies for farmers and the right to live and work throughout the union. The new members would need to meet more rigorous requirements to participate in the euro currency, now shared by 12 of the 15 existing states.
Before the union expands officially, an accession treaty must be signed next year by the existing members and the following year by the 10 candidate states. As part of the process, Irish voters, through a referendum on Oct. 19, approved a European Union treaty setting forth some of the enlargement conditions. Before the accession votes occur, some fine print -- setting terms of entry -- must still be approved.
This month, a European Union report said many candidate countries needed to improve labor productivity, bolster their health care systems and civil service and fight corruption. Because further economic reform is likely, Mark Mobius, president of Templeton Emerging Markets, expects continued robust gains.
"The journey is more important than the destination because the E.U. has certain requirements and targets that countries have to meet financially, socially and politically," he said. "This process is very good for the region, and we don't think it's all priced into stock markets."
Mr. Robinson said the downfall of the Soviet Union had allowed Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to throw out the old system and build a new one from scratch.
"They have been able to leapfrog Western Europe to some extent," he said. "The labor market is probably more flexible in Hungary than in Germany."
Mr. Robinson's portfolio holds some banking stocks, reflecting his view that private credit markets in Eastern Europe will keep growing at prodigious rates. Among them is Hansabank in Estonia, which has a return on equity of about 20 percent even though the global industry is struggling.
Two other banks in the portfolio are OTP of Hungary, which he said has a high share of the retail market there and may be a takeover target by a Western institution, and Bank Pekao in Poland, of which UniCredito Italiano has a controlling stake.
Financial services companies are prominent in the portfolios of American funds focusing on the region. The T. Rowe Price fund owns OTP and Hansabank, and Vontobel Eastern European Equity holds those two plus Pekao. Both funds also hold Komercni Banka, a Czech institution.
Many companies favored by Mr. Robinson are subsidiaries of Western companies that are sprucing them up financially, restructuring their operations and improving profitability. These include Stomil Olsztyn, a Polish tire manufacturer controlled by Michelin of France, and Matav, the Hungarian phone company that is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.
"They have been in there for several years and done a decent job of restructuring," Mr. Robinson said.
Matav, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, "is a mini-version of Deutsche Telekom without the debt," he said.
"They've been cutting the work force and improving productivity," he added.
He also owns shares of Estonia Telecom and Telekomunikacja Polska, or TPSA, a Polish affiliate of France Telecom.
MR. MOBIUS is less enthusiastic about telecommunications companies, saying he owns "a little bit" of TPSA and Matav, but no more because he finds the valuations "not that appealing."
He prefers energy concerns like the Polish refinery PKN. He also likes the region's banking sector but would rather invest through Western institutions that are taking hefty stakes in Central European banks. He likes Erste Bank of Austria, which he described as "our entree into Eastern European banking."
Another sector he recommends is pharmaceuticals. He likes the Hungarian company Gedeon Richter.
European Union expansion will be positive for Western Europe as a whole, said Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Enlargement "adds to pressure for reform" in all member states, he said.
Still, the biggest gains are bound to accrue to the new members themselves, said Mr. Booth at Ashmore. "Very clearly, integration into the E.U. is a huge economic and social benefit in the long term," he said. "That's why they all want to be in, to be part of a much larger internal market. This is a very important historical process."

HEADLINE: Doing Their Nails With a Hammer 

BYLINE:  By KATE BETTS 

 BODY:
FOUR decades of feminism have shown that women are capable of crewing on the space shuttle, defeating chess grandmasters and fighting wars. Even that male bastion, the Augusta National Golf Club, is feeling the heat from barricade-storming women.
 But when it comes to home repair, suddenly we're helpless, helpless, helpless, as Neil Young once sang. Men fix leaky faucets. Women stand by cluelessly holding the wrench thingy. 
 Enter a new wave of power women -- not those who want to be boardroom fixtures, but those obsessed with bathroom fixtures -- who are determined to teach other women more about home repair than just the seven digits of the super's telephone number. Designing tools especially for women, writing easy-to-read manuals and dispensing tips on Web sites, these Ms. Fix-Its seek to demystify, and even glamorize, home repair. 
"There's definitely still a 'damsel in distress/knight in shining armor' mentality when it comes to women and home repair," said Allegra Bennett, the author of three home repair books, including "When a Woman Takes an Ax to a Wall" (Renovating Woman Books, 2002). "We tend to want someone else to do the work in the house, but honestly, there's nothing more empowering than fixing something you were afraid of."
Barbara Kavovit, the chief executive of Anchor Construction, a Manhattan interior construction-management company that has worked in Carnegie Hall Tower and Bloomingdale's, is taking her know-how to the mass market with a line of tools for women. She is determined to prove that confidence can come from a handful of claw hammers and slip-joint pliers, maybe even a putty knife.
"I think it started with 'Sex and the City,' actually," said Ms. Kavovit, a single mother who cringes at the thought of relying on a superintendent. "That episode when Samantha moved into the meatpacking district and the curtains fell down? I thought, If only she had a toolbox."
Ms. Kavovit's Pradaesque lightweight screwdrivers have sculptured rubber handles in gray and turquoise, and the grips are indented to accommodate fragile French manicures like Ms. Kavovit's. "See this?" she said during an interview in her office, pointing to the place where the thumb rests on a screwdriver. "How many times have you broken a nail doing this?"
Her idea coincides neatly with the continuing home-improvement boom, in which women are playing an increasingly prominent role. Sales of home-improvement products reached a record $187.6 billion last year, 40 percent of it spent by women, according to the Home Improvement Research Institute in Tampa, Fla. Home-improvement television shows have come a long way from "This Old House." The new hits -- "Trading Spaces," on the Learning Channel, and "Designing for the Sexes," on Home and Garden Television -- prominently feature women as fixer-uppers.
"It's like the 70's, when women were entering the work force, but they still didn't know how to invest their own money," Ms. Kavovit said. The idea behind her Barbara K! tool kits is that Rosie the Riveter can also be Rosie the Riveting. The kits come in sleek molded turquoise plastic cases. Bed Bath & Beyond plans to carry them beginning in January. A starter kit, for $60, has the basics, including a hammer, a 6-in-1 screwdriver and an adjustable wrench. 
Users can graduate to specialized kits for plumbing, electrical repairs, painting, staining and refinishing, and to power tools. Ms. Kavovit also plans to sell the kits on a home-shopping channel.
To those who wonder why women need tools different from men's (aren't wrenches unisex?), Ms. Kavovit explained that hers are ergonomically designed for a smaller hand and are lighter, and thus easier to use.
Even the old-school guru Bob Vila, the original host of "This Old House," agreed that such products have a place. "Obviously, a woman could walk into any hardware store and buy any tool," Mr. Vila, now a spokesman for Craftsman tools, said. "But most American tool manufacturers are paying more attention to this market, and they're making friendlier, more ergonomic and lighter-weight tools. More women are single parents who have to be Mrs. Fix-It and problem-solvers in the home."
In February 2000, Tomboy Tools, an online company, was established by five Denver-area women frustrated by the lack of woman-friendly home-repair products and information. Their idea is to sell tools and tips through a Web site and at Tupperware-style parties in homes. Tomboy's 80 "associates" demonstrate how to use the tools, and guests exchange repair and remodeling tips.
"The problem I have is that any tools that have been for women are like second-class citizens -- they're cheaper," said Lynda Lyday, a host of "Talk2DIY," a call-in show on DIY cable television. "We need construction-grade tools that are going to be ergonomically correct."
Last month, "Dare to Repair: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Fixing (Almost) Anything in the Home," by Julie Sussman and Stephanie Glakas-Tenet, was published by HarperResource. The book, a cheeky romp through domestic disasters like clogged bathtub drains, cheerfully demystifies repair terminology by explaining the likes of closet augers, circuit maps and slip nuts.
The authors conceived their book out of frustration: their husbands were both in the Central Intelligence Agency (Ms. Tenet's, George J. Tenet, is the director of central intelligence) and were never around to fix things.
"We're just so used to depending on our fathers or our husbands," Ms. Sussman said. "When I was growing up, our household chores were divided by gender. And I don't want my daughter or my son to grow up like that."
Shoshana Berger, the editor in chief of ReadyMade magazine, a do-it-yourself guide geared to first-time homeowners, said younger women are a lot less shy about rolling up their sleeves and grabbing a Stillson wrench. "We get a lot of letters from women saying, 'I'm the only 26-year-old with a band saw -- thank you for creating a magazine I can relate to,' " Ms. Berger said. "Younger people are definitely not filling the same traditional archetypes that our parents did."
Take Shari Markbreiter, a Manhattan interior designer, whose father gave her a power drill for her 18th birthday, in the 1980's. "I wanted pearls," she said, "but I think he was acknowledging the feminist movement. It was his way of saying be independent, do it yourself."
And she did. Even though her husband has a degree in engineering, Ms. Markbreiter said she is the one who does the repairs in their home.
Five years ago Martha McCully, an executive editor of InStyle magazine, broke up with her boyfriend, bought a house in East Hampton and oversaw its renovation. "I did not want to wait to get married to own a house," she said, "but being a homeowner as a single woman is kind of overwhelming. A lot of women want to do this, but they don't have the confidence.
"But in the last five years, I think that's changed tremendously. Women are more financially independent and feeling more confident that they can do things they couldn't do before. I marvel at myself -- that I know how to fix things in my house now, like running toilets. Last weekend I redid my walkway with bluestones."
Ms. Kavovit was a pioneer in tool belt empowerment for women. Ten years ago, she felt that she had hit a glass ceiling as an assistant trader on the commodities desk at the Mitsubishi Corporation. ("My boss overturned my desk," she said. "I realized there was no place for me to go beyond being a glorified secretary.") At that point, she decided to build a business around the idea that women are intimidated by contractors. Posting herself in the parking lot of a mall in Scarsdale, N.Y., she asked women who owned their own homes to hire her as a liaison with the contractors and the tradesmen working on their houses. She also hired a handyman and went door to door fixing cracked tiles, sealing driveways and cleaning gutters.
Soon she relocated to Manhattan and plunged into the all-male world of big city interior construction, building a company that in 2000 did $76 million in business, she said.
But the downturn in the economy forced Ms. Kavovit to reappraise the construction business. "Now isn't a great time to build a skyscraper," she said. "It's a time when people want to stay close to home and do more for themselves."
So she hit on the idea of designing tools. "Women are no-nonsense," she said. "They're not going to be tricked by a gimmick."
She pored over Pantone color charts to pick the perfect color (pink, she said, is patronizing to women) for tools both serious and good-looking. She chose turquoise, which she points out is the same shade as the Gillette Venus razor, one of the most successful packaged goods of recent seasons. She constantly repeats her belief that a wrench is never just a wrench in a woman's hand; it is a tool of self-respect.
"I can't stress how important it is for women to have independence and confidence," said Ms. Kavovit, recounting the time her son, now 4, was locked in the bathroom and she was helpless because she didn't have the tool necessary to open the lock (an Allen wrench, or hex key).
"Now I could do anything myself," she said. "I could build an addition to my house. It makes you feel powerful."

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
The Floor Shook, But They Didn't

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
When times are tough, do the tough really get going? The answer is: Sometimes. As the mail indicates, maybe the best strategy for maintaining business in a weak economy is simply to sit tight. But when the outlook is bleak, well-planned action may also pay off in a big way.
 Catherine E. Sutter, the president and owner of Pro-Tec Mobile Communications of Casa Grande, Ariz., was facing fierce competition in difficult economic times. Owning and operating wireless radio stations that allow hundreds of business clients throughout Phoenix and Tucson to dispatch their fleets of vehicles, Miss Sutter was up against six major wireless carriers: AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS, Nextel Communications, Verizon Communications, Alltel and Western Wireless. 
 What did she do?
Nothing, she says.
"What I saw happening to the cellular industry was exactly what happened to the local two-way radio shops that were forced to compete against one another 15 years ago," she writes.
"There were too many of us providing mobile two-way service to the consumer. All of us were guilty of giving away radios and installations at cost. None of us would raise our rates for fear that our hard-earned customer would jump ship to our competitor."
Faced with a familiar situation, Miss Sutter says she paid off her company's long-term debt, sat back and waited.
As the fight for customers continues, she says, her sites are built and her company is debt free. Contemplating this competitive edge, she adds, "I now have the luxury of educating the big carriers about how to keep customers."
Until a couple of months ago in Portland, Ore., Tamara M. Seymour, now a freelance writer, was the senior marketing manager and creative director for Household International, a consumer finance company based in the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights. In the best literary tradition, she introduces her account of taking exceptional measures to avert a drastic fate with a biblical overview:
"In the beginning, an entrepreneur created a company, and the company was private and profitable," she writes. "And the entrepreneur sold his small company to a much larger Fortune 100 company. And the giant corporation said, 'Let there be efficiency'; and there were many layoffs."
She continues: "The work unit I managed served as the acquired company's internal advertising agency, responsible for the creative development and production of all its marketing communications. We were miraculously spared during the downsizing -- seems no one knew what to do with our little group, since we were an anomaly within a well-established parent organization that traditionally relied on external ad agencies. But the new management liked our pretty pictures, and the customer response rates to our ads were high."
Still, danger lurked. "We knew the day would come when we would have to prove our value to Chicago," Ms. Seymour writes. "Since we relied on internal clients to feed us business, we launched a widespread self-promotion campaign."
Designers and copywriters stayed late to develop a whole new identity for the eight-member group, including a catchy "agency" name and logo. They published a colorful promotional kit with business cards, a team biography and samples of their finest work. They visited satellite offices in other areas of the country, "passing out promo kits like Bibles at a revival," as Ms. Seymour puts it.
Ms. Seymour slipped in a plug or two -- along with some favorable comparisons with the cost of doing business with outside ad agencies -- at high-level management meetings.
"Within six months, we had booked half a dozen new clients and locked ourselves in as the primary creative service provider for our division of the corporation," she writes.
"And to ensure we would not be forgotten, we offered follow-up care in the form of occasional gifts. For example, top managers who enlisted our services received a set of original greeting cards, handcrafted in-house, to send to their own customers and vendors during the holidays. These types of simple and kind gestures were a big hit and helped to secure our team's popularity.
"For a while, hoop-jumping was a way of life in our little creative corner of a profit-driven world. But with tireless self-promotion, our collectively bleak outlook was transformed. We generated exciting new business for ourself and bulked up the company's bottom line.
"And in the end, we all kept our jobs."

A New Company Tries to Sort the Web's Chaos

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAUSALITO, Calif. 

 BODY:
BY Silicon Valley standards, it was an unassuming debut.
 Last weekend at a Marin County conference on biological and cultural diversity, Groxis, Paul Hawken's new software company, was sandwiched by the booths for Birkenstock sandals and PowerBars. 
 Mr. Hawken is best known for as a co-founder of Smith & Hawken, a California catalog and store that sells high-end gardening equipment, and for his writings, which blend environmentalism and capitalism. 
But at a time when the valley's digerati are bemoaning a technology industry recession and the death of innovation, Mr. Hawken's Grokker software, which is intended to allow personal-computer users to visually make sense of collections of thousands or hundreds of thousands of text documents, is creating a buzz. The software is attracting significant interest from large corporations and universities.
At the conference, Groxis employees began taking orders after people told the company that they were willing to pay for the program, which had not yet been released; 200 copies were sold that weekend.
Groxis, based in Sausalito, is trying to solve an old problem, but it is growing exponentially with the explosion of electronic information brought about by the Internet.
"The computer world has been alphanumeric, but we perceive things visually," said Mr. Hawken. He said he is now working on a new book and has used his program to organize a collection of more than four million Web bookmarks. "It's the first time as a writer I have too much information, but it's manageable," he said.
Groxis (pronounced GRAHK-sis) is named for a term in "Stranger in a Strange Land," by the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein. To "grok" something is to understand it completely.
The reference is driven home by the fact that today, according to the Groxis designers, 84 percent of Web surfers go no further than the first page of document titles in searching for information. While that may be appropriate for some searches, other queries, like one for the phrase "exotic vacations," may leave Web sites of interest deeply buried by search engines.
The popular search engine Google uses ranking techniques to sort through thousands of possible Web pages displaying what are often the most desirable pages first.
IN contrast, Grokker builds a visual map of the general categories into which documents fall by using what computer software designers call metadata, which describes each Web page or document. The program currently works with the Northern Light search engine, the Amazon online catalog and as a tool for scanning a user's own PC file collection.
Previously, there have been thousands of research efforts in text visualization and dozens of commercial attempts to go beyond traditional directory listing approaches for organizing information.
The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center did work in this area in the 1990's and spun off Inxight Software, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that now offers tools for the management of text data. Early on, Alta Vista, the first search engine, offered a so-called refine feature that permitted a graphical view of information returned after the query.
There are also Web search tools ranging from KartOO (www.kartoo.com) to Vivisimo (www.vivisimo.com) that provide alternative ways of viewing or categorizing the expanse of information accessible on the Web. Tim Bray, a designer of the XML Internet protocol, a commonly used format for storing and exchanging information on the Internet, has created Antarctica Systems (www.antarti.ca), a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that offers a geographically oriented visualization approach.
So far, none of the visualization tools have succeeded commercially.
"The universal reaction is that people say, 'Oh, how pretty,' " said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Watch, a British Web site (searchenginewatch.com) that tracks the search engine industry. "However, they don't continue to use them. People forget that text is visual and reading a list is a very helpful way of organizing information."
The basic ideas underlying the Groxis technology were developed by Jean-Michel Decombe, a French computer researcher, who in the late 1990's worked for the Silicon Valley start-up Metacode, which was developing automatic categorization. When Metacode was acquired in 2000 by Interwoven, another Silicon Valley content management concern, Mr. Decombe joined with Mr. Hawken and R. J. Pittman, a computer scientist and venture capitalist, to acquire the visualization technology he had been working on.
Mr. Decombe argues that Grokker is a more universal approach to the problem of visualizing textual information than what has been found in previous tools, which focus more on navigation than on categorization.
"The difference is that we have no single paradigm," said Mr. Decombe, who is Groxis's chief technology officer. Instead, Grokker offers a wide palette of different ways to view information. Under Mr. Hawken's guidance, Groxis is also hoping to refine a business strategy that will make Grokker a widely used research tool.
The Grokker software, offered in versions that include a basic $149 program, will appear first as a preview beta version available at the Groxis Web site (www.groxis.com), according to the company.
At Stanford, the library has modified its online Socrates catalog system to be viewed by Grokker. "It shows sufficient promise that we're thinking of giving it to our entire community," said Michael Keller, the university librarian. "Potentially, it will not only give our students and faculty a way to view their own information world but also our wildly multifarious array of thousands of e-journals and hundreds of databases."
Grokker has also drawn the attention of Interface Inc., based in Chicago, a big carpeting company. In March, the company plans to begin a division, Interface Flor, offering a Grokker-based catalog that will permit Web customers to view, organize and select from 50,000 samples.

Coin Trade Becomes More Like A Market

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
THE Professional Coin Grading Service has begun tracking the coin trade electronically in much the same way that Standard & Poor's tracks the stock market.
 The firm's CU3000 index, which can be found on its Web site, pcgs.com, covers 3,000 American coins and incorporates within it nine other subindexes. Visitors to the Web site can find 12-month highs and lows, as well as 1-, 3- and 10-year charts for each. 
 The daily price guide is among the recent moves by coin experts to quantify their passion and to transform coin collecting into a liquid investment with easily identifiable objective values. And as the turbulent stock market has encouraged investors to take a new look at more tangible assets, there is some evidence that those efforts have had some effect. 
David G. Hall, the president of Professional Coin Grading, based in Newport Beach, Calif., says his company is now asked to grade 70,000 to 80,000 coins a month, more than double the level five years ago. The business is a unit of Collectors Universe, which trades on the Nasdaq market and grades and authenticates other collectibles like sports cards, stamps and autographs. (The stock chart of Collectors Universe, however, has been far bleaker recently than that of many of the collectibles it tracks. The shares are down 45.7 percent this year.)
Volumes at the nation's other big coin grader, the privately held Numismatic Guaranty Corporation of America in Sarasota, Fla., have also doubled since 1998, according to Mark Salzberg, its president.
Under a widely used grading system, coins are assigned a point score between 1, the worst, and 70, the best, depending on variables like luster, scratches and other marks.
Grading and daily price guides have "certainly made the coin market more liquid, just like organized stock exchanges made equities more liquid," said Dalton L. Chandler, an analyst at Needham & Company, an investment firm based in New York.
Professional Coin Grading and Numismatic Guaranty have also set up online registries for coin collections.
"Who has the biggest, who has the best, is the driving force behind the collector base," Mr. Salzberg said.
Mr. Hall said Professional Coin Grading has registered 4,000 coin sets since the service started three years ago.
Over the last few years, some investors have shifted money from the stock market into coin collections. "They have good rates of return -- not as good as when we were riding the Internet bubble, but the coin market hasn't burst," said Arnold-Peter C. Weiss, a surgeon in Providence, R.I., who has played both markets.
Dr. Weiss said he had taken "a big hit" on a few dot-com investments. But he has done well, on paper, at least, in coin investments. In 1998, he bought a type of ancient Greek silver coin, minted by the city-state of Megalopolis and featuring the head of Zeus, for $60,000. It fetched about $200,000 last year at an auction at Bank Leu in Zurich, Dr. Weiss said.
In July, the only known 1933 American double eagle, a $20 gold coin, was auctioned in New York for $7.59 million, a record price for a coin.
Coin experts say interest has been stimulated by the "state quarters" program of the United States Mint. Every 10 weeks, the mint issues quarters celebrating one of the 50 states, in the order that they joined the union. The program began in 1999 and is to run to 2008. The releases this year are for Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, and Mississippi.
A 1999 Georgia quarter with a near-perfect 67 grade was sold for almost $1,500 in an eBay auction last year, when only nine coins were rated so high by Professional Coin Grading. Today, 30 of those quarters share the 67 grade. Mark Ferguson, the trends editor at Coin World,, said, "people who bid on eBay may get carried away." He said it was unlikely that such a coin would fetch that much now.
Even ardent coin fans warn that coin prices, like those of stocks, can go down, as they did for much of the 1990's. The Web site of Professional Coin Grading advises: "The coin market is volatile and thinly capitalized."
Scott A. Travers, a Manhattan coin dealer and author, said questionable grading services have surfaced on eBay and have "fooled consumers into paying higher prices." Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, said eBay is aware of the complaints. He said that the company provides links from its Web site to the Professional Coin Grading and Numismatic Guaranty sites, but that it is "up to buyers and sellers to determine what services they use."
Serious coin collectors and investors should buy only coins graded by Professional Coin Grading or Numismatic Guaranty, Mr. Travers said.
SOME collectors are interpreting the current price boom as a sell signal. Sidney H. Belzberg, a Toronto entrepreneur, recently decided to put his collection of rare Canadian coins on the block. The collection, to be auctioned early next year at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan, is expected to fetch $4 million to $6 million, according to Robert B. Korver, the director of Heritage Numismatic Auctions in Dallas, a unit of the Heritage Capital Corporation that is handling the sale.
"Coins have never done better," said Mr. Belzberg, a distant cousin of Samuel Belzberg, the 1980's corporate raider.
But he also said, in a telephone interview, that an even better investment now is to increase the 19 percent stake that he holds in Belzberg Technologies, a Canadian company that supplies order execution technology for traders in financial markets. The company's shares, which have risen 13.3 percent over the last 12 months, now trade at 4.25 Canadian dollars. "We've detected a number of opportunities in the stock market, not the least of which is our stock,' Mr. Belzberg said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
A Rich Dollar Sustains Imbalances In the World

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
THE economy is stumbling. Americans continue to spend far more than they produce, and have already caused the trade deficit to widen to a record annual gap of almost $400 billion. Interest rates are at lows not seen in decades, and the stock market, despite its recent rally, still seems like a risky place to invest.
 A perfect prescription, by anyone's standard, for a currency to weaken. And, indeed, for the first half of the year, that is exactly what was happening. 
 So why is the dollar going up these days?
Because just about every other area of the global economy is doing even worse.
"You have to look at the alternatives," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, Salomon Smith Barney's chief global economist. "What other markets are giving a better risk-adjusted return? None in particular. The dollar wins by default."
At first blush, this may seem just fine. Rooting for the dollar to rise, after all, seems almost patriotic to those who equate a strong dollar with a strong America. And the more the dollar goes up, the less it costs to buy imported goods and the cheaper it is for American tourists venturing abroad.
To other major countries, moreover, a robust dollar serves as an indiscriminate vacuum cleaner for their exports, helping to prop up Japan and Europe at a time when their own economies are faltering.
But consider the downside. For one, American manufacturers are forced to bear the brunt of a competitive onslaught from less-expensive foreign goods. Even if you think that lobbyists for American industries have exaggerated the impact, there is no doubt that exports have suffered and that jobs have been lost. The competitive strain has only added to the protectionist pressures that spurred the Bush administration to slap tariffs on imported steel and to lavish subsidies on American farmers.
The failure of the dollar to fall more in line with its fundamentals risks doing even more damage to the global economy. "It would be much better for everybody to see the U.S. currency depreciate in an orderly fashion," David Dodge, Canada's top central banker, said in a meeting last week with reporters and editors of The New York Times.
Why is that desirable? Start with the central quandary of the global economy: its overdependence on the American consumer. "The world is too content to allow America to provide the bulk of demand," said Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley. "In a shaky world, that's a dangerous position to be in."
The United States has about a 21 percent share of the global economy, but it has accounted for fully 40 percent of the real growth that has occurred since 1995.
That imbalance might be O.K. if the extra growth were financed mostly by Americans themselves. But the United States, with its growing government deficits and its anemic household savings, is barely putting aside any savings right now. As a result, according to a recent Merrill Lynch report by its top currency strategists, the United States will consume "a substantial three quarters" of the savings of the major industrial countries of the world this year.
While nothing is likely to change soon, the report explains, there are only three ways to correct this imbalance: "The U.S. falls into a deeper recession than other regions; other countries grow faster than the U.S.; or the U.S. dollar depreciates."
 BY no means is this imbalance entirely America's fault. Europe's economy is roughly equal in size to that of the United States, yet policy makers there have done nothing to stimulate growth at home. If anything, the European central bank, led by Wim Duisenberg, is making it worse. "Wim Duisenberg seems to think his only responsibility is to keep Europe inflation-free," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, a small investment firm. "Europeans keep pretending that they can export their way out of their own problems of sluggish domestic demand. It's a preposterous solution for anyone claiming to be a major economic power in the world."
And that's where the dollar comes back in. One way or another, it will eventually fall. That will require painful adjustments around the world, including demanding that Americans spend less and save more. But the sooner the dollar starts slipping, the sooner European countries -- and Japan, too -- will be forced to confront their own weak economic postures and the easier it will be for consumers here to cut back without plunging the economy back into recession.
"The world economy needs a global rebalancing," Mr. Roach said. "That's not a popular message either here or abroad. But it can't be avoided much longer."

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain 

 BODY:
There is nothing more beautiful than watching people get to vote in a free election for the first time -- particularly in the Arab world, where elections have been so rare. That's what happened in Bahrain Thursday, as this tiny island nation off the east coast of Saudi Arabia voted for a parliament that will, for the first time, get to share some decision-making with Bahrain's progressive king, Sheik Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa.
 As I visited polling stations, what struck me most was the number of elderly women who voted, many covered from head to toe in black burka-like robes. Many of them illiterate, they would check the picture of the candidate they wanted to vote for and then stuff the ballot in the box -- voting less for a politician than for their own empowerment. One appeared to have her grandchildren with her. As she voted, her grandson, who looked about age 10 and wore a soccer outfit, tried to explain to his little sisters what a voting booth was. Thus are seeds of democracy planted. 
 This is the first election ever in the Arab gulf region where women were allowed to run and vote, and their husbands have quickly discovered what that means. The king's wife, Sheika Sabika -- in an unprecedented move in this conservative region -- campaigned publicly for women to go out and vote. She visited a Shiite Muslim community center and an elderly woman stood up to say: "Thank you. Because we can now vote, for the first time our husbands are asking us what we think and are interested in what we have to say."
It's true that Bahrain's young king has been planning this transition to a constitutional monarchy for several years, as part of a move to spur economic growth and overcome Bahrain's legacy of Sunni-Shiite tension. He prepared the way by releasing all political prisoners, inviting exiles home, loosening reins on the press and repealing laws permitting arbitrary arrests. Nevertheless, this election is about something larger than Bahrain. It is about how the Arab world confronts the forces that produced 9/11 -- and all of Bahrain's neighbors, like Saudi Arabia, are watching.
What the more enlightened Arab leaders understand today is that with the mounting pressure of globalization, population explosions and dwindling oil revenues, their long acceptance of political and economic stagnation -- which they managed with repression and by refocusing anger onto Israel and America -- is becoming unsustainable. While the first big explosion happened in New York City, these regimes know that unless they get their houses in order, and on a more democratic track, the next explosion will be on their doorsteps.
Not a single person I spoke to at polling centers mentioned foreign policy. Most said they hoped the parliament would improve the economy, end corruption by senior ministers and give people a voice. "Things have changed in the whole world and we can't just sit around and watch and have no forum to express our views ---the pace of change dictates this upon us," said Dr. A. W. M. Abdul Wahab as he waited to vote.
The Bush team needs to pay attention to the Bahrain experiment, because it is a mini-version of what nation-building in Iraq would require. Like Iraq, Bahrain is a country with a Shiite majority, which has been economically deprived, and a Sunni Muslim minority, which has always controlled the levers of power. Historically in this part of the world, democracy never worked because of the feeling that if your tribe or religious community was not in power, it would lose everything -- so no rotation in power could be tolerated.
By electing one house of parliament and appointing another, the Bahraini king is taking the first tentative steps to both share decision-making and nurture a political culture in which the country will not be able to move forward without the new lawmakers' building coalitions across ethnic lines. The same would be needed in Iraq, only on a much larger scale.
I heard Harvard's president, Lawrence Summers, say once that "in the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car." Ditto for countries. So many Arabs today feel that they are just renting their governments. They have no real ownership, and so don't feel responsible for solving their own problems. Bahrain took a small step last week toward giving its people ownership over their own country, and one can only hope they will take responsibility for washing it and improving it. Nothing could help this region more. There is hope.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Europe Is Jittery, as the Wedding Nears

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
THE European Union is about to grow eastward, whether most Europeans like it or not. But this truly historic moment -- the political reunification of a Europe once divided by the Iron Curtain -- has created enormous anxiety on both sides of the old East-West border.
 While most of the attention has focused on Central and Eastern European anticipation about what Western Europeans might do for them, there has been less focus on what the current members want from the Easterners. As the West worries about a new influx of criminality and cheap labor from the East, the Poles, Czechs and others worry about Germans seeking cheap land, as well as the impact of subsidized goods from the West on domestic agriculture and industry. 
 Some of the concerns are straightforward matters of finance and bureaucracy. How, and how much, will the current 25 members pay to aid the entry of the next 10? How will old, discredited policies, like agricultural subsidies, be changed? How will regional aid be redistributed, and how will the union accommodate so many disparate cultures and languages?
There are also deeper fears. In the West, anxieties about job security, pensions, criminality and prostitution are being fanned by right-wing politicians, touching on fears of immigrants and racial mixing.
In candidate countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, there are parallel worries, mostly about rich Germans buying up the land taken from the Nazis after World War II, or recolonizing, through capital, the Central European states that Germany has always regarded as its special zone of influence. There are conservatives troubled by the mores of the West, and others concerned about the threat to the national and religious identities of Eastern countries -- nurtured at such cost under Soviet domination -- by a homogenous consumerist culture.
"Basically, there are two fundamental anxieties," said Christopher Bobinski, publisher of Unia and Polska, a Warsaw-based magazine devoted to the issues of European Union expansion. "One is, will they take us? And the other is, will they reject us?"
Many people in the candidate countries feel they are being treated as second-class citizens, too unruly and poor to be admitted immediately with full rights to the rich man's club.
For example, the European Union's proposal is that candidate countries, most of which have big farming sectors, will get only 25 percent of the subsidies granted current members. So smaller farmers in the East may have to compete, once the borders are fully open, with more heavily subsidized, and hence cheaper, products from farmers in the West.
These are all fears that are being fed by right-wing politicians in the east, making some leaders in candidate countries nervous about national membership referendums. Jerzy Kozminski, a former Polish ambassador to Washington, said he was concerned about what could seem to be the ungenerous spirit in which membership is being offered. "For the candidate countries, there are two levels of considerations," he said. The first is about emotions and symbols, which are not always tangible, and general discussions about culture and national identity -- and here the opponents of the European Union's enlargement play that card.
"Then on the second level, there are real, tangible issues: what the European Union will finally offer, and the way in which it is offered," he said. "The biggest concern is whether farmers and businesses in candidate countries will have equal conditions for economic competition."
Existing members like France and Germany can seem so caught up in benefiting their own constituents that the new countries wonder where the notions of a "Europe united and free" have gone in the fierce fight over national interests.
Last week, the Germans gave in to French pressure to leave the bloated system of agricultural subsidies alone until 2007. And existing members have put a seven-year moratorium on the ability of the citizens of candidate countries to travel to member countries to work -- even though Germany, in particular, needs skilled labor. 
In a parallel effort to deal with Eastern fears, Polish negotiators have worked out a 10-year moratorium on nonagricultural land sales, while farmers will be required to rent farmland and use it for three years before being allowed to buy it.
Even as public opinion in the candidate countries becomes less enthusiastic about the costs of joining, leaders there are growing concerned that the European Union will not offer the 10 candidate nations (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) firm membership proposals by the end of this year -- giving them enough of a cushion to finish negotiations and join in time to participate in the next European Parliament elections in June 2004.
Further delay will lead to more cynicism and apathy. There are small pluralities in favor of joining the European Union in all candidate countries, but in some formerly Communist countries, like Poland, there are concerns that fewer than the necessary 50 percent of eligible voters will take part in a referendum.
ON the other side, polls show only 51 percent of people in European Union nations think expansion is a good idea, while 30 percent are firmly opposed. Luckily for the candidate countries, member countries will not hold referendums, though their Parliaments must pass a treaty of accession.
Ryszard Stemplowski, the director of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, says that joining the European Union will not bring the joy to Poles that joining NATO did. 
"It's not a rosy picture we'll be able to celebrate the day of entry," he said.
"But we're talking about a marriage agreement, not a peace treaty. And if you're going to enter a marriage agreement, you have to be prepared to do anything to obtain your goal."

HEADLINE: Terror vs. Terrorism; 
When Just One Gun Is Enough

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ATOMIZED cells. Leaderless revolutionaries. Soft targets. After Sept. 11, these were the dangers intelligence officials warned us about.
 The sniper case amplifies them all. 
 These days, it is increasingly difficult to figure out who is a terrorist -- or what that even means. Terror -- as opposed to terrorism -- may be inflicted by any loner with a vague political grievance and a gun. John Allen Muhammad, the prime suspect in a string of killings around the Washington area, is the perfect enigma. 
The police say he seems to have been driven by split motivations, a mix of ideology and rage. Mr. Muhammad, a Muslim convert, sympathized with Al Qaeda and was angry at America, acquaintances said, but he also had serious personal problems that may have set him off. In the end, one motive may have been much more mundane: money. The police say that a note left at a shooting scene included a demand for $10 million.
"That doesn't make it easy to put him in a box," said Bruce Hoffman, a counterterrorism expert at the Rand Corporation. "We're uncomfortable classifying people who don't belong to terrorist groups as terrorists. But we're learning that the lines between terrorists, serial killers and psychopaths don't really exist anymore."
When the killings first began, government officials, including the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, played down the possibility of a terrorist link. But the federal government responded as if there was one. The Pentagon sent a spy plane. The C.I.A. lent its explosives-sniffing canine units. The F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms committed a total of 800 employees to the investigation. Terrorist fears peaked when a witness, later found to be lying, said the shooter had olive skin. 
"Imagine if this had happened before Sept. 11," said Neil Livingstone, chief executive of Global Options, a security firm based in Washington. "Would you have had this ongoing conversation about a terrorist on the loose? I doubt it."
In intelligence speak, the sniper victims were soft targets. Mother, father, son, cab driver, bus driver, analyst. The victims were chosen at random; they were shot in front of a Home Depot, a park bench, a bus stop. 
It took three weeks and 10 deaths to catch one man, possibly aided by a 17-year-old, armed with no more than a rifle and a fistful of bullets, in a part of the country with the highest concentration of police, military and counterterrorism forces.
The hunt for the killer exposed what can and cannot be done to prevent terrorism. The government can fortify high-profile, so-called hard targets like the White House and the airports, but what can it do to protect a Ponderosa Steakhouse? 
"Not much," said Larry Johnson, a former C.I.A. anti-terrorism analyst. "There are certain vulnerabilities you can't prevent. It's like getting on a bus in Israel: you pay your money, you step on board, you take your chance."
In any case, police experts insist that combating terrorism requires different strategies. "It's a different battle," said John Timoney, a former Philadelphia police commissioner. "The best way to fight terrorism is to gather intelligence. The best way to stop a serial killer is to apprehend him."
BUT it's not easy to define terrorism. Terrorists have a cause. That's the most common way to think of it. But Dr. Hoffman said it is better to see cause, or ideology, as falling along a spectrum, with the archetypal serial killer on one end and archetypal terrorist on the other. Ted Bundy, who murdered brunette women for sport, is at one point along the spectrum. Further down would be Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who struck out at technology, and Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber who saw himself as the first hero of the second American revolution.
"The problem today is that there are more and more people who pick up ideas and go off on their own and do them," Dr. Hoffman said. "They are freelance killers." 
Dr. Hoffman and others worry that the biggest fallout from the sniper attacks is a note of encouragement. No matter that Mr. Muhammad and John Lee Malvo, his alleged accomplice, were eventually arrested, actually sleeping alongside the road. 
The message survived. Leaderless revolutionaries, one-man armies, lone wolves angry at the world: you don't need a plane or a bomb to terrorize America. Just one gun.
