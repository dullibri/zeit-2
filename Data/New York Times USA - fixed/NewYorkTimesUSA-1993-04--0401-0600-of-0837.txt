HEADLINE: Clinton Said to Seek Increase in Intelligence Funds

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
President Clinton has asked Congress for authority to spend even more money on spy agencies, satellites and other intelligence activities in the 1994 fiscal year than it allotted for 1993, Congressional and Administration officials say.
The request is hidden in classified sections of the Defense Department budget that on the whole reflects Mr. Clinton's plans for significant cuts in military spending. 
 But the Administration has concluded that at least a short-term increase in the intelligence spending is needed before similar deep reductions can be made in the budgets of the Central Intelligence Agency and other spy agencies.
The new Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, had signaled earlier that the Administration would oppose sharp immediate cuts in intelligence spending. But the request for an increase has surprised some lawmakers because Mr. Clinton had promised to slash intelligence spending by $7 billion over four years.
Nearly all of the new spending, Administration officials said today, is to be devoted to launching spy satellites that can replace several older ones, saving money in the future.
While some members of both parties have expressed support for such an effort, other lawmakers have privately voiced some distress at the proposal. The request is expected to be the subject of a sharp debate next week when members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees meet behind closed doors to review the budget.
While the size of the nation's vast intelligence budget remains an official secret, Administration and Congressional officials disclosed today that it would total about $28 billion if the increase requested by Mr. Clinton is approved. They said the previous estimates putting the figure at $29 billion had been exaggerated.
Of the total, the officials said Mr. Clinton had proposed that $17.8 billion be set aside next year for the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. That request represents an increase at nearly double the rate of inflation from this year's final appropriation of about $17 billion, they said.
At the same time, Congressional officials said Mr. Clinton proposed only minor cuts in the other component of the intelligence budget, the military programs intended to gather the information used in battle. They said that total remained at $10.1 billion.
By comparison, after accounting for inflation, Mr. Clinton proposed a 5 percent reduction in overall military spending.
Administration officials have told members of Congress that the increase will allow intelligence agencies to consolidate programs and make deep cuts in the years ahead.
They also argue that Mr. Clinton has not violated his budget-cutting pledge because his request represents a substantial reduction from what President George Bush had planned to spend in 1994. Mr. Bush had set aside $19 billion for national intelligence programs.
Because Congress last year authorized about $400 million more for intelligence than it finally appropriated, an Administration official said last night, the White House intends to portray its proposal as a freeze, not an increase, once inflation is taken into account.
The new Administration hopes such arguments and party loyalty might blunt any Democratic impulse to renew battles that party members fought with the Bush Administration to cut intelligence spending. But some Congressional Democrats have already made clear that they intend to fight the new request, even though it comes from a Democratic President.
An influential Democratic lawmaker who spoke on condition of anonymity said the request for more money showed that the new Administration had failed to gauge the opposition to the proposal.
"This increase is just not going to happen," the Democratic lawmaker predicted. "They're going to get cut severely."
Even Representative Dan Glickman, the Kansas Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said in a recent interview that he had not yet decided whether to support the White House request. "I'm not going to be thrilled about an increase," Mr. Glickman said. "But we'll have to see where the increases are coming from."
Further evidence of the proposed increases is in a public version of Mr. Clinton's 1994 Defense Department budget request.
While the unclassified document leaves blank the spending requests for specific intelligence programs, simple calculations show that a research budget includes a request for a $150 million increase to be divided among the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the new Central Imagery Office, which handles requests for spy satellite photographs.
A separate Air Force procurement budget shows a $570 million increase for a category designated only as "selected activities," a category that experts outside government said was used to disguise money set aside for the C.I.A. and the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates spy satellites.
Administration officials confirmed that the proposed new financing would go for the consolidation of the nation's spy satellite systems. Although new reconnaissance or eavesdropping satellites can cost as much as $1 billion, officials say that at least one satellite now under construction can fulfill the duties of several others, eliminating the cost of their operation.

HEADLINE: Pratt & Whitney Threatening To Shut 2 Connecticut Plants

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., April 14

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney threatened today to close two Connecticut plants and to eliminate 2,300 additional jobs unless it receives concessions from its unions and tax breaks from the state.
The threatened closings shocked Pratt employees and their communities, but Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and other state officials quickly vowed to meet the company's requests and to avoid the loss of more jobs on top of 6,700 that are already scheduled to be eliminated. 
 In seeking the concessions, company officials said that building jet engines in Connecticut costs 30 percent more than in states like Georgia and Maine, where Pratt plants are not closing.
"We have said for a long time that Connecticut is a very expensive state to do business in, but that it is our traditional home," said a Pratt & Whitney spokesman, Mark Sullivan. "This is the first time we've done a dollar comparison."
Governor Weicker said that Pratt officials were most concerned about gaining relief from local property taxes -- they pay $22 million a year in five communities -- and gaining greater benefits from a state tax credit for research and development, on which Pratt spends several hundred million dollars a year.
 
Wider Industry Problems
 Economists said that the additional layoffs would have only a small effect on the state's economy, but that the plant closings and movement of jobs out of state would cost towns millions of dollars in taxes and could endanger the hundreds of Pratt subcontractors in the state. Pratt's employment in the state has already fallen to 17,290, from 28,800 in 1986.
Analysts say Pratt & Whitney has little choice but to cut back to compete amid a severely depressed commercial aviation market. But in a state where the recession has already eliminated 180,000 jobs, Pratt's decisions are pushing Connecticut to compete more directly with other states for its manufacturing jobs, and its unionized employees here to compete with nonunion work forces at sister plants.
"We will assist Pratt & Whitney to whatever degree is necessary," Governor Weicker said at a news conference at his regional office in Bridgeport.
"In the quest to be competitive, they have to downsize their own operations," Mr. Weicker said. "If we want them in Connecticut, clearly we have to meet the competition when it comes to business climate."
Andrew Romegialli, president of District 91 of the machinists union, told The Associated Press that the company described the closing plan to union leaders as a "worst-case scenario." Labor costs, he said, were a small part of the state's higher costs.
"They're going to want something," he said. "We don't know what it is yet. If they have specifics, like they did for the state, they can come and talk to us about it."
 
Concern in Southington
 In Hartford, Democratic and Republican leaders in the General Assembly pledged to work with Mr. Weicker and Pratt to prevent the further loss of jobs.
Pratt's president, Karl Krapek, said no final decisions have been made on its nine plants in Connecticut, pending talks with state officials and the machinists union, which represents shop workers. But in East Hartford, Southington, and North Haven -- where a third plant is scheduled to be partially shut -- employees, neighboring merchants and town officials felt like it was the end.
"The outlook is pretty dim," Southington's town manager, John Weichsel, said after a meeting this morning with plant executives. "They made it clear there was nothing more that Southington could or should have done."
The closing there would not only put 1,300 people out of work, but jeopardize the $3.8 million in property taxes that Pratt paid this year toward the town's $66 million budget.
One advantage Connecticut does offer manufacturers is a skilled work force built up over generations, but now the thousands of layoffs will include men and women with a dozen or more years of experience, many of them in their 40's and 50's who have little prospect of finding comparable jobs.
"I'd have to leave the state, plain and simple," said Nicholas M. Pisani, 50, a process planner in the North Haven plant's manufacturing and engineering department. "There are too many unemployed people in this state now, and I don't think I'd have much of a chance to find a job in Connecticut at my age."
 
Keep Connecticut Presence
 Connecticut has seen other industries, notably the brass industry in the Naugatuck Valley, slowly move its operations out of state while wringing concessions from their workers. But Mr. Krapek said today that Pratt, whose headquarters are in East Hartford, wants to maintain a major presence in Connecticut, and few analysts questioned the company's need to cut costs and seek concessions from the state and unions.
Analysts said that Pratt has higher costs than its competitors, General Electric and Rolls-Royce, and has been affected more by the commercial aviation industry's troubles. Furthermore, its greatest costs are in Connecticut, they said.
"The costs there are much higher than in Georgia, Florida and probably Maine," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at NatWest Securities.
The Connecticut workers are highly skilled, he said, but "Pratt & Whitney is going through an immense historical transition. At this point, we'd assume that people would come to the table and would want to talk."
That transition could take Pratt further in reducing its work force than its officials are now projecting. Pratt has said its target is a worldwide work force of 30,000 by the end of 1994, down from 44,400 in 1991, but Michael Lauer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, is forecasting that the company will have 27,000 employees in 1995.
The cutbacks are likely to fall more heavily on Pratt's home state than officials had originally expected. Just last month, the company was saying only 6,700 of 10,664 layoffs would come within the state; now 9,000 are scheduled.
Mr. Krapek said a study conducted this winter found that average hourly costs per worker in Connecticut plants were $6 to $8 higher than in Georgia and Maine, and officials from those states have since proposed economic-development packages that increased their advantages.
In addition, Pratt has found that it can cut the cost of many parts by nearly a third simply by having subcontractors supply them.
"We're not trying to start a bidding war between states," said Mr. Sullivan, the Pratt spokesman. "We're trying to address a very serious cost problem for the company."
Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, said, "What Pratt has done now is only to underscore what other parts of the business community have said before: It's tough to do business in Connecticut. You've got to take them seriously when they shut down the plants."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN IS BACKED AT TALKS IN TOKYO

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 14

 BODY:
The world's seven leading industrial nations pledged support today to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia but were still struggling to assemble an aid program to promote his economic reforms and to help him win a nationwide referendum in less than two weeks.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan opened the two-day conference saying that Russia was at a "critical juncture, with the reform efforts under the leadership of President Yeltsin facing tremendous challenges both politically and economically." 
 He called it "incumbent upon the international community to send a clear message that it expects Russia's reforms to be pursued irreversibly."
 
Effort to Please
 Mr. Miyazawa's statement reflected a marked effort by Japan to accommodate its other industrialized partners despite its lack of enthusiasm for aiding a country that is still occupying territory claimed by Japan but seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II.
Mr. Miyazawa's address to the meeting participants contained Japan's pledge of $1.8 billion in aid to Russia this year, a figure that disappointed some Administration officials because all but $300 million of it was in the form of loans -- not grants -- that are intended to promote Japanese exports.
By contrast, most of the new funding by the United States will be in outright grants, rather than in loans or credits.
The United States plans to announce on Thursday a new $1.8 billion aid package, some of which Administration officials said would have to be funded by an emergency aid request from Congress.
The new aid would be in addition to the $1.6 billion of previously appropriated money announced by Mr. Clinton at the summit with Mr. Yeltsin earlier this month. In addition, the United States has offered $2 billion of Export-Import Bank credits to finance Russia's purchase of American oil, gas and other energy equipment.
 
$30 Billion Package
 The seven countries are hoping to unveil on Thursday a package of $30 billion in bilateral grants, loans and credits as well as funding from international lending institutions. But there were still differences of opinion today on how much of the aid pledged represented previous promises. In endorsing Mr. Yeltsin, Secretary of State Warren Christopher sounded a little like a campaign manager, saying the Russian president "was far superior to any of his likely successors in terms of commitment to the market process." He added that any successors to Mr. Yeltsin "would probably be less committed" to this process.
As part of its aid initiative, the United States proposed today the creation of a $4 billion fund administered by the seven nations -- known as the Group of Seven -- to help Russia sell off its unprofitable large-scale state-owned industries, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said.
 
To Aid Privatization
 He added that the United States is ready to spend some $500 million on the initiative, with other funding coming from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, as well as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The American initiative also calls for the creation of another international fund to help share the costs of dismantling nuclear weapons in Russia, the Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Despite the American pressure, it is not clear that it will spur others into spending more money. German officials said today that their government, which has provided Russia with more than half of some $80 billion in international support, was unlikely to offer any new bilateral aid at the meeting.
In presenting the United States plans for expanded aid, Mr. Christopher acknowledged that there had been delays on the American side.
Officials said the delays resulted from an initial unwillingness by Mr. Clinton to consult with Congress on the Russian aid issue until his economic stimulus package was passed, and by the death of his father-in-law.
 
Pressure on Japan
 Mr. Bentsen also told reporters that he expects Mr. Clinton to urge Japan to participate in the new American initiatives when he meets Prime Minister Miyazawa Friday in Washington. "Given the strength of the economy, I'm sure the President will be urging them to participate," Mr. Bentsen said.
Mr. Clinton has come up with an entirely new aid package so that he would not open up the United States to criticism that it was doing very little, senior Administration officials said.
Even as the ministers were praising Mr. Yeltsin and his reforms, the war in the Balkans intruded as Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, told the group that Mr. Yeltsin needed to reform not only his economy and his political system but also his foreign policy, British officials said.
Later, Mr. Hurd said that Russia must endorse by the end of April a pending Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions on the Serbs for their failure to sign the United Nations-brokered peace accord.
But none of the parties to the conference are willing to link aid for Russia to its cooperation on the Balkans.
Officials said Mr. Christopher only mildly raised the possibility that at some point there should be consideration for lifting the United Nations arms embargo in the Balkans in order to "level the playing field" by aiding the lesser-armed Bosnian Muslims.

HEADLINE: Thatcher Assails West's Bosnia Policy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 14

 BODY:
In a sudden and furious assault on Western policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lady Thatcher has sharply condemned allied leaders, including her successor as Prime Minister of Britain, saying they lack the resolve to take stronger action on behalf of Bosnia's embattled Muslims.
In two days of television and radio interviews, and remarks late today in the House of Lords, where she now sits as a member, Lady Thatcher urged Britain and its Western allies not only to help arm Bosnian Muslims, but also to support what she described as "aggressive" air strikes against Serbian positions. 
 On Tuesday, in an interview on British television, she went so far as to describe members of the European Community as behaving "a little like accomplices to massacre" because, she said, they had done nothing to stop the killing.
Lady Thatcher's comments, first delivered late Tuesday when she summoned television reporters to her office for interviews, appeared to add fuel to the sometimes convulsive and so far inconclusive debate among Western governments, including the United States, over how to respond to repeated Serbian aggression inside Bosnia, including "ethnic cleansing," or efforts to forcibly displace Muslims from territory the Serbs now claim as their own.
 
The 'Iron Lady' Again
 Lady Thatcher has spoken out before on the need for tougher military steps in Bosnia. But in condemning current Western efforts as inadequate, she unlimbered the kind of no-holds-barred commentary and foreign policy toughness that often marked her tenure as Prime Minister, when she was known as the "Iron Lady."
"If these governments are not moved by those pictures of death and suffering, if they are not moved by the position of ethnic cleansing in Europe, two million refugees, mass graves being found in Croatia, then they should be," she said in a television interview today with NBC News, adding: "We cannot let things go on like this. It is evil."
In Britain, Lady Thatcher's sudden outburst touched off a political dispute as members of Prime Minister John Major's Government moved quickly to the defensive to blunt the fierceness of their former party leader's attack.
Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind at first described her remarks as "emotional nonsense." In a more politic statement before the House of Commons today, he reiterated existing British policy in Bosnia, and rejected her plea that Britain and its allies lift an international arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims.
 
A Clash in the Lords
 Late today, Lady Thatcher and Baroness Chalker, the Foreign Office's Minister of State, clashed in the House of Lords. Lady Thatcher rose to challenge Britain's refusal to lift the arms embargo on the Muslims, arguing that it left them "defenseless in the path of a determined dictator-aggressor."
Lady Chalker replied, "It is not a question of leaving people unprotected; it is a question of making sure that we work together to stop an all-out war, which many of the solutions advocated by you could well cause."
Until now, the British Government and Western allies have been reluctant to endorse any increase in military activity against the Serbs, primarily on the ground that it might endanger United Nations peacekeeping missions already in Bosnia, including 2,600 British troops helping to escort supplies of food and medicines to besieged Serbian towns.
Instead, they have favored what one British newspaper described today as a policy of "good intentions and political realism," or relief aid combined with pressure toward some sort of diplomatic or political resolution.
 
'Anger and Pent-Up Rage'
 A former aide to Mrs. Thatcher said her remarks reflected her own "anger and pent-up rage" over the situation in Bosnia, which boiled over after the artillery attack Monday on the Muslim town of Srebrenica, in which more than 50 people were killed and approximately 70 wounded.
Lord Owen, who heads the peace efforts of the European Community, said today that Lady Thatcher seemed to be speaking more out of emotion than reasoned analysis. "Sometimes Lady Thatcher makes it appear very simple," he said. "It is not, unfortunately."
Some Conservative Party members critical of Lady Thatcher said she appeared to be using Bosnia to pummel Mr. Major, with whom she has been at odds in recent months over his support for ratification of the treaty on closer European political and economic cooperation, which she opposes.
Associates of Lady Thatcher say she has become increasingly disenchanted with Mr. Major, whom she picked as her successor in November 1990, when a rebellion in Conservative Party ranks forced her resignation.
Aides to Mr. Major seemed infuriated by remarks Tuesday that what Britain now needed was a Prime Minister like Winston Churchill, whom she described as having "a lionheart."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Mediator Talks of Air Strikes
 WASHINGTON, April 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator on the Balkans, says the West should consider air strikes against Serbian forces if the Bosnian Serbs refuse to agree to a peace accord.
In an interview with Foreign Affairs, Lord Owen argued that air attacks could be an effective means of persuading the Bosnian Serbs to join a peace settlement.
"We can increase sanctions and perhaps then tilt the balance of force by the use of air power," Lord Owen said in an interview on Feb. 16 with the magazine, a quarterly journal published by the Council on Foreign Relations.
"Tipping the balance to force a recalcitrant party to accept a just and equitable peace package is, in my view, wholly legitimate diplomacy."
Lord Owen's former partner in the negotations, Cyrus R. Vance, has also recently suggested that the use of force could help bring the warring parties to reach a negotiated settlement.
Lord Owen, a former Defense Minister, said, "I don't hold the view of the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense that we cannot use air power without also putting in large national ground forces."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Move Nudges Treasuries Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices moved a little higher yesterday as the Federal Reserve helped support the market by buying Treasury securities.
The discount rates on Treasury bills moved lower for the second straight day as more investors seemed to bet that the economy was growing so slowly that the Federal Reserve might have to reduce short-term interest rates. 
 In secondary trading, the price of the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to 10424/32 , as the yield fell to 6.75 percent from 6.78 percent on Tuesday. If the price of the long bond rises another third of a point, the yield will drop to 6.72 percent, which was the closing low reached on March 8. The prices of shorter-term Treasury notes were also higher.
On Treasury bills, the discount rate dropped to 2.80 percent for three-month bills and 2.93 percent for six-month bills. Both rates are below the Federal Reserve's 3 percent target for the Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks and the presumed floor for short-term interest rates.
 
'Good Bid' in the Curve
 "Now that some doubts have crept back into the market about the strength of the economy and the Fed is not likely to tighten interest rates soon, the whole curve is going to have a good bid to it," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities, referring to investor interest in Treasury securities from bills to notes to bonds.
The market was not going anywhere in the morning, as traders and investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve would do what is called a coupon pass -- buy Treasury notes or bonds, which have a coupon, in an effort to add reserves to the banking system. The Fed does this when it is concerned that normal seasonal events, like income tax payments, will alter its monetary policy goals, in this case making them more restrictive than desired.
But such a coupon pass was expected for some time, and the market was disappointed when it did not occur on several other trading days recently. But after noon, the Fed did the buying, and the prices of notes and bonds began to rise.
Mr. Levenson said that for the near term he expected traders and investors to focus on the theme of slower economic growth. Until the employment data for April are released in early May no statistics are expected that could shift the focus because bad weather has had a negative impact on all the March data.
Mr. Levenson said that it would take another run-up in the Commodity Research Bureau's index of commodity prices, which closed yesterday at 211.95, up 0.11, or a surprising decline in initial jobless claims, which are to be released this morning, to shake the market.
"As a tactical short-term matter the market will have a good tone to it until it is clear that the March data were weather washout," he said.
 
Corporate Bonds
 More than $4.8 billion of new corporate bonds have been sold so far this week, according to Technical Data, as the rally in the Treasury market has reawakened interest among corporate treasurers.
But the flood of new issues by the end of the week may turn out to be a little less than expected. And one reason may be that the sluggishness in the economy, as exemplified by the 1 percent decline in March retail sales, is leading more economists and forecasters to suggest that interest rates will fall to new lows before rising again.
"A lot of economists are advising people that rates will be lower," said James B. Quigley, managing director of the global financing desk at Merrill Lynch. "There doesn't seem to be such a sense of urgency."
He said that to open the floodgates to a surge in corporate sales that would match the record volume of $36.78 billion in January, long-term interest rates would have to drop lower and short-term interest rates would have to rise.
The rise in short-term rates, he said, is what it will take to force some companies to decide that it is now cost effective to move their borrowing horizons out to longer maturities along the yield curve.
The impact of the rise of interest rates from mid-March to the end of last week on issuance of new corporate bonds is easily seen in Securities Data Company figures. January's record issuance of $36.78 billion was followed by near records of $34.25 billion in February and $34.41 billion in March, when interest rates hit their recent lows. But by mid April, the pace had dropped to $7.79 billion.

HEADLINE: U.S. ENVOY ISSUES WARNING TO SERBS

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, April 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's special envoy to peace negotiations on the former Yugoslavia warned today that the United States would support lifting an arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina unless the Serbian forces who have carved up the country agreed soon to a United Nations peace proposal.
"We are continuing to pursue the diplomatic track," the envoy, Reginald Bartholomew, said here at a news conference. "If the Serbs do not come to terms reasonably soon, we cannot see this as an extended process. We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies." 
 At a meeting later in Belgrade, Mr. Bartholomew pressed the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, to sign a proposed international peace plan that would reorganize Bosnia into 10 semiautonomous provinces dominated by various ethnic factions. Leaders of the other two factions in the Bosnian war, the Muslims and the Croats, have already agreed to the settlement.
"The Bosnian Serbs have to come to an agreement to the plan now," Mr. Bartholomew said in the Yugoslav capital. "The military and humanitarian horrors have to stop now."
 
Stalling by Serbs Suspected
 But, in what many envoys view as an effort to stall both the United Nations negotiations and calls for tougher action against Serbian forces, Mr. Karadzic again today called for Muslims, Croats and Serbs to enter into direct talks to resolve the Bosnian war without international mediation.
"I'm calling on Muslims and Croats for talks, face to face," he said. "There is no settlement without direct talks."
Scattered Serbian shelling was reported today in Srebrenica, a largely Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia where thousands of refugees have taken shelter. United Nations monitors quoted by The Associated Press said the Serbian fire had abated somewhat there since Tuesday, when 8 people were killed and 21 were wounded, or on Monday, when more than 50 refugeesin the town were killed, including many women and children.
Monday's attack outraged senior United Nations officials in Bosnia, who charged that the Serbs were willing to kill anyone who lay in their path.
Bosnia's Muslim-led Government has appealed repeatedly to the United Nations Security Council to end the embargo on weapons shipments to Bosnia and other countries of the former Yugoslavia so that its out-gunned forces can defend the towns they still control.
In seizing 70 percent of Bosnia's territory over the last year, Serbian nationalists have relied mainly on tanks, aircraft and heavy artillery supplied by Serbia and Montenegro -- the two republics comprising what remains of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian Serbs have refused to sign the peace plan because it would commit them to withdrawing from a third of the territory they now hold , including a critical corridor linking Serbia with a huge swath of Serbian-held land in western Bosnia and most of the land that Serbs hold in neighboring Croatia.
Despite growing international condemnation, the Bosnian Serbs have continued an operation of "ethnic cleansing" aimed at expelling the Muslims from eastern Bosnian lands along Serbia's border.
Mr. Bartholomew said that Yugoslavia would face unparalleled economic and diplomatic sanctions if the Serbs did not halt their offensive. Economic sanctions have pushed the Yugoslav economy to the brink of collapse since they were adopted by the United Nations last June, but the Bosnian Serbs and their financial backers in Serbia have shown little willingness to halt the fighting.
"If they persist in these actions, the international community will make of Serbia a pariah state for as far ahead as we can see," Mr. Bartholomew said. "You have very firm, very tightly organized international pressure building up."
 
Balkan Update
 Sporadic shellfire was reported in SREBRENICA yesterday as international pressure mounted to stop Serbian aggression in eastern BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.
At the UNITED NATIONS, a group of countries on the Security Council tried but failed to force an early vote on tighter sanctions against Yugoslavia. Russia wants to delay a vote until April 26.
In BELGRADE, the new United States envoy seeking peace in the Balkans, Reginald Bartholomew, unsuccessfully pressed the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, to sign a peace settlement for Bosnia. The envoy warned that the United States might seek to lift an embargo and let weapons through to Bosnia's Muslims if the Serbs did not sign soon.
Lady Thatcher drew sharp criticism in LONDON for urging that Britain and its Western allies not only arm the Muslims, but also bomb Serbian positions.
But air strikes were also described as an option by Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator on the Balkans, during an interview in WASHINGTON. President Clinton meanwhile told Congress that he does not expect American planes to engage in combat while enforcing the current ban on flights over Bosnia. NATO aircraft flying from bases in ITALY reported no violations of the flight ban yesterday.

HEADLINE: Union Rule Faces a Rare Fight;
Dear to Labor, Wicks Contracting Law Is Debated in Albany

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 14

 BODY:
As long as there has been a Wicks Law, which is 72 years now, there have been people trying to repeal it.
"It's a horror," said Henry Stern, president of Citizens Union, a nonprofit government monitoring group. He and other opponents of Wicks, which requires local governments to hire at least four separate contractors rather than one general contractor for most projects, say that it inflates construction costs on public projects across the state by $400 million a year.
Despite perennial efforts to rescind the Wicks Law, it has stayed off the legislative agenda for decades, mostly because of the sophisticated lobbying and generous political contributions of its prime beneficiaries -- the state's plumbing, electrical and heating trades. 
 But this year opponents are organizing a new campaign. For the first time in memory, legislators in both houses have introduced a bill to give local governments the option of following the law or not. Most say they would not, given the choice.
Construction trade unions, which have long supported the Wicks Law, are mobilizing for a fight to defend it. The law allows them to negotiate contracts directly with public agencies, instead of having to go through a single general contractor.
Although critics charge that the system results in higher public contracts, the unions argue that the problems in public construction have nothing to do with Wicks and everything to do with inefficient government.
The solution, they say, is for public agencies to send in good contract managers to oversee the agencies' projects and resolve construction disputes.
The opponents of the law are trying to bolster their case by citing a new report from one of the most active public building agencies in the state, the New York City School Construction Authority. The authority was exempted from the Wicks Law four years ago by the Legislature as a kind of experiment to test whether the law creates as much inefficiency as opponents claim.
That experiment has a year more to run. But in the meantime, the authority has just completed a study of the impact of the Wicks Law on other agencies in New York City and concluded that projects exempted from Wicks cost 13 percent less and were completed an average of 15.6 months more quickly than Wicks projects.
 
Opponents Are Encouraged
 The report, prepared by a team of outside economists hired by the construction authority, based its findings on an analysis of 163 public projects built in New York City during the 1980's, like housing, schools and firehouses. Eighty-six of the projects were subject to Wicks; 77 were not, because some agencies are exempt from the law or are only required to follow it for some of their projects.
Though the consultants said they would not be able to complete their analysis of the authority's own experience until next year, when the five-year experiment is up, their study, which the authority describes as the most comprehensive study of the law ever conducted, has greatly encouraged Wicks's opponents.
"This report strongly supports our contention that state and local agencies should be given the choice to build with or without the Wicks Law provision," said State Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, who is sponsoring the bill with Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat.
 
Multiple Contracts Required
 Most states handle public construction by hiring a general contractor, who in turn hires and oversees subcontractors for specialized work like plumbing and air conditioning.
But New York's multiple contract law, first passed in 1921 in response to corruption in the construction industry, forbids that practice by requiring that the governments negotiate directly with at least four contractors: a general contractor and contractors for heating, electrical and plumbing work. In 1946, a measure sponsored by State Senator Arthur H. Wicks expanded the law to include public housing.
The law was supposed to lower costs for the public by encouraging competition among contractors. But its opponents say that its drawbacks soon became apparent.
"When you have a problem on the job, it's very difficult to identify the responsible individual," said Rudolph J. Rinaldi, New York City's Commissioner of Buildings. "The different groups all have their own ambitions. They're not concerned about the project, but about their own profit and their own schedule."
 
Pipes Burst Amid Argument
 In a classic case, the city says, a $3.7 million project to build 88 units of housing for the homeless in the Bronx in 1988 was delayed for months while the plumbing contractor and the general contractor squabbled about whose job it was to shut off the pipes during the winter.
While they argued, a city report said, "the pipes froze, causing substantial damage to the plumbing system, walls, ceilings, hardwood floors, tiles, kitchen cabinets and paint." The plumber refused to repair the damage, was charged for it anyway, and later sued the city.
In another example cited by critics, a Queens sanitation garage was finished in 1991, six years after contracts were awarded under Wicks rules. The electrical contractor at one point walked off the job, resulting in several months' delay, even though that contractor was responsible for only 3 percent of the work. The report said that a single general contractor could have forced the subcontractor to do the job by withholding payment.
But the trades, who chafe under the firm grip of general contractors, say that the public agencies, not the Wicks law, are to blame.
"It has really become a scapegoat for construction problems that have nothing to do with Wicks," said George V. Whalen, executive director of the Plumbing Foundation of the City of New York, who says that the problem isn't the law, but rather public agencies' inability to properly manage construction.
 
Price Shopping Is Feared
 Mr. Whalen and others also say that the single-contract system leads to a practice called price shopping, in which general contractors negotiate a contract for a project, then go back and force the subcontractors to lower their bids to keep the job. The subcontractors are thus under pressure to cut corners while the general contractor keeps the profit, he said.
In a 1991 report, lobbyists for the Wicks Law cited the success of a $40 million project to build a command center at Rikers Island: there were 12 contractors, and all their bids totaled $2 million less than the city's Department of General Services had budgeted. According to the report, the project was completed on time and 8 of the 12 contractors received bonuses for finishing ahead of schedule. The report said the efficiency was due to the city's staying deeply involved in the project and hiring an efficient construction coordinator.
The new Sanders-Goodman bill may well face an uphill battle in the Legislature, whose members have traditionally been loath to offend the generous trade groups.
The trade groups say that for every report concluding that the Wicks Law wastes money, there is a counter-report saying the opposite.
 
Debate and Influence
 "It's comical how everybody gets in and fights over this," said Denis M. Hughes, executive assistant to Edward J. Cleary, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. "There is nothing that shows conclusively that repealing the law will save money over long periods of time, and yet the issue has taken on a life of its own."
But beyond the substantive debate, the unions plan to use old-fashioned political influence in their cause. The unions are a mainstay of political support for legislators in both parties in Albany, reliably giving money to both parties each year, attending fund-raising events and providing manpower at election time for phone banks, pamphleteering and the like.
Legislative leaders, who thought they had successfully managed to put off the issue until 1994, when the School Construction Authority is to release its final report, said that they were taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the interim report and would take up the issue when they returned from their vacation next week.
'All three sides agreed when we did the school construction bill for New York City that we wouldn't do anything until we heard what their experience was," said John E. MacArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino. "But he's willing to look at any proposals that are out there."

HEADLINE: Chile: Japan's Backdoor to the West

SERIES: Japan: The Consummate Trader: Two Case Studies -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
Reaching across thousands of miles of the Pacific, Japan and Chile have been quietly forming close economic and political ties in the last two years, ties that potentially challenge the long-standing dominance of the American business presence here.
Since 1991, Japan has become Chile's largest export market as everything from fish meal to refined copper to wine is making its way to Japan, and surpassing Chile's exports to the United States, which, with one exceptional year, had dominated trade with Chile for the last 20 years or so.
Both big and small Japanese companies, ranging from the Mitsubishi Corporation to the Sakata Seed Company have made commitments in the last two years to sink $700 million into Chile, more than all Japanese investment in Chile in the last two decades. And the number of Japanese companies operating here in the last three years has almost doubled, to 55.
 
Foothold for Japan
 The new relationship, though relatively small in global trade terms, has some trade experts trying to figure out how Chileans have been able to penetrate the Japanese market, often closed to American exporters.
[President Clinton has criticized Japan's barriers and will undoubtedly tell the Japanese Prime Minister that Japan must buy more American goods when they meet on April 16.]
Indeed, some in Washington are concerned that by establishing closer ties with Chile, Japan is getting an important foothold in Latin America, expanding its economic influence and potentially getting the biggest share of mineral, paper and fishing resources well into the next century.
Others worry that Japan will improperly use business ties with Chile as a back door to the North American free trade zone envisioned for Canada, Mexico and America.
"Chile has to push itself to move even closer to the Pacific Basin," Terusuke Terada, the senior officer at the Japanese Foreign Ministry in charge of Latin American affairs, said in an interview recently in Chile's leading newspaper, El Mercurio. "No other Latin American nation could do this kind of mission."
Whatever the motive, the number of deals by Japanese companies is growing almost monthly.
The Sumitomo Metal Mining Company, joined the Phelps Dodge Corporation of Phoenix in a $1.5 billion investment signed last year in La Candelaria mining project near the northern city of Copaipo, which will become a huge copper and gold mining operation. In 1991, Sumitomo, Sanyo Kokusaku of Tokyo and Chilean investors created a $57 million joint venture in land and a wood chip factory in southern Chile to export wood chips to Japan.
Last year, the giant Japanese paper concern, Daio Paper, completed an investment of $70 million for more than 160,000 acres in southern Chile, on which it is planting eucalyptus and pine. C. Itoh & Company is a 10 percent partner in the investment.
The Mitsubishi group took a 20 percent stake in the $1 billion Escondida copper mine in the North, which started producing in 1991. The company, which also owns pulp mills, was awarded a $150 million contract last year by Chile's state-owned power company, Chilgener, to build a power generating plant.
Even small Japanese companies are entering Chile.
Sakata Seed, a unit of the Nissho Iwai group of Tokyo, moved here in 1992 and is developing better strains of vegetable seeds to ship to Japan.
And Nito Seimo, a tiny maker of commercial fishing nets, transferred a third of its assets here and is selling to the local market in the northern city of Iquique.
"We have 4,000 kilometers of coast on the Pacific Basin," said Fernan Ibanez, who stepped down last month as executive director of the Government's Foreign Investment Committee. "The Japanese tell us that if it weren't for the ocean, we would be neighbors. If you just look at the growth numbers of the countries there, we have to move more in that direction."
What Japan finds attractive are Chile's big natural resources of minerals, lumber, fish and agricultural products, riches Japan sorely lacks. Also, the Japanese hope to use Chile, along with Mexico, to circumvent tariff barriers in the Latin American market and ultimately into the North American market. And the Japanese consider Chileans to be industrious, honest and concerned with quality control.
"Japan is surrounded by water and that has made us a more closed society," said Koji Mizuno, president of Mitsubishi here. "If you look at Chile, it is surrounded by water and mountains, and Chileans also tend to be a closed society. Chileans are honest, very hard workers, very shy and timid, like Japanese. Chileans are sentimental about lifetime employment and loyalty, like Japan. We are much more comfortable doing business with Chile than other countries."
Mitsubishi found in its investment in the Escondida copper mine that using Chilean contractors, the project was finished six months ahead of time and $150 million under budget.
 
A Shift for Chile, Too
 For its part, Chile, with the most robust economy in Latin America, has turned more attention to the Pacific Basin countries, particularly Japan, hoping Chile will be the "bridge" of choice for the Pacific Basin countries into Latin America.
Chile is not the only country trying to lure investment from Japan, Hong Kong and other Asian countries. Late last month, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru announced he would waive a two-year waiting list for foreigners applying for naturalization in an effort to attract skilled professionals. And Mr. Fujimori is actively negotiating with Japanese businesses on investments in Peru's privatization program.
After Mr. Fujimori's seizure of near dictatorial powers last April, the Japanese Government did not withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in vital foreign aid at a time when the rest of the international community was isolating Mr. Fujimori.
Many Chileans welcome the Japanese as good corporate citizens, noting plans by Daio paper and other Japanese to reforest 250,000 acres in southern Chile.
But some companies have recently been cutting native forests, and Japanese fishing companies are periodically accused of over-fishing the Pacific off Chile's territorial waters.
There have also been accusations of illegal purchases by Japanese of tons of locos, a large, tasty Chilean mollusk that is secretly shipped to Japan, seriously depleting an endangered shellfish.
 
Favorable Trade Balance
 Chile's balance of trade with Japan last year was a $733 million surplus, compared with a $336 million deficit with the United States. Next year, Chile will become the first Latin American country to export fresh fruit to Japan, having met the rigorous import inspection standards. A visit to Tokyo last November by President Patricio Aylwin was the first by a Chilean head of state.
The closer ties to Chile in many ways reflect a new look at all of Latin America by Japan, after many Japanese businesses suffered huge losses in 1980's when governments and corporations defaulted on loans and debt.
For years, Japan has been concentrating investment in Mexico because the country borders the huge United States market. And it has been cautiously reinvesting in Argentina, buying interests in fishing and building the luxury Cesar Park Hotel in Buenos Aires, as it waits to see whether the deep economic changes and anti-inflation policies of President Carlos Saul Menem will last.
"They are investing little by little, but I don't know if it is an investment of large scale," said Kazuo Omi, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo. "This is a time of being very conservative. They don't want to expand either in Japan or abroad. They don't want to run new risks."
 
Political Insurance
 As for Chile, the Japanese seem intent on insuring that the current political environment continues after presidential elections in December.
In an extraordinary push to the front-running candidate, Eduardo Frei, a member of the Aylwin coalition and son of a former Chilean president, the Japanese Government has invited him to visit, just months before the election, in what amounts to something just short of a presidential-style visit.
"Frei is seen as the continuation of what now exists, and that as a businessman he might bring even more ideas," said a Government official who asked not to be identified. "This is Japan trying to make sure a good formula does not change."

HEADLINE: Stephen P. Taylor, 69, Economist And Federal Reserve Statistician

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Stephen P. Taylor, an economist and a retired official of the Federal Reserve System, died last Friday at a hospital in Arlington, Va., his hometown. He was 69.
He died of injuries suffered in a fall from a bicycle, his family said. 
 Mr. Taylor worked for 32 years at the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington in the Flow of Funds and Saving Section, which he headed from 1961 until he retired in 1985.
The flow-of-funds system tries to track all significant parts of the economy, including borrowing, lending, saving and investment. Other countries have adopted the system.
Mr. Taylor integrated the statistics into a single system and was responsible for its early computerization. He also helped to develop the United Nations' national capital finance accounts, and devised a measure of private holdings of credit instruments called the Kaufman debt proxy.
 
Head of Statisticians Group
 He became assistant director of the Federal Reserve's Research and Statistics Division, and was president of the Group of Financial Statisticians of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group based in Paris.
In retirement, he was a consultant on balance-of-payments discrepancies for the International Monetary Fund, helped Indonesia on statistics for the Agency for International Development and last year joined a mission to Kyrgyzstan in the former Soviet Union for the World Bank's first report on the new nation.
Mr. Taylor was born in White Plains. He served in the Marines after graduating from Cornell University in 1944 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1949.
His first wife, Natalie, died in 1989. He is survived by his second wife, Phyllis; three daughters, Carol Taylor of Eureka, Calif., Valerie Taylor of San Rafael, Calif., and Wendy Kafka of McGrath, Minn.; a sister, Mary T. Peterman of White Plains; six grandchildren; two stepchildren, Henry D. Lockhart 3d and Melissa L. Harlow, and four stepgrandchildren.

HEADLINE: Raises at Fed Are Criticized

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, the Government agency charged with controlling inflation, has given its employees raises nearly two-thirds greater than last year's inflation rate, the chairman of the House Banking Committee said today.
In a letter of complaint to President Clinton, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, said the Fed staff members who report to the board of governors in Washington would get 4.8 percent raises this year. Employees who work for the Fed's 12 regional banks would get raises of 4.3 percent. 
 Those rates compare with an inflation rate of 2.9 percent in 1992. Wages and salaries nationally, as measured by the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index, rose just 2.7 percent last year. Other Federal employees received a 3.7 percent increase in January.
"There is a certain irony about the nation's chief inflation fighters giving themselves raises greater than the rate of inflation," Mr. Gonzalez wrote. He has introduced legislation that would bring the Fed under greater scrutiny.
Mr. Gonzalez also complained that 12 senior Fed staff members in Washington would earn $161,800 this year, considerably more than Cabinet officers, who receive $148,400, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who will earn $133,400.
In a March 11 letter to Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's salary structure was intended to retain senior employees who could draw top pay in private jobs.

HEADLINE: Strictest Curb on Smoking In U.S. Backed by Cuomo

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 14

 BODY:
Citing new information about the dangers of secondhand tobacco smoke, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed legislation today that would prohibit smoking in schools and many restaurants and prevent advertising for tobacco products on all billboards and signs.
If passed, the proposal would give New York State the toughest laws in the nation governing smoking in restaurants and advertising for tobacco products, Mr. Cuomo's aides, restaurant organizations and several anti-smoking groups said. The New York City Council and several state legislatures have already passed laws prohibiting smoking in schools. 
 But the plan is almost certain to face opposition from an array of groups, including those representing the tobacco, restaurant and advertising industries. And the New York Civil Liberties Union said today that Mr. Cuomo's proposed restrictions on advertising would be overly broad and would violate the tobacco industry's right to free speech.
"A total prohibition cannot survive constitutional scrutiny because there are less drastic alternatives that New York State has at its disposal," said Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group.
Mr. Cuomo said he was motivated largely by a recent report by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency showing that secondhand tobacco smoke causes the deaths of an estimated 3,000 nonsmokers a year and subjects hundreds of thousands of children to respiratory disease.
Mr. Cuomo has pushed tough anti-smoking proposals in the past, not always with success. Last year, a proposal to ban smoking in schools and to require the tobacco industry to help pay for anti-smoking advertisements failed in the state Senate.
 
Skepticism in Senate
 Today, leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate said they were concerned about the economic impact of Mr. Cuomo's proposal on small businesses and restaurants, particularly because the Legislature recently approved a 17-cent-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes. That increase will give New York State the highest cigarette tax in the country, 56 cents per pack.
Bill Stevens, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican from Muttontown, said a ban on signs and items advertising cigarettes could hurt sales at newsstands and candy stores. "If mom-and-pop stores are going to be hurt by the imposition of an additional 17-cent tax, is this going to further hurt them?" Mr. Stevens said. "It is one thing to sheer the sheep; it's another to simply to cut off its head."
But Mr. Cuomo said the E.P.A. study "ought to change some minds" by providing "clear proof" that children are hurt by adults' smoking.
"The Senate is very sensitive to lobbyists," he said in an interview today. "I foresee trouble whenever people with a lot of wealth who are willing to invest in lobbying efforts line up against you. That's what will happen here."
 
Broadening the Rules
 The proposal would broaden existing state restrictions on smoking in several important ways. First, it would prevent smoking inside schools and on school grounds, public or private. Current law allows adults to smoke in designated areas of schools and outside of school buildings. The proposal would also prevent smoking in a number of places frequented by children, including indoor zoos, youth centers and child-care centers.
In a provision aimed largely at fast-food restaurants and other family-style eating places, the plan would ban smoking in all restaurants that do not have full liquor licenses. And for restaurants with 50 or more seats, it would require a separate room for smokers. The current law allows for designated smoking sections.
The proposal would also prohibit smoking anywhere in public transportation terminals and food stores. And it would outlaw the sale of individual cigarettes, known as "loosies."
"This would make New York State the leader nationally on protecting the public from the dangers of secondhand smoke," said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
The proposal is expected to receive the support of the union representing most of the state's public school teachers, which could provide an important boost in the Legislature. "I'm sure there will be teachers who will be unhappy, but we are interested in people's health," said Linda Rosenblatt, spokeswoman for the New York State United Teachers.
But a spokeswoman for a tobacco industry trade association called the proposal "severe" and unconstitutional.
"I can think of no other state with regulations that are so far reaching," said Brennan Dawson of the Tobacco Institute in Washington.
Fred Sampson, president of the New York State Restaurant Association, which represents about 6,000 food businesses, said the proposal would drive customers away from businesses that prohibit smoking and create problems for larger restaurants required to build separate smoking rooms.
Esthetic concerns, for instance, might prevent restaurants such as Le Cirque and the Rainbow Room, with their grand dining rooms, from creating walled-off sections for smokers, he said.
"Cigarettes are not our business, but hospitality is," Mr. Sampson said. "We would have to enforce a law that would put us in a very uncomfortable position."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Labor Secretary's Spin On Jobs Data Lifts Eyebrows

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
At a time when the economic outlook is confused and the President's economic stimulus package faces opposition, it should come as no surprise that the Clinton Administration is eager to put its own spin on politically charged economic statistics.
Most administrations do. 
 But a recent episode at the Labor Department has touched off much clucking within the economics community and within the department itself.
 
 
An Inconvenient Fact
 On March 5, just half an hour before the acting commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics was due to testify on February employment statistics, Labor Secretary Robert Reich held his own special news conference. The February figures showed that the economy had created 365,000 new jobs in February, the biggest monthly gain in years -- a politically inconvenient fact for an Administration fighting for a big new jobs program.
The commissioner's testimony was fairly upbeat. In contrast, Mr. Reich maintained that while there were job gains in February, they did not make the stimulus program redundant because "90 percent of the new jobs that have been created are in involuntary part time, that is, the contingent work force."
This claim took many of the economists in his agency by surprise. As it turns out, there was no way for anyone to know what proportion of the payroll jobs were part-time, since the Labor Department simply does not ask businesses whether their payroll jobs are full- or part-time when it surveys them each month.
But Mr. Reich and his chief economist, Lawrence Katz, a labor economist from Harvard University, derived the 90 percent statistic by going to a second Government survey, the so-called household survey by the Census Bureau, which asks individuals whether they worked in the previous month and, if so, whether they worked full time or part time.
But that survey produces totally separate data, and conclusions drawn from that data cannot be applied to the business payroll survey; for a variety of reasons, trends in one do not necessarily track trends in the other.
But that is what Mr. Reich and Mr. Katz did. They took the one-month jump in the number of Americans who said they were employed part time because they could not find full-time jobs, and applied it to that month's increase in the total number of Americans who said that they had jobs in February.
Their 90 percent figure was picked up by major news organizations and widely repeated as fact for weeks afterward.
The fact that the Labor Secretary had put out such a statistic created a furor among the department's career economists and statisticians. They drafted an internal memorandum -- for use in answering telephone queries -- to explain why one could not conclude what Mr. Reich had concluded from the data.
"The rise in total employment may have been largely persons working part time for economic reasons, or it could have been all new full-time workers," the internal memo said. "We are unable to explicitly link the two movements."
 
 
Volatile Data
 What many of these economists and statisticians recognized is that the part-time data are extremely volatile from month to month, and that the rise in February was a blip that followed a sharp move in the opposite direction the previous month.
As the department's internal memorandum put it: "The trend over approximately the last year and a half has been flat, at a level of about 6.4 million even with periodic sharp monthly fluctuations (like this month for instance)."
Mr. Katz, for one, now admits that the calculation was indeed an error. "The notion that a lot of jobs created in this recovery are temporary and part time is an accurate perception," he said. But in using the 90 percent figure, he continued, "we made a mistake."
Economists outside the Labor Department were also quick to attack the Labor Secretary's calculations.
"How come they didn't say in the previous month that there was a big decline and this was a monthly blip?" asked Marvin Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, who had been chosen by President Bush to be the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics had he won re-election.
And Steven Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley, called the Labor Secretary's approach "shenanigans."
 
 
'Cooking the Numbers'
 "It smacks of cooking the numbers when it's convenient to do so, but walking away from reality when it doesn't fit the script," Mr. Roach said. "It's unconscionable for a Cabinet level department at a critical juncture."
Some economists, however, said the episode reminded them of the time in 1971, during the Nixon Administration, when the Labor Secretary canceled the traditional briefing by the economist in charge of the monthly employment report. Instead, the secretary issued his own rosy interpretation of some disappointing statistics. At that time, in 1971, much like today, unemployment was proving particularly stubborn.
 
Changing Course
 In any case, Mr. Reich did not use the same approach this month, when the March jobs data were released.
"Using his methodology, the economy would have created 255,000 full-time jobs in March," said Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley, pointing out that such an inference would have been ridiculous, though no more so than the contrary claim of the prior month.
Indeed, an April 2 public statement released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics sets the record straight from the Labor Department's perspective. Involuntary part-time employment, it said, has bobbed around the same level for a year and a half. And 25 percent -- not 90 percent -- of the payroll jobs created in the last year or so have sprouted in temporary help firms. And finally, it said, despite no further gains on either the unemployment or jobs-creation fronts in March, "the general trend in recent months has been one of slow improvement."

HEADLINE: Outside the Gates, Losing A Definition of Security

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, April 14

 BODY:
The manufacturing operation at the Pratt & Whitney headquarters here is known as the mother plant, the oldest and largest of Pratt & Whitney factories. The jet engines that rolled out of its bays led the world in aviation technology.
Over the last decade, company employees have grown accustomed to layoff notices. Today, they had to absorb the most shocking news of all: The plant itself may have to close, with a loss of 2,200 jobs. 
 Under the plan, administrative offices, engineering and experimental testing would remain open at a down-scaled headquarters operation here. Manufacturing would continue at other sites.
For Herbert Nolan, a 37-year-old machinist who has worked at the plant for 20 years, the news was unthinkable.
 
Once, Real Job Security
 "When I got out of high school, my uncle said, 'Get over to East Hartford,' " Mr. Nolan recalled, nursing a beer at Hockanum Restaurant, near the main gate of the plant. " 'If you have a job there,' he told me, 'you are set for life. Between Government contracts and commercial contracts, there will always be work.' "
Now, he said, people with 25 or 30 years' experience are being let go. "People are afraid to go out to dinner with their families, let alone buy a car," he said. "It's too risky."
Mr. Nolan was one of six patrons at the vast U-shaped bar at 3:30 this afternoon, the hour when the morning shift ends and the evening shift begins. The scene at the bar told part of the story.
"In our heyday, there was a line out the door and it was three deep at the bar," said the bartender, Jamie Valbona. It's not just that they don't come in anymore, she said; "There aren't many left."
James Parent, a spokesman for the union that represents most of the workers in the plant, said that he had seen the plant shrink from 22,000 when he was hired in 1965 to about 2,200 today.
The union, District 91 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, announced that it would do everything it could to keep the plant open, but employees leaving the gate after the morning shift were not hopeful.
"People are scared in there," said Lisa Biveinis, a secretary who has been with the company three years. "Everybody's wondering what's going to happen. I'm thinking about getting my resume in shape. I don't want to wait until they lay me off."
But another employee said that some last-minute agreement or change in the economy might yet save the plant. "This is kind of like the New England weather," said Norman Pietruska, an engineer with Pratt & Whitney for 10 years. "You never know what's coming."
Few expressed bitterness toward the company. At the bar, Mr. Nolan ticked off the names of many relatives who had enjoyed long and steady careers with Pratt & Whitney: three uncles, two aunts and numerous cousins. Still he said that he expected a layoff notice soon. "When I get it," he said, "I plan to open my own business. That way I know I won't get laid off."
At an East Hartford automobile dealership on Connecticut Boulevard, two salesman sympathized with the families of Pratt employees.
"They've worked there, their fathers worked there, their fathers' fathers worked there," said Roger Donzello, "and now, not to have a there is a terrible, emotional thing."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
HILTON HOTELS CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Hilton Hotels Corporation, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., reported a 19 percent increase yesterday in its first-quarter net income, to $26.5 million, or 55 cents a share. The earnings were in line with analysts' expectations of 50 to 60 cents a share. But before the cumulative effect of accounting changes, the earnings were equivalent to 48 cents a share, a bit less than the analysts had forecast.
The company adopted two accounting changes at the beginning of the year, one for income taxes, which lifted net income by $8 million, and one for retirees' benefits, which resulted in a charge of $4.6 million after a deferred tax benefit of $2.3 million. 
 Operating income rose 13 percent to $54.6 million, from $48.5 million a year earlier.
"Our gaming segment continues to perform well," said Barron Hilton, chairman and chief executive, "while results from the hotels division are down slightly," hampered by overbuilding and the weak economy. The gaming division's operating income increased 18 percent to $48.3 million in the quarter, from $40.8 million a year earlier. The hotel division's operating income slipped 3 percent to $12.8 million, from $13.2 million.

First Fidelity to Buy Peoples Bank

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Continuing an aggressive expansion campaign, the First Fidelity Bancorp, based in Lawrenceville, N.J., said yesterday that it would acquire Peoples Westchester Savings Bank, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., for $233 million in cash and stock.
The offer price, of either $43.90 in cash or 0.8693 share in First Fidelity, was considered disappointing by some analysts since it did not offer a premium to Peoples' stock prices. 
 Shares of Peoples Westchester fell $2.25 in Nasdaq trading yesterday, to $41. Peoples had turned down an offer of $30 a share from an investor group in January. First Fidelity closed at $50.125 yesterday, down 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Peoples Westchester was down because the deal was struck very close to the current market, and recent speculation had the price much higher," said Frank R. DeSantis Jr., an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. "And on First Fidelity, for right or for wrong, the market is taking a show-me attitude. Any time you close a deal where you issue stock, you create near-term uncertainty about the effect on earnings per share."
 
Bank Supports Deal
 The sale needs approval from regulators and shareholders of Peoples Westchester, whose management said it would support the First Fidelity offer.
First Fidelity has been expanding broadly over the last year and a half, becoming one of the nation's fastest-growing regional banks, with $30 billion in assets making it the 25th-largest bank holding company in the country.
Yesterday's move, combined with the purchase of Village Financial Services of Port Chester, N.Y., and several American Savings Bank branches, makes First Fidelity the second-biggest bank in the Westchester market behind the Bank of New York.
Anthony P. Terracciano, chairman and chief executive, said more expansion was likely. "I'd like to see the franchise stretch from Boston down to Baltimore if that's possible," he said.
First Fidelity reported on Tuesday that its first-quarter net income increased 41 percent to $95 million, or $1.12 a share.
Peoples Westchester, a $1.8 billion savings bank with 32 Westchester County offices, has done well despite the economic downturn in the Northeast. It has been discussed as a takeover prospect at least since the beginning of the year.
Nancy A. Bush of Brown Brothers Harriman said "there was nothing about this deal to hate." She also said further acquisitions were to be expected from First Fidelity.
"Their weakest link right now is Bergen County, which is an area they're quite interested in, and I'm sure they're scouting out deals there," she said. "They will continue to consolidate their ring around New York City, in the more affluent commuter suburbs, where they cannot only emphasize lending, but also private banking and trust services."

Shares Drop As Goodrich Reports Loss

BYLINE: JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company reported a $7.6 million first-quarter loss yesterday, a surprise that led to heavy morning selling of its stock. Its shares tumbled $3.125, to $44.875, in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange but later partly recovered to close at $46.875, off $1.125.
The loss was far deeper than the operating loss of $1.9 million reported in the first quarter of 1992, when a $286.5 million charge for adopting a new accounting standard for retiree health-care benefits resulted in a net loss of $288.4 million. First-quarter sales fell 1.4 percent, to $596.8 million, from $605.3 million a year earlier. 
 Leonard Bogner, senior chemical analyst at Prudential Securities, called the results "a major disappointment."
"We saw a loss, but this is worse" than expected, Mr. Bogner said.
The loss was equivalent to 38 cents a share, compared with a forecast loss of 10 to 15 cents a share. For the year, Mr. Bogner sees "an orderly pattern of real earnings," with a sharp bounce back in the second quarter.
 
Subsidiary Turns Around
 Goodrich, based in Akron, Ohio, provides aircraft systems, components and services and manufactures a wide range of specialty chemicals.
Its subsidiary, the Geon Company, makes compounds used in construction products, business machine components and appliance parts. That business turned around in the quarter, reporting an operating income of $2.2 million, in contrast to a loss of $500,000 a year earlier.
Goodrich said it planned to offer 50 percent of Geon's stock to the public and to use the proceeds to expand its aerospace and specialty chemicals businesses.
One reason for the selloff on Wall Street yesterday morning, Mr. Bogner said, was "disenchantment on the part of analysts that they are selling it off" at this stage.
 
Rebound Expected
 Many people had been following the company "in expectation of an up-cycle in chemicals," he said, especially the commodity chemicals represented by Geon. The two other businesses are underperforming, he said.
The aerospace segment had operating income of $16.6 million in the quarter, down from a record $22.7 million a year earlier, when the Persian Gulf war lifted sales. The specialty chemicals business essentially broke even for the quarter, the company said, down from operating income of $5.4 million a year ago.
John D. Ong, the company chairman, said: "Our aerospace businesses continue to meet our expectations, and we should achieve record income this year for the 10th consecutive year. Many of our specialty chemicals businesses also performed well during the quarter, but results for the segment over all continue to be hurt by weak demand in construction-related markets and by generally poor economic conditions in Canada and Europe."

Yields of Money Funds Off As Inflation Worries Ease

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were down in the latest week, reflecting some easing of investor fears about inflation, according to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
Tax-exempt money fund yields fell sharply in the week that ended Tuesday. The IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 9 basis points, to 1.89 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield also down 9 basis points, to 1.86 percent. The 30-day average compounded yield is 1.94 percent and the simple yield 1.92 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. 
 Not including state and local taxes, the taxable bond equivalent for the average seven-day yield is about 2.63 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket and about 2.74 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
 
Outflow Considered Small
 Tax-exempt fund assets fell $326 million to $103.5 billion. The outflow was considered small, said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at The Money Fund Report. Lower yields elsewhere kept more money from flowing out, he said.
Money fund managers elected to hold their tax-exempt positions, and the average days left to maturity of securities held in portfolios was unchanged, at 50, for the second consecutive week.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, The Money Fund Report said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund was the top performer this week, with a yield of 2.58 percent, down 4 basis points from last week's best.
Assets of taxable money market funds rose by $1 billion in the week ended yesterday, to a total of $483.5 billion, with assets of institutional funds up by $2.1 billion, and retail assets down by $1.1 billion.
The money moving out of retail funds is probably coming out for tax purposes, among other things, analysts at The Money Fund Report said.
 
Higher Yields Sought
 Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios rose to 62, from 60, as managers sought higher yields in the longer maturities.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund slipped 3 basis points, to 2.68 percent, with the seven-day simple yield also down 3 basis points, to 2.64 percent.
Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the highest return among general purpose taxable money funds, with a yield of 3.47 percent.
For the purpose of comparison, banks are offering an average yield of 2.59 percent. The yield is down a basis point from a week earlier.

Dollar Edges Up as Talks Open Among the Group of 7

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced modestly but broadly yesterday in trading driven mostly by technical factors. The trading occurred as finance ministers of seven of the world's leading industrial nations began a two-day meeting in Tokyo.
The meeting of representatives of the Group of Seven served "as a background deterrent to selling the dollar," particularly against the Japanese yen, said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. 
 Mr. Donney said there were unconfirmed reports that the group was working on an agreement to support the dollar against the Japanese yen, should the American currency fall sharply.
 
Fine-Tuning the Yen
 The United States and many of Japan's other trading partners have advocated a stronger yen to combat trade imbalances by raising the foreign prices of Japanese goods, and the yen has advanced about 10 percent in the last three months.
"But that hasn't done anything to help the trade imbalance," Mr. Donney said. On Tuesday, Tokyo announced an economic-stimulus package that had elements intended to help trim the huge trade surplus with the United States.
"The market is just bracing itself for what comes out of the G-7 meeting," Mr. Donney said. The week will culminate in President Clinton's meeting in Washington tomorrow with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan.
 
German Sales Down Sharply
 The German mark was depressed by a report that retail sales there plunged 8 percent in February compared with those a year ago. The British pound gained against other European currencies, as London reported a 1.6 percent jump in industrial production for the month of February.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 113.47 yen, up 0.14 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 113.90 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 113.88 yen, up from 113.40 yen on Tuesday.
The pound fell in London to $1.5520 from $1.5591 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.5515 to buy a pound, down from Tuesday's $1.5580.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday rates, included: 1.5935 German marks, up from 1.5820; 1.4590 Swiss francs, up from 1.4475; 5.3885 French francs, up from 5.3495; 1,544 Italian lire, up from 1,524, and 1.2630 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2615.

HEADLINE: Stormy Caterpillar Meeting

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., April 14

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. and angry union members sparred orally today as company officers tried to convince shareholders that long-term prospects were bright despite 1992 losses.
At an annual meeting held under heavy security, Caterpillar's chairman, Donald V. Fites, said the company had to reach a labor contract that recognized a global marketplace. 
 A five-month strike by 11,000 United Auto Workers union members ended April 14, 1992, after Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., threatened to hire replacement workers. The employees have since been working without a contract. At the meeting, both sides said they were ready to resume bargaining, but neither indicated that would happen soon.
Mr. Fites was peppered with remarks and questions from U.A.W. members. The "vast majority" of Caterpillar union members want a chance to vote on the company's last contract proposal, he told shareholders and union members.
Because of a three-year $1.8 billion factory modernization program and management changes, Mr. Fites said, Caterpillar is poised to show a profit when the United States and world economies rebound. In 1992, it lost $2.43 billion after adopting new accounting standards for post-retirement benefits and deferred income taxes. Without the accounting changes, it would have shown a loss of $190 million, compared with a loss of $404 million after charges in 1991.

HEADLINE: Wallace Stegner Is Dead at 84; Pulitzer Prize-Winning Author

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Wallace Stegner, the novelist and short-story writer whose work celebrated the American West and won him the country's highest literary awards, died on Tuesday night at St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 84 and lived in Los Altos Hills, Calif.
The cause of death was respiratory failure, said Lynn Stegner, his daughter-in-law. On March 28, Mr. Stegner was seriously injured in a traffic accident in Santa Fe, where he had gone to give a lecture. 
 In a literary career that covered more than 50 years and produced more than two dozen novels, historical works and collections of stories and essays, Mr. Stegner found the Western frontier spirit of boundless optimism receding. But he saw in its place, as he once expressed it, "a respect for the heroic virtues: fortitude, resolution, magnanimity."
 
The Potential for Dignity
 His preoccupation with these upbeat qualities separated Mr. Stegner's writing from the despair and alienation in the work of many of his contemporaries. His characters seem propelled by the author's conviction "that man, even Modern Man, has some dignity if he will assume it, and that most lives are worth living even when they are lives of quiet desperation."
To appreciate the West, he once remarked, "You have to get over the color green; you have to quit associating beauty with gardens and lawns; you have to get used to an inhuman scale."
He also turned upside down the stereotypical characters of the West: the barroom beauties with hearts of gold and the lean, heroic cowboys in their chaps and Stetsons. In "Remembering Laughter," he portrayed two sisters who are a complex mixture of youthful exuberance, penance and hatred; in "All the Little Live Things" (1967) and later in "The Spectator Bird" (1976), the recurring character Joe Allston, a fearful retired literary agent, struggles to extricate himself from a tragic past.
 
'The New World's Last Chance'
 "The West does not need to explore its myths much further; it has already relied on them too long," he told a reporter in 1981. "The West is politically reactionary and exploitative: admit it. The West as a whole is guilty of inexplicable crimes against the land: admit that, too. The West is rootless, culturally half-baked. So be it."
Despite all this, he continued, the West remains "the New World's last chance to be something better, the only American society still malleable enough to be formed."
He won the 1972 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for "Angle of Repose," a novel about an elderly, sickly man who learns to accept his anguish when he studies the lives of his grandparents and realizes that their lives, too, left much to be desired.
In 1977, he won a National Book Award for "The Spectator Bird." His work has been nominated several times for the National Book Critics Circle Awards, including this year for a 1992 collection of essays, "Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs: Living and Writing in the West."
 
Dream of the Easy Life
 Among his most popular novels was "The Big Rock Candy Mountain" (1943), a semiautobiographical work in which two sons learn to cope with life by coming to understand their father's failings. When Mr. Stegner was a child, his father had shuttled the family from North Dakota to the state of Washington, and from Saskatchewan to Montana and Utah, pursuing the dream of an easy life that was always just out of reach. The book's title is taken from the hobo song about an imaginary land where life is never less than ideal.
An important theme of that and other works was the fragility of the environment. In an essay for The Saturday Review in 1964, Mr. Stegner compared the way Americans were learning about the environment to the cracker-barrel joke about the boy who twisted the mule's tail and "isn't as pretty as he once was, but knows more."
"There is nothing in the history of the West that indicates any great concern for the environment or for the renewability and sustainability of the economy," he said in an interview last year. "Nor for the labor force used in that exploitation. Those are all serious mistakes."
His "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian" is a biography of John Wesley Powell, who explored the Colorado River. "Wolf Willow" is a history of Saskatchewan.
Another significant nonfiction work was "One Nation" (1945), a collection of photographs illustrating the corrosive effect of racial prejudice in the United States. The book was a co-winner of the Anisfield-Wolfe Award for the best book of the year on race relations.
 
A Teaching Career
 Besides writing and editing, Mr. Stegner had a long career as a teacher of creative writing and literature at the University of Utah, the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University and Stanford University, where he was the director of the Creative Writing Center from 1945 until his retirement in 1971.
His students at Stanford included a number who went on to become notable writers, including Larry McMurtry.
Wallace Earle Stegner was born on Feb. 18, 1909, in Lake Mills, Iowa, the son of Scandinavian immigrants. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Utah in 1930, a master's degree from the University of Iowa in 1932 and a doctorate from Iowa in 1935.
He then taught English at the University of Utah, and began his literary career in earnest after winning a $2,500 Little, Brown novelette contest in 1937 with "Remembering Laughter," a tale about an adulterous triangle in Iowa farm country.
In addition to his daughter-in-law, he is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Page Stegner, who is a novelist and professor of American literature and creative writing at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Where Artifacts Find Shelter After Many Storms

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN

 BODY:
THEY live in an uncluttered six-room apartment in Manhattan with their two children, a pair of green shutters, a few well-worn porch columns and a sprinkling of weather vanes, cast-iron urns and hand-painted signs. All of which -- except the children -- are the pillars and posts of a decorating style that also encompasses salt-glazed crockery, wooden building blocks, primitive paintings and twig rockers.
But that was last week. Don't expect the same things to be there from one day to the next. Judith and James Milne are antiques dealers who specialize in folk art and quilts but also have a predilection for architectural fragments like stair banisters, roof finials and arched windows that they call "bits of history." 
 On buying trips north to New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont, south to the Maryland shore and west to the Ohio River Valley for their East Side shop, they often fall for eight-foot-high trellises, patinated garden gates and louvers with more peeling paint than not. And when the items don't sell, the Milnes take them home. "I usually give things a few weeks, sometimes even a few months," Mrs. Milne said. "If no one wants them, I don't feel guilty taking them home."
Mrs. Milne has a penchant for objects whose surfaces are witness to years of rugged weather. As far as Mr. Milne is concerned, the distressed surfaces so much in vogue these days are nothing new. "Even in the 20's, a core of collectors appreciated furniture in its original condition," he said.
But that may not have included barn doors, fan lights and screen doors that are now having a reincarnation indoors.
"Architectural elements have come into their own in the last five years," Mr. Milne added. "Old columns, for example, are not a lot of money in comparison to what it would cost to have them handmade." (The Milnes' weather-beaten wooden columns start at $375 each, in the shop.)
"You bring this stuff in and create your own atmosphere," Mrs. Milne said. A shutter, for example, "can look romantic, country, even Gothic."
The Milnes seem to have profited from, and may even have been instrumental in jump-starting, the kind of decorating in which a trellis is displayed on its side above the mantelpiece and a finial rests on the coffee table. They have been in the antiques business about 20 years, and although the nature of their wares has changed -- more furniture and paintings and fewer quilts -- their tables, chairs, pedestals and mirrors are still usually in transit somewhere between their shop and their apartment. And sometimes back again.
Mrs. Milne relishes the memory of how aghast her husband's colleagues looked when the sofa they were sitting on in the Milnes' apartment was whisked out from under them.
The shop, called Judith and James Milne, is situated at 506 East 74th Street (East River Drive).
Before getting into antiques, Mrs. Milne was in the garment industry for 10 years, buying and selling fabrics. "With textiles, I knew what was old and what was new," she said. "Quilts were one area I couldn't be tricked in."
So, when she decided about 20 years ago that she wanted to work from home, buying and selling antique quilts seemed right. Her husband, then a manager for a pharmaceutical company, had just been moved to Indianapolis from New York.
"I wouldn't move out there," Mrs. Milne said of the city whose claim to fame, she said, "was its large number of war memorials." So, Mr. Milne went alone. And Mrs. Milne, her mother and her 2-month-old son, Greg, had plenty of time to drive around looking for quilts.
One Monday morning about six months later, Mr. Milne called home and said, "How would you like to pick up your unemployed husband at the airport?"
"Jim decided he hated the Midwest and corporate life," his wife said. Instead of looking for another job in the pharmaceutical field, Mr. Milne joined his wife.
As their business grew, she continued her quest for quilts. He became more interested in furniture. And they both looked for folk art pieces. "We learned by osmosis," he said, adding that buying and selling the folk art pieces eventually became "a whole life style."
Before their children were old enough for school, they were taken along. Greg, now 16, would collect baseball cards; their daughter, Rebekah, now 12, doll furniture. "That gave them the incentive to come with us," Mr. Milne said.
The Milnes' social life revolved around people in the same business. During the week they would be at their shop. On weekends they would be out looking for merchandise or tending a booth at an antique show. "It's 18 hours a day, seven days a week," Mr. Milne said.
Now, they have a system. "I do the schlepping and take care of the financial aspects," he said. He also does 95 percent of the driving. "She does the buying and selling," he added of his wife. "Timewise, it works out pretty evenly."
For 13 years, the Milnes have lived in an apartment on Fifth Avenue in the 90's with a glorious view of the reservoir in Central Park. Two years ago they renovated the space, moving and opening up the kitchen, getting rid of the formal dining room, painting all the walls white and installing track lighting.
In the living room most of the furnishings are in a more or less stable holding pattern.
The folk art pieces look particularly graphic displayed against white walls.
One wooden cow weather vane from about 1880 (priced at $6,500 when it stood in the shop) is poised atop a modern white cabinet. The effect is exceptionally fetching when a remote control lifts into view a television set that is often tuned to Mr. Milne's favorite station, the Weather Channel.
A rustic chair made from craggy rhododendron branches stands in a corner, its original paint flaking nicely. "I took it to an antiques show for a weekend," Mrs. Milne said. "No one bought it, so I brought it home."
A similar fate attended the green shutters that hang over the sofa. "I always wanted to take them home from the shop," Mrs. Milne said. "But I needed merchandise for a show." So the shutters went to a show on a Manhattan pier. "Everyone loved them; no one bought them," she added.
And what about a four-foot-tall country-store barrel that dates from the 1860's? "Six months at the store and I suggested to dozens of people how to use it," Mrs. Milne said. No one was convinced. Now, it's in the corner of the Milnes' living room and filled with firewood.
"We're not like Syms, where things are marked down," Mr. Milne said.
Mrs. Milne added: "We price the things based on what we paid for them, not what the market will bear. And we don't change the prices either when we bring them home or take them back to the store."
But as sure as spring follows winter, as soon as a bench, cupboard or sign is out of the shop, a customer calls. "That's when they really want it," Mrs. Milne said. "And sometimes it's too late, because we've gotten attached."
A pair of painted duck andirons sat unsold at the shop for three months. Now, they sit in the fireplace. "They're my favorites," Mrs. Milne said.
There are exceptions to the Milnes' special kind of recycling. The two sets of columns that frame the foyer and the fireplace, for example. "They're 19th-century columns from a New England porch," Mrs. Milne said. "We nailed them into the wall. They're not going anywhere."
Neither are the pieces that literally have their names on them. A salt-glazed stoneware crock that is emblazoned with a blue "J" and "M" was a birthday present to Mr. Milne from his wife about 15 years ago.
And over the door to their daughter's room is a graceful wooden arch with "The Rebekah Rooms" carved into it. "It's from a hotel in Saratoga, N.Y.," Mrs. Milne said. "But it's also exactly the way she spells her name."
Then there is the huge sign on the wall across from the open kitchen and near the large dining table: "Lunch Room." The sign, which originally came from Connecticut, spent a year in the Milnes' shop. "When we redid our apartment, we had just the right place for it," Mrs. Milne said.
"Don't you just love it?" she continued.
"Yes, yes," was the answer, along with the sense that as far as these antiques dealers are concerned, nothing, attached to the wall or not, is forever.

HEADLINE: Upstairs, Downstairs: A Way to Manage Both

BYLINE: By JULIE LEW

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
WHEN Mark O'Connell decided to change careers, he never thought he would have to learn how to balance glasses on his head or to pack trousers without wrinkling them.
But those were among the skills he gained in an intense 10-day immersion in the world of household management taught by Ivor Spencer, who many in England believe has breathed new life into the grand old profession of being a butler. 
 At the Ivor Spencer International School for Housemen here, the American branch of Mr. Spencer's International Agency for Butlers and Housemen in London, Mr. O'Connell, 34, previously a poster salesman, was transformed from man to manservant. "I'd thought about going into this field, but I never knew there was a school for it," he said.
Now, there is. The $3,000 houseman course, which was established in February and will be offered six times a year, alternating between San Francisco and Los Angeles, covers such essentials as answering the telephone properly, coping discreetly with an employer's sleep-over guest the morning after, organizing a party, serving tea, matching wines with food, cleaning antiques and packing a suitcase. (Tip: To keep pants unwrinkled, use a suitcase that is wide enough so they will have to be folded only once; then stuff tissue paper into the fold).
If polishing up such skills sounds a bit too pompous, and therefore unrealistic, for the back-to-basics, low-key 90's, the job market indicates otherwise. The weekend after graduating, Mr. O'Connell packed for a flight to Dallas for a job interview (paid for by the prospective employer). Three other employment possibilities are on the horizon in case that one falls through, he said.
"A lot of people feel that a butler is too grand for them or too expensive," said Mr. Spencer, who trained butlers for the Duke and Duchess of York, King Hussein of Jordan and Rupert Murdoch. "But there is a big market for housemen. A lot of couples work all day long today. When they come home, a meal will be ready, messages taken, the shopping looked after, the cleaning done, the dogs walked."
All this for those who have $20,000, plus room and board and medical benefits, to spare for such help. (Butlers will set you back $35,000 or more, and they don't clean house.)
Most housemen, the American equivalent of the English housekeeper, are not trained, Mr. Spencer said.
"When they come to the door, they shuffle," he said. "They're not clean." They may not know what kind of voice to use to address a guest (an octave lower than normal) or the proper attitude (nice but not overpowering).
Mr. Spencer, who is 59 and as English as a palace guard, wants to rectify that, using the same fastidious methods he used in modernizing the butler's profession.
"We want the person, when they walk to the door, to have a presence," he said. "We want the visitor or the guest to really see somebody who looks immaculate. We clean our teeth 10 or 12 times a day. We shower twice a day. There's nothing worse than body odor or bad breath when somebody is serving you. He manicures his nails. What's the sense of having lovely food, a beautifully set table, but his hands are dirty?"
James Swan, who manages the San Francisco branch and teaches the courses here and in Los Angeles, said that since the course was established, he had received a call a day from prospective employers around the country asking if graduates were available.
"The demand is exceeding our supply," said Mr. Swan, a San Francisco interior designer and a graduate of Mr. Spencer's butler course. "These are people who lead very demanding lives and who believe they have to have appropriate staff on hand to manage a house for them."
Mr. Swan said he worked hard to counter the impression that houseman -- or household manager, as the job is also known -- is a man's job. "We're fighting the Jeeves-the-butler image," he said. "We think it's a career opportunity for women, too." But he said few women have taken up the challenge. "Perhaps women feel they don't need to study up to be a household manager," he said. "Maybe they think that's the role society already expects of them."
Mary Starkey, the founder of the Starkey International Institute for Household Management, in Denver, the only other school in the country that trains high-level household managers, said that despite the recession, demand had grown steadily for her graduates since she started her program in 1990.
"I get about 60 phone calls a week from all over," she said. She attributed the growing appetite for highly trained household help to a desire by working couples to have not only dual careers but also a well-run home.
"We have proved that if you hire a household manager, that manager will save you 20 percent in what the average family pays for convenience food, cleaning service and other extras," she said. "And the quality of life doubles." Ms. Starkey has operated a placement service for household managers for 12 years.
Mr. Spencer's lessons are taught through role-playing and with such techniques as balancing wine glasses on the head to encourage proper posture. He also likes to throw out hypothetical problems to students. For example, one sticky situation might arise in the bedroom in the morning.
"One of the pair is out of town," he explained. "You knock at the door, you go in and you see a strange face on the pillow. What do you do?"
First, he said, you should not stare. "Ignore that person. You place the tray with the morning paper and breakfast on the master's side of the bed. Draw the curtains. You go out and prepare a duplicate drink and place it on the master's side of the bed." You do not speak to the strange face unless it speaks to you.
In another lesson, Mr. Spencer emphasizes the importance of keeping notes on everything you need to know to run the household smoothly. The efficient houseman will note down the likes and dislikes of regular guests, the employers' favorite hotels, the wines served on a certain special occasion, the name of a favorite maitre d'hotel, birthdays and the family's clothing sizes.
In short, the houseman will do everything a butler does and more, and for a smaller salary. Which is not to say that butlers are an endangered species. "Seriously rich people who've got apartments in New York and a home in the country still think of butlers as a big status symbol," Mr. Spencer said.
One big difference between butlers and housemen is their styles. "A butler wears a uniform, and a houseman wears a white shirt, navy tie and black pants, and a jacket for dinner service," he explained. "If they were both working together, you would notice the butler has more style in serving, more of a touch of theater."
The houseman also does more cleaning and cooking. "A butler is a person who usually runs a home with a staff of two or three," Mr. Spencer said. "He may clean the silver, but he won't do toilets."
Today's butlers are also different from those of the past. When Mr. Spencer started his agency in 1981, there were only 70 butlers left in England, he said. Early in this century, there were 30,000, but most became casualties of huge inheritance taxes that their employers' children could not afford to pay. The estates were sold and a generation of Jeeves es was let go.
Although he was never a butler, he learned the art of graciousness and service as a chef and an accomplished caterer, and through his 38 years as a toastmaster, Mr. Spencer said. He also founded a guild of professional toastmasters in England.
"I was able to easily teach how to become a butler, and I was able to change things," he recalled. "I wanted all the lovely qualities of the old butler: discreet, affectionate, friendly but not familiar, immaculate, and he served beautifully. But the old butlers didn't manage. Now, we purchase everything for the house. We book travel, plan menus. We're executives today. Some are spending more money running a home than it takes an executive to run a small business."
Mr. Spencer and Ms. Starkey have found that would-be butlers and household managers come from all walks of life, from headmaster to pilot to biologist.
"Some things you do are very mundane, some fascinating," Mr. Spencer said. "But it's very lovely to become part of someone's life. You truly miss it when you retire."

When to Forgive and Forget

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Let's say it's authentic -- the document found in old Soviet archives in which a North Vietnamese general says Hanoi held three times the number of U.S. prisoners of war it had acknowledged to Washington. Suppose, further, that Hanoi killed the P.O.W.'s to destroy the evidence.
It would be a nightmare. It would confirm all our worst fears about North Vietnamese brutality and malice. Yet it would still leave open the wrenching question of what U.S. policy toward Vietnam should be now, 18 years this month after Marine helicopters swooped down onto U.S. Embassy rooftops in Saigon to rescue the last American diplomats from advancing Communist troops. 
 The question applies not only to Vietnam but to a host of other "outlaw" states, terrorist or dying Communist regimes whose cardinal sins lie in a steadily receding past and some of which now profess good behavior. Namely, Iraq, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Cuba.
There are no good answers. There are only gut feelings, risks, political pressures and imperfect guidelines.
Washington's policy has been to pressure, punish, isolate and even oust outlaw leaders. But increasingly, other nations are refusing to join these enterprises. Increasingly they are forgiving and forgetting and getting on with the business of making money. They argue that the best way to transform bad guys into tolerable guys is not to isolate them but to deal with them.
The U.S. itself has used just such "conversion" arguments to justify exceptions to its own policy. Washington stroked Janos Kadar, who held power in Budapest by pulling out fingernails, and thus helped bring Hungary around to mild "goulash socialism." By refusing to break with the "butchers of Tiananmen," President Bush aided some Chinese economic reformers. Most notably, Washington never gave up trying to create common interests with a hostile and dangerous Soviet Union.
Today, the Clinton Administration courts President Assad, terrorist and mass killer, hoping to coax Syria toward moderation. Even Israel, ever aware of Jewish blood spilled by Damascus, now eagerly seeks peace with its sworn enemy.
How to decide when to engage and when to stiff-arm an old adversary?
Size and power count, but not always. The U.S. talked arms control and commerce with Moscow throughout the cold war, but tried to isolate Beijing for over 20 years.
Hard-headed balance-of-power considerations are not always decisive either. The U.S. now sees Iran as a greater threat in the Persian Gulf than Iraq. Yet it won't build up Baghdad as a counterweight as long as Saddam Hussein hangs around. But is Saddam a badder guy than Assad?Washington won't open the door to Vietnam either, though it could help balance off future Chinese power.
Even powerful business interests have been largely unsuccessful over the years in persuading Washington to go easier on outlaws. Other nations have been stealing the march on markets in Iran, Libya and Vietnam -- and still Washington won't budge on trade restrictions.
Most often, the decision to spurn an outlaw state comes down to U.S. politics. For many reasons, including many good reasons, most Americans want no part of Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Iranian ayatollahs, Muammar Qaddafi or any North Vietnamese leaders who fought against the U.S. The feelings are too raw and too bitter. These guys harmed Americans. And few politicians will risk moving counter to these feelings -- even when U.S. strategic interests call for direct contacts and deals.
There are generally only two ways around this problem. One is for the bad guys to die. Americans would then be willing to work with successors. The other is for the bad guys to admit their misdeeds.
Public confession sounds silly to foreigners. But it isn't, especially not to Americans. It's very hard to trust anyone tomorrow who denies yesterday's proven sins. Confession isn't everything -- and maybe Washington needs to do a little of its own. But honesty can start the process of reconciliation.
In the case of Vietnam, U.S. economic and strategic interests will eventually dictate a new relationship. Whether this happens sooner or later depends on Vietnamese leaders, on their willingness finally to clear the air over American P.O.W.'s.

HEADLINE: My 'Middle-Class' Family Lives From Paycheck to Paycheck

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the Federal Government considers a national sacrifice economic plan, I wonder if Beltway politicians truly understand the daily middle-class plight. I wish one of them would spend a month in my parents' Brooklyn "upper middle class" home. 
 At a $75,000 yearly income, my parents are certainly on Washington's list of middle-class Americans ripe for sacrifice. While middle-class Americans once took one or two vacations a year, my parents would cherish two nights in Atlantic City once every two years. My parents proudly recall their last new car -- a 1973 Plymouth Fury. Like many in today's middle class, my parents live each week from paycheck to paycheck. Bill maneuvering and management have replaced the Tuesday card game for many like them.
A $75,000 salary seems enough, but politicians ought to analyze why my parents' salary is increasingly modest. Federal, state and city taxes cut a New York City paycheck of $75,000 in half. As my father said last week, "Your mother and I work Monday, Tuesday and part of Wednesday for ourselves, and the rest of the week is for the Government."
But taxes alone are not their sole expenses. Insurance has emerged as the second leading culprit for the disappearance of middle-class America. After car, health, life and home insurance premiums, my parents' $38,000 after-tax income has been reduced to approximately $23,000.
Like many Americans, my family of four enjoys living in a three-bedroom home. Luxuries of this nature entail at least $1,000 a month in rent or mortgage payments. Thus, after rent or mortgage, only $11,000 can go toward utilities and automobile fuel. Essentially, my middle-class parents are left with $7,000 a year for food and some little extras.
My sister and I cannot have paid tuitions for college and graduate school. Thus, as a law student, I mortgage my future every day with accumulating loans. My sister, a student of occupational therapy, is concerned about her loans.
Living at home inexpensively during my legal and college educations, I have witnessed my parents' endless daily sacrifice. Instead of depositing money in savings accounts, they struggle to maintain the checking account in the black.
Nonetheless, my family's predicament raises the question of those less fortunate. Do they live in crowded homes? Do they depend on public transportation or bicycles? Can they even dream of a college education?
I hope that those concerned with the strength of the American family at least consider the majority of Americans who earn significantly less than $75,000. They too sacrifice every day. While it is noble to combat the nation's debt, Washington's priority obligation ought to be the American family.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Trampling of Rights Fosters Extremism;
Some Other Cairo

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a yearlong resident of Cairo, and a member of its expatriate community, I was outraged by the tone and content of your March 31 article Cairo Journal, which maintains that the fury of Islam has dimmed the sparkle for expatriates on the Nile. The city you describe is not the city in which I live. 
 I have never heard of "vials of acid tossed at foreign women" as you blithely assert without attributing this experience to any source. As a foreign woman, I would like to know exactly who has had such experiences and in what context.
Your perceptions of Cairo's foreign community are stilted and inaccurate. As an administrator at the American University in Cairo and a freelance journalist for Cairo's English-language press, I know many foreign residents of Cairo, and none of them live in the manner you describe so disapprovingly. You seem to confuse the opulent lifestyle of upper class Cairenes with the habits of the expatriate community.
At the very least, you do readers a disservice by implying that all foreigners live more luxuriously than all Egyptians. While some foreigners may indeed live lavishly in Cairo, I also know many wealthy Egyptians who spend their leisure time at exclusive clubs and surround themselves with "maids, errand boys, drivers, cooks and nannies" as you state foreigners do. I grew up on the Upper East Side of New York City, and I have never seen so many Mercedes-Benzes in one city, almost all driven by Egyptians.
I find your assertion that recent terrorist incidents have made "most of the 35,000 Americans and Europeans alter their daily routine" improbable. I cannot believe that your reporter actually spoke with "most" of these people. Of the couple of hundred foreigners with whom I have daily contact, only a few have changed their lifestyle at all.
You state that the American University in Cairo and Cairo American College have "made concerted efforts to lower their profiles and have increased their security staff." I work in the public relations office of the American University and can state that while we have tightened our security, we have not made any attempt to lower our profile.
Overall, your tone is exaggerated and biased. The few direct quotations are surrounded by such slanted text that the reader interprets far more fear, anger and desperation in the comments than is actually stated.
This is not to say that there is no fundamentalist terrorism in Cairo; there is. I am very sensitive to the local political climate, and I take potential threats very seriously, but irresponsible and inflated reports fuel the flames of frustration without conveying accurately the atmosphere in Cairo.

HEADLINE: Population Control Doesn't Cure Poverty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Birth Control 'for All People' " (editorial, April 2) draws attention to the opinions of two Republican Presidents on international population control programs. Dwight D. Eisenhower, you remind us, favored such programs on the ground that without them "the expectation of future generations" would be limited "to abject poverty and suffering." Ronald Reagan denied them funds on the ground that population growth was a "natural phenomenon" that could stimulate economic growth. Neither state
ment enables us to reach any conclusion on population control. They are opinions, not arguments. 
 You offer no compelling arguments for population control. You state that "at least 500,000 pregnant women, most of them in poor countries, die every year." This is an appalling statistic. Undoubtedly, if more women availed themselves of birth control there would be fewer deaths attributable to pregnancy, but only because there would be fewer pregnancies.
Death rates for pregnant women would remain the same because the acute problems that ultimately cause those deaths -- drought, unrelievable heat, lack of medical and hygiene facilities, and primitive agricultural technology -- remain unsolved in the third world. Financing population control programs does not address the health concerns of poor women.
Advocates of such programs assume "overpopulation" causes poverty. In "The Economy of Cities" (New York, 1969), Jane Jacobs points to Ireland's experience as evidence that what is taken as axiomatic by "population experts" is at the least open to question. Before the 19th-century potato famine, Ireland had nine million people, not a large population for a country of its size. Nevertheless, the Irish were very poor.
"From starvation, disease and emigration, they were swiftly reduced to less than three million," she writes. "The fewer poor people were still poor. Their marriage and birth rates became the lowest in the world, but this did not make Ireland well off."
"One wonders," Jane Jacobs concludes, "how much a population is supposed to be reduced before prosperity comes."

HEADLINE: 7 NATIONS PLEDGE $28 BILLION FUND TO ASSIST RUSSIA

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 15

 BODY:
Seeking to help President Boris N. Yeltsin's political fortunes, the leading industrialized nations committed themselves today to $28 billion in aid for Russia, most intended to be delivered this year, although much of it was contingent on austerity steps that Moscow may find difficult to adopt.
Most of the package announced today is to be provided by various international lending agencies, not the United States Treasury. But it did include about $2 billion in United States credits or loan guarantees to pay for Russian imports of American goods, and separately the Administration announced a new commitment of $1.8 billion in direct aid that seems likely to require Congressional approval. 
 The package was announced at the end of two-day emergency meeting -- the first of its kind -- of the foreign and finance ministers of the so-called Group of Seven nations.
 
Addressed the Pitfalls
 Ministers said the aid had been designed to avoid the pitfalls of the West's efforts to prop up the Russian economy last year, when only about half the $24 billion in aid pledged by the West was actually disbursed.
But many participants expressed doubts about whether Mr. Yeltsin wields the political power necessary to meet even the watered-down conditions on which much of the new aid depends, including a requirement that Russia curb its runaway inflation, now running at close to 25 percent a month.
It was also doubtful whether Mr. Yeltsin would be aided at all in his campaign for approval of the April 25 referendum on his policies since most Russians would not feel any effects for months.
 
'Year of Real Breakthroughs'
 Russian officials attending the conference said they were pleased with the results, largely because much of the support is aimed at highly visible projects that the donors hope will compensate for the jobs lost by the closing or conversion of inefficient state-run factories and enterprises.
"This year will be the year of real breakthroughs," Boris G. Fyodorov, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister, said at a news conference here this afternoon. "The amounts of money in the package are not so important as the practical, visible approach we feel."
Despite the doubts expressed here about Mr. Yeltsin's power and future, Secretary of State Warren Christopher pressed several countries to provide even more aid in coming weeks, warning today that "the world will be a considerably more dangerous place if Mr. Yeltsin does not prevail."
Today's pledges include roughly $22 billion in new aid, but they are not the only steps announced this year to help Russia. In a separate move, various commercial banks, international lending institutions and governments have agreed to permit Russia to defer about $15 billion in payments of principal and interest on past loans falling due this year.
 
New Aid of $4.5 Billion
 The Administration's additional commitment today of $1.8 billion brings its total new commitments to Russia in recent weeks to $4.5 billion. Some part of that commitment may eventually be counted in the overall package announced in Tokyo today.
There was considerable uncertainty about the aid numbers, however. Administration officials said they did not know how much of this package should be included in the G-7 totals because some of the Clinton Administration's commitments will have to be matched by other countries in a fund to rehabilitate large industries before the money is disbursed.
Most of the funding announced today is intended to pass through international lending institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and much of it is aimed at building ways for Russia to increase exports and earn hard currency more readily, chiefly through oil production.
Administration officials traveling with Mr. Christopher and Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said that they had not yet determined how they would pay for the new $1.8 billion in aid, which is mostly in the form of grants. They also said they would have to negotiate with Congress over specific projects to provide assistance with such needs as nuclear power safety, medical help in rural areas, housing for displaced Russian military officers and dismantling of nuclear weapons.
Clearly concerned that the new aid commitment would meet considerable opposition at home at a time when President Clinton is talking about tax increases and federal spending cuts, Mr. Christopher went before the television cameras to announce that "the U.S. effort to aid reform in Russia is in no way a program of charity, in no way a handout."
He and Mr. Bentsen said repeatedly that if the reform effort in Russia is thwarted, the United States will face not only a potentially renewed military threat but also the risk of "the loss of large potential markets for our businesses."
Despite Russian assurances that economic reforms would be carried out this year, the ministers in Tokyo were clearly concerned. This morning they quizzed Mr. Fyodorov, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Foreign Minister, on their commitment to rapid changes on the West's terms.
"It was a bit of an oral exam," said one European diplomat who observed the encounter in a giant hotel ballroom in downtown Tokyo. The two Russian ministers spent most of recent weeks negotiating over how to make the aid package usable. Mr. Christopher said today that he had spoken with Mr. Kozyrev "every day for the past 10 days."
 
Money Was Never Spent
 While the figure for the total multilateral package announced by the Group of Seven countries was a little more than $28 billion, a bit more than $6 billion was appropriated last year by the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the value of the ruble against other international currencies. A stable exchange rate is regarded as essential for Russia to increase its trade and investment.
But the money was never sent because Russia's Central Bank, which is answerable to the Legislature and not to Mr. Yeltsin, has not yet adopted the monetary and credit controls that are conditions of the aid. Instead, it has pumped credits to deficit-ridden state enterprises so they would not have to lay off workers.
Another concern about the new program is that much of it may be delayed for years -- including, for example, an estimated $10 billion in "export credits" offered by the seven governments on which Russia can draw to purchase equipment and other goods in each of the countries.
While the export credits were described today as if they are readily available, in fact they must be approved on a project-by-project basis by the export-import banks of each of the donor countries involved, a process that could take quite some time.
 
A Turning Point
 For the Japanese, the host of the meeting, the session marked a tremendous turning point. Japan had initially been reluctant about holding the emergency session for fear that it could upstage its July summit of the leaders of the Group of Seven.
Japan also feared that the meeting this week would place even more pressure on Tokyo to lift its longtime linkage of aid with progress on getting Russia to return what Japan calls its "northern territories," four forbidding islands in the Kurile chain that the former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II.
The issue remains a potent one in Tokyo, where public opinion is decidedly against large-scale aid. As the talks went on his morning, right-wing nationalists in giant gray sound trucks cruised Tokyo's streets, demanding return of the islands over loudspeakers and playing their signature martial music. But they never got through the heavy security lines to within earshot of the ministers.
In the end the Japanese came through with a $1.8 billion package of their own, though all but $320 million of it is in loans and trade insurance. More important, though, by the conclusion of the session they appeared to have dropped all pretense of making substantial aid contingent on the islands dispute.
 
A Different Approach
 The critical question at the conference is whether the new aid would be any more effective than the $24 billion promised to Russia last year -- much of which was never disbursed, either because of disarray in Russia or because Mr. Yeltsin could not meet the stringent conditions.
"We are trying it differently this time," a senior Clinton Administration official who insisted on anonymity said this morning. "The idea is to prime the pump with some initial money so that the effects can be felt, and then to have more flexible conditions for the rest."
For example, an initial $3 billion in the aid will be disbursed through a new fund to ease the transition to a market economy, administered by the International Monetary Fund. Half the money will be paid out after a "clear political commitment" to stabilizing the currency, American officials said.
The threshold is sufficiently vague that it means the money can flow almost immediately if the Russian Central Bank takes step to control the issuance of credits and currency, as it recently said it would. The second half of the money would be sent after initial progress in getting inflation under control.
The new aid program also includes a larger "standby" loan from the International Monetary Fund, amounting to $4.1 billion, that officials said would have less restrictive conditions than last year's loans. Only $1 billion of the $3 billion commitment last year was disbursed.

HEADLINE: After National Search, Yale Picks Its Graduate Dean to Be President

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, April 15

 BODY:
After a nationwide search for a president to lead it into the 21st century, Yale University turned to its own campus today and selected Richard C. Levin, a 46-year-old economist who has spent nearly half his life at the university, most recently as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. Levin, who will become Yale's 22d president on July 1, faces high expectations. Faculty, students and others will be looking to him to rescue the university from the economic troubles and low morale that plagued his predecessor, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who resigned last May.
 
Traits Other Than Experience
 Though Mr. Levin has less administrative experience than other candidates who were said to be under consideration, trustees and other university leaders say he brings important compensating traits to the job: leadership, an insider's knowledge of the institution and an ability to bring factions together on the 11,000-student campus. 
 Faculty members and students also seemed cheered by his selection. Many said they hoped it would end the antagonism that marked Mr. Schmidt's tenure.
"I think it's a good and important thing to have someone from the inside, who understands Yale and has the ability to seek and find consensus," said John Merriman, a professor of history.
At the announcement of his selection, in a wood-panelled hall of the august Sterling Library, Mr. Levin said he was humbled by the appointment. He talked of renewing and revitalizing Yale at a time of serious financial problems and low morale and said he welcomed challenge.
"Time and again in the history of this institution, its leaders have expressed grave concern about the university's financial health and the deterioration of its buildings," he said. "History gives us hope."
In explaining why the search committee had taken so long to name Mr. Schmidt's replacement, Vernon R. Loucks Jr., chairman of the Yale Corporation, the university's executive board, tried to counter speculation that Yale had been turned down by more desirable candidates.
He also denied speculation that the university was looking only for someone with links to Yale, saying that more than 400 candidates, including the presidents of several colleges and universities had been considered.
"Dean Levin is the only person to whom the corporation extended an offer," he said. "After a long and a very far-reaching search he has emerged clearly as the person best qaualified to lead Yale.
 
Students and Faculty Surveyed
 Although all but one of Yale's presidents have been chosen from among the faculty, Mr. Loucks said that "history was not considered at all by the search committee" and that "there was no presumption in favor of an internal candidate; quite the contrary."
He said the search committee had spent the first four months surveying students, faculty, alumni and educators from around the nation about what kind of person would best lead Yale.
"No search in Yale's history has been more comprehsive, or more exhaustive," he said.
Yale's provost, Judith Rodin, who preceeded Mr. Levin as graduate school dean, was once thought to be the front-runner for the job. At today's news conference she described her relationship with Mr. Levin as "wonderful" and said she planned to stay on as provost.
The search committee, which for the first time included faculty members, was unusually secretive. Others who were said to be in line for the job included David Kennedy, a Stanford University historian, Donald M. Crothers, chairman of Yale's chemistry department, and James Duderstadt, president of the University of Michigan.
 
New Kind of Leadership
 To many, the selection of Mr. Levin, a popular professor and administrator, seemed a solution to rocky relations between the university and Mr. Schmidt. Faculty members were angry about an academic restructuring committee Mr. Schmidt had appointed to determine which departments and disciplines were expendable. Graduate students were angered by his tough stance against their efforts to organize a union.
Many students, bothered by what they perceived as Mr. Schmidt's inaccessibility and frequent absences from campus, put up signs on the lawn asking, "Where's Benno?"
In an interview today before the announcement, Mr. Levin refused to criticize his predecessor. He applauded Mr. Schmidt for raising $570 million to improve campus buildings, and for his efforts to improve relations with New Haven.
"We really owe him a debt of gratitude for that," Mr. Levin said.
Before Mr. Schmidt's tenure, he said, there had been "a lot of 'town-gown' tensions and conflicts. Benno really took that issue seriously and worked very hard to forge a new partnership."
Mr. Schmidt likewise praised his successor. "I think Rick is an excellent choice," he said. "He is one of the best and most widely respected and people on the faculty of Yale."
He added: "I knew when I asked him to be dean of the graduate school that he was one of people who had one of deepest understandings of the university."
Mr. Schmidt also defended his tenure as president. "I think my years at Yale were very good ones," he said. "The problem was that we had to reckon with long-standing problems as we faced the pressures of escalating costs associated with academic excellence. So we and other universities were faced with tough choices, but Yale's financial situation is very strong."
 
'He's a Mensch'
 After Mr. Schmidt's departure, the coporation named as acting president Howard R. Lamar, a professor of Western history. Because they were so pleased with his tenure, during which campus tensions were considerably eased, corporation members announced today that they would formally recognize Mr. Lamar as Yale's 21st president.
Faculty and students described Mr. Levin as an affable and down-to-earth administrator.
"It's obvious he's a mensch, and that means a lot to me," said the writer Calvin M. Trillin, who is a member of the Yale Corporation. "He's someone whose basic honesty and decency are just the first things people mention when they talk about him."

HEADLINE: ACCORD IS REACHED TO AID FOREST BIRD

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Trying to defuse the battle over the Endangered Species Act, the Clinton Administration said today it had approved a plan by the Georgia Pacific Corporation to protect the red cockaded woodpecker, a forest bird that is declining in much of its range in the South.
The agreement, which was announced by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, calls for Georgia Pacific, the nation's largest timber company, to keep at least 10 acres of trees and brush standing around each colony of red cockaded woodpeckers that live on its forest lands in Arkansas, the Carolinas, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
 The focus of the agreement is a small, wood-boring forest bird with a splash of bright red on its head. It was once widespread in the Southern forests from Virginia to Texas, but logging and development eroded its habitat, and in 1973 it was among the first animals listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act.
 
What the Company Gains
 By agreeing to restrict operations on more than 50,000 acres, the timber company won a promise that the Government will not invoke the species act to further curtail logging throughout the rest of Georgia Pacific's 4.2 million acres of Southern timberland. The agreement calls for Georgia Pacific to protect any newly discovered woodpecker colonies on any of its lands.
Mr. Babbitt said today that the Government's acceptance of the company's plan would help maintain the woodpecker's numbers in the South, although most of the 10,000 red cockaded woodpeckers in existence live in national forests and timberlands on military bases in the South. Thus, they are not affected by the agreement announced today. But they continue to be protected under the general provisions of the species act, which prohibits killing a threatened or endangered species or harming its habitat, whether on public or private land.
The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that 300 to 400 birds would be directly affected by the agreement, including the last surviving population of the species in Southern Arkansas. But the importance of the accord was clearly as much symbolic as practical.
Georgia Pacific's plan is emblematic of a new approach by the timber industry to avoid political and legal problems caused by the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws that affect their huge land holdings. Mr. Babbitt said the Interior Department had opened negotiations with other Southern timber companies to protect the woodpecker.
 
An Important Precedent?
 The most important effect of the Georgia Pacific plan, Mr. Babbitt said, could well be the precedent it sets in helping to establish a less politically incendiary approach to safeguarding endangered wildlife and their habitat, especially on private land.
The Georgia Pacific accord marks the second time in a month that the Clinton Administration has collaborated with industry to forge an agreement meant to protect the environment while advancing economic goals. In March, Mr. Babbitt declared the California gnatcatcher a threatened species and then announced that the Administration would cooperate with developers and conservationists to decide how to divide the land where the bird lived for new housing and for habitat.
The Endangered Species Act allows for such flexibility, though it was rarely exercised during the previous two administrations, environmental lawyers said today.
Instead, the lawyers asserted, both Republican administrations delayed protecting species and seemed to encourage conflicts to gain support from property owners, timber companies and farmers to weaken the act.
 
Was Conflict Predictable?
 Leaders of farm and timber groups and those seeking to protect private property said the conflict over the Endangered Species Act was a logical result of the law's protections for endangered plants and animals. But they said the law did little to encourage the Government to take into account the economic harm such protections could have on working people.
Mr. Babbitt said today his intention was to protect the Endangered Species Act by improving the Government's management of all wildlife. In doing so, the Government could avoid the last-ditch efforts to save a threatened species that have characterized the struggle in the Pacific Northwest over the northern spotted owl.
The Georgia Pacific plan, which has been under development for nearly two years, was a good start, he said: "Lands can be managed in a way that a bird species is not destroyed and its habitat is preserved."
 
Chief Executive Comments
 A. D. (Pete) Correll, the president and chief operating officer of Georgia Pacific, said today that the primary motivation for drawing up the plan was to avoid lawsuits and Government action while also being able to cut timber for a growing market.
At the heart of the Georgia Pacific plan are several assurances by the company and the Government. The first is the company's vow to protect 110 colonies of woodpeckers by prohibiting cutting on 10 acres surrounding each colony, or 1,100 acres.
The company also said it would more carefully manage some 510 additional acres that surround each colony of birds, though executives today were vague about how much timber it would take from these buffer zones. The company, which had revenues of $11.8 billion last year, can log the rest of its 4.2 million acres in the South.
Michael Bean, a lawyer from the Environmental Defense Fund, endorsed the Georgia Pacific agreement today. "Creative solutions are necessary if we are to conserve endangered species," he said.
Other environmental groups reserved judgment, though most said they had confidence that Mr. Babbitt was probably doing something worthwhile.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall Sharply

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits fell sharply last week, the Labor Department said today, but economists cautioned that the drop might be largely attributed to a workweek shortened by the Good Friday holiday. 
 First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell 38,000 in the week ended April 10, to 335,000, the lowest level in two months. The drop was the largest since a decline of 131,000 in the week that ended on Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Make Toyota Cars for Sale in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 16

 BODY:
In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 cars a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan under the Toyota brand name.
The arrangement, confirmed by G.M. today, would be a reversal of the usual pattern in which Japanese companies have made cars in Japan that are sold to American consumers as G.M., Ford and Chrysler cars. 
 The "conceptual" accord, as G.M. called it, came to light as the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was to meet with President Clinton for the first time in Washington today. Mr. Miyazawa is expected to come under heavy pressure from President Clinton to take concrete steps to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States.
 
American Actions to Lift Exports
 Automobiles and automobile parts account for much of the trade gap, and the Big Three Detroit auto makers have been pressing Mr. Clinton to take action to increase American exports to Japan or to decrease Japanese exports to the United States.
Exporting American-made Japanese cars to Japan is not new. Some 37,000 American-made cars were imported by Japan last year, but about 20,000 of them were Hondas.
And G.M. and Toyota, the largest auto manufacturers in their respective countries, already have a history of cooperation. They operate a factory in Fremont, Calif., that makes both G.M. and Toyota vehicles, some of which are exported worldwide. But for General Motors, which sold only about 9,000 passenger cars under its various brand names in Japan last year, selling 20,000 to Toyota would represent a big jump.
The Toyota agreement was reported in this morning's edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese economic newspaper, and then confirmed by G.M. Toyota said it was premature to comment on specifics of the reports of the agreement.
The American company said that its chief executive and president, John F. Smith Jr., had met with Tatsuro Toyoda, Toyota's president, in Washington on April 5 to discuss ways of increasing G.M.'s exports to Japan of cars and car parts.
The two executives "agreed conceptually to pursue an arrangement whereby G.M. would build a Toyota-badged right-hand-drive vehicle in the United States for sale by Toyota in Japan," G.M. said in a statement. "A working group has been formed to finalize model specifications, exact timing and other details."
A G.M. spokesman in Japan, David G. Bodkin, said the number of cars involved could reach 20,000 a year and that sales are likely to begin around 1996 or 1997.
Mr. Bodkin would not say which factory will be chosen but said G.M. does not plan to use a plant that is now scheduled to be closed in the company's restructuring. The company said it is too early to speculate whether the new arrangement would allow it to retain any workers that are now scheduled to be laid off.
The Japanese newspaper reported that the cars to be sold will be new versions under G.M.'s line of subcompacts, including the Chevrolet Cavalier and the Pontiac Sunbird.
Selling the car under the Toyota name, through Toyota distribution channels, could help G.M. overcome the resistance among some Japanese consumers to American cars.
 
 
A Hard Sell
 American car companies have had a notoriously hard time selling in Japan. Critics have been saying that American cars are too big and expensive, have a reputation for poor quality and do not come with the steering wheel on the right side. American executives say the quality and price issues have been addressed and that problems stem from formal and informal trade barriers and difficulty in obtaining distribution.
Indeed, the American cars that are now selling best in Japan are those made by the Japanese themselves at their American factories. Honda just became the largest importer of cars to Japan. That is largely because the Japanese can use their brand names and existing distribution channels.
In January 1992, President Bush came to Japan with the heads of the Big Three auto makers to press for increase access to the Japanese market. At that time, Japan's auto makers collectively pledged informally to sell up to 20,000 American cars in Japan each year. As part of that agreement, Toyota said it would import and sell 5,000 G.M. vehicles a year.
 
Implementation of Agreements
 But implementation of such agreements has been slow to materialize. In the case of G.M. and Toyota, G.M. itself did not want to circumvent its longtime Japanese distributor, Yanase & Company. But in the new arrangement, since it will be making Toyota vehicles, G.M. apparently does not have to go through Yanase.
Still, analysts said that the agreement might have a bigger impact politically than it would on reducing the United States trade deficit with Japan.
Japan's car exports to the United States are more than 1.5 million cars a year, a number that has been held down in recent years by a voluntary limit of 1.65 million cars a year. And Japanese companies make cars in the United States using many parts imported from Japan.
Compared with that gulf, "20,000 cars coming from the United States seems like a drop in the bucket," said Peter Boardman, an auto industry analyst for UBS Phillips and Drew International in Tokyo.
"It's well-timed news to calm the political pressure," he said. "It's a politically motivated agreement and I haven't seen too much success in these types of relationships."

HEADLINE: Both Sides Talk of Pact On Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Suspending their public quarrel over President Clinton's $19.5 billion plan to stimulate the economy, Mr. Clinton declared today that he was willing to scale back his proposal, and Senate Republicans signaled they were ready to discuss an agreement.
"I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who've been blocking action on the jobs plan," Mr. Clinton said during a ceremony in the Rose Garden. "I am willing to compromise so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs." 
 White House officials said the President's comments were intended to show that he, and not the Republicans, was initiating efforts to reach a compromise. But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, also sought to take the initiative by calling Mr. Clinton about the package.
 
'We Are Both Adults'
 Recalling one of two telephone discussions last night, Mr. Dole, who was traveling in New Hampshire, said: "It was a very good conversation. We are both adults. We understand politics." He said at several appearances today that Republicans were not seeking to "embarrass" Mr. Clinton but merely disagree with him.
But while the tone was decidely friendlier in public today, it was far from clear that any real accommodation was forthcoming. Both sides were careful not to spell out specifics of the negotiations, and aides on both sides emphasized that the talks were of a general nature.
The aides said, however, that there seemed to be some agreement on preserving big-ticket items like jobs programs and unemployment benefits, and that the compromises would probably be over trimming other elements.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole had what the aides described as two productive phone conversations on Wednesday about the stimulus package. The President said he urged Senators George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader, and Robert C. Byrd Jr., chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to continue the talks today with Mr. Dole.
Mr. Clinton said he told Mr. Dole that "I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him I was working on a reformulation" so that the package "would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to address."
 
Carrots for Republicans
 In a reference to Mr. Clinton's criticism earlier this week that the Republican filibuster of the package was at the expense of children like those at the White House Easter egg hunt, Mr. Dole said he told the President, "We've been throwing Easter eggs at each other long enough."
Even as he was talking about cuts, Mr. Clinton sought to sweeten the package for Republicans who favor a strong emphasis on law enforcement. He called the Rose Garden ceremony of law-enforcement officials to announce that he was adding $200 million to the package for rehiring local police officers who were laid off because of the recession. He said the $200 million could lead to putting as many as 10,000 officers back on the job.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said it was unlikely that the two sides would reach an accord before Congress returns next week from its Easter break. "This is the beginning of the process," he said. "It's hard to imagine that it would get finished before the Senate returns but it's not impossible."
When the Senate reconvenes on Monday, new versions of the Clinton package may be offered by Mr. Dole and by Mr. Mitchell. A vote on one or both of those versions has been scheduled for Tuesday, but the Senate could put that off if the current talks are making progress.
At a news conference in Concord, N.H., Mr. Dole said that Mr. Clinton had told him he was "focusing on two or three areas" for a compromise. While the President did not say what those areas would be, Mr. Clinton made clear what programs he wanted to keep.
"I want the summer jobs," Mr. Clinton told reporters gathered for the Rose Garden event. "I want the highway program. I want the police program."

The Security Council is expected to hold an emergency session on Friday to consider imposing tough new sanctions on Yugoslavia immediately if the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica falls to Serbian forces.
"I would definitely convene the Council, and I personally think we should move ahead immediately with the new sanctions," Jamsheed K. A. Marker of Pakistan, this month's Council president, said after reports that the Bosnian defenders of Srebrenica are negotiating the town's surrender. 
 Mr. Marker spoke after the Security Council had agreed to hold a two-day debate next week on Bosnia and Herzegovina. But at the same time the Council agreed, at the urging of Russia and the United States, to postpone a vote on new sanctions until April 26, the day after Russian voters vote in a national referendum on the political future of President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin's opponents in the Russian Congress support the Serbs, and the postponement of the vote was meant to avoid embarrassing him or playing into his opponents' hands.
 
Response to Third World
 Mr. Marker said there was an understanding among Council members that the agreement to delay the sanctions vote would be abandoned if Srebrenica or Sarajevo fell and that Russia would not use its veto to block new punitive measures against the Serbs.
The decision to hold an open debate next week, at which all members of the United Nations can air their views, is an attempt to deal with the anger many third-world and Muslim countries feel at finding the Council powerless to act against the Serbs. The Bosnian Government is largely Muslim.
If the new sanctions, as expected, are adopted by the Security Council on April 26 -- or earlier -- the United States, France and Britain are likely to support Russia's call earlier this week for another Council meeting at foreign minister level in the second half of May, diplomats said today.
Moscow has suggested that such a high-level meeting should discuss rising ethnic tensions throughout the world and also review the suggestions Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has made for strengthening the United Nations peacekeeping role.

HEADLINE: A Peek Inside the Health-Care Debate

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
In opening the door to an indirect form of national sales tax, the White House has provided an unusual public peek into the private conflict about how to finance a costly new Government-supported health-care program.
A health-care task force headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton has reached no conclusions about the cost of the various elements of the program or how to pay for them, although officials say there are at least 20 financing alternatives under consideration. 
 Moreover, last week several senior Administration officials contacted Ira C. Magaziner, the adviser in charge of the health-care proposal, to express their displeasure that no cost estimates had been forthcoming for a plan that outside experts say could cost from $30 billion to $90 billion a year.
 
Billions Are Envisioned
 In light of that need, the value-added tax, imposed on goods and services at each stage of production, would be a lucrative financing tool.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, such a tax assessed at 5 percent would raise $35 billion in its first year if provisions were included to relieve the burden on the poor by exempting food, housing and medical care. The revenues would rise to $65 billion in the fourth year.
But the tax has been dismissed as regressive by advocates for the poor, as anti-growth by retailers and as excessive by industries that have already been wary of President Clinton's proposal to increase energy taxes. Even Mr. Clinton seemed to dismiss the idea in February.
But as George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, conceded today, "Certain things have changed."
 
A Balloon Deflated?
 The President's political advisers were unwilling to predict how far the value-added proposal would progress, and there is a good chance it will go nowhere.
"There are lots of things under discussion," said Stan Greenberg, a political adviser who conducts polls for the White House. "This is not one of things that is percolating to the top."
The trial balloon that was sent aloft by two senior Administration officials in seemingly coordinated remarks this week was premature, critics and even some Clinton aides said today.
Republicans were quick to note that the debate about it erupted on the day income taxes are due, and even Democrats who had supported the idea grimaced over its sudden appearance.
"Today is tax day for millions of Americans, but judging from the latest White House trial balloon, this Administration is considering making every day tax day," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
During a morning jog today, Mr. Clinton said he had not changed his position on a value-added tax. But he also said he had not yet fully reviewed the matter. "A lot of business and labor people are for it," he said.
Later, at a Rose Garden ceremony, the President cautioned against comparing his plan to stimulate the economy -- which he would dearly love seeing passed over Republican objections -- to the tax proposal.
"I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that, on that or any other kind of general tax," Mr. Clinton said.
"The real issue is how quickly we could recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the costs," the President added, noting that polls show broad support for restructuring health care. "Everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system; if you fix the system so there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services; if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health-care system."
But the analyses also show that in the short run such savings would not be enough to cover the costs of expanding insurance coverage to those who lack it and of adding expensive options like long-term care.
The President's advisers had hoped this week to work out the fine points of ending the Congressional impasse over his plan to stimulate the economy without giving Republicans more ammunition with which to tar him as an unrepentant tax-and-spend Democrat.
But the timing went awry this week after both Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Alice M. Rivlin, the deputy budget director, suggested that the value-added proposal was under consideration.
"It seems like a very strange time to float a gigantic tax," offered one Democratic Congressional aide.
Jerry Jasinowski, chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, said: "It not only doesn't make any substantive sense, it doesn't make any political sense. You can't make all these changes and fight on all these fronts at the same time."
Bad timing aside, testing the political waters in this manner has become a Clinton Administration tactic to give the President room to maneuver.
Administration officials used a similar approach earlier this year when Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, proposed freezing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. Once he had suggested to a group of influential senators that such an approach was under consideration, the outcry allowed the White House to gauge the discontent and eventually win support for a less onerous plan to increase the tax on benefits only for wealthier recipients.
And the value-added tax proposal has the advantage of having previously won support from several influential members of Congress and from members of the Clinton Administration, including Ms. Rivlin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and a key economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers.
In Congress, those who have supported different versions of the tax include Senators Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico; Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland; Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and David Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma. Many are attracted to the idea because it would shift the burden of taxation from income to consumption, thereby providing an incentive for savings and expanded investment.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Enclave Braces for Verdict

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif., April15

 BODY:
At the Fancy Hair beauty salon here, Vivian Granillo and her mother, Milagro, stay close to a television that hums from the counter, the volume low but the set on all the time as the women await a verdict in the Rodney G. King beating trial in nearby Los Angeles.
Last year, after the first trial, they were taken by surprise by a band of looters armed with a sledge hammer who invaded their shop and left with $46,000 worth of shears, swivel chairs and beauty potions. This year, the Granillos say, they will pack the equipment they can carry the moment a verdict is reached and hustle it home. 
 A few blocks away, on a sun-dappled residential street that is quiet now but for bird songs, Feliciano Mendoza and his wife, Margaret, are figuring out how to get their three daughters safely home after a verdict, since the girls are in schools scattered around distant Los Angeles neighborhoods.
They have decided that two of the girls, 6-year-old Alice and 12-year-old Lisa, will join their mother at her office at the University of Southern California, a secure compound that was untouched in last year's disturbances, although rioters roared nearby. The third daughter, 14-year-old Mariella, will ride the school bus home on a circuitous route that has been revised by school officials to avoid areas most likely to explode in violence.
 
Recalling the Destruction
 Just like their neighbors in Los Angeles, residents of Huntington Park are worrying and planning as the Federal jury continues its deliberations, which broke off late this afternoon and are to resume for a seventh day on Friday. This Hispanic enclave just a few miles southeast of the big city was not far from the epicenter of last year's mayhem and many stores were looted and burned.
Mr. Mendoza, a fifth-grade teacher at Miles Elementary School, vividly recalls the aftermath of last year's verdict: Pillars of smoke, wailing sirens and the rattle of automatic gunfire just blocks from his stucco bungalow. There were long lines at gasoline stations as frightened families fled. Shoe boxes littering the main commercial boulevard, where footwear, electronics and liquor stores were the most popular with looters.
But Mr. Mendoza, a fourth-generation American of Mexican descent, has been challenging neighbors who say they have armed themselves this time around. Most of the violence, he tells them, was against commercial property, not homes or people. They have little to fear, he said, unless "they end up killing each other."
"It was an economic riot, not a race riot," Mr. Mendoza concluded.
Huntington Park, where 90 percent of the 55,000 residents are Hispanic, is a paradigm for what the Latin community in the larger Los Angeles area might be, a place where Mexican-Americans who have been here for generations live comfortable lives, vastly different from those of the impoverished newcomers from the south.
"There is a big difference between those people and us," said Mary Castillo, a teacher's aide at Miles Elementary, which operates year round and still bursts at the seams because of the flood tide of immigrants who have made this one of the densest corners of the county. "We appreciate what we have. We have a foundation here and we take pride in our city."
 
New Culture Atop the Old
 The Mexican-Americans of long standing in Huntington Park own their own homes, including stucco bungalows like Mr. Mendoza's and impressive stone dwellings surrounded by lush gardens.
Many of the newcomers, by contrast, are crowded into illegally converted garages or live doubled or tripled in tumbledown shacks at are the edge of town, near steel and auto plants that were idled years ago. The city is rather like an archeological dig, with the new culture superimposed on the ruins of the old. Along Pacific Boulevard, the sort of small-town commercial strip rarely seen in Southern California, old buildings that once held the likes of the J. C. Penney Company are now home to Joyeria Alberta and Clinica Medica.
To listen to longtime residents here, it was the struggling immigrants, many of them here illegally, who participated in last year's looting, joining outsiders who stormed in from Watts and South-Central Los Angeles.
Jerry Meza, a teacher's assistant at Miles Elementary, said he stood outside Tommy's hamburger stand here and watched streams of people headed east on Florence Avenue, toward Huntington Park, where eager locals then joined them. Martha Pena, another teaching assistant at the school, added that many of her newest students said later that they had gone looting with their parents.
"They were very excited about getting things they never had," Ms. Pena said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Reports Higher Income

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
While New York City's economy may still be in the doldrums, Mayor David N. Dinkins did much better financially in 1992 than in the year before, according to income-tax returns he released yesterday.
His taxable income rose 12.5 percent last year, largely because of speaking honorariums and expiration of a 5 percent cut in his salary for part of the year, the returns showed. 
 The documents also showed that Mr. Dinkins was more generous with his money. He gave $17,462 to charity last year, or about 12 percent of the $144,997 he and his wife, Joyce, reported in taxable income. That compared with $15,000 in contributions the preceding year. For last year, Mr. Dinkins and his wife paid $38,009 in Federal, state and local taxes, compared with $33,100 a year earlier.
Tax returns released by his Republican challenger for mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, showed he gave $10,888 to charity last year, about 3 percent of the $363,441 in taxable income reported by him and his wife, Donna K. Hanover, the television reporter.
Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President who intends to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary, filed for an extension, as he has for the last few years. Victoria Streitfeld, his chief of staff, said that Mr. Stein's accountant had not yet completed the returns but that Mr. Stein paid an estimated amount.
Besides his salary, the income of Mr. Dinkins and his wife came from $4,963 in interest on savings accounts, $3,381 in taxable dividends and $6,649 in pension benefits for Mrs. Dinkins, who had worked with the State Taxation and Finance Department before retiring when Mr. Dinkins took office. His income also included a $145 payment for an appearance on the television program "Law and Order." That episode was never broadcast.
The subject of the Mayor's charitable contributions has been a thorny one for him. Two years ago, he took some heat for having made cash charitable contributions of just $190. He responded by saying he had donated time to several charities in ways that could not be measured in dollars.

HEADLINE: Donors Also See Gain in Aid Package

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 15

 BODY:
While there were arguments here today over how much of the $28 billion in aid pledged by the wealthy industrial nations will reach Russia quickly, there were fewer doubts about another group likely to benefit: foreign businesses eager to finance risky operations in Russia.
No sooner had the delegates to the conference on Russian aid handed out fact sheets explaining their complex new program, than they moved on to the issue of expanding trade and developing jobs -- in their own countries. 
 Clinton Administration officials, mindful that Americans might be less than receptive to big foreign-aid programs when budgets are declining and taxes rising at home, said the package would generate huge orders for American oil and gas equipment and benefit as many as 9,000 American workers.
Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, gushed, "Russia could be one of the biggest export markets for British firms in the next decade. We want to help and encourage them to get in on the ground floor and to establish links with Russia at an early stage."
To some extent, of course, such comments were intended to persuade legislators back home to support big new appropriations for aid to Russia.
It also seemed clear that the aid package would likely suffer some of the same problems that plagued last year's package: Of the $24 billion committed by the seven nations last year, only about half was disbursed because the Russian Government was unable to take the tough economic measures called for.
The $6 billion ruble-stabilization fund announced here, for instance, is really a fund set up last year that Moscow could not draw from because it failed to get inflation under control. Curbing inflation would involve ending the subsidies that have kept hundreds of deficit-ridden state enterprises afloat and millions of Russians employed.
The turbulent political situation in Russia makes it uncertain whether Moscow will be able to use all the import credits being offered this year either.
 
Meeting Immediate Needs
 A senior United States official said the whole point of the new program was to get aid more quickly to the areas that need it most. About $2 billion from a new type of International Monetary Fund program -- called, somewhat awkwardly, the systemic transformation facility -- is likely to be disbursed within three months, the official said; the only condition is that Moscow express a commitment to economic change.
That still leaves the Russian Government with the difficult job of reducing inflation and slashing its budget deficit before billions of dollars in additional assistance can be disbursed, particularly from a $4.1 billion I.M.F. loan program offered here.
But the sudden interest in commercial prospects in Russia is, in part, a product of the unusual way the new package was drawn up and its pragmatic, commercial emphasis on building the private sector.
A total of $10 billion in the new package, for instance, is in loans and guarantees for exports to Russian enterprises. Much of the money is intended to help Russia purchase equipment that will produce quick returns by modernizing and expanding its major export industries, including oil, gas and minerals. Several billion dollars in World Bank loans could be used to finance energy development.
 
A Russian, Hard at Work
 The conference ended with a call for a $300 million fund at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to provide loans to promising small and medium-sized companies, a form of grass-roots support that was absent last year.
The new approach was one reason Boris G. Fyodorov, Russia's Finance Minister, discouraged nitpicking over the prospects that all the new money will hit the targets.
"This is not wishful thinking," he said of the $10 billion in trade credits. "We're already negotiating with various countries on this."

HEADLINE: Pentagon Speeds Plan to Lift Gay Ban

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
After two months of delay and indecision, the Pentagon is hurrying to prepare an executive order to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military and to agree on the practical steps to carry it out.
The Defense Department has established a 50-member military working group in an office six blocks from the White House, and ordered the panel to deliver a list of policy options to Defense Secretary Les Aspin by May 5. Two dozen experts from the Rand Corporation, a research organization, are conducting a separate review for Mr. Aspin that is due in early June. 
 Under the direction of a senior aide to Mr. Aspin, Rudy de Leon, top civilian Pentagon officials are seeking to write an executive order by July 15 that meets President Clinton's goal to end discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and that is acceptable to Congress and the armed forces.
 
'Practical Resolution'
 "Our working approach is that we can come to a practical resolution to this problem," said one senior Defense Department official.
Advocates of gay rights expressed relief today that the Administration, and the Pentagon, in particular, had started a fact-finding and policy-review process after more than two months of inaction.
President Clinton ordered the Pentagon on Jan. 29 to draft an executive order lifting the ban and an accompanying study to support it. Senior policy makers, distracted by other issues, said they did not focus on the task until they were embarrassed by published reports last month that the armed services were using the policy vacuum to continue to resist lifting the ban.
President Clinton only worsened the confusion last month when he said at his first news conference that he would consider restricting the deployment of gay soldiers. Under criticism from gay rights groups, Mr. Clinton quickly backed away from his remarks.
Administration officials say the review is now moving along smartly.
 
Overcoming 'Emotionalism'
 "There are official and unofficial conversations, strategies and options being discussed all over the Beltway by Administration officials," said Bob Hattoy, a White House adviser on gays issues who last month criticized the Administration's handling of the issue.
Senior Pentagon officials are cautiously optimistic that they can reach agreement with military leaders on issues like greater privacy in latrines and showers, and public displays of affection among same-sex personnel. But they worry aloud that Congress is a wild card that could upset a brokered deal between the White House and the armed services.
"I'm concerned whether a practical solution can overcome all the emotionalism that exists in politics," said one senior Defense Department official.
A dozen staff members from the Senate Armed Services Committee quietly visited about 20 military installations around the country this week and last week to canvass officers and enlisted personnel on the ban, and to prepare for field hearings the committee will hold in May.
Staff members representing Democratic and Republican lawmakers interviewed scores of troops at bases in New York, California, Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington. Staff members said that most troops voiced support for the ban, but that there were some calls to lift the prohibition.
 
Criticism on Interviews
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the committee, strongly supports the ban but has insisted the panel's hearings will be "fair, thorough and objective." The Armed Services Committee held its first two hearings in early April, and will hear testimony later this month from experts of foreign militaries that permit declared homosexuals to serve in their ranks.
Advocates of homosexual rights have expressed anger at the committee's recent visits, contending that commanders handpicked the troops that staff members interviewed and that the interviews were conducted in large groups, inhibiting any dissenting opinions.
"This methodology is inherently flawed and will inevitably yield skewed results," said Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service, a coalition of gay rights groups that oppose the ban.
A committee spokesman, Scott Williams, said today that staff members heard from both supporters and opponents of the ban. He added rights groups were welcome to discuss their views with staff members.
While the Pentagon's nuts-and-bolts review is taking place at a second-floor office on Pennsylvania Avenue here, the parallel study is going on more than 3,000 miles away at the Rand Corporation headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif.
"We need Rand's methodological approach and the military's independent judgment," said a senior Defense Department official, explaining why two reviews are needed.
The Pentagon working group is headed by Lieut. Gen. Robert M. Alexander of the Air Force, who is temporarily the Defense Department's chief personnel officer. Assisting General Alexander are Maj. Gen. John P. Otjen of the Army, Rear Adm. John S. Redd of the Navy, Brig. Gen. William B. Davitte of the Air Force, Brig. Gen. Gerald L. Miller of the Marine Corps and Rear Adm. James M. Loy of the Coast Guard.
Heading the Rand study is Bernard D. Rostker, a former head of the Selective Service System. Rand has assigned historians, economists, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, doctors and lawyers to the study.
Pentagon officials expect to gather all their information by mid-May, and then consult on various policy options with gay rights groups, veterans organizations and lawmakers through June.

HEADLINE: Tax-Protest Leader to Oppose Florio

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 15

 BODY:
John Budzash, the mail carrier who organized the huge statewide tax protest that seemed to put the political future of Gov. Jim Florio in serious jeopardy, filed today as a candidate to oppose the Governor in the June 8 primary.
Mr. Budzash, who resigned from the Postal Service earlier this week to run, turned his nominating petitions over to the Secretary of State's Office five minutes after the official filing deadline. But in a hurried telephone call, Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo directed the office to accept the petitions. 
 Raymond J. Lesniak, the Democratic Party Chairman, said he would review the signatures on the petitions and decide whether to challenge them.
"Here is a guy who was a Republican until a few days ago, and now he decides to run as a Democrat," Mr. Lesniak said.
Mr. Budzash, who delivered the petitions himself, running into the office with his tie askew and his shirttail out at 4:05 P.M., said he was late because he had discovered that 300 of his petitions had been signed on the wrong line.
 
Pledges to Reduce Waste
 Even if Mr. Budzash's petitions survive a challenge, just what impact he will have on the election is uncertain. He conceded today that he has yet to raise any campaign funds, and he acknowledged that he does not have a platform beyond general pledges to reduce waste in government and reduce taxes.
Mr. Budzash, who has never held political office, rose to some prominence in 1990 after he called a radio talk show to complain about the $2.8-billion tax increase Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature. He and another caller, Pat Ralston, who said she was unemployed and about to lose her home, became the founders of a group called Hands Across New Jersey to work for repeal of the taxes. The group was given credit for igniting the outpouring of voter anger that turned the Democratic majority out of the Legislature in 1990. Mr. Budzash later resigned from the group, which has splintered.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Enrollment Rises In New York City Schools

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Accelerating a trend of recent years, 65,322 immigrant children entered New York City's public schools in the last year, creating new pressures to increase the number of classrooms, expand bilingual education programs and provide other services for foreign-born students.
The increase, reported yesterday by Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, was 45 percent larger than in the 1991-92 school year, when 46,358 immigrant children enrolled in the schools. Since the 1990-91 year, the report said, the public schools have gained 137,796 immigrant children. 
 "It is a phenomenon that harkens back to the waves of immigration at the beginning of the century," said Robin Willner, the executive director for strategic planning for the Board of Education. Instead of increases in native-born students, she added, "It is immigration that is fueling the growth of the schools."
Analysts said the increases, if they continue, are certain to create new difficulties for the nation's largest school system, even though it has been promised a large increase in state financing.
"The pressures are outstripping most people's expectations," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and urban planning at New York University. The immigrant youngsters may be a "back breaker," for the schools, he added.
The report yesterday was derived from an annual census of school enrollment, conducted last October. It said the immigrant children, from 188 countries, more than accounted for an overall increase in public school enrollment, which rose by 23,319, to 995,465, this year.
 
Dominicans in Lead
 As in recent years, students born in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and China had the highest increases in enrollment. Dominican-born children now account for more than 20 percent of all immigrants in the public schools.
The influx of immigrant students was spread among all grade levels and experienced by public schools across much of New York City, but the report found three community school districts attracted the largest numbers, each adding more than 6,000 immigrants to its enrollment this year. They are District 30 in Astoria and Corona, Queens; District 24 in Long Island City and Middle Village, Queens, and District 10 in Riverdale and the North Bronx.
New York City public school enrollment declined sharply from the 1971-72 school year, when it reached a peak of 1.15 million, until the 1982-83 year, when it reached a low of 918,384, but it has been climbing back steadily for the last decade.
School officials said yesterday that the latest census made them even more confident of their projections, made repeatedly over the last year, that enrollment would once again exceed 1 million students next year and continue to grow.
"I don't think there is any question we will exceed the previous peak," said Mr. Tobier, who added that he expects continued increases in immigration to combine with a rebound in enrollment by native-born students during the rest of the 1990's.
He said one reason for continued growth will be demographic trends, which resulted in a large increase in birth rates among New York City women in the late 1970's and through much of the 1980's. Their children will enroll in the public schools in growing numbers over the next five years, he said.
The public school census report was released after months of dickering over school financing that resulted in a pledge, contained in the New York State budget proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, of $145 million in added state aid for the New York City schools during the next school year, beginning in September.
The increase will follow a year without added financing for the schools, despite their expanding enrollment. Ms. Willner said the public school budget, financed by the Federal, state and city governments, is $7 billion this year and "just about even" with the amount spent during the 1991-92 year.
Anticipating the added state funds, school officials have already announced an aggressive program of opening new schools, largely by leasing space in existing buildings. James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Fernandez, said yesterday that seven of the new schools had been opened in recent months, and 43 more would be opening by the beginning of the next school year.
But with more schools and classrooms being prepared, Ms. Willner said yesterday's report underscores the need for more spending on specialized programs. Among them, she said, is bilingual education, an expensive program that costs an average of $650 per student per year, and expanded school services to work with the parents of immigrant children.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Yields End Low After a Wild Day

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market felt the rumble of the roller coaster yesterday as traders and investors bought, then sold and then bought 30-year bonds again, jolting its yield down, up and then down again.
For several brief moments early in the day and near the end of trading, the yield on the long bond dipped below 6.72 percent, the lowest yield since the Treasury began regular auctions of the bond 16 years ago. 
 But by late in the day, the market's wild ride -- which took the yield up to 6.77 percent, down through 6.72, back up to 6.77 and down again -- ended as the yield came to rest at 6.72 percent, matching the low reached on March 8. The price was up 14/32 to 1056/32 and the yield was down from 6.75 percent Wednesday.
 
Hard Day to Explain
 For traders and analysts, it was not an easy day to explain. The data released early in the day, including the decline in initial jobless claims of 38,000 in the latest week, tended to be positive for the economy.
Many traders and investors have been thinking that the March economic statistics have signaled slower growth. But the report on jobless claims provided signs that the economy was actually looking a bit stronger this month. Reinforcing that view was the increase in the business index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, released yesterday, which rose to 24.6 in April from 19.6 in March.
Still, bond prices rose and yields fell early in the day despite this news.
The complete statistics on car sales for the beginning of the month, which were reported yesterday afternoon, also indicated that April might be better than March. Only at the close of trading, when the Federal Reserve reported that money supply growth in the most recent week was much stronger than expected, did the market seem to react normally, as the news seemed to blunt the long bond's last effort to break below 6.72 percent.
The weakness of the money supply all this year is another reason some forecasters are predicting an annual growth rate for the economy of around 2 percent rather than the 3 percent that many forecasters have predicted.
 
Compromise on Stimulus?
 On the other side of the ledger, supporting a rise in prices and a decline in yields, were comments from the White House that President Clinton was willing to compromise with Senate Republicans by making his $16.3 billion economic stimulus program smaller.
"We grudgingly did better for no particular reason," said Paul McCormack, a managing director at Chase Securities Inc., referring to the trading in relation to the news yesterday.
What seems to explain the moves of the day is not the economic news but the abrupt change in the tone of the market in the last week -- from concern about inflation, which had driven yields higher, to expectations of slower growth, a possibility of another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and confidence that inflation is in check.
"In the last week, we have seen a 180-degree turn in the concern of the market," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
Last week's report of two small increases in producer and consumer prices in March have temporarily laid to rest worries about inflation, and Tuesday's report of a sharp 1 percent decline in March retail sales pushed expectations of slower growth to the forefront.
 
Testing the Market
 So, in part, yesterday was a test of how far the market could go in this new environment, and the long bond was doing the probing. The prices of Treasury notes from 2 years to 10 years were unchanged or little changed, while the discount rates on Treasury bills were up a tad.
But for the day, the testing failed, although some traders said a large, unidentified speculator was moving the market. "The market is trying to do better, but it doesn't have the courage of its convictions," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S.G. Warburg & Company.
Still, Mr. Liro said, the yield on the 30-year bond should eventually fall below 6.72 percent. And he suggested that the report of industrial production today for March could be the catalyst, especially if it is a lot weaker than expected. He is forecasting a two-tenths of 1 percent decline in production.
But Mr. Liro also warned that if the scant data on April that is now available proved to be right, then "in a couple of weeks the slow growth notion could pass."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Against Yen As Trade Discussions Begin

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against the German mark yesterday but weakened against the Japanese yen.
After two days of losses, the yen flirted with all-time highs against the dollar on renewed speculation that the Japanese Government favors a stronger currency to help reduce the nation's trade surplus with the United States. 
 The yen began its rise overnight in Tokyo on reports that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa would support a stronger yen in the trade talks with President Clinton that started yesterday. The leading industrialized nations have pressed for a stronger yen, which should help reduce Japan's bulging trade surplus by making its exports more expensive.
 
Jolts from Germany
 Also rocking the market were comments from Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German Bundesbank, that Germany's interest rates were not too high, considering that the nation's inflation rate is more than 4 percent.
"Every time one of his comments came out, the market jerked one way or another," said Ken Gettinger, head of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland.
But Mr. Schlesinger's remarks before the Institute for International Economics were overcome by the market's deeper confidence that the central bank would push rates lower, which would raise the value of the dollar.
"The longer-term expectations are still for rates to come down in Germany," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 113.43 yen, down 0.04 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 113.25 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was at 113.10 yen, down from late Wednesday's 113.88 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5425 from $1.5520 late Wednesday. In New York trading, it settled at $1.5415, down from late Wednesday's $1.5515.
Other late dollar quotes in New York, compared with late Wednesday: 1.6055 German marks, up from 1.5935; 1.4683 Swiss francs, up from 1.4590; 5.4275 French francs, up from 5.3885; 1,543.00 Italian lire, down from 1,544.00; and 1.2594 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2630.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals Tumble As Rally's Profits Are Taken

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures prices fell back yesterday as a stronger dollar prompted selling that wiped out most of the sharp gains posted a day earlier.
On other commodity markets, copper futures also fell; oil futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $2.50, to $337.20 an ounce; May silver tumbled 6.7 cents to $3.878 an ounce.
July platinum fell $1.20 to $368.10 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The losses in gold and silver wiped out Wednesday's advances. Platinum, which rose $6.90 on Wednesday, retained most of that gain amid uneasiness about political and racial tensions in South Africa.
Wednesday's surge in prices was a response to violence in South Africa, the world's biggest platinum producer.
 
A Time for Profit Taking
 John O'Connell, metals analyst with the commodities brokerage firm Refco Inc., said the lack of follow-through buying yesterday left the markets vulnerable to profit taking. He said the selling began about two hours after the markets opened, when the dollar rallied on international currency markets.
A stronger dollar makes American goods costlier overseas, which reduces the likelihood of inflation and makes precious metals less attractive to investors.
Copper futures also fell sharply, reflecting a continuing lack of East Asian demand. April copper dropped 1.20 cents, to 87.10 cents, a pound on the Commodity Exchange.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light crude oil for May delivery fell 18 cents, to $20.22 a barrel; May heating oil fell 0.09 cent, to 55.92 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline slipped 0.03 cent, to 60.43 cents, a gallon; May natural gas fell 0.7 cent to $2.357 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Wheat for May delivery rose 5 3/4 cents, to $3.55 1/2 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade; May corn rose 3/4 cent, to $2.31 3/4 a bushel; May oats rose 3 cents, to $1.47 3/4 a bushel and May soybeans fell 4 3/4 cents, to $5.90 1/2 a bushel.
Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: City Opera Chairman Is Stepping Down

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Robert W. Wilson stepped down as chairman of the New York City Opera yesterday at a meeting of the company's board. Mr. Wilson, who is 66 and has been chairman since 1981, is to remain on the board as chairman emeritus. Irwin Schneiderman, the current president, and Lloyd E. Rigler, the current vice chairman, will succeed him as co-chairmen.
"Mr. Wilson has presided over a turbulent time that included two strikes, a change of artistic leadership and a recession," Christopher Keene, the company's general director, said yesterday, "and he has consistently supported the company's growth." 
 Mr. Wilson, a private investor who has been one of the City Opera's major financial backers during his tenure, said last summer that the company's $2.9 million deficit for the 1992 season might imperil its future. He has also said that the deficit occurred because the company had striven to improve the quality of its performances in the hope of attracting a new audience and more donors, but that the results had not justified the costs. His suggestion that the company therefore scale back its efforts did not meet with general board approval.
"But this is not about being thwarted in any way," Mr. Wilson said yesterday by telephone. "We have not run out of money, so ideally this is a question that the new regime won't have to deal with. There has been no disagreement. I had wanted to step down sooner. I believe that 12 years is long enough, and that it's time for others to have their turn."
Mr. Wilson said he would fulfill his pledge to give the company $2.5 million over six years, ending in 1995, and that he expected to continue to contribute to the company after that. But in stepping down as chairman, he said that he would be less involved in the company's affairs.
Mr. Schneiderman is a senior partner in the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel, and has been on the City Opera board since 1986. Mr. Rigler, who lives in Los Angeles, is an investor and philanthropist who has been on the company's board since 1978, when the City Opera and City Ballet established their own boards. Until then, both organizations had been governed by the board of the City Center for Music and Drama. During City Opera's 1982 financial crisis, Mr. Rigler advanced the company $3 million to cover payroll and expenses, and undertook the cost of setting up a development department.

HEADLINE: Why New York's Credit Ratings May Soon Show Improvement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Stop New York's Shady Borrowing" (editorial, April 2) would lead one to conclude that New York State's dismal credit ratings are based mostly on questionable debt practices. It follows that the state could raise its ratings by reforming those practices. Debt reform is clearly needed, but your view is far too simplistic.
While these practices contribute to the low ratings, the state's poor credit position is more deeply rooted in a weak economy and weak tax revenue growth; in the inordinately long time it took state officials to adjust to this environment; in an inability to end profligate spending; in over-reliance on budget gimmicks; in failure to maintain a balanced budget in four consecutive years, and in too much debt, as opposed to the form it takes. 
 These factors make it clear why the state's rating sank to the bottom. But it is also clear that substantial progress has been made. The state's ratings are likely to rise, possibly as soon as May 1994, even in the absence of debt reform. It will happen because the worst of the state's economic decline is over. Also, the state has adopted a more conservative approach to tax revenue forecasting and has limited spending growth.
Such changes enabled the state to produce a sizable surplus this year, with another likely next year. It will happen because the last two budgets were adopted close enough to the April 1 deadline to eliminate negative credit implications. And it will happen without debt reform, which is fortunate since the state's plan to eliminate its "shady borrowing" practices falls short of true reform.
The new plan codifies the system, giving the Legislature too much power over issuing debt and leaving the voters not enough control over capital spending.

HEADLINE: CLINTON CONSIDERS A TOUGHER POLICY TO HALT THE SERBS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
As Serbian forces moved on the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica, President Clinton said today that the United States and its allies needed to consider actions that "previously have been unacceptable" to stop the Serbian attacks in Bosnia.
While American officials debated in private whether to seek air strikes against Serbian artillery positions, Mr. Clinton said at a news conference that in the present situation he had not ruled out any military options except the dispatch of American ground troops to the Balkans. 
 At the same time, the United States pressed its efforts to win allied support for arms deliveries to the Bosnian Muslims. The President expressed outrage not only at the Serbian attacks on Srebrenica (pronounced sreh-breh-NEET-sah) but also at the Serbs' refusal to sign a draft peace treaty.
 
A Sense of Confusion
 His comments on the fighting in the Balkans were his most forceful since he took office, recalling his tough campaign statements in which he likened the Serb attacks to the Holocaust.
In New York, the Security Council voted unanimously to declare Srebrenica a United Nations-protected haven, to send in peacekeeping troops and to demand that the Serbian forces retreat from the town.
The vote marked the first time the Council has taken such an action, but it was unclear whether it would have any immediate effect on the Serbian forces just outside the town. Hours after the vote, a United Nations relief convoy left Belgrade for Srebrenica, Reuters reported. [Page 4.]
Mr. Clinton, appearing at the White House with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, also said Washington would not take any actions that were not approved by its allies. Behind his strong words, the evident ambivalence of the President's position reflected a sense of confusion and struggle as his advisers remained at odds over whether the United States should take military action in the Balkans.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin has argued that air strikes against Serbian positions should be considered, but Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Thursday appeared to rule out the use of military force.
 
What Strikes Could Do
 If air strikes were conducted, they could be used to silence the heavy artillery that is pounding Muslim towns and cities, to cut the supply lines of Serbian forces and, perhaps, to hit targets in and around Belgrade to punish Serbia, which is supporting the Bosnian Serb offensive.
Even though the fall of Srebrenica appears imminent, air strikes could reduce the threat to Muslin civilians in other besieged cities. A team of Administration experts sent to Bosnia by President Clinton recently concluded that the main threat to Bosnian civilians was not starvation but attacks by Bosnian Serbs.
As Mr. Clinton and his aides anxiously watched developments in Bosnia, Administration officials said Washington had stepped up its efforts to persuade its allies to lift the arms embargo, which has locked in the Serbian weapons advantage, so that arms could be provided to the Bosnian Muslims.
 
An Appeal to Moscow
 The Clinton Administration also informed Russia that it would press ahead with a vote in the United Nations Security Council on expanding the trade sanctions on Serbia if Srebrenica were to fall. That vote was supposed to have occurred last Monday but was delayed at Russia's request.
Administration officials said Washington had also asked Moscow to influence the Serbs to halt the fighting.
But there was no indication that Britain, France and Russia had dropped their opposition to arming the Bosnian Muslims. And Western diplomats also said that the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Vitali Churkin, appeared to have essentially taken the Serbian side in recent deliberations.
Nor is there any expectation among Administration specialists that the broadening of the trade embargo would have any immediate effect.
As for the use of force, a senior American official said the Clinton Administration had not yet decided whether it was prepared to launch air strikes alone and had therefore not pressed the idea with its allies.
 
'It's on the Table'
 Reflecting the continuing debate within the Administration, a senior Defense official told reporters today that air strikes against Serbian artillery positions were a possibility once it became clear that the talks initiated by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, the mediators for the United Nations and the European Community, could not be revived. The senior Defense official said, however, that it was unlikely that military action would be taken before the Russian referendum on constitutional revisions on April 25.
"It's on the table," the senior Defense official said, referring to air strikes. "There are no good options. There are some that are less bad than others. The one that is less bad is probably the use of air strikes in some way against the artillery."
But on Thursday, Mr. Christopher appeared to rule out military action in an interview with the NBC News program "Today."
"There's no great mystery about the fact that some people have called for the use of force in Bosnia," Mr. Christopher said. "We think that the use of ground troops, the use of American force, is not the solution to that problem at the present time. It's not being contemplated."
After Mr. Clinton indicated today that air strikes were being considered, Administration officials said they would be on a long list of options that the White House would consider to ratchet up the pressure on the Serbs.
 
'Not Just About Bosnia'
 Still, Mr. Clinton's public comments seemed to embody the ambivalence within the Administration over military action.
On the one hand, the President said that stopping Serb aggression in Bosnia was a critical test of the West's ability to deter ethnic aggression after the end of the cold war.
"I think we have an interest in standing up against the principle of ethnic cleansing," the President said. "If you look at the turmoil all through the Balkans, if you look at the other places where this could play itself out in other parts of the world, this is not just about Bosnia.".
"On the other hand there is reason to be humble when dealing with the former Yugoslavia," Mr. Clinton said, referring to the difficulties German invading troops had in Yugoslavia in World War II. "You have only to look at the topography of the country to realize we have a very limited hand to play."
As the Administration debated air strikes, Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, joined the debate, proposing the selective bombing of roads and bridges in Bosnia to interdict Serb supplies lines.
"I think the world community will now have to consider taking direct action to impose sanctions and that is by far the most effective measure," Lord Owen said.
 
3 Urge Military Action
 A group of three Republican lawmakers, returning from a trip to Bosnia, also urged military action. The lawmakers urged the Administration to impose the total diplomatic isolation of Belgrade, end the arms embargo and undertake air strikes.
"Strategic air strikes against Serbian infrastructure is one of the only ways the Serbs will understand that we are serious about them coming to the peace table,' said Representative Susan Molinari, a Republican of Staten Island and one of the lawmakers.
A team of Administration officials, sent to Bosnia in February by President Clinton, also urged that military action be considered, including the creation of a safe haven protected by international forces.
Still, Western officials said there was little support among the Western European allies for lifting the arms embargo or conducting arms strikes.
Britain, for example, appears dead set against lifting the embargo, arguing that such an action would increase the fighting in Bosnia, endangering its peacekeeping troops.
When former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called for bombing attacks earlier this week, the British Defense Secretary derided the recommendation as an emotional response.
Secretary Christopher also called Mrs. Thatcher's call for military action "a rather emotional response to an emotional problem."
Even if Mr. Clinton rejects the counsel of the State Department and opts for force, the President has made it clear that the Western Europe allies would, in effect, have a veto over any American plans to use force.
"I have operated from the beginning under the assumption that whatever is done must be done within the framework of a multilateral cooperation, that this was not something the United States could effectively do alone," Mr. Clinton said.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Briton Backs Blockade
 LONDON, April 16 (Special to The New York Times) -- The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, took a somewhat harder line on Serbian aggression in Bosnia today, endorsing a full-scale commercial blockade to tighten existing economic and military sanctions, but still stopped short of supporting any direct military action.
Despite growing pressure from Lady Thatcher and even the leadership of the opposition Labor Party to get the Government to support military moves against the Serbs, including air strikes, Mr. Hurd said he remained dubious.
"We are not ruling out air strikes," Mr. Hurd said in response to a question. But he added that the Government "would have to be clear how it would help," and at this point believed such a move would also have to involve a commitment of ground forces to have any real effect.
He also reiterated his opposition to lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, as Lady Thatcher has argued.
Rather, in brief remarks to reporters outside 10 Downing Street, where he had just met with Prime Minister John Major, Mr. Hurd reaffirmed the British policy of international diplomatic and political pressure to get the Serbs to change their policy of "outrage and inhumanity."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Signs Pact With Indians For Casino in Upstate New York

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed an agreement today allowing the tiny Oneida Indian Nation near Syracuse to open New York State's first high-stakes gambling casino in more than a century.
Mr. Cuomo was considered the last major obstacle to the Oneidas' plan. The compact is subject to approval by the Interior Department, but the Federal agency has a strong record of endorsing such agreements. 
 Bob Walker, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, said: "This Secretary has made it clear he supports Indian gaming as a legitimate method of economic development. He's not looking for reasons to reject it."
Opponents and supporters of casino gambling said that Mr. Cuomo's action opens the way for statewide gambling by weakening arguments against casinos in down-at-the-heels tourist areas such as Niagara Falls and the Catskills.
"Whether we like it or not, we'll have it on Indian reservations," said State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Yonkers who has introduced legislation to allow for-profit gambling statewide. "Now we'll be giving great benefits to Indians while our tourism industry is dying and people are out of work."
Though Mr. Cuomo has never publicly expressed a position on casino gambling, his aides said he felt he had little choice but to sign the Oneida compact since a 1988 Federal law allows Indians to have profit-making gambling operations on their land. Under that law, Indians can run the same games of chance the state allows charities to run. Las Vegas nights are commonly run throughout the state by charities.
 
Broad State Regulation
 "People who are for gaming will use this as a reason to push it," said Mary Ann Crotty, Mr. Cuomo's director of policy management. "But I don't have reason to think that the majority of the Legislature wants that right now."
When made final, the compact will open the door to what is probably the state's first legal casino since Saratoga had one in the 1870's. The agreement will allow the Oneidas to operate a variety of games, including blackjack, roulette, craps and keno. It will not allow for slot machines, which are regarded as the most profitable of gambling games, but which are outlawed in New York State.
The Oneidas, who have 1,100 members living on or near a 32-acre reservation in central New York State, would become the second tribe in the Northeast and the 59th in the nation to have for-profit, casino-style gambling. The Mashantucket Pequots opened a casino in Connecticut last year.
The pact will give New York State broad powers to regulate the Oneida's gambling operations. The New York State Police will post officers in the casino and will conduct background checks on potential employees. Inspectors from the state Racing and Wagering Board will also be present to oversee the integrity of the games.
Leaders of the Oneida Nation say the casino, which they hope to open in July near Verona, about 30 miles east of Syracuse, could generate more than $100 million in profits annually. They say it will provide 2,000 jobs for a largely impoverished area and venture capital for a variety of Indian businesses and social services ranging from day care to low-income housing.
"The execution of this compact with the state begins a new era of economic sovereignty for the Oneida Indian Nation," said Ray Halbritter, the nation's representative, an elected tribal position. Mr. Halbritter has said that the casino will not serve alcohol, at least at the outset, because of the high rate of alcoholism among Indians.
The casino will be operated by an outside management company that has not been chosen, he said. Under Federal law, the tribe must receive at least 70 percent of the net gambling profits.
 
Dispute Over Site
 Though gambling on the Oneida reservation seems almost assured, there still could be a dispute concerning the site of the casino. Under Federal law, tribes seeking to open casinos off their federally designated reservations must first ask the Interior Department to incorporate that land into the reservation, Mr. Walker said.
But the tribe plans to open a 68,000-square-foot casino on a 250-acre tract that is not part of their 32-acre reservation. The $10 million, glass-and-metal structure is nearing completion on land just off the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
Mr. Halbritter said that courts have recently ruled that the land was historically owned by the Oneidas and therefore is, in essence, part of their reservation. Mr. Walker said it was not clear whether the Interior Department would dispute that.
The casino has received strong support from business groups and elected officials in central New York State, who view it as a valuable economic boost in an otherwise grim period. Griffiss Air Force Base in nearby Rome is one of several local employers where layoffs are threatened or underway.
"This has always been a high unemployment area," said State Senator William A. Sears, Republican of Utica. "The casino is going to be 2,000 jobs and will bring people from all over to spend money locally. It's a great thing."
 
A Reversal by Cuomo
 Still, many Indians have objected to casino gambling on their land, saying it allows unprecedented state involvement in their internal affairs. Others contend that gambling violates traditional Indian values and can become an addiction as bad as alcoholism.
"It's been proven that there is an increase of family breakdown, domestic violence and child abuse when people gamble," said Gerald Thompson, an Oneida who opposes the casino. "Is the money worth the devastation that could happen to our people?"
Mr. Cuomo's office is also negotiating a gambling compact with the St. Regis Mohawk Indians near the Canadian border. Protests against illegal casinos on the Mohawk reservation in 1990 led to the deaths of two Indians.
Today's signing represented something of a reversal by Mr. Cuomo, who had said that the Legislature needed to authorize state regulation of the casino before he could sign a compact. Republican leaders had said Mr. Cuomo was trying to spread political responsibility for gambling, and they refused to debate the issue until Mr. Cuomo signed the compact.
On Monday, Mr. Cuomo plans to introduce legislation giving him the authority to spend $2.5 million for state police officers and inspectors for Indian casinos. Under the compact, that money will be repaid by the Oneidas.
"We'll look at any legislation that he sends," said Chris McKenna, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino.

HEADLINE: HAITI ARMY SPURNS OFFER OF AMNESTY

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 16

 BODY:
Haiti's military commanders today rejected an offer of amnesty by the country's ousted President that was to have been the cornerstone of a diplomatic settlement of this country's 18-month-old political stalemate.
The rejection was a setback to the efforts by the special United Nations envoy, Dante Caputo, who had set today as a deadline for the military's acceptance of the amnesty offer. In recent weeks, diplomats involved in the mediation efforts said they had been led to believe by the Haitian military leaders that they would accept the proposed settlement if they received a guaranteed amnesty.

 Although the details of the rejection were not disclosed, diplomats said the Haitian Army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, had rejected outright acceptance of a proposed settlement, which calls for the early return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 Father Aristide, a populist priest who was the country's first democratically elected leader, was overthrown in a violent army coup on September 30, 1991.
Mr. Caputo, whose mediation efforts have been strongly supported by the United States, said he was flying immediately to New York and Washington for consultations on what diplomats had already warned would be strong new measures aimed at bringing the Haitian military command into compliance.
Diplomats said they would soon announce highly selective sanctions to step up pressure on Haitian military leaders and their supporters among the country's political elite to accept a return to democratic rule. "There are a few things we are going to try right away," said a diplomat close to the negotiations.
After delivering a written summary of the terms of the settlement on Wednesday night, when he met with senior Haitian officers here, Mr. Caputo said he waited throughout the day Thursday and much of the morning today for the army's answer.
"Some very bad things were said," Mr. Caputo said of the army's reply to the proposed settlement, but he declined to give details.
 
'High Price to Pay'
 A diplomat close to the negotiations said: "They have decided to say, 'We are staying,' in effect, 'If you want us, come and get us.' This, however, is not the way things work with this effort, and they may soon find that they have a very high price to pay for their decision."
Asked what kinds of measures might be taken, the diplomat said: "There are many ways to apply pressure. Here, we may be talking about something like microsurgery."
In recent days, diplomats close to the negotiations have used such analogies not to suggest that an early option would be to use force to remove General Cedras and his associates, who presided over the coup against Father Aristide, but to suggest that as opposed to the hemisphere-wide embargo already imposed on the country, new sanctions would be aimed more precisely at recalcitrant military and business leaders.
Although the new measures will probably not be determined until early next week, after Mr. Caputo completes his meetings with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and President Clinton's national security advisers, diplomats have alluded to a number of possibilities in recent days.
 
Possibilities Under Study
 Among the measures that would affect military leaders and their supporters most strongly, diplomats said, would be the suspension of commercial air traffic to the United States, the suspension of visas for adults here and the revocation of visas for their children studying in the United States. Other measures reportedly under study include suppression of contraband arriving from the neighboring Dominican Republic, a strict ban on oil shipments and the freezing of financial assets abroad.
Even before any of these measures can take effect, diplomats said, there are likely to be tensions in the army itself, which the diplomats said is divided over the amnesty proposal.
Although he declined to comment on the current round of negotiations, Mr. Clinton's special envoy here, Charles Redman, has reportedly told Haitians with whom he has met in recent days that whether or not the military accepts the amnesty offer, "We're going to arrive at a political settlement here."
In rejecting the settlement offer, an associate of General Cedras said the Haitian commander had cited a speech by Father Aristide on Sunday offering the political amnesty to army leaders. "Our ancestors wish for us to safeguard each other, according to the country's Constitution," Father Aristide said in his broadcast speech. "Toussaint Louverture accorded an amnesty to General Rigaud and his supporters."
 
Veiled Threat Seen
 The military commander's associate said General Cedras, like other conservative commentators here, had read a veiled threat in Father Aristide's remarks about two of Haiti's most prominent independence-era figures. Within months of the amnesty referred to by Father Aristide, Toussaint Louverture supervised the slaughter of thousands of his rival's supporters in one of the most violent incidents of the country's early-19th-century revolutionary struggle with France.
Political experts said that by seizing upon this supposed threat to back out of an amnesty-based settlement, however, General Cedras may lose the protection from prosecution or punishment that Father Aristide reluctantly granted him as part of the settlement. Diplomats said they had repeatedly advised Haitian military leaders that the settlement represented the best deal they could hope for.
In exchange for the amnesty, the negotiated settlement called for the resignation of General Cedras, many of his military associates and the army-backed civilian Government.
After the formation of a new government and the influx of large-scale economic aid to begin the reconstruction of Haiti's shattered economy, diplomats have said, Father Aristide would be allowed to return from exile in Washington within weeks.

HEADLINE: Clinton and the Japanese Premier Scold Each Other on Trade Issues

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan used their first White House meeting today to scold each other bluntly about international trade, as Mr. Clinton insisted on an approach to resolving disputes that the Prime Minister called unacceptable.
Appearing together at an East Room news conference, the two leaders made clear that little progress had been made on their economic disagreement during a private meeting and luncheon, saying only that they would now attempt to work out new definitions of what could constitute a middle ground. 
 "The world needs a strong Japan," Mr. Clinton said. "The world needs a strong United States. The world needs these two countries to cooperate. And it can only happen if we are making real progress on this trade deficit."
Hours before their meeting, the Commerce Department reported that the United States' overall trade deficit rose slightly to $7.2 billion in February. The trade imbalance with the Japanese, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said, accounted for two-thirds of the total deficit so far this year. The United States had a $49 billion trade deficit with Japan last year and an overall deficit of $84 billion.
The strain between the two leaders, the result of weeks of barbs thrown back and forth between representatives of both Governments, was evident today. The leaders shook hands politely at the end of their joint appearance but there was little eye contact during the news conference. And there was little of the normal friendly exchange at the podiums that is common to such staged diplomatic events.
Saying that he was "deeply concerned about the inadequate market access for American firms, products and investors," Mr. Clinton said he would like to see Japan increase its purchase of specific American goods by setting goals.
 
Clinton's Approach Criticized
 But Mr. Miyazawa described the President's approach today as an unacceptable foray into "managed trade" that places all of the burden to create greater market access on Japan.
Each leader offered the other standard praise and spoke of his optimism about the potential for agreement on economic and other issues, but neither man pretended to ignore the underlying tensions in the room. Although President Clinton has described America's relationship with Japan as perhaps its most important bilateral link, the disagreements between the two are substantial and enduring.
"Let's not paper this over," Mr. Clinton said as his chief foreign policy and economic aides watched from the sidelines. "There are still differences between the Prime Minister and me about what we should do."
"I recognize that these are complex issues, but the simple fact is that it is harder to sell in Japan's market than in ours," Mr. Clinton said. "America is accepting the challenge of change and so too must Japan."
But American officials said afterward that the President and the Prime Minister never discussed key points of contention such as Japanese imports of American auto parts or American taxes on imported Japanese minivans during a meeting both sides described as "businesslike" rather than warm.
"The President didn't mean to negotiate," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, who has angered many in Japan by accusing the nation outright of engaging in unfair trade practices.
Mr. Miyazawa said, "We must nurture this relationship with a cooperative spirit based upon the principle of free trade."
 
'Plus-Sum Relationship'
 "This cannot be realized with managed trade nor under the threat of unilateralism," he said, referring to the possibility of one country imposing tariffs or sanctions, rather than negotiating agreements. "Our relationship must be a plus-sum relationship, not a zero-sum one."
In remarks to reporters here earlier this week, Ambassador Takakazu Kuriyama said that the United States has sought to impose "some artificial government intervention" on trade policy "which would work against fair and healthy competition."
"It really takes two to dance," Mr. Kuriyama said.
Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Clinton said they had agreed that Japan would devise a plan within the next three months aimed at reducing its trade surplus. And the two pledged to meet twice a year, beginning at the economic summit scheduled to be held in Toyko in July.
 
Numerical Targets Opposed
 Officials said they were seeking to establish a different yardstick by which to measure progress on relations between the two countries. The Japanese are wary of specific goals. The Bush Administration was able to reach agreements on the purchase of American semiconductors and auto parts that the Japanese now fear are being used as the benchmark for future agreements.
"We can make improvements without their being any numerical targets," one Japanese official said after the White House meeting ended.
Even though both sides agreed that a new "framework" would be developed to govern trade relations, Mr. Miyazawa made clear that any plan he presented would not necessarily address any of Mr. Clinton's immediate concerns.
 
Influence of the Yen
 "In the area of our bilateral trade and economic relations, I stressed to the President that our economic prosperity is founded on our deep economic interdependence," Mr. Miyazawa said. "It is in this context that I expressed seriously some concern over some trends in the United States. I explained my Government's policy to continue efforts to increase our market access. But this must be done with parallel efforts of the United States to strengthen competitiveness, export promotion under the free trade system."
Mr. Clinton argued that circumstances have now changed between the two nations because of the appreciation of the yen, the new $115 billion Japanese stimulus program and the increased quality of American goods.
"There are some differences still between the Prime Minister and me about what kinds of agreements we should make sector by sector on these structural issues," he said. "But if we focus on them and talk about them specifically, honestly and openly, I believe this is very different from what has happened in the past."
Mr. Clinton, however, backpedaled on his Administration's criticism of the Japanese Government's recently announced $115 billion economic stimulus plan. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and others had said the plan lacked the heft needed to spur Japanese buyers into increasing their appetite for imported goods that would presumably come largely from the United States.
Calling the plan "a very good first step," Mr. Clinton said he expected it to be part of a beneficial long-term plan.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Lead Group Beyond Abortion Battle

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In the simple equation of public image, Planned Parenthood equals abortion rights. And Faye Wattleton, the past president of the organization, equals Planned Parenthood.
But the new president, Pamela J. Maraldo, is working hard to change the old equations. When she took over Ms. Wattleton's midtown Manhattan office in February, she hoped to begin reshaping the Planned Parenthood Federation: moving it beyond the abortion-rights crucible that has consumed its budget and energies in recent years, and transforming it into the leading provider of health care for women.
 
Hostage to Abortion Rights
 She and the organization's board reasoned that a White House and Congress less hostile to abortion rights would clear the way for a broader agenda. 
 Instead, Ms. Maraldo has had to devote much of her energy in her first weeks on the job to stepping into the role that her tough, telegenic predecessor played as the nation's leading spokeswoman on abortion rights.
When Dr. David Gunn was shot to death last month by an anti-abortion demonstrator outside a clinic in Pensacola, Fla., where he performed abortions, Ms. Maraldo was deluged with strategy meetings, calls from the news media, television appearances and press releases. Four days after the shooting, Planned Parenthood took out full-page newspaper advertisements seeking donations to its new clinic defense fund.
 
Combat With Catholic Church
 "We obviously had to do all that, and it was very exciting for me to see how fast this organization can move," said Ms. Maraldo, who spent the previous decade as chief executive of an advocacy group for nurses.
Becoming the leading defender of abortion rights was not the most obvious career path for the Catholic daughter of an Italian mushroom grower in Kennett Square, Pa. But Ms. Maraldo does not seem concerned that her views have already made her the target of a homily by John Cardinal O'Connor of New York.
"I didn't take the job to do combat with the Catholic Church," she said. "But the Catholic Church is an institution that has not factored in the development of women -- economic and social -- in American society, and I'm not uncomfortable about saying that."
 
Slightly Camera Shy
 What does make her uncomfortable is television -- the medium in which Ms. Wattleton, fast on her feet and cool in the heat of hostile debate, was a forceful presence.
"Before I got here, I didn't understand the need to be a public person, the need to go on television when a doctor who performs abortions gets killed by an anti-abortion demonstrator in Pensacola," Ms. Maraldo said. "I didn't understand quite what a leap into the public eye this job would be."
Ms. Wattleton, who is six feet tall, possessed a poise and presence that seemed made for television. Indeed, she resigned from Planned Parenthood to become the host of a syndicated talk show, although that plan has fallen through.
Ms. Maraldo finds the medium both alien and a bit alarming, though she is making an effort to accommodate the cameras. While she does not yet paint her fingernails to match her outfits, as Ms. Wattleton did, Ms. Maraldo has begun to use a clear polish. Still, she still seems thoroughly uninterested in the mirrored dressing room that adjoins her office.
"I'm a fairly nice-looking person, so I never gave it a lot of thought," said Ms. Maraldo, who is 45 years old.
 
Stark Contrast in Personalities
 Her personal style could not be more different from that of Ms. Wattleton. Where her predecessor was cool and precise, Ms. Maraldo is warm and informal. Where Ms. Wattleton spoke in careful cadences, Ms. Maraldo is prone to statements like, "It's a the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-the-parts kind of thing."
Just how to make this work in front of a camera puzzles her.
"The first time I saw myself on television, I thought I looked like Howdy Doody, moving around all the time," she said.
Adding to her difficulties, Ms. Maraldo got braces in November. "My dentist said it was no big deal, but it is," she said. "Even though you can't see them, they feel funny, and I don't feel like I'm talking like my real self."
She sounds a bit wistful about what she gave up when she left her job running the National League for Nursing, an advocacy group that she transformed in 10 years from a nearly moribund organization with a $5 million budget into a powerhouse that spends $20 million a year to improve the lot of nurses.
"A lot of my closest friends are there," said Ms. Maraldo, who is single. "People like me have had a gradual blurring of the line between personal life and vocation. I have the luxury of being friends with people I work with, and having work that's about the same stuff I would be talking about after work anyway."
One thing Ms. Maraldo would be talking about is health-care policy. Although she spent several years as a hospital nurse -- first on the cardiology unit at the New York University Medical Center, then as an oncology nurse at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center -- most of her career has been devoted to policy rather than patient care.
 
'Fire in Her Belly'
 While never achieving the celebrity of Ms. Wattleton, Ms. Maraldo is widely known in the nursing world for advocating, and winning, basic changes in health-care regulations that brought power and status to the nursing profession. Among other things, she got nurses appointed to the commission that accredits hospitals, and she created a new group to accredit home-care services.
Leah Binder, a friend and former colleague of Ms. Maraldo at the nursing league, said: "She has a fire in her belly about empowering women. When the Planned Parenthood job came along, she talked about it with me, because I've been strongly pro-choice for a long time, and she thinks of me as this raging feminist.
"But actually, she's the raging feminist, and the same issues of women controlling their own lives that she cared about at the nursing league carry over into this new job. It's not so different."
 
Fosters One-Stop Clinics
 Ms. Maraldo at first refused to talk to the search firm that was looking for someone to succeed Ms. Wattleton in the $225,000-a-year president's job, because she felt she lacked expertise in reproductive health.
But while she is still learning about the legal and political issues surrounding abortion -- meeting with Dr. Sheldon Segal to discuss RU-486, the French abortion pill, and reading a constitutional analysis of abortion rights by Laurence Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor -- she is fluent and forceful in selling the idea that Planned Parenthood can be a major player in women's overall health care.
"We know that 70 percent of the women who enter the health-care delivery system come in with reproductive health issues, like contraception or Pap smears," she said. "Most patients want one-stop shopping. If they come in for a breast exam or a Pap smear, they'd really like the person who examines them to help them to take care of their flu, too.
"Planned Parenthood is in a good position to do that, with nurses or physician's assistants who will be the Marcus Welbys of the future, doing primary care and really getting to know their patients."
It was that philosophy that made her attractive to the Planned Parenthood board.
"We were terribly impressed with how she articulated the direction in which this organization should be moving as an established network of providers of women's health care," said the the board's chairwoman, Jacqueline S. Jackson, "which was exactly where we had thought we should be going, too."
Ms. Maraldo said that one of her goals would be to help Planned Parenthood clinics persuade clients not to switch to private gynecologists as they grow older and more affluent.
"A lot of women come to us as young adults, and we want to retain them," Ms. Maraldo said. "But we are going to have to convince them we are capable of serving women who are not young and poor."
Planned Parenthood's nearly 1,000 clinics nationwide are run by 168 independent affiliates that control which services they offer. Though only about a third perform abortions, Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider, doing 130,000 of the country's approximately 1.5 million procedures each year.
 
Weathering a Money Crunch
 While the Planned Parenthood Federation gets a portion of its money from its affiliates, it also does its own fund raising. But after the Supreme Court's decision last year reaffirming the right to abortion, followed by the election of Bill Clinton to the Presidency, donations to the Planned Parenthood Federation dropped off so drastically that the organization earlier this year reduced its budget by 25 percent, to $27 million from $36 million, and laid off 34 employees.
"Some people apparently think that abortion is no longer an issue," Ms. Maraldo said. "The public has to understand that the battle's not over, that it is a battle for America's soul. Some rights are nonnegotiable. We have to educate people that if you can take away women's rights one day, the next day it's Jews, the next day it's blacks and the next day it's Italians. Pro-choice means a broad social agenda."

Toyota to Sell G.M.-Made Cars in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 16

 BODY:
In a deal that would increase American car exports to Japan, the General Motors Corporation has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 Toyotas a year in the United States for sale by the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan.
The "conceptual" accord, which G.M. confirmed today, came as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan met with President Clinton for the first time in Washington. 
 Japan has been under pressure to take concrete steps to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, much of it caused by automobiles and automobile parts.
 
 
History of Cooperation
 Exporting American-made Japanese cars to Japan is not new. Some 37,000 American-made cars were imported by Japan last year, about 20,000 of them Hondas. And G.M. and Toyota, the largest auto manufacturers in their respective countries, already have a history of cooperation.
The two companies operate a factory in Fremont, Calif., that makes both G.M. and Toyota vehicles, some of which are exported worldwide. For General Motors, which sold only about 9,000 passenger cars under its various brand names in Japan last year, selling 20,000 to Toyota would represent a big jump.
But compared with the 1.5 million cars Japan exports to the United States, 20,000 "seems like a drop in the bucket," said Peter Boardman, an auto industry analyst for UBS Phillips & Drew International in Tokyo. "It's well-timed news to calm the political pressure," he said.
 
Sales May Begin in 1996
 A G.M. spokesman in Japan, David G. Bodkin, said that the number of cars involved, which will be right-hand drive models, could reach 20,000 a year and that sales were likely to begin in 1996 or 1997.
Mr. Bodkin would not say which factory would be chosen but said G.M. did not plan to use a plant that had been scheduled to be closed in the company's restructuring.
A Japanese economic newspaper, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported today that the cars to be sold would be new versions of G.M.'s J-car line of subcompacts, which include the Chevrolet Cavalier and the Pontiac Sunbird.

HEADLINE: Clinton Retreats on Jobs Plan, Offering $4 Billion Cut

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
In his first concession on his plan to stimulate the economy, President Clinton today offered to cut $4 billion from the $19.5 billion package. But the overture was immediately spurned by the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, who said trimming some fat off what he called a pork-barrel bill was no gift to American taxpayers.
Mr. Clinton's new proposal, made in the hope of luring some Senate Republicans who are blocking his package into negotiations, would keep intact the entire list of job and social programs in the bill. 
 But it would cut, by 44 percent, money for some of the most disputed items, including grants to local communities to build parks. Republicans have sought instead to eliminate programs entirely or to cut other spending to pay for Mr. Clinton's package.
 
$200 Million in New Spending
 Mr. Clinton's latest overture adds $200 million in new spending to enable cities to rehire about 10,000 laid-off police officers. This was included to force Republicans into a vote against crime-fighting if they want to oppose the package, or give Republicans the cover of hiring more police officers to justify siding with Mr. Clinton, a senior Administration official said.
"Let's see how long Dole wants to stand out there and say he is voting against more cops," the official added.
White House officials said today that they hope the compromise offer will at least embarrass the Kansas Republican -- by making the President look accommodating and Mr. Dole unreasonable and unsympathetic to the plight of millions of Americans who are out of work. The White House released the contents of the new compromise offer to the press before presenting it to Mr. Dole.
But Mr. Dole and his aides greeted these tactics with amused contempt. Mr. Dole has made clear that he believes he not only has the backing of his own party, but also a lot of support from the public and some Senate Democrats as well.
 
Puns From Dole
 Mr. Dole has been dismissing Mr. Clinton's overtures with a stream of faxes, puns and declarations that do not exactly evince awe for the White House. Mr. Dole's latest statement, faxed to news bureaus in Washington, was headlined: "Gridlock Begins In Oval Office: New Clinton Budget-Buster No Compromise. Once Again Flunks Deficit Test."
Mr. Dole said his party would support the $4 billion in unemployment benefits in the package but would only support new spending measures if the President made offsetting cuts in other programs, instead of engaging in more deficit spending.
White House officials, by contrast, are convinced that a majority of the public wants a stimulus bill that will create more jobs, and are hoping that the President's new offer will be enough to encourage four Republican senators to support the package -- enough to give Mr. Clinton the 60 votes he needs to end the Republican filibuster that has blocked a vote on the bill.
"This is a new offer," Vice President Al Gore said an interview this morning on NBC. "Now Senator Dole has not made any counteroffer. Their position apparently is to just do nothing and wait. The President tracked him down in New Hampshire, where he was out on the campaign trail, and asked: 'What about a counteroffer? Can we get this thing moving?' We'll see."
Win or lose, Mr. Clinton is expending a lot of political capital to see the passage of a bill that most economists say will have only a marginal effect on the economy and unemployment rates. The fight with Mr. Dole and his Republican colleagues has already slowed the Administration's early momentum. Coming on top of several other foreign and domestic challenges, it seems to have left the White House feeling a bit rattled.
Mr. Clinton spelled out the compromise offer in a letter to the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, who has been handling the negotiations with the Republicans and will meet with Mr. Dole on Monday.
The latest offer left intact money proposed for building new highways ($2.9 billion), summer jobs for youth ($1 billion), early childhood immunizations ($300 million), AIDS treatment ($200 million), construction of sewage treatment plants ($845 million), hiring more meat inspectors ($4 million), assisting small businesses ($141 million) and $4 billion in extended unemployment compensation benefits.
The projects that would be cut roughly 44 percent across the board include community development block grants, student loans, mass transit and summer schools. The compromise also adds $200 million for "grants to local governments to hire police as a means of helping to fight crime and to offset layoffs resulting from the fiscal constraints on local government."
The White House spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, said the compromise would result in a reduction of about 18 percent of the job-creating potential of the bill, meaning it would probably create about 250,000 new jobs instead of 300,000.
 
Reluctance and Regret
 "I make this recommendation reluctantly and regret the unwillingness of the minority to let the Senate act on the original legislation," Mr. Clinton said in the letter to Mr. Mitchell. "But our mandate is to achieve change and to move our country forward and to end business as usual in Washington."
Mr. Clinton said the compromise was intended to "achieve a significant portion of our original goals" in the face of what he called "an unrelenting filibuster."
Though Democrats hold a 57-to-43 majority over Republicans in the Senate, it takes 60 votes to break a filibuster and no Republicans have split off from their party so far. It takes only 51 to pass the stimulus bill, which Mr. Clinton would have no problem mustering -- even though several Democrats have come out against it in its present form. These include Russell D. Feingold and Herb Kohl, both of Wisconsin; Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.
Mr. Clinton has scheduled a trip to Pittsburgh on Saturday to drum up more public support for his plan. The main reason Pittsburgh was chosen was in hopes of swaying Pennsylvania's Republican Senator, Arlen Specter, a moderate who has spoken in favor of many components of the jobs bill, but was upset by the Clinton Administration's tactic of trying to ram the measure through the Senate without negotiating with the Republicans.
Another reason Pittsburgh was chosen was because Senator Spector is traveling in Africa, and Pittsburgh's airport, where Mr. Clinton will be speaking, was slated to benefit from the stimulus bill. The combination of a junketing Senator opposing money that would help the local community was a bit of symbolism the White House could not pass up.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bonds Retreat From Highs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices slipped from record highs yesterday, closing lower in choppy but slow trading.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32 , with the yield rising to 6.75 percent after sinking to a 16-year low of 6.71 percent on Thursday. 
 Bond prices had established new highs in overseas markets, but traders in the United States saw an opportunity to cash in on the gains when activity shifted to domestic markets, failing to muster the momentum to break through a key psychological level.
 
'Market Is Not Ready'
 "The market is not ready yet to blast through these levels to a lower yield," said Kevin Logan, chief economist in the United States for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Yesterday's volatility followed a recent trend in which bond prices have moved up and down as much as a point in a session because of thin trading. But prices have been trading within a range, with few signals to modify the market's modestly bullish sentiment.
Some selling yesterday may have been prompted by a Government report showing March industrial production unchanged from February, ending a string of five advances.
The market had expected weaker data, and the report initially seemed to increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will maintain its monetary policy, given the relative strength of the economy. The Fed typically lowers interest rates to help stimulate a weak economy, which results in higher bond prices.
The news, however, did little to change the market's tone, said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets. He said "two-tenths in either direction is considered in line with expectations."
Mr. Logan said the next big news could come out of Washington as President Clinton's economic program and health care reform package encounter more hurdles.
"A lot of investors are marking time," he said. "They are sidelined, content with their positions."
Short-term Treasuries were unchanged to 4/32 lower, and intermediate maturities were off 2/32 to 5/32 .
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.61, to 1,302.95.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.88 percent, with the discount yield rising a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 2.83 percent. Six-month yields rose to 3.04 percent, with the discount adding two basis points, to 2.96 percent. One-year yields slipped to 3.18 percent, with the discount off a basis point, to 3.07.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 101 5/8, down 1/8 from Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.91 percent, up from 5.90.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Its Trade Deficit Has Hit a Three-Month High

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
The United States merchandise trade deficit hit a three-month high of $7.2 billion in February, nearly three-fourths of which was with Japan, the Government reported today.
"The Japanese economy is so weak that they are not importing," said Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "Until that economy starts to recover, we won't see any improvement." 
 The report came on the same day that President Clinton met for the first time with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan to discuss trade issues, particularly the American trade deficit with Japan, which reached $49 billion last year, 59 percent of the total for the year.
 
 
Widest Gap Since November
 The Commerce Department said the American gap with its trading partners widened five-tenths of 1 percent in February to the highest level since November, when it was $7.3 billion. It had dipped to $6.9 billion in December before rising to $7.16 billion a month later.
Those figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.
When unadjusted, the deficit totaled $5.7 billion, including $4.1 billion with Japan, 73 percent of the entire shortfall and the highest since a $5.1 billion imbalance last December.
For the year so far, the unadjusted deficit between the two countries was $8 billion, 68 percent of the $11.8 billion American imbalance. The Commerce Department does not make seasonal adjustments by countries.
The Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, said in a statement that an improvement in the American-Japanese trade situation would be a "driving item" during his visit to Japan next week.
The report said exports, a big source of strength for the American economy for four years, virtually stalled in February, inching up a barely perceptible one-tenth of a percent, to $37.2 billion.
 At the same time, imports increased only two-tenths of a percent, to $44.4 billion. The deficit is the difference between the two.

HEADLINE: March Industrial Output Unchanged

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Held down by the East Coast blizzard in mid-March, industrial output remained unchanged for the month after posting five straight advances, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
But since most analysts had expected a modest decline, based mainly on employment and workweek data published two weeks ago, the results were considered in line with continued moderate economic expansion. At month's end, the Government is expected to report first-quarter growth in gross domestic product of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. 
 "Production has been chugging along" to replenish inventories depleted by the holiday buying surge, said Robert T. McGee, senior economist for the Tokai Bank.
 
February Output Revised Upward
 Today's report also showed that production climbed six-tenths of a percent in February compared with the gain of four-tenths of a percent initially estimated. January's output, however, was revised downward by two-tenths of a point.
Separately, the University of Michigan told subscribers to its survey of consumer confidence that the preliminary April reading was 84, down slightly from the 85.9 final for March.
While the Fed cited the blizzard as a factor in the flat industrial performance last month, neither it nor other analysts would estimate how much the storm dampened output in March. Most assumed there would have been at least a small overall gain without the storm, but they also noted that it was a positive factor in the utility sector, since it prompted consumers and businesses to turn up the heat.
"Things were a little soft because of the weather," said Darwin L. Beck, a one-time Fed employee who is now an economist for the First Boston Corporation. But, he added, "one never knows" how much of a factor a storm might have been or how much lost production might be regained.
Without adjustment for usual seasonal variations, industrial production fell seven-tenths of a percent last month after jumping 3 percent in February.
 
Capacity Use Is Up
 In addition, the Fed's compilation showed that the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.9 percent of capacity in March, the same pace first reported for February. The upward revision in February output, however, pushed utilization for that month to 80.1 percent, the first time since December 1990 -- when it was in recessionary decline -- that the rate exceeded 80 percent.
The March operating rate for factories was 79.1 percent -- 2.4 points above the year-earlier pace -- while mines operated at 81.8 percent and utilities at 88.3 percent.
Output at factories was up one-tenth of a percent for the month, the Fed reported, with the storm taking its biggest toll on textiles, steel, furniture, tobacco and coal mining. Production from mines and oil and gas wells slumped 1.2 percent, the fourth straight decline, while the gain for utilities was eight-tenths of a percent.
Motor vehicles were assembled at an annual rate of 11 million, down from 11.2 million in February and 11.5 million in January, and production of aircraft and gasoline also declined. Cutbacks in military and space equipment remained a restraint on industry, the Fed said.
 
Appliance Output Rises
 The losses were offset mostly by increases in output of appliances and by residential utilities.
Production of business equipment rose four-tenths of a percent, but this came after gains averaging more than 1 percent a month since October, the Fed also pointed out.
At 112.0, the Index of Industrial Production stands 12 percent higher than its 1987 average and 4.1 percent above its level of March 1992.

HEADLINE: Changing Times: Push-Button Fires

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHEL, Vt.

 BODY:
David F. Knowles, secret weapon in hand, stood before a stove with cheery yellow flames dancing over a stack of gnarly logs. The winter just ended was another mediocre one for his industry, wood stoves, but in his palm was his wait-until-next-year weapon, a black plastic box that looked suspiciously like a remote control unit borrowed from a television set.
It was. One click and the flames disappeared. Another and they suddenly came back. And the stove does not burn wood at all; the logs are ceramic, and -- no fuss and no bother -- the merry flames come from natural gas. 
 Remote control? Imitation wood? From Vermont Castings, which made a name for itself in the 1970's and early 1980's with stoves named "Defiant," "Resolute" and "Vigilant?"
 Even in Vermont, whose main exports are maple syrup and New England charm, the 80's took their toll. Oil became cheap and wood expensive; environmental regulators said stoves were big sources of air pollution. People changed, too; the radical back-to-the-land types who once demonstrated to Free Huey and Free the Chicago 7 got more interested in free checking and free parking. So the company, after some corporate misadventures, is trying to catch up with its market.
"We have something for everyone," said Mr. Knowles, the company's research and development director, his face fairly glowing. "There are people who like to dump wood on the stove, and there are people who just like to come home and have a fire," he added.
Vermont Castings recently introduced the gas stove that starts at the touch of a button; full-scale production will begin soon on the remote control model, in time for next winter's heating season. Soon after will come a remote with a temperature dial in the middle; leave it set to the desired level, and the stove will automatically keep the room heated to that temperature. Some models even forsake the macho cast iron in favor of Italian ceramic stove bodies.
 The company won a cult-like following in the 70's and 80's of die-hard, penny-pinching New England Yankees. The owners prospered in the oil price shocks of the 1970's but stayed so folksy that they invited all their customers to an annual "Owners Outing" picnic on a verdant mountainside here, with fiddle music and plant tours; sometimes 10,000 attended.
It was a peculiarly conservative business; the company would not build a stove until the customer put down a deposit, and there was no sales network. Most buyers appeared with pick-up trucks to haul their purchases home.
In 1983, one of the co-founders, Murray Howell, died of cancer. In 1988, the management saddled itself with debt to buy out its largest competitor, Consolidated Dutchwest, and made extensive changes to its foundry in Randolph, just up the road from Bethel, to produce the Consolidated Dutchwest stoves.
The Environmental Protection Agency required that smoke output be cut by more than 80 percent for health reasons. For Vermont Castings, like the rest of the industry, that meant extensive redesign, and in some cases, catalytic converters akin to the ones on cars. The changes promoted fuller combustion, and therefore more heat per log. But the company's owners ran short of capital.
Further, over the course of the 80's, the price of home heating oil fell by nearly half, in inflation-adjusted terms. The old New England adage that wood warms you twice -- once when you chop it and again when you burn it -- began losing its charm. Sales plunged.
 
New Owners
 In May 1990, Vermont Castings' chief creditor, Pacificorp Financial Services of Portland, Ore., stepped in. Now, according to a spokesman, Jeff Wakefield, "the plaid-shirt types are gone." The new owners have brought in a new marketing team, from companies like Mennen and Gillette, and new products.
The gas stoves (or "hearth appliances," as the catalogue calls them), in red, blue, sand, antique brown and midnight black, now account for 15 percent of sales. They, and a stove that burns wood pellets and is controlled by a computer-like circuit board, have restored the company to profitability; 1992 was the first time in 13 years that sales volume grew, according to the firm, with total sales of about $40 million. In North America, it was the company's best year since 1981, when oil prices were at their peak.
For the industry, sales in 1992 were between 150,000 and 160,000 units, roughly the same as the year before, with the market divided among some 50 manufacturers. At the beginning of the 80's there were about 350 manufacturers, turning out more than 500,000 units a year, according to the industry's trade association. Formerly the Wood Heating Alliance, it became the Hearth Products Association in 1991, reflecting the members' search for new products.
Vermont Castings introduced new business practices -- charge accounts, a network of dealers and wholesale pricing that equalizes retail prices around the country. Phoenix, not known for its winters, is a big growth market, said William J. Mathewson, vice president for marketing and sales, and a former vice president of Mennen U.S.A. On the other hand, there will be no more picnics. "Liability problems, things like that," he said.
"The real source of the decline was the bloom coming off the energy crisis," said Carter E. Keithley, president of the Hearth Products Association, which has about 1,500 members. Gas, he said, offers "the convenience factor," and with about 51 million American homes with gas service, a huge market awaits. The industry estimates that nearly two-thirds of those homes have wood fireplaces, ripe for conversion.
Not that efficiency is the goal in the gas-burning models either; they are purposely carbureted badly, to make the flame yellow instead of blue.
The stove industry's turnabout is all the more striking because for a time in the 70's and early 80's, Federal law banned new ornamental gas appliances, because gas was thought to be in short supply. After price controls were lifted, drillers found extensive new reserves and flooded the market.
Vermont Castings is far from alone; the American Gas Association now lists 34 hearth stove manufacturers, up from 5 in 1987.
Wood stove sales still outnumber gas stove sales, especially in places where people cut their own wood. And a replacement market is developing, sometimes aided by local air pollution control officials. In 1991, for example, Crested Butte, Colo., began charging people with uncontrolled wood stoves $30 a month, to encourage them to switch to cleaner models.
 
High Price of Wood
 But in large metropolitan areas, wood is uncompetitive.
"It's probably much more expensive than oil," said Charles G. Ehrens, who has stopped offering wood stoves in his Leisure Unlimited chain of stores in Hartsdale, N.Y., and Danbury, Westport, Orange and West Hartford in Connecticut. And wood was never easy anyway, he said.
"I was not prepared to get up every morning and worry about the damn stove," he said. "I'm not a back woodsman. It doesn't give you fast heat. A stove is meant to burn all day, day in and day out."
Although the stove market may not grow much, Mr. Mathewson thinks Vermont Castings' share of it can. The trick, he said, is to interest homeowners, and especially home buyers, in more than just a wood stove, but a particular brand. "Stoves are the most under-marketed product in the country," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Clinton Backs Stronger Yen And Dollar Sinks Against It

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar plunged to a new postwar low against the Japanese yen yesterday as President Clinton, emerging from trade talks with Japan's Prime Minister, stressed support for a stronger yen.
The remarks came after new trade figures showed that Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States swelled further in February. 
 But the dollar advanced against the German mark and other leading European currencies, which were affected more than the dollar was by the yen's surge.
Gold rose in New York but was mixed overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.80 an ounce to $339. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $338.50 an ounce, up $1.90.
Reports swept the market this week that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan would like to see a higher yen as a way to make Japanese products more expensive on world markets, which would help to pare the country's trade surplus.
 
Further Drop in New York
 After falling against the yen in Tokyo and European markets, the dollar retreated further in New York when the Commerce Department reported that the United States merchandise trade deficit hit a three-month high of $7.2 billion in February. Nearly three-fourths of the deficit was with Japan.
The dollar plummeted to 112.15 yen around midafternoon, its lowest point since World War II, after Mr. Clinton told reporters that the trade surplus could be pared by "No. 1, the appreciation of the Japanese yen."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 112.95 yen, down 0.48 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, it fell to 112.60 yen. By late afternoon in New York, the dollar settled at 112.30 yen, down from 113.10 yen late Thursday.
Mr. Clinton's remark eased concerns that the seven leading industrial nations would intervene to halt the rise of the yen, which has gained as much as 10 percent this year against the dollar.
The mark, hurt by pervasive weakness in the German economy, was pummeled the most as traders sold it to buy yen. The weaker mark helped the dollar score gains against other European currencies.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Pork and Cattle Prices Fall; Lumber Continues to Surge

BYLINE: By ReutersReuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 16

 BODY:
Pork prices fell sharply today after the weekly pace of hog slaughters picked up, resulting in selling that also put pressure on cattle prices.
In other commodity markets, lumber prices jumped the $10 limit for the second consecutive day, most grain prices tumbled and energy prices eased. 
 The hog slaughter jumped to 1.8 million head in the last week, according to Government estimates, lifting the projected supply. The slaughter was below expectations in recent weeks.
 
'Real Jittery'
"The trading is real jittery over this hog slaughter coming in over 1.7 million. We finally penetrated some real key support areas in live hogs," said Dennis Smith, livestock analyst with the Linnco Futures Group.
Traders will take their cue on Monday from hog marketing levels in the Midwest; analysts said a daily run of more than 100,000 head would keep pressure on prices.
Falling hog prices also pushed down already weak live cattle prices for delivery in April, which dropped 0.875 cent, to 81.025 cents a pound. April feeder cattle was unchanged at 85.6 cents.
Lumber prices hit the daily limit of $10 for 1,000 board feet for the second consecutive session, feeding off a cash market for spruce. May lumber closed at $365.30 for 1,000 board feet.
After spending most of the day in the doldrums, corn and soybean futures came to life late in the session as traders representing commodity funds sold. Two meteorologists contradicted the National Weather Service and said warm, dry air would edge into the Midwest next week, drying out the saturated soil.
The commodity funds had held large positions in the soybean complex, betting on a rally tied to inflation fears. But recent data have dispelled those fears.
Crude oil for May fell 8 cents, to $20.14 a barrel; May heating oil eased 0.05 cent, to 55.87 cents a gallon, and May unleaded gasoline dipped 0.09 cent, to 60.34 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
I.R.A.'s Yes, but They're Not Only Kid on Block

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
IN the pamphlets and advertisements pouring forth from banks, brokerage firms and mutual funds, I.R.A.'s are the financial equivalent of vitamin E -- a way to prevent all ills. To scoop up I.R.A. accounts and other retirement savings, Merrill Lynch, for example, has churned out a large-format, 521-page hardcover guide, with a cardboard calculator bound in. Those wanting to guarantee a healthy retirement should buy the book and bench-press it 10 times every morning.
Lately, individual retirement accounts have become an easy sell. I.R.A. investments, off sharply in the late 1980's after Congress restricted their tax deductibility, have come roaring back. 
 Financial advisers strongly recommend that the roughly half of all workers who can still take I.R.A. tax deductions do so. Employees with no corporate retirement plans, as well as joint filers earning less than $50,000 and individuals earning less than $35,000, remain eligible for at least partial deductibility.
For those who cannot take deductions, some advisers show less enthusiasm than many financial merchants. Just the record-keeping to separate deductible and taxable contributions and calculate the taxes decades later causes even some accountants to wince.
Before making nondeductible I.R.A. contributions, investors should set aside all they can through other deductible channels. These include 401(k) plans at many corporations and Keogh and simplified employee pensions (S.E.P.'s) for small businesses and the self-employed.
Then, those saving for retirement should compare the tax-free returns available from municipal bonds and, perhaps, the tax-deferred merits of annuities. Municipals have the advantage of paying interest that remains free of most taxes. I.R.A. earnings are taxed when withdrawn.
Especially for those cautious investors who favor bonds, buying municipals outside their I.R.A.'s can make the most sense, said Lewis J. Altfest, an investment adviser in New York. Corporate and government bonds or bond funds, common I.R.A. vehicles, do pay higher interest rates than municipals. (A point lost on the wretches whose I.R.A.'s hold $51 million in municipal bond funds, sacrificing yield for a redundant tax advantage). Currently, Treasury bonds pay about 6.7 percent, municipal bonds about 5.9 percent.
But eventual taxes on I.R.A. withdrawals could leave the ultimate returns on the corporate and government bonds below those available from municipals. "In the case of the I.R.A., we're getting tax deferral," Mr. Altfest said. "We're not getting tax elimination. In the case of the muni, we never have to pay taxes."
The surge in retirement saving has also washed into annuities. Until recently, annuities were looking rather tired and wan. They offered only narrow investment choices, high fees and other restrictions that largely limited their appeal to older investors. Then their backers took some lessons from the marketers at the brokerage firms and mutual funds.
Now, it's as if annuities have just emerged from an extended stay at the Golden Door health spa. Wood Logan Associates, which sells its Venture annuities through brokerage firms including Paine Webber and Shearson Lehman Brothers, expects to pick up $1 billion this year, up from $632 million last year.
There are fixed annuities, which guarantee steady but relatively low returns without the risk of loss, and variable annuities, which can be invested in stock, bond or money market funds. Investors pay taxes on their contributions, but their earnings accumulate tax-free until withdrawn.
Wood Logan promotes its annuities as P.R.A.'s, or private retirement accounts. "It looks, acts and breathes just like an I.R.A.," said Doug Wood, the firm's chairman.
But they still sometimes quack. For one thing, variable annuities tend to have much higher annual fees and expenses, typically more than 2 percent a year, about twice as much as those of mutual funds available in I.R.A.'s. Although some variable annuity sponsors like to call them no-load, redemption fees often range from about 7 percent for those wanting to cash out within in a year to perhaps 2 percent within 7 years.
Some fixed annuities, however, are paying a percentage point more than risk-averse investors can earn from buying certificates of deposit for their I.R.A.'s. All annuities are free of any ceilings on annual contributions, an attraction for some investors who have already reached their $2,000 annual I.R.A. limits.
The annuities and the I.R.A.'s share a paradoxical advantage over investments that are not shielded from taxes. Any withdrawals before age 59 1/2 suffer a 10 percent penalty in addition to regular income taxes.
"We're not a saving nation, and this forces people to save," said Stuart Kessler, senior tax partner at Goldstein, Golub Kessler & Company, accountants in New York. He recommends nondeductible I.R.A. contributions.
The higher taxes sought by President Clinton would provide an added incentive for tax-deferred savings. And Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, formerly the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sponsored a bill last year to restore the broad deductibility of I.R.A. contributions. Part of a tax bill vetoed by President Bush, the measure is bound to be revived.
Despite all the inducements from Washington and Wall Street, Americans are unlikely to become as thrifty as, say, the Japanese. Even though many younger people -- fearful of losing their jobs, uncertain about pensions or Social Security -- are starting I.R.A.'s, they are unlikely to save at the same rate as their parents.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Your Own 401(k)?
Q. Is it possible for an employee to arrange a 401(k) plan on her own?
 GAIL HARRINGTON, Larchmont, N.Y.
A. No. "The Internal Revenue Code restricts such arrangements to qualified pension, profit-sharing and stock bonus plans maintained by employers," said William J. Arnone, director of financial and retirement planning for Buck Consultants of New York.
Individuals may, of course, set up their own individual retirement plans, which allow tax-deferred investment earnings to accumulate as with a 401(k) savings plan. And self-employed people can establish a simplified employee pension, known as a S.E.P., which operates under the same basic rules as an I.R.A., or a Keogh plan, which operates like a 401(k) plan.
 
 
 
Broker-Held Securities
Q. What are the pros and cons of leaving your securities in the custody of a broker?
 MILDRED D. MAILICK, Forest Hills, Queens
A. A big advantage of keeping securities in the custody of a brokerage firm is that you don't have to worry about safeguarding them or delivering them at the time of sale. There is also generally an automatic deposit of your interest and dividends into some type of interest-bearing money market account at the firm.
"The major disadvantage is that you become tied to the broker who sold the securities to you and whose commissions probably cannot be negotiated," said Kenneth Janke, president of the National Association of Investors Corporation.
In addition, you cannot enter a company's dividend reinvestment plan when your stock is registered in the broker's name. And if the broker has financial difficulties -- even with the insurance protection for customer assets that most firms have -- there may be delays before you can reclaim your securities.
 
 
 
Callable Treasury Bonds
 Q. Why doesn't the Treasury issue bonds with a callable feature?
 WILLIAM H. O'BEIRNE, Brooklyn,
A. Callable debt is redeemable by the issuer before the scheduled maturity date, with calls usually made when the issuer can save money by floating new debt at a lower interest rate. The Federal Government did sell callable bonds in the past and about two dozen issues are still outstanding. But it stopped selling them when it instituted the Strips program in the mid-1980's, a system that led to the separate trading of the principal and interest on its bonds.
"In a system like that, it's pretty inconvenient to have callable bonds," said Deborah Danker, Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary for Federal Finance. "If the bonds could be called, an investor could never be sure that the interest payments would actually be made in later years."
From a broader perspective, the question relates to the fact that the Government considers itself a large enough entity to self-insure. A call on a bond usually requires a higher interest rate -- in effect, an insurance premium -- that Washington chooses not to pay.

HEADLINE: Lowering the Passions Over Trade

 BODY:
Standing between President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan during their talks yesterday in Washington was a looming $50 billion trade imbalance. Mr. Clinton labeled the deficit unacceptable and warned that it jeopardized cooperation between the two economic superpowers. Also turning up the heat on the trade dispute are powerful industrialists threatened by Japanese exports; U.S. automobile manufacturers took out a full-page newspaper ad yesterday calling the trade deficit with Japan "priority number one."
Though the two leaders were polite during a press conference following their talks, belligerence was close to the surface. That's too bad, because the trade deficit is a poor reason to drive a wedge between important allies. 
 The U.S. trade deficit reflects a home-grown problem that can be solved with home-grown remedies. Americans buy more goods than they produce; the difference is imported from abroad. If Americans spent less -- saved more -- the trade deficit would disappear. Japan, which saves four times more than the U.S., runs persistent trade surpluses.
Japan does block some U.S. exports. So there is reason for Mr. Clinton to pry open Japanese markets. If Japan imported more supercomputers, medical technology and semiconductors, American workers could concentrate in high-wage jobs -- a marginal but welcome boost to living standards.
But America's economic malaise cannot be cured by bashing Japan. The remedy is to raise savings -- most easily by cutting the Federal budget deficit -- and to raise public and private investment. That, of course, is the core of Mr. Clinton's domestic plan.
The danger is that Mr. Clinton will accept the advice of those urging him to wipe out the trade deficit by fiat: Tell the Japanese how many more U.S. semiconductors and supercomputers they must buy and how many fewer cars they will be allowed to sell. But Tokyo could enforce such edicts only by replacing market decisions with bureaucratic controls -- an odd message from a country that's lecturing Russia to do the opposite.
Besides, trade-by-fiat would prove contagious; Europe, with which the U.S. runs a trade surplus, wouldn't take long to limit U.S. exports. In the end, trade would be stunted and middle-class consumers would face higher prices.
Judging from their remarks, the two leaders tried to turn down the flames heating up trade resentment. They agreed to focus future negotiations on opening up sectors where exports are blocked -- holding each country to rules of fair trade. But if enforcing fair rules slips into enforcing strict quantitative results, the two countries will reignite destructive political and economic passions.

TO BE MAYOR OF NEW YORK
Ethnic Politics in the City.
By Chris McNickle.
Illustrated. 403 pp. New York:
Columbia University Press. $29.95. 
 TWO years ago the chairman of the Budapest City Council's Committee on Human Rights and Minorities spent several weeks surveying the Balkanization of New York City. In Budapest, Dr. Gabor Nagy said, the predominant minority group, the Gypsies, constitutes only about 10 percent of the population. In New York, as he discovered while observing the first campaign for an expanded City Council, political power is more fragmented.
"This is not just a city of ethnic concerns," Dr. Nagy concluded. "It's a city that requires taxation and services. This guy will represent the gays and that one the African-Americans and this one the Hispanic people and that one the Asians.
"But who," he asked, "will represent the majority?"
The answer is simple: it is supposed to be the Mayor. In New York, though, there is a second part to the question that is considerably more challenging: exactly who, in a shifting constellation of fading and rising stars, is the majority? Whoever is elected Mayor this year will preside as his constituents begin to mark the centennial of greater New York. (In 1898, what are now the five boroughs joined together as a single city.) Given the intensity of tribal politics, it seems remarkable that New Yorkers have stuck together so long. Two scholarly analyses illuminate an unsurprising conclusion about New York's current political cohesion: race coupled with ethnicity and religion, more than class, galvanizes and unites the city's shrinking white majority as the century ends.
John H. Mollenkopf's new study, "A Phoenix in the Ashes," is a thorough, if sometimes pedantic, analysis of the changing electorate on which Edward I. Koch capitalized to become New York's 105th Mayor in 1977 and which, having continued to change, discarded him 12 years later. "To Be Mayor of New York," by Chris McNickle, is an encyclopedic overview from the 1880's to the present; it contributes the vital context in which to consider today's events.
Historical perspective is the one ingredient lacking in Mr. Mollenkopf's otherwise instructive account, which amplifies on demographic research he did as a political science professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Mr. Mollenkopf suggests that Mr. Koch actively exploited middle-class white fears of black and Hispanic encroachment and capitalized on the divisions among his opponents; dispensed "new patronage" to a network of community service providers; struck an accommodation with a rebounding regular Democratic Party organization; and forged a growth-minded coalition with real-estate developers and the corporate elite. "His genius," Mr. Mollenkopf writes, "lay in his ability to construct a new kind of dominant political coalition that made the pursuit of economic growth a politically rational thing to do."
Mr. Koch's successor, David N. Dinkins, benefited from a New York tradition of interracial trust to fashion a "black-led, biracial and multiethnic insurgent coalition," Mr. Mollenkopf writes. But, he continues, except perhaps for the racial card, Mr. Dinkins's agenda as Mayor has seemed strikingly similar to Mr. Koch's. This finely nuanced and sophisticated analysis (supplemented with research by Charles Brecher and Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission) suffers only when it lapses into jargon and seems to infer too much from voting patterns.
Mr. McNickle's history of ethnic succession, and of ethnic secession from changing majorities, is the product of a dangerous exercise: transforming a doctoral dissertation in history into a book. In this case, the author has succeeded. Mr. McNickle, a pension fund consultant, locates the seeds of the Koch coalition in the 1960's, when the city's white majority began to put aside historical ethnic and religious rivalries. "A political alliance emerged in the wake of that decade led by not-so-liberal Jews, supported by Irish Catholics, Italian Catholics and other whites," he writes. "Racial tension held it together."
"To Be Mayor of New York" is a reminder that in a city where ethnic politics is a preoccupation, mayoral campaigns are a continuum punctuated by periodic pauses for governing. Such an overview vividly recalls the era of the balanced ticket, the collapse of the Democratic machine, the depth of dissatisfaction among the many whites who believed the Lindsay administration was favoring blacks, the rise and fall of ethnic hegemonies, and the us-is-them incorporation of the reform movement into the Democratic Party hierarchy. The largely chronological view draws heavily on published accounts and is burdened by some incidental, if enlightening, asides. (Mr. Dinkins, who has been mocked for showering frequently, might be reassured by the reminder that Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri regularly got rubdowns on a City Hall massage table.)
SPRINKLED through the text are revealing anecdotes gleaned from the author's own interviews, such as a 1969 episode in which Mr. Lindsay's campaign manager, Richard Aurelio, and the Manhattan Republican leader, Vincent F. Albano Jr., browbeat Sanford Garelik, Chief Inspector of the Police Department, to accept the nomination for City Council President on a fusion ticket. "What kind of man are you?" Mr. Aurelio demanded repeatedly of Mr. Garelik, finally prompting Mr. Albano to whisper the cautionary advice: "Christ, Dick, remember he's got a gun."
"To Be Mayor of New York" is an engaging history that is short on analysis but makes a fine introduction to Mr. Mollenkopf's deconstruction of the Koch coalition. Readers for whom time is at a premium might skip Mr. McNickle's account of the Koch administration altogether and go directly to his conclusion: "The various candidates for Mayor in New York have often taken nearly identical positions on local political matters. As a result, citizens cast their votes on the basis of the image the candidates present, not the policies they define. The vote is not a selection of a series of programs. It is a statement of the kind of world the voter would like to see."
That the candidates so often sound alike places a greater premium on how they look. "To be Mayor of New York," Mr. McNickle writes, "requires a leader who can reconcile the competing visions the city's ethnic groups hold of the metropolis, at least in sufficient measure to win the confidence of a majority."
Regardless of how they sound or look while they are running, candidates often tend to act similarly once they win. Getting re-elected requires not only the promise of reconciliation, but the demonstrated leadership and vision that denies rivals a compelling rationale. Mr. Mollenkopf suggests one vehicle for Mr. Dinkins to use to contribute a new dimension to New York City politics: "an alliance between the city workers and community-based organizations who produce public services and the neighborhood residents who use them." But in every potential ash heap, another would-be Phoenix lies in wait. As a consequence of the Mayor's caution, Mr. Mollenkopf concludes, "the Dinkins coalition may founder, as have many of its reform predecessors, on its internal contradictions, opening the way to efforts to restore the Koch coalition in some new form."

HEADLINE: 24 Candidates in Search of a City

BYLINE: By Jane Fritsch; Jane Fritsch, a former political reporter for The Los Angeles Times, is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
On the umpteenth wet and dreary day of a peculiar California winter, the drought-resistant plants are drowning in the muck in Ed Begley Jr.'s front yard. Atop his cozy, unpretentious house, solar panels search the sky in vain for sunlight. Inside, the gangly actor pads around in tennis shoes, greeting guests and switching off lights.
Two dozen people who don't have to be anywhere at 9:30 on a weekday morning mill about in Begley's living room, sipping mugs of coffee in the energy-saving gloom. They are middle-aged, liberal and well-to-do, and some are involved in the entertainment industry. The license plate on a new Pontiac van parked out front broadcasts the good fortune of its owner: GOTAGIG. 
 They are the elite of Southern California's environmental movement, a potent political force, and they have paid as much as $5,000 for the privilege of grilling candidates at intimate gatherings about pollution, recycling, conservation and, lately, a novel proposal to turn the concrete-lined Los Angeles River into a freeway on days when it is dry. This morning's guest is Michael Woo, one of the front-runners in the race for Mayor of Los Angeles.
Begley introduces Woo, an old friend, and settles down on the hardwood floor. Woo takes command. In khaki pants and a sport jacket, the 41-year-old City Councilman and student of urban planning sets off on an upscale version of his standard speech.
These balding men with pony tails, these women in earth tones and sensible shoes, are his intellectual equals and philosophical soul mates -- the sort of people a fellow like Woo should be able to count on. He wants to become the first Asian-American mayor of a major American city. What more likely group to embrace that progressive notion? Woo is at ease. The river plan is a "dumb idea" cooked up by one of his opponents. He punches home his points with confidence. Conservation. Electric cars. Coalitions. Big development. Congealed traffic.
In another year, those themes might have galvanized a roomful of environmentalists, but there is something else in the air this morning, and a 40-ish man in an impatient mood gives voice to it. What, he demands, would Woo do to stem the tide of illegal immigrants in Southern California?
Woo, the son of a Chinese immigrant, stiffens. "I will not," he scolds, "support any effort to scapegoat immigrants for our economic problems here."
A no-nonsense voice rises from the couch near the window. This time it's a woman, annoyed that there are just "too many children" in Los Angeles. What, she would like to know, does Woo propose to do about that?
Woo takes a breath, then parries: Family planning is a good idea, but he has no interest in appearing to be anti-child. And besides, there's a limit to what a mayor can do.
It was a strangely hostile exchange, given the liberal bent of the group, but this is an odd time in Los Angeles politics. The citizens of the nation's second-largest city are cranky and out of sorts, having been brought up short nearly a year ago by three enervating days of riots. The old illusion of a glittering polyglot -- the capital of the Pacific Rim for the 21st century, as they liked to predict -- seems childishly optimistic now. The great urban laboratory has exploded, and the best thinkers in town are not certain how to piece it together again.
Like the desert plants drowning in the unexpected rain, the people of Los Angeles are confronting a future they had not prepared for in a city that suddenly seems unfamiliar.
Even the grafitti seems more brazen now. A sleek new traffic sign high above the Hollywood Freeway is unreadable, its electronic messages obscured by the jagged, illegible scrawl of a daredevil.
For all the city's laid-back image, this is an epochal time in its history. The people of Los Angeles mourn the death of a city that never was, that lived largely in the imaginations of the desperate, the bored, the dissatisfied, the seekers of fortune. They had come from Buffalo and Toledo and Kansas City, their notions of aquamarine waters and sparkling lights formed in darkened movie theaters in the dead of winter.
When they arrived, they saw what they wanted to see; the closer the resemblance to the dream, the greater the testament to their cleverness in having chosen it.
At this time of great municipal angst comes what could be one of the most significant mayoral elections in the city's history. In its broadest context, the election is a referendum on whether this city of 3.4 million people wants to take its future in hand with new policies aimed at all its economic and ethnic groups, or continue on the path that has been good for the businessmen who have controlled the public agenda -- and hope that this will somehow be good for the uneasy masses.
Tom Bradley, the placid figure who presided over Los Angeles for two decades of intoxicating growth, decided after the riots not to run again. For most of his tenure, he had been a popular figure, but the city's helplessness in the face of the mayhem last spring took a toll on his image. The son of sharecroppers, Bradley was the city's first black mayor. As a police officer, he went to law school and learned to speak the language of the white businessmen whose support he would assiduously court in his later years.
New construction ran virtually unchecked during the Bradley era. Gleaming downtown office towers seemed to spring up daily, and the last big chunk of untouched land in the far reaches of the San Fernando Valley is now being developed into expensive homes that, inevitably, will be sold to the well-off people -- the white people -- who can afford them.
Embraced by the world of the white and the powerful, Bradley had returned the affection. His quiet style and patrician manner put the city at ease and allowed the better-off to indulge in the fantasy that there were no serious ethnic or racial problems -- among whites, blacks, Asians and the fast-growing Hispanic population -- in their sunny paradise. But the people who had once found comfort in Bradley's quiescence would be looking for a more dynamic leader in 1993, and Bradley sensed that.
The rioting "tore at my heart," he said last fall, conceding that the time for change had come. At 75, he would make his exit as gracefully as possible, under the circumstances, leaving the citizens of Los Angeles to assess what the city was and what it wants to become.
Los Angeles has always been a self-conscious city, acutely so since the widely broadcast beating of Rodney King led it to question its most basic assumptions about its character. The public soul-searching was ratcheted up by the riots that followed the acquittals of the police officers who had beaten King.
No single person can restore the city's self-esteem, but the history of urban America is filled with giant personages -- La Guardia, Daley and even Los Angeles's own rough-hewn Sam Yorty -- who have embodied the essence of their cities and become symbols as much as chief executives. Los Angeles's opportunity to find such a figure is here again.
It is emblematic of the confusion that has engulfed the city that 24 candidates are on the ballot for Tuesday's primary election, each offering the voters a version of the dream. (A list of the candidates appears on page 36.)
There is Richard J. Riordan, the ultra-wealthy, law-and-order conservative who remembers the freewheeling days of a young Los Angeles when he made his fortune, and business was unhampered by City Hall. With some tinkering, he feels, that could happen again.
There is Joel Wachs, who would "empower all the people," as he is fond of saying, so that Los Angeles can be everything to everyone.
There are the fringe candidates, like Julian Nava, the prickly academic who would station as many as 10,000 Federal troops in the city's streets as a prophylactic measure until the people can be trusted to behave themselves.
There is the Greek-born businessman Nick Patsaouras, who has a radical vision of Los Angeles as a great European city, where people get out of their cars to stroll grand boulevards, patronize local shops -- and meet their neighbors.
And there is Woo, who offers the voters a chance to choose as their new public face a seemingly genial young man who fits the stereotype of the new wave of industrious, polite and clean-living Asian immigrants, with a little of Bill Clinton thrown in. Such a candidate may be particularly attractive to white liberals, for whom guilt over the condition of the less-fortunate competes daily with images of hostile minority members rampaging through the city. In its most cynical interpretation, Woo's candidacy enables whites to vote for a minority candidate without voting for someone who is black or Hispanic.
THE WEST BEACH CAFE IS filling up with the evening crowd when Anthony L. Vaughn walks in and is led to a booth near the back, next to the big corner table where Carlos Santana, the musician, is having dinner with friends. It's a trendy place near the ocean in the funky Venice district, and Vaughn, who has a home nearby, is used to seeing celebrities here. But Santana, that's special. He's from a better time -- the 60's -- an era when Los Angeles was a city without limits, when people cared about politics, when Anthony Vaughn cared about politics.
At 41, after a two-decade lapse, Vaughn has become interested in politics again. He thinks he is typical of some young professionals whose fortunes soared during an era of self-involvement. In this land brimming with distractions, it was easy to lose track of humdrum municipal affairs. So many beaches, so much money to be made, so many deals to be done.
Vaughn surveys the menu, and rejects item after item. Salads, pastas, grilled vegetables. Very California. Something catches his eye. "Would anyone be offended if I ordered a steak?" he asks in the most apologetic of tones. Permission is granted.
Vaughn has done a lot of thinking about the state of his city since he saw the smoke rising in the eastern sky a year ago. He and his friends have spent some time talking it over, probably more time in the last year than they had in the last 20. He has come to some conclusions about himself that are not particularly flattering.
"I think I got caught up in the 80's, and a lot of people got caught up," he said. "I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and everybody else's problems were everybody else's problems. What got us into trouble was that everybody just got so selfish."
He is not sure that a mayor can accomplish much now, but he says the next choice Los Angeles makes will be extraordinarily significant.
"I think it's important symbolically, if not effectively, to have minorities in high positions of power," he said. "I think that Woo would be good for Los Angeles."
Like many in Los Angeles, Vaughn knows that Woo was constantly on television denouncing Daryl F. Gates, the rogue police chief, before, during and after the riots. All that was fine, because Vaughn didn't have much use for Gates's bullying either.
Still, Vaughn is uneasy about Woo. Beyond the Gates controversy, he doesn't know much about Woo, or most of the others in the race for that matter. "I don't trust him and I don't know why," Vaughn said.
He wishes that some other candidate would emerge, someone like, say, Bill Clinton, who could inspire the public and raise the city's spirits, but it is difficult for any candidate to catch fire.
The television news producers find the race excruciatingly dull and broadcast little of it. And besides, the television reporters have been preoccupied with the second trial of the officers who beat King -- this time on Federal civil rights charges -- as well as the coming trial of the black youths who attacked Reginald Denny, the white truck driver caught in South-Central Los Angeles when the rioting began.
It is difficult to overstate the effect of the riots on the psyches of the people of Los Angeles.
Vaughn's transformation over the last year has been profound. He has overcome a lifelong distaste for guns and now keeps a .357 Magnum revolver in a locked box near his bed. His friends say they are stunned by this development.
Until the riots, his liberal credentials had been unassailable: he studied law under Bill Clinton at the University of Arkansas, was a labor negotiator for the Screen Actors Guild and was in the kitchen of the old Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968, when Robert Kennedy was shot -- so close, he recalls, that he could smell the gunpowder.
He is keenly aware that he has led a charmed life. He has made so much money as a labor negotiator for film studios that he was able to retire two years ago, at the age of 39. He does as he pleases now: a little volunteer work, trips to museums, things that were unimaginable before.
Still, life in Los Angeles is not what he thought it would be, or might have been, if not for the riots.
He remembers feeling "petrified" the day of the King verdict. "Everyone got scared. I found myself walking around the beach with a baseball bat on my shoulder and my little Lhasa apso dog." Some neighbors, pointing to their chests, confided that they were carrying guns.
That night, he gathered up every potential weapon in the house -- the bat, a BB gun and a hunting knife -- and slept with them. Later, after a moratorium on gun sales was lifted, he bought the .357 Magnum and drove over to the Beverly Hills Gun Club to learn how to shoot it. "I'm convinced," he said, "that I'll have to use it."
IT IS A PECULIARITY of California politics that candidates for local office desperately seek to attach themselves to movie stars. Local elections are by law nonpartisan, so there are no Democrats or Republicans to vouch for anybody or get out the vote. In such a system, name recognition is crucial, and anonymity a formidable enemy.
The 24 names on the ballot will lack any party designations, any hints at all, really, to help voters sort things out. The two who get the most votes will compete in a runoff election in June, assuming no one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote. Anyone who came up with $300 and the signatures of 500 registered voters is in the race. There is an engineer-composer-songwriter; a writer-musician-activist; a tax preparer-actor; a taxi driver. Half are completely unknown.
But there have been some stunning celebrity coups this election season. The most breathtaking was achieved by J. Stanley Sanders, a black lawyer who persuaded Bill Cosby to preside over the opening of his campaign headquarters and sponsor a fund-raising dinner.
Dana Carvey, the comedian, has been making appearances on behalf of Richard Katz, a white legislator from the San Fernando Valley for whom Carvey's wife used to work. "We had more cameras show up for the event with Dana Carvey than we've had for any other press conference," Katz lamented. He may have put together the most formidable stable of stars: Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Hays, Richard Dysart, Polly Bergen, Shaun Cassidy, Dana Delaney and Mary Steenburgen.
And Katz needs all the help he can get. He has been an influential member of the State Assembly for more than a decade, but only about half of the voters had ever heard of him, according to a Los Angeles Times poll early this year. He is hoping the celebrities will draw some attention to his ideas, like the one about selling a city-owned airport to raise money to put cops on the street.
Woo, who has the highest name recognition of all the candidates, is, nonetheless, taking no chances in the celebrity derby. He represents Hollywood on the City Council and has doggedly pursued legislation to help the entertainment industry. In return, he has obtained major financial support from celebrities and others in show business. In addition to Begley and his environmentalist friends, Woo has the endorsement of Lloyd Bridges, the television and movie actor, notwithstanding the fact that Bridges lives in Beverly Hills, beyond the Los Angeles city limits.
And Woo has entered an unlikely alliance with the actor Charlton Heston, a highly visible backer of conservative interests, including the National Rifle Association and William F. Buckley Jr.'s publication, National Review. It is the sort of thing that makes people uneasy about Woo.
Heston was host of a fund-raising dinner for Woo, but Garry South, Woo's campaign spokesman, plays down its significance. "It's based, apparently, on an old friendship," South said. "And celebrities are not as big a deal here as they are in other places. People see them at the grocery store."
Woo has been a high-profile member of the City Council almost since the day he was elected in 1985. He came to prominence as the chief sponsor of a sweeping ethics and campaign financing law. Shortly after the King beating, with an eye on the 1993 mayoral race, he thrust himself into the spotlight again by demanding the resignation of Chief Gates. He was the first city official to do so -- others were waffling, worried that their constituents cared more about law and order than civil rights.
A year later, when Gates's police force failed utterly to either prevent rioting or bring it under control once it started, Woo seemed prescient. And he got the added benefit of countering a perception that he was indecisive and lacked deeply held convictions.
There is a grudging consensus among the city's political leaders and Woo's fellow candidates that his stand on Gates two years ago is responsible for his position as the front-runner now.
By virtue of his standing in the polls, Woo is the enemy. Some of his opponents have taken particular glee in seeing him twist and turn in the face of stinging disclosures about his personal affairs. First, there was the report that Woo was vastly enlarging his hillside home at the same time he was pushing legislation that would all but ban such projects. Then there were the stories raising questions about his handling of campaign funds. These were especially delicious because Woo had taken so much credit for the ethics law.
Still, Woo plods on, pushing his Clintonesque ideas, like the Urban Peace Corps, an organization that would put young people to work on community projects. And he goes out to South-Central Los Angeles as often as he can, to hunt for the black and ethnic-minority votes he knows he will need.
Since the King beating, Woo has been making weekend pilgrimages to black churches. Sometimes the pastors let him take the microphone and talk to the faithful.
But two years of practice have done little to lessen the awkwardness of the scene: a slightly built, bespectacled Asian man sits stiffly off to the side, tapping his delicate fingers on the back of the pew, sometimes clapping tentatively in rhythm with the foot-stomping music.
All patience and graciousness, he waited his turn at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church one Sunday in February. The payoff was a kind introduction by the bombastic pastor, the Rev. Cheviene Jones, who took note that President Clinton was in town -- somewhere nearby, he had heard -- but would not be bothering with this church today. "But this young man thought enough of us to come." Even so, Woo would be allotted only 2.6 minutes, Jones ruled, so he had better get to it. Woo crammed it all in: crime, unity, economic rebirth, a new generation of leadership. A breath. Applause. Some did not clap, but the reception was respectable. On to another stop.
NOT ALL THE VOICES OF post-riot Los Angeles are despairing. Perhaps those who saw the city for what it was, those who had only small dreams, are the happiest now.
Ivon Allen has lived in South-Central, the area hardest-hit by the riots, since she moved there from Arkansas with her husband, John, in 1946. He died in 1975, but his picture has a prominent place on a table in her living room. Her neighbors can see the stone facade he applied to the front of their neat little house two decades ago. It was the envy of the neighborhood. And, if she looks past the big palm tree in the yard, she can keep up with the comings and goings of her neighbors. She is satisfied with what she sees.
Allen, who is black, has seen a wave of Mexican immigrants move in, and Korean immigrants have bought up most of the little grocery stores.
The neighborhood is organized, she said, and if a problem arises, if a "bad element" moves in, they "nip it in the bud." A small government-sponsored loan program has helped many in the area get money to rehabilitate their houses, she said. And she thinks it has made all the difference.
"So far as I know, people get along," Allen said on a recent afternoon.
"We're different races, but whenever the opportunity presents itself I get acquainted." Sometimes they exchange small gifts.
During the riots, she watched some television reports, but the trouble seemed remote. "I really was not afraid."
On the second morning, she decided to go for a walk. A year earlier she had had a hip replacement and she wanted to keep up with her exercise. "My neighbor next door saw me walking and told me that I'd better go back in my house," she said. It hadn't occurred to her that she might be in danger. "I feel very good about remaining here," she said. "I do like Los Angeles."
Ivon Allen has taken the measure of Michael Woo, and she will consider voting for him. She happened to catch his speech a few months ago at a gathering in her neighborhood. When she got the moderator's attention, she tried to ask a question. Her words got all twisted around and the moderator tried to interrupt her, but Woo said, wait a minute, I understand what she's saying. She wanted to know why sometimes rich people conclude that poor people are ignorant. She doesn't remember precisely what his answer was, but he made a good impression.
IT'S POWER BREAKFAST time at the Pacific Dining Car, and Richard Riordan, considered a front-runner, is running late. His driver didn't show, so he piloted his Ford Explorer into downtown Los Angeles on his own, through rush-hour traffic all the way from his home in Brentwood, where the lawns look like fairways at Pebble Beach and the cool ocean breeze picks up the sweet scent of the bougainvilleas and the lavender jacaranda trees.
Riordan is out of breath when he arrives. He gives a nod, a wave, a shake of the hand as he passes tables crammed with the lobbyists, lawyers and political aides who meet here each morning to share secrets and work out deals.
For years now, Riordan has been one of them, a lawyer working the levers of politics in relative obscurity. Now he is out in the open. His vast fortune -- more than $100 million -- no longer satisfies. He wants something more. He wants to be in charge. He is a man of majestic appetites.
This morning, he orders the eggs Benedict, a serving of pancakes, a big glass of orange juice and coffee. He demolishes the feast in astonishing time, particularly given the fact that he has been answering questions nonstop. It is a skill perhaps picked up in these long months on the campaign trail.
Despite his millions, he is plagued by anonymity. He has put $3 million of his own into the campaign to pay for television commercials, but that may not be enough.
Does he have any celebrities?
"I've got Billy Barty," he offers.
The name hangs in the air for a moment or two. He tries again.
"And Tom Poston."
Largely because of his money and his willingness to spend it on the race, Riordan is viewed as one of the leading contenders. If Woo is the Bill Clinton of the race, then Riordan is the Ross Perot. Riordan does not mind the comparison, but he wants it made perfectly clear that he is not an autocrat. He believes in making deals, thrives on it, in fact. Woo's preachments about unity and harmony are all very nice, but it's a disaster out there.
Richard Riordan's Los Angeles is a frightening place, viewed around the world as a "war zone." Audiences respond well to this theme. His campaign brochure features a sinister picture of the barrel of a revolver pointing at the reader dead on from the gloved hand of an anonymous assailant. The brochure demands 3,000 more police officers -- "even more firepower in the war against crime."
His best hope is the vast San Fernando Valley, beyond the mountain range that runs through the center of the city, a suburban world where lots are still zoned for the keeping of horses and people still want to dream that they can be the masters of their little urban ranches. If the fences are high enough, you can pretend that there is no city around you at all.
Riordan's apocalyptic message may play well there, but he may have a hard time persuading the less fortunate around the city that he speaks for them. He portrays himself as an outsider, but over the years, his law firm has received millions of dollars in business from local government. And he was, and still is, a friend of Michael Milken, the ultimate insider who, from his office in Beverly Hills, ran the junk bond department of the defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert investment firm.
Riordan gets nervous when you ask about Milken. Riordan has made some of his millions through deals handled by Milken's department.
"I personally never had any involvement with Mike Milken whatsoever on business," Riordan snaps. "The people who work with me dealt with Milken."
BKUWON KIM, A Korean immigrant, knows little of Richard Riordan, or for that matter any of the people who are running for Mayor of Los Angeles. He and his family work 12-hour days to keep up with the demands of their grocery store in far South-Central Los Angeles, where sullen young men stand at the roadside with sacks of oranges, or peanuts or some other fragment of a crop that has made its way into the city from a distant farm.
The Kim family has been in the grocery business for 12 years now, drawn to California by the same celluloid images that have lured millions. Buwon's parents wanted a better life for their children and good educations, so they followed their version of the dream.
Buwon's mother, Kumhee, summons her son and returns to the darkened corner of the store where she sits for hours and watches. Often, her eyes brim with tears. In February, her husband, Hyung Soo, Buwon's father, was bludgeoned to death by a black teen-ager and a 26-year-old accomplice who had lured him out of the store and robbed him. Kumhee was inside, at the counter, but she had heard nothing. Now, she is of little use to the business, but she comes in anyhow, to watch over her sons.
At 28, Buwon has abruptly taken over the store and his younger brother, Hyowon, has dropped out of school to help. He was studying theology at a seminary in Chicago.
From what the Kims have been able to glean from the police, their father was killed for the cash in his pocket. It happened at the beginning of February, a time of the month when people knew that he carried money to cash small checks for his customers. He was found in a pool of blood outside the store.
Now Buwon feels the great weight of family responsibility as he strides around the store in his baseball cap and blue jeans, stocking shelves and directing customers. He had wanted to be an architect, but it is all confusion now. "My dad came to another country, another land and spilled his blood here. I don't want to just turn my back and go my own way." Buwon has not come up with a solution. He will give the matter some thought.
He has thought a great deal about what happened to his father and has found a certain peace about it. He does not think it was a hate crime, although he knows there has been so much trouble between the black residents of South-Central and the Korean merchants who seem to run all the shops.
"I really feel bad about the people here," he says. "I feel sad. Most of them are very decent people. They're the victim as well as we are."
Their store survived the riots last year because the people in the neighborhood liked his father. He respected them, called them by name and gave them credit.
Whoever did this was just a bad element, Buwon has concluded. "Everybody's hungry here. It's an economic thing mainly. That's why I think this happened."
He has been casting about for some help from a government official and wants to know who one calls about such a tragedy. He has gotten little response from the City Hall offices he has tried to call, but he knows he is over his head in all this bureaucracy and has not made himself clear. His family, his people, have stayed at a distance from American politics. But now, when they help, there must be someone who can do something about his father's death. He is not quite sure who that might be.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Playing It Safe With Payment

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
A GROUP of 16 students and teachers at Mattituck High School on Long Island paid $17,000 to a travel agent in Florida for a class trip to England and Ireland earlier this month. But when Alan Lawrence, the social studies teacher who organized the group, had not received travel documents and was unable to reach the agent the day before the group was to leave, he began to make inquiries. He learned, he says, that none of the money had been remitted to the airline, the hotel or the company providing the land tour. Then he called the Martin County Sheriff, who issued a warrant for the agent's arrest on charges of grand larceny.
A week after the group's original departure date, with travel donations from Trafalgar Tours, which volunteered to help, and Virgin Atlantic Airways, the airline Mr. Lawrence was told would be used, plus cash from a number of Mattituck community groups, the students and their teachers took off for their 10-day trip. 
 Mr. Lawrence and the other organizers, as well as a similar group in another Long Island town, were not flinging their carwash earnings at a stranger. The travel agent, originally from Long Island, had provided "excellent tours, everything you could ask" in two earlier years, according to Mr. Lawrence.
Unknown to the Long Islanders, in May 1992 the agent had left the Smart Traveller of Miami, where she had been an outside sales agent, according to the agency's manager, and set up in business north of Miami with a name so similar that the original agency obtained a court order in August to stop her from using it. The checks, made out to the original agency, were endorsed for deposit with the new agency name. Then the account was emptied and the agent disappeared, the sheriff said.
 
In Case of Default
 No organization insures against the failure of a travel agency, so how can people arranging a tour protect themselves?
First, it seems clear that last year's reference may not be good enough. Agents and operators may have a record of good performance for several years and still default.
Bands and high school groups save for a year for the class trip, using the same agent as earlier classes, then the agent decamps or the operator strands the group. "I've heard the story a hundred times," said Dick Knodt, executive vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents. Deposits given to a travel agent should be acknowledged in specific ways. Mr. Knodt said that when large amounts of money were involved over a long time, the organizer of a tour could ask for a joint account so that he or she would countersign all checks, verifying that the checks are made out to the airlines and other providers.
Anyone acting on behalf of a big group should demand proof from the agent or directly from the travel companies within 24 hours that arrangements have been paid for, according to Robert E. Whitley, president of the United States Tour Operators Association. That way, if the agency folds, he said, the supplier can provide the tour. He said the amount of the travel agency's commission need not be disclosed; the receipt need only say "received full payment for land arrangements" or words to that effect.
Travelers should get receipts with reservation numbers and copies of acknowledgments from suppliers. "When no vouchers and no tickets appear," Mr. Knodt said, "call the suppliers and find out why."
Mr. Knodt said that one check is to call the association at (703) 739-2782 to find out if the travel agency is a member. If an agency does belong, the group may help in resolving disputes. One can also ask the Better Business Bureau how many unresolved complaints are listed for a particular agency.
Travel agencies, because they have virtually no assets that can be seized and because their only inventory is ticket forms, may be more susceptible than some other businesses to larcenous schemes. But if honest agencies have sent a customer's money to a tour operator or even an airline and that supplier ceases operations, the travel agency may be forced to make refunds from its own funds, and it becomes a victim too.
 
Setting Up Insurance Pool
 The United States Tour Operators Association, the American Society of Travel Agents and the National Tour Association, which is made up primarily of bus tour operators, have created insurance pools to meet this possibility. The recession has put heavy pressure on these plans. Mr. Whitley estimated 25 tour operators' failures in the last five years.
The tour operators' association plan, which in 1990 increased its coverage to $5 million, protects all 38 tour-operator members, which are large companies like Abercrombie & Kent, American Express Vacations and Maupintour. If any member company becomes insolvent, the plan refunds customers' payments. At one point, the plan was coping with $6 million in losses, but the drain was spread over two fiscal years, so the plan remained solvent.
Tour companies that belong to this organization usually advertise it, but the organization, (212) 944-5727, will comfirm an operator's membership.
The American Society of Travel Agents has had two plans fall victim to bad times. The Tour Protection Plan provided coverage of $250,000 for tour-operator members who signed up. Customers got refunds if a bankrupt operator was a participant and if their travel agent belonged to the society. As of February, 26 companies were participating.
In the light of recent defaults, the organization's board felt that $250,000 was inadequate coverage; Mr. Knodt said that refunding 10 cents on the dollar in a big failure would do the society more harm than good. But he said that the participants who were polled did not want to pay for $1 million in coverage, which was expected to cost a premium of $1 for each client in addition to the $250,000 letter of credit that the agencies were already maintaining. So the organization's board voted to terminate the plan, effective at the end of 1993. Until then, operators that display the plan's logotype are covered.
To replace the coverage, the society is encouraging its tour-operator members to hold customer payments in an escrow bank account until the travel takes place, but this requires tying up their cash flow. The program is just getting started; one tour operator, Future Tours, is signed up.
The travel agents' organization's second plan to unravel, the Travel Reimbursement Insurance Protection Plan, underwritten by Lloyd's, began in August 1992 and was sold to 600 agencies for $600 a year. If any supplier defaults, it repays the agency whatever it lost, including clients' deposits. In October, Lloyd's stopped providing the insurance, so the coverage will end when all the one-year policies have expired. Another underwriter is being sought.
The National Tour Association's Consumer Protection Plan, begun in 1988, covers its 560 members, operators of escorted bus tours in the United States and Canada, for $100,000 each in customer deposits, but this plan is facing increased demands because of recent failures. A consumer guide is available from the organization, 546 East Main Street, Lexington, Ky. 40508; (800) 755-8687.
These organizations act to protect public confidence in travel sellers, but the climate is harsh and protection costly. Keep a careful watch on how your checks are deposited, and get confirmation at each step. Use of a credit card provides further protection.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Rent-Controlled Increase
 
Question: My mother-in-law, age 85, lives in a large rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan. A few months ago she arranged for a 17-year-old music student from Bulgaria to move in with her so she would not be alone at night. The student, however, pays her no money. 
 When the landlord learned that the young woman was living there he raised my mother-in-law's rent by approximately $30 a month. He told her that the increase was justified by the city's rent control and stabilization law.
Is this legal? . . . A.W. Hopkins, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. According to Bruce D. Friedberg, a Manhattan lawyer, the owner can increase the rent based on Sec. 2202.6 of the city's Unconsoldiated Rent and Eviction Regulations, which says that where there is an increase in the number of residents who are not members of the immediate family of the tenant, the landlord can apply to the Department of Housing and Community Renewal for an increase of no more than 10 percent of the maximum rent.
 
Living in a Loft
 
Question: Please tell me why it is illegal to live in a so-called commercial loft? Also is a J-51 absolutely necessary for someone to live in a loft? . . . C. Harris, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Arthur Rhine, a Manhattan lawyer, the J-51 tax abatement program is irrelevant to whether you can live in a loft. The program, essentially, was a deal struck between apartment and loft owners and the city to encourage landlords to fix up buildings, regardless of whether they are lofts, brownstones or apartments.
"Basically, the city lent money to the owners in exchange for keeping the rents low, usually for 10 years," Mr. Rhine said. "You can live in a loft with or without a J-51."
As for moving into a commercial loft, you can't do it, Mr. Rhine said, unless the building was legalized into a residence. Under the city's loft law, the unit had to be used as a residence on both April 1, 1980, and Dec. 1, 1981, the beginning and end of the so-called window period for legalization.
Mr. Rhine added that there also had to be at least three separate lofts being used as residences in the building on those days.
 
Patrolling Private Streets
 
Question: We inadvertently parked our car on what turned out to be the private streets of Forest Hills Gardens Corp. Within a half-hour, the tire was booted and we had to pay $150 in cash immediately for the boot to be removed or else the car would be towed with an additional fine. What made this all the more astonishing was that this was also during a time that parking regulations were suspended in New York City because of weather conditions.
Can a co-op have this much power to control what were once city streets? . . . Karen Louise, Kew Gardens, Queens
 
Answer: Yes. According to Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Co-Operatives, the streets of such a corporation are basically privately maintained.
He added that the quid pro quo for the community for having the obligation to maintain and secure the streets was having some control over their use.
 
Why 'the Bronx'?
 
Question: Is it necessary to put the word "the" before the word "Bronx" when referring to that borough? . . . Hymie Kindler, Brooklyn
 
Answer: Yes -- but nobody knows why. It has been speculated, though, that the name derives from Jonas Bronck, a Scandinavian who in 1639 became the first European to settle there. It could it be that people going to visit the Bronck family kept saying they were going to see the Broncks and that this later became the Bronx.

Worthy Child-Care Pay Scales

BYLINE: Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
IF wages are any indication of the esteem in which a person's labor is held, consider the following fact, culled from the pages of the Federal Government's Occupational Outlook Handbook: People who take care of zoo animals make on average nearly $2,500 a year more than most of the people who take care of human animals in child-care centers.
Should it gall a child-care worker that a python is thought to require more skillful handling than a toddler? No? Then try on these figures from an about-to-be-released survey and see how they fit your budget: In 1988, the lowest-paid workers in child care, assistant teachers in preschool centers, made $5.16 an hour; in 1992, they made $5.08, a figure that works out to about $8,890 a year. The highest-paid teachers at the centers, most of whom have college-level training in early childhood education, were doing slightly better: in 1992 they made $8.85 an hour, up from $8.19 in 1988, for an annual salary of $15,488. That's about twice as much as the burgermeisters at McDonald's make. The bad news is that, even as the number of centers has grown to accommodate the demands of working parents since the mid-1970's, salaries in real dollars are off by 20 percent. About a fifth of the 10 million American children in child care are in certified, regulated centers. 
 These figures come from the Child Care Employee Project, a research and advocacy project in Oakland, Calif., which has updated a survey of child-care centers it released in 1989. On Thursday, the project will release its new report in Washington as children, teachers and child-care providers call attention to its findings by observing Worthy Wage Day, a program sponsored by a group known as the Worthy Wage Coalition.
In locations across the country, from Pacific Grove College in California to the Jelly Bean Child Care Center in Stamford, Conn., child-care advocates will take time off to march, rally and wear buttons in the service of a quest for higher -- or "worthy" -- wages and wild-and-crazy amenities like paid health benefits, which are now offered to less than a third of teachers.
The original study may be remembered for the chill it sent up many a working parent's spine: the high turnover of child-care workers, the survey concluded, hurt the children's language and social development. Between 1988 and 1991, 70 percent of the teaching staff interviewed had left their jobs. Turnover stabilized somewhat last year at about 26 percent. But, as the study notes, the turnover at all United States companies in 1992 was an average 9.6 percent.
WHY are child-care workers badly paid? One clue comes from the survey's sample, which was drawn from centers in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Phoenix and Seattle: 98 percent of the workers were female and about a third were women of color. "We don't think women's work is valuable," said Marcy Whitebook, executive director of the Child Care Employee Project. "This is the quintessential women's work."
But there are other, more complicated reasons as well. "Child care is something families have not traditionally paid for," Ms. Whitebook said. "We don't think of it as skilled work that we want to pay for." And in many places an underground economy in child care allows consumers to opt for cheaper alternatives to regulated care. Workers in regulated centers subsidize the underground option with depressed wages.
The Worthy Wage Coalition is calling for a minimum average wage of $10 an hour and comprehensive health care. Few experts in the area think the market will take care of workers' concerns. "The main way to increase wages in child care is through public subsidy," said Heidi Hartmann, an economist who directs the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. "We want children to have a higher level of care than parents can afford. It's like public education, it's a social good."
Such a program requires what Ms. Whitebook and others say the country lacks: a national policy on child care. "We have a nonsystem system," she said. "We've never said to ourselves, 'Parents of young children are going to be in the labor force. What shall we do about it?' "
Perhaps Hillary Rodham Clinton will need another project after she whips the health-care system into shape.
Information on Worthy Wage Day is available from the Child Care Employee Project at 510-653-9889.

Helping Russia: What's in It for the Rest of Us? 

How much is generosity, how much just self-interest, when hands are extended to an ailing neighbor? As soon as the world's richest nations announced a $28 billion aid package for Russia last week, each country rushed to point out how it could help folks back home. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was quick to mention the national-security angle -- "The world will be a considerably more dangerous place if Mr. Yeltsin does not prevail" -- and stressed the risk of losing "large potential markets for our businesses." And Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said, "Russia could be one of the biggest export markets for British firms." True, each nation must sell the aid package to legislators back home, who must come up with the money out of already-tight budgets. But do the world's emissaries really have so little faith in voters' altruism?
 
A Shot in the Arm for Japan
 
As President Clinton struggled to get his stimulus plan through Congress, Japan announced a far larger effort to get its economy moving -- to the tune of $116 billion. And even though some said the plan would not help much, investors took it quite seriously. Stocks in Tokyo, which had already been rallying for two months as the nation sensed a possible end to recession, took another leap to their highest level in more than a year.
 
A.T.& T. Wants Equal Access
 
Multinationals don't worry much about borders. They're more interested in things like sending data around the globe fast -- and in one-stop shopping for fancy phone services. But providers of those services, often bound by borders but hungry for that vast business, often snipe at foreign rivals. So when British Telecom sought permission to provide an array of trans-Atlantic services, A.T.& T. cried foul. It moved last week to block its rival until it's allowed to compete in Britain.
 
Oil for Sale in Argentina
 
Argentina's President, Carlos Saul Menem, apparently wants to sell half the state oil company for $3 billion to buy another term. It works like this: If the privatization -- possibly Latin America's largest ever -- goes through by July, Mr. Menem can pay off a million pensioners. Then, the reasoning goes, he'll have enough backing for a constitutional amendment to allow him a second term.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Is It a Toyota? Don't Ask
 
The day is surely coming when the same car gets shipped back and forth across the Pacific, over and over, a stateless orphan, because people keep forgetting whether it's an American car, a Japanese car or one dressed up as the other. Here's the latest (try to keep it straight): General Motors has tentatively agreed to make up to 20,000 cars a year in the United States, and Toyota will sell them in Japan as Toyotas. Yes, it will lift our exports a bit, and ease some political pressure, but isn't this getting, well, rather confusing?
 
Sega Lands a Body Blow
 
The battle is fierce, each warrior lashing out with deadly jabs and kicks. Tension mounts, pulses quicken. But just as giant Nintendo seems to have Sega in a corner and is going for the kill, Sega unleashes a mighty surprise attack. Last week Sega said it would team up with two cable giants, Time Warner and Tele-Communications, to transmit its games directly into homes. Yes, there are 25 million or so Nintendo machines out there, dwarfing Sega's 8 million, but Sega may suddenly have battered down the door of 17 million homes with the cable deal. As one analyst said, "Nintendo seems to be getting left in the dust."
 
Don't Let Sales Dry Up
 
Consumers are catching on: If you want to buy something, you don't have to buy all the marketing hoopla, too -- you can buy a no-name product for a few dollars less. And more companies, their precious market share in peril, are getting the message and cutting prices for brand names. But investors' reactions vary. When Philip Morris cut Marlboro's price recently, its stock plummeted, but when Procter & Gamble lowered prices last week for its disposable diapers, Pampers and Luvs, its stock rose slightly. Investors must figure that babies' bottoms, being far more appealing than cigarettes, have a plumper future.
 
Mighty Wal-Mart Takes a Spill
 
Wal-Mart has for years been larger than life. Sales at the nation's largest retailer have grown more than 30 percent a year, and when it rides into town with its rock-bottom prices and vast stores, terrified rivals often throw down their guns without a fight. But the Arkansas tough guy may be slowing down. The stock has taken some nasty falls lately -- as it did last week when the company said recent sales growth fell below the kind of outsize performance investors have come to expect. Also creeping in are health care worries: More than half of Wal-Mart employees work less than 28 hours a week, with no health benefits; if benefits for part-timers are ever mandated, costs could soar.
 
A Tidy Profit in Citicorp Stock
 
It's always been simple to make a fortune on Wall Street -- just buy low, sell high. Leave it to a Saudi prince to apply that rule on a royal scale. A little over two years ago Prince al-Waleed bin Talal invested hundreds of millions in Citicorp, when its shares were in the dumps. It was a smart move. Citicorp stock has soared to its highest point in three years, and last week Prince Waleed raked in some profits, selling nearly nine million of his shares for $268 million -- two and a half times what he'd paid. Not that he's bailing out: He still owns a good chunk of the company. But the question is: What's he investing in now?
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Will 1 Electric Car Beat 3?
 
Here's a challenge: Take a popular product, make it far less useful, charge a hefty premium for it and get people to buy it. Under a California law that's spreading to other states, 2 percent of 1998 cars have to be "zero-emission" (unless Captain Kirk provides some dilithium crystals, that means electric). But current electric models have a range of 100 miles or less, and their prices give new meaning to "sticker shock": An electric Dodge van costs $120,000. Facing this deadline, Detroit is doing something drastic: Last week the Big Three said they were discussing building the car jointly.
 
A Tax to Pay the Doctor
 
The Administration doesn't like to say "tax" -- it scares people. And, wanting to keep the focus on the jobs bill, it doesn't want to talk just yet about how it's going to pay $50 billion or more to fix the health care mess. But a bulky tax idea is hard to keep under the rug, and last week it came out: The White House admitted that it's considering a value-added tax. ("Sin taxes," apparently, will fall short.) The advantage of such a tax, imposed on goods at every step of production, is that -- as Europe has found -- it is hard to evade. One disadvantage: It falls heavily on lower-income people, but that could be eased if items like food and housing are excluded.
 
A Place to Peck
 
Critics of recent Republican Administrations (older readers will remember those days) have said the only species protected then were timber companies and property owners -- not exactly high on any endangered list. The main goal, critics assert, was to weaken the Endangered Species Act by encouraging conflict. But these days, deals seem more likely. Last week Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced a deal with Georgia Pacific to protect the red cockaded woodpecker, which was one of the first species listed under the 1973 act, and whose habitat in the South is being chain-sawed away. Georgia Pacific gets more freedom to cut logs elsewhere in the South, and the bird gets a good deal, too: 10 acres of trees for each colony to peck at.
 
S.& L. Property, Up for Grabs
 
The Bush Administration did not want it around -- all that property seized from failed savings and loans. Too painful a reminder, perhaps, of all those wild, Government-backed spending sprees. So it sold it off quickly in huge bundles -- over $300 billion worth so far. But complaints abounded -- that local investors were frozen out, that the Government wasn't getting the best price. So the Clinton team shifted gears last week, making it far easier for smaller investors to take part. It brings the process "to Main Street, where it should be," a Treasury official said.
 
Retail Sales Dip, Analysis Soars
 
Politicians can't seem to leave statistics alone. Before the ink is dry, they litter them with partisan footnotes. When word came that retail sales fell 1 percent in March, the Administration seized on the figure as proof of a dire need for its stimulus package -- which Republicans are holding hostage. But others were quick to say the East Coast blizzard kept people out of stores. Senator Bob Dole, who as No. 1 Clinton needler is putting cute wordplays ever higher on his list of job duties, called it a "snow job" to overplay a weather-related sales dip -- that the real consumer worry is a "blizzard of new taxes."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Inflation: Not Dying, Just Changing

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to inflation and share prices, the most important question is not how big the inflation is, but where it is. When the market allows companies to raise prices almost at will, Wall Street comes to love them.
What is going on now is a reshuffling of inflationary pressures. With the dollar down -- and the Clinton Administration evidently quite happy to keep it there -- the pressures are receding on those American companies that sell goods subject to international competition. Mr. Clinton's tendency toward managed trade and quotas -- illustrated last week in his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa -- also bodes well for those companies. 
 But in this country, the price pressures are on, whether it is in diapers, drugs, cigarettes or corn flakes. Throughout the 1980's, brand name products raised prices regularly. Now, with real incomes down, "they have priced themselves out of a lot of markets," says Robert Barbera, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers. As companies fight for market share, prices are falling for many products.
But the opposite may be true in the internationally traded manufactured goods that were the subject of the most intense competition in the past decade. "Protectionism and the decline of the dollar are creating a price umbrella for the auto industry," says David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. Adds Mr. Barbera: "The price of cars could go up faster than the price of Cheerios."
If so, it will be a radical change. The consumer price index for cereals (yes, the Government really does compute that figure) is up 156 percent since the beginning of 1980, three times as much as the C.P.I. for new cars. It should come as no surprise that Kellogg's share price is 12 times as high as it was then, while G.M.'s is up just 62 percent.
The stock market is beginning to adjust to the new reality, buying American industries that are gaining in international markets and avoiding domestic businesses that have relied on price increases that no longer can be sustained. In 1993, Kellogg stock has fallen 15 percent, while G.M.'s is up 25 percent.
The prospect of price flexibility is good for Detroit, but it has less comforting implications for the overall inflation rate. The optimism that swept Wall Street last week, in the wake of a good report on March consumer prices, may prove to have been overdone. Mr. Shulman argues that investors are now confident that consumer prices will rise only 3 percent or less, and says that indications it might be more like 4 percent could alarm both the stock and bond markets.
It is amusing to see Wall Street happily watch the decline of the dollar -- it is down 9 percent against the yen since Mr. Clinton was elected -- while talking about the end of inflation. Americans can afford less of what the world produces, which is the real meaning of inflation, even if some American companies can expect to make more (devalued) dollars.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Short Memories for the Bad Times

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
WALL STREET'S executives are at heart a cheerful bunch, and nothing proves that better than their speedy ability to forget the bad times and revel in the good.
Merrill Lynch said last week that it had enjoyed record earnings in the first quarter, and the giddy Wednesday morning headlines set just the right tone for an annual gathering of securities executives in New York. 
 The Securities Industry Association, trade group for the brokerage industry, packed 200 people into a Hilton conference room to ogle a slide show of bar charts that only a short seller could hate: initial public offerings, mutual fund sales, municipal bond offerings and total industry revenues gaining year after year, to a sizzling finale in the first quarter of 1993.
The introductory cheerleading session was followed by a workshop in which purveyors of financial products from brokerage firms, banks and mutual funds each told why theirs was a business that would continue to prosper. Phrases like "baby boomers," "scared savers" and "outliving assets" come to mind. How could anything go wrong with all those investors panting for the good advice of financial services firms? How, indeed.
By Thursday afternoon, holders of brokerage industry stocks were reminded that parties can end abruptly on Wall Street. A surprisingly strong 19 percent surge in first-quarter earnings at Charles Schwab & Company, the discount brokerage firm, was met with a heavy selloff of Schwab shares, which lost $3.125, to close the day at $35.125. The glass is half full to brokerage industry executives who assume that individual investors will be lining up for their services for years to come. But increasingly skeptical brokerage stock shareholders are starting to wonder if all the hoopla is deserved.
And at the Wednesday confab, some outsiders to the industry were wondering too.
Though Stephen Friedman, chairman of Goldman Sachs, warned his colleagues that the 1990's would be ruthless with any brokerage firms whose managements didn't begin to take tough measures, most industry representatives had a happier message. John S. Chalsty, chief executive officer of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, applauded "a great improvement in management on Wall Street." James F. Getz, president of the mutual fund outfit Federated Securities Corporation, cheered the fact that only 30 percent of American households own mutual funds, which presumably means the other 70 percent will come around. The bullish Mr. Getz even made the optimistic prediction that assets would continue to flood into funds at a rate of 15 percent to 20 percent a year.
Reality check time came, though, when a politician, a securities industry analyst and a publishing executive imparted their thoughts on what was ahead. Warren B. Rudman, the retired Senator from New Hampshire who co-authored the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law, pretty much spoiled the raspberry sundae dessert with his prediction of higher long-term interest rates. That, he said, would come as a result of President Clinton's reluctance to take tougher measures to reduce the Federal deficit.
John Keefe, a brokerage industry analyst who gave an afternoon talk, splashed a little more cold water in the crowd's faces when he began his talk with a reminder that "the financial weather" can change quickly and completely. Even worse, he included a slide in his presentation that showed a more complete history on mutual fund sales than had an earlier speaker. Fund sales started to drop months before the 1987 stock market crash, he documented. That means even the indestructible asset management business "isn't all that free from cycles," he said.
So who asked him?
The audience perhaps can easily ignore Mr. Keefe, but they may not be able to hide from the last industry critic of the day, who could well wind up as the top cop of the securities industry. Arthur Levitt Jr., the former American Stock Exchange chairman who currently runs a media firm, gave a closing speech that warned against several evils that have troubled him since he left the brokerage business five years ago.
For one thing, said Mr. Levitt, there is the prickly issue of brokerage firms purchasing other firms' order flows -- something that potentially could harm investors who might not get the best price. For another, there is the troubling use of custom-made derivatives products, which "remain unregulated and misunderstood except by small groups of professionals." Mr. Levitt had other problem areas on his mind, too, including the institutionalization of the financial markets. Then there are the matters of corporate structures "in turmoil," excessive rewards for those who act as principal as opposed to agent, and health insurance.
Health insurance?
Of course health insurance. Mr. Levitt's name may be on top of every list of would-be S.E.C. chairmen, but he said last week that the White House hadn't even called yet. So why not curry a little favor by supporting the President's goals. We are "not covering enough people" right now, he said.
Mr. Keefe said Friday that while he happens to agree with Mr. Levitt on the health care issue, "it was somewhat out of place" at a conference of securities executives. As for the bullishness of the group of securities executives generally, he admitted sheepishly, "My speech wasn't too well received," in light of those irritating reminders of how cyclical the brokerage business is.
But the industry hasn't become overly bullish, said Mr. Keefe. Baby boomers may disappoint Wall Street if they fail to save as much as the firms hope, but at least wooing these investors isn't that expensive. "It's not the kind of thing where Acme Brokerage goes out and rents the most expensive real estate in Tokyo to implement expansion plans," he said. "They haven't built a temple of individual investor services or done other unnecessary spending in the name of the small investor." At least not yet.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Gabelli Guarantee to Ponder

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
MARIO GABELLI, the mutual fund manager well regarded for his investing acumen, is introducing a new fund with a difference -- a guaranteed investment return. Sounds good, but it is a difference that the investor would be wise to study well.
The new Gabelli ABC Fund is of a type created by mutual fund companies in the last few years to lure bank-account and certificate-of-deposit savers -- those used to insured investments but distressed by tumbling interest rates. One new product puts the stress on less volatile share prices while others, like the Gabelli fund, provide some sort of investment guarantee. 
 One of the first moves came from Shearson Lehman Brothers. Shearson Principal Return 1996, set up in 1989, combines stocks with enough zero-coupon bonds to insure that investors will get back in 1996 at least the amount they invested. Shearson started a second fund two years later. And Kemper Retirement I, II and III, a series of similar funds, started coming out in 1990.
Gabelli ABC, which can invest in virtually any type of stock or bond, goes much farther: it promises a minimum investment return. However, the promise is only good for one year, only on a limited amount and likely to be expensive, prompting Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo, to conclude that, overall, "The fund promises too much and delivers too little to the investor."
The promise is a guaranteed total return of at least 6 percent for the first year on the first $2,000 invested during the fund's initial offering period, which began March 15 and runs through April 29. As of last week, the fund had about $1.2 million, at an average of $2,000 an account, according to Bruce Alpert, chief financial officer of the Gabelli funds.
No sales charge is levied on the first $2,000 invested but, in an unusual twist, a load (of 2 percent) is applied to additional investments.
In another twist, Mr. Gabelli promises, backed by a letter of credit he set up with the State Street Bank and Trust Company, to use his own money to make good on any shortfall in the 6 percent return at the end of one year.
While the Gabelli fund breaks new ground, analysts do not expect to see similar ones soon because of the risk to the fund manager. "It's innovative," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago, "but it's dangerous."
In addition, fund companies that have been trying to educate people to the risks and rewards of the financial markets may regard this fund as hiding the risk and thus a setback to their efforts. To this, Mr. Alpert replies that the one-year guarantee program is intended to serve as "an introduction to the securities markets."
Only a select group can invest in Gabelli ABC. First dibs (up to 60 percent of the shares) go to individual retirement account investors who do not already own shares in the other seven Gabelli funds. Up to 30 percent more is reserved for investors in the Gabelli Convertible Securities Fund (for whom the guaranteed return is on investments of up to $10,000), plus other Gabelli shareholders. Others can buy any leftovers.
The $2,000 limit on the guarantee and the large allocation to I.R.A.'s are intended to attract long-term pension assets, as Fund Action, an industry newsletter pointed out. Those are assets that are likely, because of investor inertia, to remain in the fund after the guarantee has expired. "The preference for non-Gabelli shareholders," the newsletter continued, "is a marketing ploy to expand the adviser's shareholder base."
Shareholders will find the fund is not cheap. Besides the sales load above $2,000, there are steep annual expenses: a 1 percent management fee, generous by industry standards, and a one-quarter of 1 percent 12b-1 fee, used to defray marketing expenses. These fees, plus the fund's other annual expenses are projected to equal 2 percent of assets, nearly double the average stock fund's, which Mr. Alpert attributed to the expectation that the fund would be relatively small, at $30 million.
And the guarantee can actually backfire. In the prospectus, Mr. Gabelli says he intends to manage the ABC fund more conservatively than his other funds to avoid having to reimburse the State Street Bank for any payments. He adds that he will "seek to manage the Fund without regard to this potential conflict of interest" that could prompt him to shun a possibly high-return investment for fear it could prove a big loser.
But what happens if the fund's net asset value falls significantly? If it drops 15 percent or more and Mr. Gabelli fails to put up additional collateral, the bank can terminate the letter of credit and pay the entire shortfall at that time, forcing the investor to rely on Mr. Gabelli's largesse to cover any balance over the full year.
And who believes the stock market will drop that far? Mr. Gabelli, for one. In the 1992 annual report mailed to Gabelli Asset Fund shareholders earlier this year, he wrote: "All in all, we think the Dow could decline as much as 20 percent during the year from current levels."
Said Mr. Alpert of that possibility: "If the market will fall 20 percent, this is the fund to be in."

HEADLINE: Raising the Roof As the Economy Lifts

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
HOME builders usually are hard at work when a teetering economy has begun to recover, and that is happening now in many parts of the nation. Wood frames for single-family homes are going up at what analysts estimate is the fastest yearly pace since 1986.
But this is not a typical home-building resurgence. The industry recovery, which took its first, small steps as the Persian Gulf war ended two years ago, has hit its stride in the last year only for the big companies that generally build 1,000 or more homes a year in a business where most competitors build fewer than 20. 
 Among the winners are the Centex Corporation, Toll Brothers Inc., Ryland Homes, the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, Hovnanian Enterprises and the PHM Corporation, parent of Pulte Homes.
Even some fallen giants have revived. The U.S. Home Corporation, for example, was cleared April 1 by a Federal judge to complete a two-year bankruptcy reorganization. New-home sales at the Houston-based company increased 39 percent last year, to 5,000.
But medium-sized and smaller builders have had a tougher time. Many have been shut off from traditional lending sources at banks and savings institutions, narrowing their opportunities to acquire lots that are ready for building.
By contrast, the big builders have been using Wall Street more often to raise money, through stock issues, debt offerings and borrowing from institutional investors. Profits growing out of big land purchases made from banks and government agencies at fire-sale prices in the last three years should begin to show up in earnings reports by this summer, said James Meyer, housing analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. Stock prices of many big builders have already risen by more than 50 percent from their low points in the last 12 months and are expected by many analysts to go higher.
In short, a consolidation trend that thousands of builders thought could never happen in an intensely-local business is under way.
"It's my view that eventually there will be nothing between the big builders and the very small builders, virtually nothing," said Barbara Allen, the housing analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The Clinton Administration acted last week to help smaller builders and developers when it ordered the Resolution Trust Corporation to alter procedures for auctioning raw and developed land and other assets that had favored larger bidders.
But the small builders are still facing a credit crunch. "The land development loan is still far and few between," said Lewis Ranieri, chairman of Hyperion Partners, a New York investment group that owns a large Texas savings institution, Bank United.
The trends favoring large builders should make houses, particularly starter homes, more affordable in many markets, courtesy of the big builders' economies of scale and management savvy. But in Dallas and other cities where big builders have been very active, buyers have complained about fewer choices in architecture and floor plans.
Home builders capitalized on low mortgage rates and improved consumer confidence in the last 18 months to play a leading part in the recovery, and most analysts expect the industry to be a steady, but not rousing, element for the nation's economy through most of the 1990's.
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, investments in single-family construction rose by 16.7 percent last year in an economy that grew overall by 3.1 percent. Sales of new furniture, appliances and other household goods often acquired for new homes rose by 12 percent.
The chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, David Seiders, estimated that housing construction will rise by 9 percent this year, to 1.32 million units, representing 1.15 million single-family homes and the rest apartments. He anticipates no increase in the overbuilt apartment market, with nearly all gains coming in home construction.
Ms. Allen, the Donaldson, Lufkin analyst, said the nation needs to add an average of 1.5 million housing units a year through the decade, and that construction should reach that level by 1995. Builders lament that soaring lumber prices, which have added $3,000 to the price of a typical new home in less than a year, have pinched back demand, but Ms. Allen says prospects are good for healthy, moderate growth lasting several years.
"If inflation remains low, and therefore mortgage rates, you could have a very, very long upward cycle," she said. "Frankly, it's a wonderful environment."
What follows are profiles of three of the more successful builders. Each has profited by adapting well to local markets with widely varying economic conditions.
 
Centex
 The nation's largest home builder, Centex, was a pioneer among home builders in raising money from Wall Street during the early 1980's. It also was a major buyer in recent years of bargain-priced raw land in north Texas from the R.T.C.
"We were one of the few people in this market that had cash, and they were all cash deals," said Laurence E. Hirsch, chairman and chief executive.
Centex occasionally expands into new areas by buying existing builders, but more often brings in people trained in other Centex markets.
"Home building is becoming a more sophisticated and management-intensive industry," Mr. Hirsch said. "There certainly are the mom-and-pops, but to really be successful, you're going to have to use traditional management tools."
He said Centex spends $2 million a year training employees in everything from land acquisition to holding the hands of anxious buyers. The company also has computerized information systems that keep managers on top of lumber, labor and land costs, among other things.
Centex built about 10,000 homes in the fiscal year ended March 31, 29 percent more than the average of its last three years. The Dallas-based company, operating in 41 markets in 20 states, plans to build as many as 14,000 homes by 1995.
Centex still gets most financing through large debt offerings, and also has the option of issuing more common shares when its stock price rises, as it has in the last two years. "We look at the credit crunch as a significant advantage for Centex," Mr. Hirsch said.
Land bargains of recent vintage are showing up in rising profits. Net income increased 81.7 percent, to $45.8 million, in the nine months ended Dec. 31, with revenues up 12.5 percent, to $1.8 billion.
Home-building and mortgage banking generated most of the profit and revenue. The company also operates the nation's fifth- largest general contracting company, cement and wallboard companies and a Texas savings institution.
 
Kaufman & Broad Homes
 California's economy has been sliding for three years, but Kaufman & Broad's focus on new homes for first-time buyers has paid off. Its orders in the state last year increased 49 percent, with three of every four customers buying a home for the first time.
The company, based in Los Angeles, reported a 28 percent gain in first-quarter profits last month, to $4.4 million. Sales increased by 22 percent, to $224.9 million.
Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive, said Kaufman & Broad pared the size of its typical starter home in California in the last four years by 200 square feet, to 1,500 square feet, as one way to reduce the price for first-time buyers.
The company also established a central purchasing department to lower costs for lumber and other materials. Financing costs have also dropped. Managers of its 12 divisions are sharing information, and when costs are noticeably lower in one region, other managers are expected to get their costs down, too.
"You show people this in an honest, straightforward way, and they get the message real quickly," Mr. Karatz said. "People really want to succeed."
The changes reduced the average price of Kaufman & Broad's homes in California to $169,000, from $200,000 in 1989. The company also builds homes in France and Canada, and recently opened a subdivision in Las Vegas for the first time.
Analysts estimate that Kaufman & Broad will build more than 5,000 homes this year in California and Nevada. The company had its biggest year ever last year in California, building 3,900 homes, or 200 more than in its previous best year, 1989.
"Many analysts said 10 to 15 years ago that the big would get bigger and the medium-sized builders would get squeezed, but it never happened," Mr. Karatz said. "Now it's happening."
 
Toll Brothers
 The suburbs of cities along the Atlantic coast are filled with land bargains, and Toll Brothers, which builds from Washington to Boston, has been snapping up building lots as fast and sensibly as it can.
Of the 5,600 lots that it put under option to buy in the last 24 months, more than 5,100 were parcels other developers or builders had once owned at higher prices. The land was acquired either from financial institutions or Federal agencies liquidating failed banks and savings institutions.
"You could make great land buys in the '81-'82 recession, but maybe one a quarter, not one a week," said an enthusiastic Robert I. Toll, chairman and chief executive. The company is based near Philadelphia in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.
The recent history of Southport Chase, a wooded setting on a former estate of 105 acres wedged between Bridgeport and Westport, Conn., near Long Island Sound, provides a case study of how Toll Brothers spotted opportunities in troubled properties.
The company won a sealed-bid auction last May for 47 vacant lots remaining in the 79-lot development. Roads, sewers and water lines had already been completed by the original developer-builder of Southport Chase.
The property was auctioned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had acquired a huge portfolio of problem loans as a result of the biggest bank failure in the Northeast, the Bank of New England. The agency foreclosed on the original developer, who had been behind on payments since 1990.
Toll Brothers' bid of $5.6 million, an average of $119,000 a lot, was well-timed. The company now has 27 contracts for four home models that range in size from 3,000 to 3,500 square feet. Three of the homes are completed and occupied, with another 20 under construction.
The company has increased prices five times since last July, a reflection of strong buyer demand even in the face of rising lumber costs. The homes now sell for between $470,000 and $550,000, up from the original $447,000 to $505,000.
In the quarter ended Jan. 31, Toll Brothers recorded $88.2 million in contracts on new homes, an increase of 55 percent from the comparable quarter a year ago. Net income soared to $4.9 million, from $2.3 million, a record high for the eighth quarter in a row. Revenues rose 47 percent, to $51.8 million.
Like executives at Centex, Kaufman & Broad and other big builders, Mr. Toll said he is prepared to retreat after the land bargains have waned and smaller builders drive up material and labor costs, as they typically do late in a housing boom.
For now, though, the land bargains are too ripe to ignore. "These tremendous buys have not existed since the end of the Depression," he said, "and they probably will not be available for more than another year."

HEADLINE: Profile;
Soros's Alter Ego: Low Profile, Very High Returns

BYLINE: By Stanley F. Druckenmiller By BARRY REHFELD; Barry Rehfeld is a freelance writer based in New York.

 BODY:
WHEN the Tokyo stock market began rallying last month, a big buyer was the Quantum Group, the investment funds run by George Soros. Indeed, once word got around that Mr. Soros had bet big and fast on a range of Japanese securities, the rush into the market accelerated.
Yet Mr. Soros could not have been farther from the action. He was in Eastern Europe and Russia, tending to his numerous philanthropic projects. The Soros lieutenant who masterminded the Japan investment was Stanley F. Druckenmiller. 
 When Quantum bet $10 billion on the German mark and against the British pound and the Italian lira last September, it was Stanley F. Druckenmiller who created the investment strategy, which made $2 billion in profits in a matter of weeks.
For four years, the 39-year-old Mr. Druckenmiller has quietly served as Mr. Soros's alter ego, deciding on the complicated mix of investments by Quantum, while also handling his own large and highly profitable fund, Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Capital Management.
Mr. Druckenmiller's strategy goes far beyond buying stocks and bonds, into the esoteric world of derivatives like options and futures on a variety of products worldwide, including foreign currencies, bonds and stock indexes. His success has contributed mightily to the perception that, while the 1980's was the decade of the dealmakers, the 1990's is the decade of derivatives.
Since Mr. Druckenmiller took over, Quantum's funds have been averaging an annual gain of 40 percent in net asset value -- higher even than Mr. Soros's own outstanding record of 30 percent annually since 1969. Last year was his best yet -- a 60 percent jump.
"Of all the people in the business, he is just the best, both at the macro level and with individual stocks," said Julian Robertson, who runs the Tiger Management funds, which are among Quantum's biggest competitors.
So formidable is the Soros-Druckenmiller investment hand that many on Wall Street have discussed its ability to undermine a major foreign currency. In January, Mr. Druckenmiller traveled to London with all the credibility of a financial head of state. He met privately with officials of the British Treasury and the Bank of England. In an interview with The Financial Times, he denied reports that Quantum was angling for a repeat of last September's killing shorting European currencies, this time wagering against the franc.
But Quantum may be at a crossroads. It has grown so enormous that its sheer size might work against its funds' chances of finding enough investment opportunities to continue the spectacular gains. Moreover, Quantum's management has been subpoenaed in connection with the Justice Department investigation of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal involving Salomon Brothers. The Government is thought to be looking into whether big investment houses and their customers participated in a squeeze play, driving up the price of the Treasury issue by cornering the market.
Mr. Druckenmiller has kept a low profile. Technically he's one of 12 managing directors at Soros Fund Management, which runs the Quantum Group. And, guarded by Quantum's newly hired public relations firm, Kekst & Company, he has refused to be interviewed for this article. (So have Mr. Soros and anyone else at his firm.)
Those who know him -- friends, in-laws and people in the money-management business -- say he prefers staying out of the limelight, is loyal to Mr. Soros and is consumed by investing.
A magna cum laude graduate of Bowdoin College in Maine with degrees in economics and English, the tall, lanky Philadelphia native was the head of equity research at Pittsburgh National Bank by the time he was 25. When a securities-firm executive offered him $10,000 a month just for the chance to talk with him about investments, he decided to open his own money management firm, Duquesne Capital, in 1981.
His numbers in the first five years attracted Howard Stein, head of the Dreyfus Fund, and the 32-year-old boy wonder was soon dividing his time between New York and Pittsburgh. Mr. Stein built up funds around him -- seven in all -- offering investors variations on Mr. Druckenmiller's technique. Mr. Soros landed him in autumn 1988.
The union got off to a rocky start; Mr. Soros second-guessed his protege, and they clashed over the sale of bonds that Mr. Druckenmiller had wanted to keep. Mr. Druckenmiller was able to take charge, he told Jack D. Schwager for the book "The New Market Wizards," only after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union allowed Mr. Soros to devote himself more to philanthropy in his Hungarian homeland and throughout the region.
But the changeover brought little real difference in Quantum's investment approach. Like his mentor, Mr. Druckenmiller concentrates on "macro" issues, the proverbial big picture. How corporate leaders perform is less important than what the Federal Reserve chairman does. When the Persian Gulf war started in January 1991, he switched his American investments from short to long.
He is disciplined yet flexible, just as comfortable shorting securities as buying them, and borrows readily to make investments.
Mr. Druckenmiller also favors "technical" over "fundamental" analysis. That is, he concentrates on market factors like price and volume trends rather than on particular corporate revenues and earnings -- Wall Street's methodology -- in determining which way securities are heading.
FOR example, he predicted the October 1987 crash because he thought the market rally preceding it was being driven by a few strong companies, while the vast majority were trailing weakly and were headed for a fall; unfortunately for him, after the market began to fall just before the crash, he started to buy -- the worst case of timing in his life.
The Soros-Druckenmiller team produced spectacular results last summer when the pound looked shaky despite British determination to prop it up. In August, Mr. Druckenmiller built up a position shorting the pound and the lira, and buying the German mark, on the assumption that the British and Italian economies were took weak to support the value of their currencies against the mark. He bought British stocks, betting on a boost from lower interest rates intended to stimulate the economy, and sold German and French stocks because the lack of a similar drop in interest rates and increases in prices relative to British prices would be bad for business. By the same token, he bought French and German bonds because they would look good by comparison to stocks in those countries.
Mr. Soros's role in this investing coup? He endorsed the strategy and in fact encouraged Mr. Druckenmiller to bet more and faster.
As of the end of last year, the original Quantum Fund had assets of $3.7 billion and, by borrowing on them, had built a portfolio weighted heavily in currencies and fixed-income investments like Treasury securities that was worth more than $30 billion.
Quantum has grown so quickly that four new funds -- Quota, Quasar International, Quantum Emerging Growth and now Quantum Realty -- have been spun off in the last two years from the original Quantum Fund. Taken together the five funds held a portfolio of more than $50 billion at the beginning of the year. Mr. Druckenmiller directly controls the original Quantum Fund and oversees Mr. Soros's other funds.
"He's the master chef," said James Marquez, the portfolio manager at Quantum Fund in the early 1980's, who now runs his own money management company.
Not everything has come out well done. Last January an outside portfolio manager at the Quantum Fund was a defendant in one of the largest insider trading cases. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that a tip from the manager, Purnendu Chatterjee, had enabled his brother-in-law and a friend to profit from a takeover of the Foxboro Company, in which Quantum had a large stake and Mr. Chatterjee held a board seat. The three defendants settled the case with the S.E.C., without admitting or denying guilt, for $2.1 million. Meanwhile, Mr. Chatterjee is still managing the same slice of Mr. Druckenmiller's Quantum Fund as he did before.
WHILE his investment record is formidable, Mr. Druckenmiller has a manner that does not always impress. E. Lee Hennessee, a hedge-fund consultant at Shearson who met Mr. Druckenmiller when he came to New York, said his dry style turned off the investment manager of an Ivy League university to whom she introduced him. "Stanley's a very intense, serious man with a very quick mind. He'll go through something very fast, not seeming to notice that he's leaving some people behind. When he's said what he has to say, that's it."
At work or away from it, he had little interest in small talk or in revealing much of himself. "He's very hard to read," Ms. Hennessee concluded.
Mr. Druckenmiller maintains something of a spartan regimen in the midst of luxury at the penthouse on 72d Street off Park Avenue and the weekend home in Southampton that he shares with his wife (Fiona Biggs, another Dreyfus money manager and a niece of Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley managing director) and three daughters. Mr. Druckenmiller works out in his apartment gym, jogs in Southampton and has been known to be in bed at 8:30 P.M. on weekends.
He has hunted at the Maryland barony of Paul Tudor Jones, who runs Tudor Investment; he socializes with Stanley Shopkorn, a former vice chairman at Salomon, and he plays an exceptional game of golf.
Even admirers of Mr. Druckenmiller suggest that it will be hard for him to extend his sensational streak. Barton Biggs thinks that the markets might be overwhelmed by imitators. Mr. Marquez added: "They're almost too big. It's tough to move $7 billion. It's tough to maintain those returns."
Mr. Marquez suggested that Quantum may effectively be limited in every market except for trading currencies, which at a daily volume of $1 trillion dwarfs all the others.
And even then, it may be tough finding the right plays.
 
 
 
NOT FOR WIDOWS AND ORPHANS
 TOO bad, America. The funds managed by Stanley F. Druckenmiller are closed to United States citizens or residents. The principal reason: Their managers want access to more than 99 investors, the maximum United States securities law allows for such "hedge funds."
The law limits the number of investors as a means of limiting exposure to risk.
Hedge funds also register outside the United States so they can operate with a lot more flexibility than if they were governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
That can translate into a lot more risk. Hedge funds may short securities as often as they buy. But shorting has far greater potential for loss than gain. Their longs (purchases) or some other opposing strategy may cover them, which is where the term hedging comes from, but the buys could also go down as the shorts go up.
Also, investing in futures and options currencies, commodities and stocks forces managers to deal with volatile variables not found when buying "vanilla" stocks and bonds. Finally, the funds may leverage up to 20 times their assets. All and all, not for widows and orphans.
Few funds are as successful as the Quantum Group and those that are can't produce simply "good" returns for investors to make money. The funds generally charge a management fee of 1 percent and take 15 percent to 20 percent of the profits, and the best of them might charge a premium of some 30 percent on the purchase of their shares.

HEADLINE: THE SEXES;
This Proposal Is for Status Quo

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Kaye

 BODY:
POPULAR entertainments being what they are, attempts to analyze a movie these days may produce the uneasy sense that you are critiquing a cartoon. Still, Hollywood cartoons can impinge on a nerve, activating reservoirs of shame and secret longing, tapping into inadmissible impulses, in the process providing a release for moral and sexual anxiety in much the way that horror movies are said to release other types of tension. Consider "Fatal Attraction," "Pretty Woman," "Basic Instinct" and, with an opening-week gross of $25 million, the current leading box-office attraction, "Indecent Proposal," a film that begins in the soft focus of a Kotex ad, and goes on to prove that nothing is sacred.
The picture's evocative title instantly telegraphs the link it draws between sex and money, the two issues that even the most sanguine individuals are least sanguine about. This combination is examined through a premise that is as bogus as it is intriguing: can a middle-class marriage survive after a devoted wife sells herself for an evening to a stunning-but-lonely billionaire winsomely played by a guarded-yet-tender Robert Redford? Or, to recycle the question Erich Segal posited more than 25 years ago, does being in love really mean never having to say you're sorry? 
 Yet, because the other leading characters are numbingly bland, as portrayed by Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson, and because the potentially explosive subject matter is dealt with so fancifully, the most astonishing aspect of this picture is that it has made so many people of such varying views so apoplectic.
Last week, a local Manhattan news show interviewed Dr. Ruth Westheimer, who categorically stated that the picture cheapens love. Newspaper reporters interviewed Patricia Ireland and Susan Faludi, who categorically stated that the picture demeans women. One station conducted man-on-the-street interviews with men who stated categorically that the picture demeans them.
In The New York Post, society columnist William Norwich reported that the English author Barbara Cartland, "has gone ballistic."
"The whole idea is absolutely disgusting, degrading and vulgar," Mr. Norwich quoted Ms. Cartland as saying, "and no woman with any pretensions to being decent would do it."
"This movie," said a woman I know, "is a man's fantasy of a woman's fantasy."
The proliferation of that fantasy is more widespread than you might suspect, as can be gleaned from results of a poll aired on the Oprah Winfrey show on which the film's premise was discussed. "If you were offered a million dollars," women were asked, "would you break your marriage vows and sleep with a stranger?" Fifty-five percent said yes.
To men, the delicate matter of whether to relinquish their wife to raise money they cannot earn seemingly provoked such overwhelming feelings that most retreated into the cliches that mask real emotion.
"I'd do it in a minute," one man told Ms. Winfrey, "they can touch her physically, but they can't touch her spiritually."
"I would have to say yes," agreed another man. "I love her, but afterwards I could still love her, and we'd have the money."
In case you were wondering how its theme plays out, the film's main characters, Diana and David (Miss Moore and Mr. Harrelson) are avatars from an equally bromide-ridden America, a smug and comfortable world where there is an answer for every question and no one questions any answers. In this world, David believes "a life without risk is like no life at all."
Displaying her habit for being bowled over by shopworn verities, Diana dreamily intones, "Someone once said, 'If you want something very badly, set it free, if it comes back to you, it's yours forever.' "
In Diana and David's sturdy, no-frills America, pocketbooks are eschewed for knapsacks, underwear is white cotton and shirts are well-worn denim. David snacks on the good-old-American peanut butter and banana sandwiches that fattened Elvis Presley. Yet, Diana and David are not squares. Their sex life is heated and virtually incessant. Their intimacy permits Diana to engage David in earnest talks about their finances while she sits on the toilet.
David is an architect. Diana is a real estate agent who finds the property on which David can build the dream house that will establish his reputation, though it turns out that, unlike Mr. Blandings, he can't afford it. The recession has inhibited their grasping the American dream through the hard work and vision that traditionally help obtain it. They borrow $5,000 and go to Las Vegas, Nev., to parlay it into the $50,000 they desperately need, thus partaking in the ultimate American dream, which is to get something for nothing.
In Las Vegas, Diana beguiles the billionaire John Gage by surreptitiously helping herself to a large handful of free Godiva chocolates, (read: innocent) and then trying on a $5,000 black dress that is elegant with just a hint of bondage (read: sexy). Still, Diana evinces her stubborn Calvinist streak when John tries to buy her the dress.
"You've earned it," he tells her.
"No, I haven't," she replies. "The dress is for sale. I'm not."
Sadly, like most of what Diana claims, this is not the case.
And when John offers David a million dollars for one night with Diana, she replies with characteristic originality, "You can't buy people."
"That's naive, Diana," John says, in the best line of the picture, "I buy people every day."
John is curiously self-effacing for a man able to amass a billion dollars. "The night would come and go," he tells the couple when they initially and emphatically refuse his offer, "but the money would last a lifetime."
In any case, you see what is upsetting about this picture: it nudges you to reassess cherished illusions that the vows you make cannot be broken, that the principles you adopt cannot be compromised, that you cannot be bought for a million dollars. And the audience giggles and twitters nervously when the next scene reveals David in bed, sleeplessly staring at the ceiling, eyes as round, blue and blank as newly laid robin's eggs. They laugh because it is obvious that he is thinking that the deal might be worth it.
Just like people in real life, movie characters want it both ways, although, unlike in real life, getting it both ways does not seem to pose much of an obstacle.
"Fatal Attraction" hedged its bets by dividing the classic madonna/ whore into two people. The particular cleverness of a movie like "Pretty Woman" or "Indecent Proposal" is that they contain the tension of madonna and whore in a single individual. Not that there is much tension, this being Hollywood. In "Pretty Woman," the madonna was barely a whore, while "Indecent Proposal's" whore is a tad too earthy to really be a madonna. Nonetheless, this fusion enabled the pretty woman to be both a prostitute and an innocent, while enabling Diana to be both a bad girl and a self-sacrificing martyr.
But sacrifice, or so women are always told, is meant to be its own reward. So perhaps what ultimately upsets people about "Indecent Proposal" is not that Diana spends the night with John, but that she enjoys it. The idea that a woman can enjoy sex without love makes people nervous.
In the Chinese film "Raise the Red Lantern," the most likable woman is the one who least likes being a concubine. But now, we have Diana, dressed by John for their rendezvous in a Mandarin-style sheath, after he has already pleased her with a sexy dress in a big red box tied with bright red ribbon, like a child's vision of a really good present. You don't have to be pre-pubescent to harbor the fantasy of being Daddy's little girl.
The future of the woman's movement depends on women disliking their current position, which means that nothing subverts feminism more than the possibility that there are perks in being infantalized and in victimization. The secret appeal of the victimized status is precisely what Adrian Lyne, the director of "Indecent Proposal," has capitalized on since he made "Nine-and-a-Half Weeks" and "Fatal Attraction." The degree to which women enjoy being victims is the degree to which their progress is impeded, which means that progress depends on denying that this enjoyment is possible.
"I hate you," Diana later tells John.
"No," he says, "you want to hate me."
By the end of the movie, David and Diana have ventured far from the good, predictable America where children of all ages eat peanut butter and banana sandwiches, only to arrive there once again, ready to embark on the life they planned initially. Which brings us to the most disturbing aspect of this picture: it's strange ability to demonstrate that nothing is more difficult to become than the person you always claimed to be.

HEADLINE: Fixing Blast Damage Isn't an Economic Lift

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report April 8 that economists of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimate the World Trade Center blast is providing an economic benefit. You have fallen prey to an old economic fallacy often called the "broken window fallacy." 
 This is the notion that wanton destruction, whether by vandals, terrorists or even full-scale war, is somehow a net benefit to the economy by creating work and funneling funds in a concentrated manner toward repairing damage and replacing destroyed goods.
But real wealth, as opposed to money wealth, has been destroyed in the bombing; spending money in the effort to recreate it funnels that money from the effort to create new wealth.
The thinking of the Port Authority economists overlooks all the other jobs that would have been created or sustained and the products that would have been purchased if people could spend their money as they preferred to spend it before they had to spend money on replacing what has been destroyed.
Whether or not most of the money came from outside the New York area, if the logic of the broken window fallacy were followed, New York City could get the most bang for the buck (so to speak) economically by employing terrorists, since a simple and cheap explosion is the quick ticket toward economic growth. Obviously, this is nonsense.
So is the Port Authority analysis, which you have presented so unquestioningly.

HEADLINE: APRIL 11-17: Failure in Bosnia;
Srebrenica: A Symbol Of Serbian Brutality And the World's Impotence

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Serbian forces in Bosnia last week launched a final assault on the eastern town of Srebrenica after a siege emblematic of the horrors of the Balkan war and the outside world's inability to stop it. The United Nations, having failed to organize action that might have saved the Muslim-held enclave, was reduced to efforts to minimize the carnage of its evacuation.
The town's plight seems to illustrate conclusively, if there were any doubt, that the Bosnian Serbs intend to use force to consolidate their position while the world dithers. Negotiating, if necessary, comes later, from a vantage of strength. 
 Hope is fading for the peace plan for the former Yugoslavia devised by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen of Britain. The Muslim-led Bosnian Government said Srebrenica's fall would render its signing of the peace plan void. Even Lord Owen last week said bombing raids on the Serbs' supply routes were now probably needed to bring the Serbs in line.
President Clinton may have been hinting the same thing when he said the West needed to consider actions that "previously have been unacceptable" to stop Serbian attacks. He said he had not ruled out any military option except sending American ground troops to the Balkans.
Also under consideration are tightened economic sanctions and, perhaps, a decision to allow the Bosnian Government to import arms.
The Serbs are evidently calculating that they can live with anything short of major Western military intervention (the NATO air patrols that began last week over Bosnia are largely inconsequential). Still, tough action may not materialize for many reasons, ranging from American fear of a quagmire to Russian opposition.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Head to Head With the Japanese

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IF there was any doubt in the minds of the Japanese that the rules have permanently changed in their dealings with Washington, it ended last week when Secretary of State Warren G. Christopher flew into town for an emergency meeting about aiding Russia and stopped by to meet Japan's new Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto.
In years past there would have been lots of reassuring talk at such a first meeting about how crucial the Japan-America relationship was, as the linchpin of stability and democracy in East Asia. Instead, the two men started talking about personal computers. Halfway through Mr. Muto's explanation of the wonders of Japan's new $116 billion economic stimulus package, which includes the purchase of more high-tech equipment for Japanese schools and universities, Mr. Christopher cut to the heart of the matter: Would the program result in more opportunities for the likes of I.B.M., Compaq and Apple, whose share of the Japanese personal computer market, while growing, is nothing to celebrate? 
 "It wasn't so subtle, but the message had to get across," said an American diplomat who helped inspire the exchange. "The central element in this relationship is now, more clearly than ever, the economic relationship. And for the Japanese, that is taking some getting used to."
Indeed, for two countries as obsessed with each other as these, it is remarkable how out of sync they seem to be. When Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Washington on Friday, President Clinton and his Cabinet members wasted little time with get-to-know-you niceties, and moved right into talk about the primacy of the trade surplus to the relationship -- and the need for immediate results before protectionist movements mushroom.
They did nod to the continued need for a deep security relationship, especially in light of North Korea's nuclear program. There was the usual vague talk about global cooperation on the environment and energy. But Mr. Clinton made it clear that the shift in priorities that has been seeping through the relationship for years must now be acknowledged. "The cold war partnership between our two countries is outdated," he said at a joint press conference with Mr. Miyazawa. He talked at length about "the rebalancing of our relationship" to put economics at the forefront. "America is accepting the challenge of change, and so, too, must Japan."
 
Different Timetables
 But it is clear that the pace of change the two countries have in mind is quite different. Mr. Clinton is talking about a quick reversal of the trade gap, which was $49 billion in 1992. But Mr. Miyazawa, in a contemplative conversation on Monday with American reporters, said that "we should be patient."
"Since we have been trying to cooperate for a decade," he said, "there is no reason we should solve it overnight." He even mused about the continued need for "gaiatsu" -- the well-rehearsed cycle of American pressure and Japanese concessions that, while effective, breeds resentments here. Mr. Miyazawa likened it to a "mother telling her child to do this or not to do this, otherwise your neighbor may laugh at you; that is the way of education in this country." And it would go on for some time, he predicted, because gaiatsu is "just perhaps a part of our culture," Japan's mechanism for adjusting itself to "the modern world."
In the Clinton Administration's view, it is a bit late for hand-wringing about how Japan needs more time to make cultural adjustments. Mr. Clinton's leaked comment to Russia's President, Boris Yeltsin, that "when the Japanese say yes to us, they often mean no" seemed tinged with impatience about talks that drag on endlessly. Mr. Miyazawa laughed the comment off, saying it reminded him of the song, "Yes, We Have No Bananas." But in the end, his trip to Washington amounted to another no-bananas meeting. Apart from the economic stimulus program -- which at best will increase imports by a few billion dollars -- he brought little fruit to feed the new occupant of White House.
For the Japanese, this is the worst moment to talk about new concessions, much less a new basis for the relationship. At few times in its 37-year rule has the Liberal Democratic Party been in greater turmoil or fear that its monopoly on power may be threatened. The result is a virtual vacuum of political leadership at the top -- where leadership has never been in huge supply -- to get done what Mr. Clinton says he needs.
Over the past two months most of the elderly men who quietly executed the political fixes with the United States have suddenly found themselves in jail, in the hospital or out of power, leaving it less clear than ever who is really running the place. And this has left a swirl of rumors about the growing strength of some new parties and the possibility of large-scale defections from the Liberal Democrats later this year.
The absence of political leadership was evident in the weeks leading up to the two-day emergency meeting here last week of the seven leading industrialized democracies, an event Japan was unenthusiastic about. Everyone in Tokyo knew that as the host of the meeting, and of the G-7 summit meeting in July, Japan would have to come up with serious aid for Mr. Yeltsin. It did: $1.8 billion (most of it in credits and trade insurance) as its share of a $28 billion aid package largely contingent on Russian austerity. Along the way, though, Japanese leaders left their Russia policy in a tangle of contradictions, with Cabinet ministers changing their descriptions daily about whether Japan is now willing to set aside a territorial dispute over four islands held by the Soviet Union and Russia since the end of World War II.
The Russia conference proved that gaiatsu lives on as the driving force behind Japanese policy. But top officials here say they fear that the Clinton Administration is beginning to push too hard, announcing "investigations" of compliance with trade agreements and tempting the Japanese bureaucracy to retaliate in kind.
Mr. Miyazawa made it clear during his visit that Japan would not stand for new American efforts to guarantee a specific market share for American products, or tolerate trade sanctions if Washington plays judge and jury on issues of trade.
"You want to solve everything quickly," one of Mr. Miyazawa's closest foreign policy advisers said the other day. "From our point of view it will take time." In short, we have no bananas today. Maybe tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Verdict in Los Angeles;
Calm Relief Where Rage Once Ruled

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 17

 BODY:
After two years of convulsions, racial turmoil and fear, a great cloud of gloom lifted from Los Angeles today.
The battered city seemed to open and brighten just after 7 A.M., when it was announced that two of four white officers had been found guilty of violating Rodney G. King's civil rights. Shopkeepers who had boarded up their stores opened for business. Children went to Saturday arts classes. Traffic moved smoothly amid a general feeling that the split verdict had brought at least a measure of justice, if not a solution to all this city's social ills. 
 "It's like I've got cotton under my feet," Jimmy Simon, a black retired mechanic, said as he flashed a toothy smile on a street in South-Central Los Angeles. "Everybody can go home -- nothing will happen now."
 
Divisions Remain
 It was much the same throughout this polyglot region's patchwork quilt of suburbs and city, and the calm that lasted through the day appeared to be holding well into the evening.
But there were also pointed reminders that much work remained, that more than equal justice in the courts was at issue.
"There has to be some economic and educational justice," said Connier J. Nero, a black woman who helps the elderly get medical care. "We can't talk about holding hands and being friends when you have a job and I don't."
 
Nightmare May Be Over
 Since Friday evening, 6,500 police officers, backed by National Guard troops, have been at full mobilization in case of a repeat of the devastating riots that left 52 dead and $1 billion in property damage last year. But they had little to do apart from keeping a wary eye.
"All the information we are getting is that the streets are quiet and peaceful," said Deputy Police Chief Matthew V. Hunt at the police command post at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. "Hopefully, this long nightmare that has gone on for the last two years is finally behind us."
At City Hall, Mayor Tom Bradley, nearing the end of his 20-year tenure, breathed a sigh of relief. "Today a jury representing the diversity of our city found the truth," he said. "Today a measure of simple justice has been delivered to our community."
He added, "Today, Los Angeles has turned the corner."
The verdicts were praised around the city and the nation. Gov. Pete Wilson said, "Justice has been done." In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno said, "The jury has spoken and justice has prevailed."
There was also great relief 40 miles away in Simi Valley, the suburban community in Ventura County where a state jury with no black members acquitted the four officials on state charges last year, in a verdict that touched off days of rioting. "I think we are very pleased that it is over, so we can get on with life," said Mayor Gregory Stratton. "The prosecution this time did a much better job."
At the corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues, the South-Central Los Angeles flash point for last April's riots, all was calm apart from the commotion caused by dozens of reporters and photographers. Drivers passed, honked their horns and flashed peace signs at the cameras.
"I don't understand why everybody is here," said Joseph Thomas, a black stock worker at the Price Club who had stopped for gas at the Unocal station at the still-battered intersection. "This area has been pretty quiet until today."
 
Business as Usual
 In Koreatown, which suffered the worst of the damage to shops last year, merchants warily began to open for business starting about 9 A.M., when it appeared that all was calm. "When I heard the verdict, I thought, There's not that much to get excited about," Charles Yoon said at his small key-copying shack in the minimall at Vermont Avenue and West Eighth Street. His shack was looted and burned last year.
At Cosmos, a Koreatown appliance store that had been cleaned out last year, Lawrence Ha, the manager, was open for business as usual. "The city is so quiet now," he said. "We've already started making deliveries across town, downtown, and in black neighborhoods. There is nobody on the streets."
Probably nowhere was the reaction more emotional than at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominantly black congregation where a large crowed gathered to watch the verdict on big-screen televisions.
One year ago, just after the acquittal in the state trial, Mayor Bradley stood at the church's pulpit and pleaded for calm as violence broke out around the city.
Today, the Rev. Cecil Murray bowed his head in prayer and held hands with the Rev. Jesse Jackson as the clerk read the verdict in Federal court.
 
Eruption of Cheers
 The word "guilty" twice brought an eruption of cheers when the verdicts for Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell were read. When it was over, the group burst into the hymn "My Faith Looks Up to Thee," their hands reaching to touch a Bible held aloft.
Later, Mr. Murray, a leader in attempts to calm the city's minority areas, expressed joy at the verdict but warned that "justice means jobs."
There were still fears of trouble because of the upcoming trial of three young black men in the beating of a truck driver, Reginald O. Denny, during last year's unrest. But John Mack, president of the local chapter of the Urban League, said he believed that the groundwork for peace had been laid during months of preparations.
"I believe that the verdict in this case is going to help," he said. "We have begun to restore the lost credibility in the criminal justice system, which was just about zero before in the African-American community."
 
'Justice Has Spoken'
 The church hall rang with calls for the local and Federal governments to intensify efforts to create jobs and training, and to improve schooling in Los Angeles's poorer neighborhoods.
The reaction among police officers was more equivocal. Deputy Chief Hunt watched the verdict with other officers at the Coliseum. "It was a very dramatic moment with very little reaction," he said later. "Justice has spoken."
On the streets, most police officers refused to comment on the record. One who did was Sgt. Gene McCloskey, who said: "We've been turned upside down for two years. Maybe we can get on with policing now."
Another white officer, who would not give his name, said the convicted officers "were scapegoats."
At the Los Angeles Police Department's Southeast Division headquarters, officers clustered around television sets. Officer John J. Clark said, "For the people who work in the street, it makes their job a lot tougher to do, because we'll be second guessed every time we do something.
"This is what a majority of the community wanted. This gives the criminal a lot more power in the streets."
At City Hall, the Chief of Police, Willie L. Williams, urged Angelenos to go about their normal business today, saying the police would remain on high alert.
"Right now, the City of Los Angeles is very calm, perhaps even more calm than this time last Saturday," he said. "It's very important to point out that the deployment plans put in place last night, complemented with full deployment beginning at 6 A.M. this morning, will stay in place for the time being."
The previous police chief, Daryl F. Gates, who was forced from his job by controversies over the King beating, spoke on KFI, a radio station on which he has a talk show. "It's amazing to see the jubilation on the part of some people over this verdict and that fact that so many are saying what a great verdict it is and what a great job this jury has done," Mr. Gates said. "Those are the same people who trashed the system on the last occasion."
"I think they were under incredible pressure," Mr. Gates said of the jury. "Clearly in the back of their minds they had to have the pressure of the rioting, the vilification of the last jury."
Asked about Mr. Gates's comments, Mayor Bradley -- long at odds with the former chief -- said, "Daryl Gates is irrelevant to the issues of this city."
Civil rights groups voiced satisfaction with the verdict but cautioned that the case was merely a symptom of basic issues of unequal justice, racial bias and police brutality that must still be addressed.
In a statement, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund said, "These convictions send a message to all of America: It is unacceptable under the laws of our nation to brutalize any person on the basis of race."
The group called on the nation "to look beyond the drama of this trial, to the criminal justice system that produced this horrible event," and to the economic plight of urban minority communities.

HEADLINE: Verdict in Los Angeles;
CLINTON SATISFIED BY JURY'S DECISION

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Clinton expressed satisfaction today with the verdict in the police beating trial in Los Angeles and then used the decision as a platform to promote spiritual and economic revitalization.
In an interview at the airport in Pittsburgh with radio station KDKA shortly after the verdict, Mr. Clinton said of the jury, "No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here." 
The President, a former prosecutor and lawyer, gave his own analysis of the split verdict, saying that the two men who were convicted, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell, seemed to bear more responsibility in the March 1991 beating of a motorist, Rodney G. King. One of the acquitted officers, Theodore J. Briseno, tried to shield Mr. King from more blows, Mr. Clinton said, and the other officer, Timothy E. Wind, was a rookie.
 
Federal Efforts Praised
 The President also praised the efforts of the Federal Government in developing the case. The case was begun by the Bush Administration's Justice Department in the heat of last year's election campaign several months after the acquittal of the four officers in a state trial precipitated rioting in Los Angeles.
The new Attorney General, Janet Reno, said today at a press conference in Washington that the "Department of Justice is going to do everything it can to continue to bring prosecutions to insure that the civil rights of all citizens across the country are protected."
The department will recommend sentences for the two convicted officers to the Federal judge in the case, but Ms. Reno declined to discuss the matter further, saying, "That should be done in court."
The President, at the beginning of a rally at the Pittsburgh International Airport, relayed news of the verdict to the crowd, who cheered and applauded at the announcement of the two guilty verdicts. Mr. Clinton said he found a deeper message in the jury's decision, calling for reconciliation and harmony despite the racial, religious and ethnic differences in the country.
 
'Our Common Humanity'
 "Surely the lasting legacy of the Rodney King trial ought to be a determination to reaffirm our common humanity and to make a strength of our diversity. And if we can do that, then we get on about the business of this great land," he told the airport crowd.
The President, in his radio interview a few minutes later, said that the verdict reinforced the importance of "not violating the civil rights of any American." He also used the case to highlight two priorities of his Administration, renewing the fight against crime and revitalizing the cities and economically distressed areas.
President Clinton was in Pennsylvania to push his spending program.

HEADLINE: 2 Gay Adoption Cases Go to Appeals Courts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., April 17

 BODY:
Appellate courts in two states are to decide whether a person in a long-term homosexual relationship can adopt the children of the partner.
The Vermont Supreme Court and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Appeals Court each have before them a case in which a lesbian has asked to become the adoptive parent of her partner's children. The rulings later this year will be the nation's first appellate-level decisions on the issue. 
 Some advocates of such adoptions say they welcome the prospect of rulings with more weight than the decisions of trial court judges.
"Not only will this provide uniformity throughout one state, but it may also have a persuasive effect on other states," said Paula Ettelbrick, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights group based in New York.
But other people see a peril for those who favor such adoptions.
"At least 100 -- and probably hundreds -- of these cases have succeeded at the trial court level, most of them on the West Coast," said Ruth Harlow, a lawyer with the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. "At the trial court level, the judge gets to see the interaction between the parents and the children. The danger at the appellate level is that judges will deal with the legal issues in a vacuum."
There was no legal opposition to the adoptions in either of the New England cases. The lawyers for the people involved say they simply want an interpretation of the laws.
The catalyst for the Vermont case was a health insurance claim involving Deborah Lashman and Jane Van Buren. Ms. Van Buren, who was unemployed at the time, was the biological mother of two boys, 18 months old and 4 years old, who were conceived by artificial insemination.
Ms. Lashman's insurer would not include them under her policy.
"We had been thinking about adoption for some time," Ms. Van Buren said in an interview, "but when I was unemployed, we felt very vulnerable. We were living off Deb's income. What if something happened to her? The boys couldn't even collect her Social Security benefits."
 
Rare Adoption Rejection
 Judge George Belcher of Burlington Probate Court turned down their adoption request in June 1992 in what Ms. Ettelbrick and Ms. Harlow said was the first case they were aware of nationally in which a trial judge disallowed such an adoption.
Judge Belcher declined to comment on his decision, but Ms. Ettelbrick, who took part in the case, said he apparently relied on language in the Vermont adoption statutes that requires a spouse to consent to an adoption. She said Judge Belcher interpreted the wording to mean that couples must be married in order to adopt.
Ms. Lashman and Ms. Van Buren appealed.
In the Massachusetts case, known as "the adoption of Katherine Mary," Ms. Harlow said the trial judge allowed the adoption but then sent the case to the appeals court to test the validity of her interpretation of the statute. Briefs in that case were filed in mid-February.
Only two states, Florida and New Hampshire, have specifically prohibited adoptions by partners of the same sex, and the Florida statute is being tested in several lawsuits there.

HEADLINE: Audit Faults Market for Ills of Blue Cross

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 17

 BODY:
A long-awaited independent audit of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield concludes that the management of New York State's largest health-insurance company has been slow to react to accelerating changes in the insurance marketplace. Among other findings, the audit maintains that Empire trailed the rest of the industry in expanding its managed-care programs and in developing modern computer systems, both of which contributed to heavy losses in recent years.
But the executive summary of a draft of the report, based on an audit ordered by the State Legislature last year and performed by Arthur Andersen & Company, maintains that Empire's poor financial performance has resulted primarily from economic forces beyond the control of management. 
 "Empire's current financial straits are the result of the inevitable conflict between the historic social mission of Blue Cross Blue Shield and the modern reality of spiraling health-care costs and heightened market competition for low-risk customers," according to the draft report.
The final report is due on May 1, but officials with Empire and the state began receiving copies of the draft on Thursday night. The Daily News reported some of the audit's findings today.
 
Empire Officials Find Support
 Empire officials said today that they were gratified by the audit's support for their contention that the company's losses of $250 million over the last two years were largely unavoidable. But the audit stops far short of giving Empire's management a clean bill of health.
"In a dynamic, volatile health care market, Empire has been an autocratic, functionally organized, hierarchical organization that has been slow to react to the pace of change," the report states. "In an earlier era -- when the pace of change was slower and competition less intense -- Empire's culture and operating environment may have served it well. Today Empire is neither organized nor managed to become a market leader in innovation or quality improvement."
The audit criticized the dual managerial role played by Albert A. Cardone, who serves both as Empire's board chairman and its chief executive officer. That arrangement has been questioned by the State Insurance Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, who told Empire board members on Friday that they should either take more responsibility for the company or resign.
The audit concludes that "companies like Empire, which operate in the public trust, can more effectively address issues such as governance and strategic mission by separating the lead roles in the company."
Michael Blumenfeld, Empire's vice president for public and governmental affairs, said the board would seriously examine all of the audit's recommendations, including the division of Mr. Cardone's responsibilities.
The larger issue may be whether the board ultimately will lose confidence in Mr. Cardone, who has become a lightning rod for criticism of the company. Some Republican legislators have called for the resignations of both Mr. Cardone and Mr. Curiale.
The audit may help Mr. Cardone to some extent. It dismisses as unjustified the recurring criticism of the company's salary levels and administrative expenses.
 
$600,000 Salary
 Last month, The New York Times reported that Empire lost tens of millions of dollars over the last decade through a series of management mistakes, offered lucrative contracts to insiders and spent freely on management perquisites. Mr. Cardone receives $600,000 a year, travels first class and is provided with a chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car.
But the audit concludes that "based on comparisons to various insurance executive compensation surveys, Empire's officer-compensation levels are reasonable."
And with regard to travel and entertainment expenses, if found that "Empire's policies are stringent when compared to comparable private corporations and in fact may impair the ability of Empire's marketing and sales organization to compete in the larger group market."
Empire is a nonprofit corporation that must insure all those who can afford to pay, regardless of their health or age. In return, it gets a discount on hospital charges and pays no state or city taxes. The company serves 8.5 million people in 28 counties in eastern New York, from the New York City area to Albany.
With the company's reserves dwindling in recent years, the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have taken a number of extraordinary measures to keep Empire afloat.
In January, under a deal negotiated by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature, Mr. Curiale granted Empire a rate increase that averaged 20 percent per customer. The increase came on the heels of legislation approved last year that was aimed at making Empire more competitive with commercial insurance companies.
Under the new law, which took effect on April 1, commercial insurers have to accept all applicants and must base rates on the risks posed by groups of customers rather than individuals. The law also authorized Arthur Andersen to conduct the audit to determine whether the company's problems resulted from its management practices or its competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.

HEADLINE: Verdict in Los Angeles;
NEW YORK GREETS VERDICTS QUIETLY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Calm prevailed across the New York metropolitan area after the verdicts in the Los Angeles beating case yesterday, but emotions were sharply mixed as public officials, spiritual and civil-rights leaders and many ordinary people voiced relief, praise, anger and disappointment over the mosaic outcome.
The verdict -- two white officers guilty and two acquitted of Federal civil-rights charges in the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King in 1991 -- was the topic of the day for people across the region, as it was for millions of Americans a year after straight acquittals in a state trial that led to deadly riots in Los Angeles and other cities. 
 But after days of apprehension and low-key preparations for trouble, there were no reports of violence in the metropolitan area yesterday -- not even an echo of last year's sporadic and relatively moderate incidents of disorder in New York City, New Rochelle and a few other areas.
"It's as quiet as any normal April Saturday," said Deputy Inspector John Laffey, commanding officer of New York's police operations, whose hundreds of officers had little to do but patrol a soft spring day remarkable mainly for the yellow daffodils and sprays of forsythia out in the parks and for a warm golden sun that prowled for openings in a puffy meringue of clouds.
 
Hopes for Harmony
 And while hundreds of people in the New York area attended vigils, rallies or gatherings in houses of worship and expressed anger and sorrow over what many felt was an imperfect verdict, the predominant themes were those of peace and hope for harmony in a nation too often dealing with racial hatreds.
"It was half of what I wanted, but twice as much as I expected," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended a morning vigil with 150 people at Public School 175 in Harlem and later led a rally of 50 chanting demonstrators protesting the verdict outside Police Headquarters in Manhattan.
"I think it vindicates those of us who have for years said that the state trials were unfair," Mr. Sharpton said of the verdict. "In many ways it validates the marchings and groanings and protests that many of us have done for years." He also called for a review of a half dozen local cases involving allegations of excessive force by police officers.
Another civil-rights advocate, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, said he was sorry that all four officers in Los Angeles were not convicted but relieved that at least two were found guilty. And he contended that last year's riots, while sparked by the King verdict, were a result of more profound grievances.
"The eruptions which created such havoc in cities across America last year were due in large part to the urban decay, impoverishment, neglect, unfairness and injustice," he said. He called for a new urban policy to save the cities with aid comparable to the Marshall Plan for Europe after World War II.
 
Mayor Asks for Calm
 At City Hall, Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had appealed for calm in recent days while quietly mustering support from leaders of civic and other groups and ordering a wide range of security precautions, met with his top advisers, including Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and Fire Commissioner Carlos M. Rivera.
"I thought all four were guilty," the Mayor said after the announcement in Los Angeles, echoing a view expressed by many New Yorkers. He said the four had "crossed the thin blue line between appropriate response and excessive force." But he added, "We must accept the verdict -- that doesn't mean I have to like it."
In Newark, a largely black and poor city of 275,000 that experienced devastating riots in 1967, the verdict was met with a mixture of disappointment and relief.
"It's something," said Malik Al-Salaam, who was selling T-shirts with red, black and green flags of Africa. "After the first verdict, when the proof was so obvious with the videotape, I thought there was nothing that could give a black man justice."
But Thelma Nickerson, a lifelong Newark resident, said she believed that accusations of police brutality were still largely unheeded. And Allan Siegal, director of a downtown art gallery, said: "I've become more depressed than before. It points out the horrible state of urban disintegration."
 
Compromise Is Seen
 In Harlem, on Malcolm X Boulevard, many called the verdict a compromise, perhaps intended to pacify Americans, and that left some angry. "I think all of them should have been found guilty -- and that's not because I'm black, it's because I'm a human being," said Junior Smith, a street vendor.
But Kevin McGill, a shoe-store owner, called the verdicts just. "The next time a black man gets stopped by the police, he won't have fear in his heart," Mr. McGill said.
In Brooklyn, Luis Garden Acosta, chief executive of El Puente, a Hispanic community organization, called the verdict a step in the right direction for the nation.
"This trial was not just about those four individuals, but about this country's values and about our history and who we are as a people," he said. "I believe the two individuals found not guilty represented the millions of Americans who in the face of injustice turn the other way."

HEADLINE: Turgut Ozal, 66, Dies in Ankara; Pugnacious President of Turkey

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, who was combative, pugnacious and provocative to the last, died in his Ankara home yesterday. He was 66 years old.
Officials said the cause of death was heart failure and suggested that it might have been hastened by a grueling 12-day tour of Central Asia that ended two days earlier. 
 The five-country tour was designed to show support for neighboring Azerbaijan, which is ethnically close to Turkey, in its conflict with Armenia.
Mr. Ozal had undergone triple-bypass heart surgery in the United States in 1987 and survived an assassination attempt a year later. He had been free of known heart problems since then.
Reporters traveling with him in Central Asia said he had seemed very fatigued.
 
Joined Anti-Iraq Coalition
 A squat, bespectacled and irascible figure, President Ozal left a deep mark on Turkey's modern history.
In 1990, he showed no hesitation in committing his predominantly Muslim country, a member of the NATO alliance, to the United States-led coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. That was crucial to the coalition's planning because it meant the severing of Iraq's principle oil-export routes, which remain closed by United Nations sanctions, and gave allied warplanes access to tactically important air bases.
In a statement yesterday, President Clinton said: "On behalf of all Americans, Mrs. Clinton and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to the people of Turkey and to the family and friends of President Ozal. President Ozal devoted his life to public service, and Turkey is a stronger country because of his dedicated and visionary leadership."
At home, many Turks remembered Mr. Ozal as the leader who thrust his land into an export-led drive toward free enterprise that revolutionized its moribund economy and turned the 1980's into free-wheeling boom years as the nation emerged in 1983 from three years of military rule.
Mr. Ozal's career betrayed a liking for power played out in devil-may-care style on the stage of international renown. But at home, his political life displayed other attributes. He engaged publicly in what seemed petty personal vendettas.
In his later years, his provocative comments often seemed deliberately at odds with official policy. And he was often accused of permitting his family to misuse his office to lead lives of lavish ostentation.
 
Was World Bank Economist
 Mr. Ozal was born in the central Anatolian town of Malatya. His father was a bank clerk and his mother a schoolteacher. He studied electrical engineering at Istanbul Technical University and joined the World Bank as an economist. Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's most durable political survivor and current prime minister, appointed him head of the State Planning Office in the 1970's.
His political career took shape during Turkey's period of military rule, from Mr. Demirel's overthrow in 1980 to the return of civilian rule in 1983.
His Motherland Party was one of the few the army allowed to operate, and Mr. Ozal became Prime Minister from 1983 to 1989. By then, the high inflationary cost of the 1980's boom and complaints about the autocratic behavior of Mr. Ozal and his family had weakened his public following.
Sensing his party's imminent political decline, he had himself elected President, a post traditionally above politics, so as to be able to retain high office after his party's 1991 election defeat by Mr. Demirel and his allies.
 
Running Battle With Demirel
 From then on, Mr. Ozal fought a running battle with Mr. Demirel, the one-time patron whose political rehabilitation he had opposed in the 1980's.
Such was Mr. Ozal's objection to the apolitical nature of the presidency that he once spent most of an hourlong interview with a reporter reading aloud clauses from the Constitution permitting presidential political intervention.
Those interventions were often controversial.
Claiming some Kurdish ancestry, he spoke out far more openly for limited rights for Turkey's large and restive Kurdish minority than did Mr. Demirel or most other mainstream politicians.
He also seemed to delight in abandoning Ankara's cautious diplomacy to champion the cause of Turkey's Muslim allies in regional disputes from the Caucasus to the Balkans.
 
'Turkey Must Show Its Teeth'
 "Turkey must show its teeth to Armenia," he said two weeks ago in discussing the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. "What harm would it do if a few bombs were dropped on the Armenian side by Turkish troops holding maneuvers on the border?"
His five-nation Central Asian tour itself seemed a display of his refusal to play only ceremonial roles.
According to a medical report issued in Ankara yesterday, Mr. Ozal suffered blood pressure fluctuations overnight, and doctors implanted a pacemaker in the early hours of the day. By the time he arrived at Hacettepe University Hospital in Ankara in the early afternoon, however, he had no pulse and his breathing had stopped. Efforts to revive him failed.
Mr. Ozal is survived by his wife, Semra; two sons, Ahmet and Efe, and a daughter, Zeynep.
Under Turkish law, the Speaker of Parliament, Husamettin Cindoruk, will be acting President until Parliament elects a successor within 30 days. The new president needs the support of two-thirds of the 450 legislators.

HEADLINE: Revival of Tax Credit Is Sought to Spur Low-Income Housing

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Perhaps Thurgood Marshall or Cab Calloway slept in what is now Anita Winston's apartment back when the Whitelaw Hotel was the place to stay for black notables visiting segregated Washington. But after the 1950's, the hotel decayed into an abandoned, drug-infested hulk.
A lot of forces had to come together to revive the historic hotel into a home for 35 low-income families. Among them was an unusual alliance of big corporations looking at their tax bills and a network of housing groups hoping to rebuild inner cities. 
 But most of all, the transformation of the Whitelaw rests on a tax provision that has become the primary resource for such housing nationwide and that is a major element of the Clinton Administration's policy on housing: the low-income housing tax credit.
 
Tax Credit Has 2 Advantages
 The credit was responsible for 94 percent of the low-income housing constructed from 1986, when it was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act, and last year, when its temporary authorization expired. By calling for the provision to be made permanent as part of his economic package, Mr. Clinton has picked up on an idea endorsed by housing advocates well before he came to the White House.
Though some advocates assert that changes are needed in the provision to insure that it benefits those who are most in need, the majority of them agree that its permanent extension is essential. And housing experts in and out of Government agree that the credit has two important advantages over more traditional housing programs: it puts development into private hands, which is considered more efficient, and tax credits are often easier to support politically than direct Government spending.
In a recent speech, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said permanent extension of the tax credit would "stimulate the construction and rehabilitation of 120,000 low-income homes annually, support 67,000 jobs and generate $1.7 billion in wages every year."
Although the tax credit has enjoyed widespread support in Congress and the White House, under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Congress balked at writing its foregone revenues into the budget permanently. The credit, which would cost the Government $5 billion over a five years, is one of several tax incentives in a Democratic urban aid and tax bill.
Even as a temporary measure, the tax credit is responsible for the creation of more than 600,000 housing units in the last six years and one-third of all new housing starts, said Paul S. Grogan, president of the New York-based Local Initiatives Support Corporation, whose subsidiary, the National Equity Fund, organizes tax-credit financing. Housing has been built through the credit in all 50 states, with the cities of Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia among the biggest beneficiaries.
 
Community and Private Groups
 Under the law, the Federal Government issues tax credits to state housing agencies, with the most populous states receiving the most credits. Developers can apply to the state for credits that are then sold to investors, usually corporations that enjoy credits against their Federal corporate income tax.
The provision has resulted in partnerships between community-based organizations and private investors. And several groups have grown up as intermediaries, raising money for corporations that are then packaged as financing for specific projects proposed by the grass-roots groups. The National Equity Fund and the Enterprise Social Investment Corporation, a subsidiary of the low-income housing group Enterprise Foundation, are the two largest national funds set up to manage this money.
In 1992, Local Initiatives and Enterprise together raised $403 million from more than 100 corporate investors. Of that amount, $83 million is earmarked for projects in New York and held in the New York Equity Fund, a joint venture of the two groups.
Community developers point to the Whitelaw, which reopened in late 1992, as an example of the tax credits' success. The building, which suffered a near-fatal blow in 1981 when a fire gutted its interior, was bought in 1991 by a local not-for-profit housing developer, Manna Inc.. The $4 million renovation included more than $1.6 million in capital provided by Local Initiatives.
The tax law requires that all of the units in the Whitelaw be rented to people who make 60 percent or less of Washington's median income. Nine of the units must be occupied by people who make 50 percent of the median or less. A family of four, like that of Sidney Johnson, a printer at the State Department and his wife, Olivia, who live in a three-bedroom apartment with their two daughters, must have an income of $18,000 to $36,000 a year.
The units are considered affordable by many people because tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their income. The Whitelaw must maintain these income requirements for at least 15 years, at which time renters will be given the option to buy their units.
"I've got a baby 12 months old so I could be one of the ones that stays around," said Anita Winston, 40, who lives in a three-bedroom apartment with four of her children. Standing in the building's refurbished lobby after a recent tenants' meeting, Ms. Winston said her new apartment was a "step up" from her old place in a run-down building.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Peek at Whitman Wealth Puts a Foe on the Attack

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman, a candidate for the New Jersey Republican Party's gubernatorial nomination, gave a cursory peek at her personal finances last week, and it was enough to make her political opponents gasp.
Mrs. Whitman's campaign reported that she and her husband, John, had an estimated 1992 income of $3.7 million and had paid $1,028,568 in Federal taxes and $255,000 in state income taxes. They also paid real-estate taxes of $39,551. 
 Mrs. Whitman came under immediate attack from James H. Wallwork, a former State Senator who entered the Republican race after both Mrs. Whitman and another candidate, Cary Edwards, admitted that they had hired illegal aliens.
"In light of the Whitmans' extraordinary 1992 income of $3.7 million, her hiring of illegal aliens off the books and her failing to pay Social Security, withholding, unemployment, worker compensation and other taxes demonstrate arrogance and insensitivity to tax-paying New Jersey families," Mr. Wallwork said.
Earlier this year, Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Whitman paid the back taxes and other fees associated with the hirings.
The one-page statement released last week by the Whitman camp did not say how she and Mr. Whitman, a financial consultant who currently works for the Agency for International Development, made their money.
The Whitmans have asked for a four-month extension of the April 15 filing deadline, and Mrs. Whitman said her full tax returns would be made public after she officially files. That prompted complaints from Mr. Edwards and Mr. Wallwork that Mrs. Whitman was trying to wait until after the June 8 primary.
Gov. Jim Florio and his wife, Lucinda, paid $30,160 in Federal taxes and $8,237 in state taxes on an income of $171,106. The bulk of their income came from Mr. Florio's $85,000-a-year salary as Governor and his official expense account of $75,000.
Mr. Wallwork, a businessman, and his wife, Lark, had an income of $210,047 and paid $50,188 in Federal taxes and $10,431 in state taxes. They also paid $10,405 in property taxes.
Mr. Edwards, a lawyer, has said he will release his tax information this week.
 
The Matalin Factor in Albany
 Mary Matalin, the sharp-witted and acid-tongued deputy campaign manager for George Bush in 1992, has agreed to serve as a political strategist for Jon S. Fossel, a former Assemblyman who plans to run for Governor of New York in 1994.
The agreement between Ms. Matalin and Mr. Fossel is a loose one, with neither a signed contract nor an agreement on compensation. That has led to some confusion over just what Ms. Matalin's role will be.
Mr. Fossel, a Westchester resident who served in the Assembly from 1978 to 1982 and is chairman of Oppenheimer Mutual Funds, described Ms. Matalin alternately as his "C.E.O." and his campaign manager.
But Ms. Matalin said that for the time being she considers herself more an informal adviser and overseer than a day-to-day manager. But she said that she had no plans to work for other candidates and that her role in Mr. Fossel's campaign could become active next year.

HEADLINE: $20 Million Given to Harvard Medical School

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Warren Alpert, a poor boy who made a fortune in the petroleum and food-products business, has given $20 million to Harvard Medical School, the largest gift in its 200-year history.
The Alpert gift is for the school's research building, opened last year, which houses the laboratories of the departments of genetics, neurobiology and pathology and the Center for Blood Research. The building will be named for him. 
 "I want cures, cures for Alzheimer's disease, cancer, AIDS," said Mr. Alpert, 71, who added that he chose Harvard Medical School in Boston because he thought it the most likely to be successful in fighting the diseases.
Sentiment also played a role: He likes to recall that he grew up across the harbor in a working-class neighborhood in Chelsea, Mass., and lived at 90 Orange Street in a frame house that has since been razed.
 
Always in a Hurry
 Mr. Alpert's mother had Alzheimer's and her last years were spent in a nursing home. Her photograph hangs in a place of honor in his New York office, a picture of a dignified, and somewhat stern woman with a firm chin and a no-nonsense look about her. The family resemblance is marked.
At 13, Mr. Alpert became an entrepreneur, helping his father to peddle sheets and towels from a truck. He tried to induce his father to open a store and sell on credit. "Even then, I was in a hurry to succeed," he recalled.
He put himself through Boston University, earning money as a hat salesman and by tutoring students. After Army combat service in France in World War II, he went to the Harvard Business School with the help of the G.I. Bill of Rights. It was the first time he had set foot on the Harvard campus.
In 1950, he started his own business, a dry-goods store, with $1,000 in savings and $9,000 borrowed from his older brother, which was repaid promptly.
 
On the Forbes List
 Today, Warren Equities and the Warren Companies market petroleum and food products through 300 service stations and convenience stores, operate a wholesale petroleum business along the Atlantic Seaboard and employ 1,600 people in 11 states. The enterprises have a $600 million annual volume and are listed by Forbes as one of America's 400 largest privately held companies.
Unlike many big-business ventures, the company has no long-term debt and a single owner: Mr. Alpert. He never married, and there are no children to share the fortune.
Over the years, he has made gifts to the Harvard Business School, Boston University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Sutton Place Synagogue in Manhattan, for which he helped to build a new home. Along the way, he also served in the Agency for International Development in the Kennedy Administration.
 
'Let Them Give Money'
 Mr. Alpert says he plans to urge other business leaders to endow the Harvard Medical School, pointing to buildings near the Warren Alpert Research Building known simply as A, B, C and D. Mr. Alpert deplores this anonymity as "a wasted opportunity."
"Let them give money," he said, "and have a building in their name."
He also intends to prod scientists at the research institute to pursue cures in much the same way he has pushed his own staff to promote business.
Dr. Bernard Fields, chairman of the school's department of microbiology, said medical progress was more likely to be incremental than dramatic. Still, he added: "Some people will be ruffled by his questions, but most will not. Whatever his style, most people will appreciate what he has done for this institution."
The largest gift to a college or university is believed to have been the $105 million donated in 1979 to Emory University in Atlanta by Robert W. Woodruff, former chairman of Coca-Cola. In 1992, the entrepreneur Henry M. Rowan and his wife, Betty, donated $100 million to Glassboro State College in New Jersey, which was renamed Rowan College. The gift is believed to have been the largest to a public college or university.

HEADLINE: Old M.I.A. Theory Is Given a New Life

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
A document recently unearthed in Moscow has breathed new life into one of this city's most enduring conspiracy theories: that the Reagan and Bush Administrations covered up attempts by Vietnam to trade American prisoners of war for cash.
The theory, which remains unproved, holds that Vietnam held back hundreds of P.O.W.s to make sure Washington paid war reparations, and then kept them as bargaining chips when no aid was forthcoming. 
 Proponents of this view see two new pieces of supporting evidence in the Sept. 15, 1972, document, whose authenticity is still in dispute. In it, a high-ranking Vietnamese military officer, identified as Gen. Tran Van Quang, wrote that Hanoi was holding 1,205 American prisoners, 837 more than it publicly acknowledged.
The officer explicitly linked the captives' release to economic aid and other concessions from the United States, saying, "Nixon must compensate North Vietnam for those enormous losses which the destructive war caused." Hanoi denies the authenticity of the document.
 
Only 591 Released
 Eleven days later, at the Paris peace talks, Le Duc Tho, the Vietnamese negotiator, told American negotiators that the issue of prisoners was tied to "the question of reparations," according to transcripts since made public.
When the war ended, Hanoi released only 591 prisoners. That was 400 to 600 fewer than American military officials had estimated were still alive. Eugene Tighe, a retired lieutenant general who once headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in an interview this week that he had helped draw up a list of 900 to 1,000 names of men presumed to be prisoners in 1973.
Relatively little was done to resolve this discrepancy in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations. A Senate report released in January said that from 1975 to 1983, intelligence agencies had assigned a very low priority to collecting data on troops missing in action.
Congress repeatedly refused to authorize any money for rebuilding Vietnam and by the 1980's rumors were circulating in Washington and Asia that Vietnam was seeking discreetly to trade live P.O.W.'s for cash.
 
No Conclusive Proof Found
 Those reports were repeatedly denied by officials in both the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and a recent inquiry by a Senate select committee failed to find conclusive proof either of such offers or a conspiracy to conceal them.
But the suspicions of Government wrongdoing persist, fueled by a stream of first-hand accounts from refugees and others that Americans are imprisoned in Southeast Asia. Those who believe the Vietnamese are holding Americans point to Vietnam's record in its war with France.
An expert formerly involved in investigations of Americans missing in Vietnam said that when the French withdrew in 1954, the Government agreed to pay an annual fee to Vietnam to maintain graves and continue resolution of casualties.
In 1986, rather than pay a yearly charge, France agreed to an unspecified lump sum, which was said by some to be about $360 million worth of grants and credits to buy French goods. Whatever the sum, Vietnam suddenly released 25,000 French remains in six months in 1986.
After that, some Vietnamese working on that program were transferred to American searches.
"This is our country's greatest state secret," insisted J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition. "They've known these men were there and they've covered it up."
Mr. Burch is a lawyer for the source of one of the most tantalizing stories, an account by a Secret Service agent of a 1981 conversation he says he overheard between President Reagan and his senior aides. According to the agent, the Government of Vietnam was offering to sell live P.O.W.s for $4.5 billion.
Senator Robert C. Smith, the New Hampshire Republican who was vice chairman of the Senate select committee, said in an interview that he learned of the agent's story in the mid-1980's. Mr. Smith, a member of the House of Representatives at the time, demanded a meeting with President Reagan and Vice President Bush and confronted them with the allegation in the Oval Office. Both denied it.
In 1992, when the Senate committee was investigating the matter further, the Secret Service agent refused to testify unless he was subpoenaed, saying he feared losing his job. The Treasury Department said Congressional testimony by a Secret Service agent would set a bad precedent, and a majority of the committee agreed.
When Richard Allen, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser at the time of the supposed offer, was questioned by the committee in 1992, he initially recalled an offer of $4 billion. Later, he said he had been mistaken, and that his recollection was of being asked about the issue years later. In an interview, Mr. Allen said that if the question had arisen during his tenure, he would have supported looking into it further.
Senator Smith said that Max Hugel, who was head of operations for the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, told him recently that the offer was well known to senior intelligence officials, and that the P.O.W.'s were to come out through Laos on Jan. 26, 1981. During his deposition to the committee, however, Mr. Hugel denied any knowledge of the issue or of having said anything about it to the Senator.
Senator Smith himself says he no longer believes the story told by the Secret Service agent. "If I sit in the Oval Office and ask a straightforward question -- and they tell me the answer is "No" -- and then we have a guy that won't come forward, where does that leave you?" he asked. "I'm siding with the President."
Proponents of the conspiracy theory suggest that the Reagan Administration was ignoring reports about the P.O.W.'s because it was afraid of being trapped into the sort of hostage crisis that crippled the Carter Presidency.
The Reagan Administration's actions cast doubt on that hypothesis. In early 1981, when it received intelligence reports on a possible prison camp in Laos, the Administration sent Laotian operatives into the jungle to search for confirmation. The search proved inconclusive; the team was permitted to look into the compound's buildings only from a distance.
Another opportunity arose in 1984, when a person with contacts in Southeast Asia, identified in the Senate report as I. Irving Davidson, was told by a general in Indonesia that the Vietnamese were willing to discuss with Washington the sale of both remains and live P.O.W.s. In this instance, a Government paper trail exists. Paul Wolfowitz, at the time a senior State Department official, wrote a memo to Secretary of State George P. Shultz that referred to the offer of "possible live P.O.W.s."
Richard Childress, the National Security Council's senior expert on Asia, traveled to Hanoi, met with a member of the Politburo and was told that the only thing the Vietnamese were ready to discuss was the return of remains.
The committee sent investigators to Indonesia to try to trace the report further, and even that led to conflicting testimony. The general said his original offer mentioned only remains; the general's brother, who was also involved, said the Vietnamese had included live P.O.W.s.
A final incident that has fueled speculation in Washington surrounds a February 1977 C.I.A. report. In it, Senator Smith said an Indonesian diplomat quoted the Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister, Min Phan Hien, as saying that his country was holding P.O.W.s who would be released only if the United States provided aid.
A declassified version of the document, which does not identify the name of the Vietnamese official who is speaking, says that data on M.I.A.s were "a trump card" for Vietnam in coming talks with the United States.
William Hendon, a former Republican Congressman from North Carolina who is one of the most vocal advocates of the conspiracy theory, said he saw the complete version of the document while working for the Pentagon in 1983 as a consultant on P.O.W. issues. Although the document does not specifically identify a source, Mr. Hendon said he believed the Indonesian diplomat's account of the conversation had been picked up by a listening device secretly planted in Indonesia by the C.I.A.
A C.I.A. spokesman said Friday the agency now views the report as a "fabrication."
In 1986, a Pentagon panel headed by General Tighe reviewed the existing intelligence files and concluded that there was a "strong possibility" that Americans were still being held in Vietnam.
According to Mr. Hendon, William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence at the time, told several members of Congress in October 1986 that he had the same opinion, but could not take any action unless the Americans were seen by "two of my men." Mr. Hendon later prepared a sworn affidavit that quoted Mr. Casey as telling the group, "What do you want, another hostage crisis?" Mr. Casey died in 1987.
In its 585-page report, in January, the Senate Committee quoted sworn testimony from most of the major figures in American policy that a conspiracy of silence would have been impossible to carry out. Several noted that such an effort would require the support of thousands of people scattered through the military and intelligence agencies for a period of 20 years.
"The isolated bits of information out of which some have constructed whole labyrinths of intrigue and deception have not withostood the tests of objective investigation," the report said. "The vast archives of secret U.S. documents that some felt contained incriminating evidence have been thoroughly examined by the committee only to find that the conspiracy cupboard is bare."

HEADLINE: Sanitation Cutbacks Hit Poorer Districts Hardest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The sharp cuts in New York City's sanitation budget during the fiscal crises of 1990-91 have hit poor, minority residents far harder than wealthier ones, scarring once-orderly blocks in neighborhoods like Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and the South Bronx.
With garbage collection, sweeping and enforcement steadily scaled back, the number of the city's 59 sanitation districts rated dirty by the Mayor's Office has jumped from 1 to 12 since 1987. The dirty districts are all economically depressed areas with mostly black and Hispanic populations. 
 In West Harlem, the percentage of streets rated acceptably clean by the city dropped from 58.8 in 1987 to 39.4 this year. In the South Bronx, the percentage decreased from 59.8 to 38. The rating in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, declined from 55.3 to 46.4.
A district is considered dirty if fewer than 50 percent of its streets are rated acceptably clean during monthly surveys by inspectors who assign grades based on visual examinations.
 
Poor Areas More Vulnerable
 The drops in poor neighborhoods have occurred even as the city overall has weathered the sanitation cuts fairly well. The citywide average for all 59 sanitation districts has remained steady in recent years; about 70 to 75 percent of the city's streets are rated acceptably clean.
Sanitation Department officials maintain that they have spread service reductions evenly around the city. But they acknowledge that poor neighborhoods have suffered more because overcrowding, shoddy apartment maintenance and a surfeit of vacant lots and abandoned buildings make them more vulnerable to sanitation problems.
"There are a lot of conditions in these districts that are tough to correct," said John J. Doherty, the deputy sanitation commissioner for operations.
But community leaders in these areas scoff at those explanations, contending that the city has long devoted proportionally fewer resources to the sanitation needs of poor residents. The budget cuts, they say, have merely dealt another blow to fragile neighborhoods already reeling from decades of indifference.
 
'There Has Never Been a Will'
 "There has never been a will to keep Harlem clean," said Stephen Roberson, an organizer at Harlem Initiatives Together, a citizens' lobbying group. "You're asking me to differentiate between a time when they didn't want to keep this area clean and now, when they don't want to keep it clean even more."
The Sanitation Department received some of the most severe cuts of any city agency in 1990-91. Its budget in fiscal year 1988 was $563.8 million; the projected budget for fiscal year 1994 is $598.6 million, which actually represents a decline of about 16 percent from 1988 when inflation is factored in. The latter figure also includes money for the city's recycling program, which was not in place in the 1980's.
Perhaps the harshest service reduction was the elimination of the Clean Teams -- crews that roamed the city on foot with trash cans and brooms, picking up refuse from streets and sidewalks. In 1987, there were 1,400 such workers. Now, there are none.
"Many of our cleaners were in these poorer districts, so we were able to keep these districts out of the filthy category," Mr. Doherty said. "But when the Clean Teams left, that had a big impact."
That is readily apparent during a morning stroll around West Harlem with Peggy Shepard, co-founder of a citizens' group called West Harlem Environmental Action. At the corner of Broadway and West 152d Street, Ms. Shepard gingerly circled a gutter clogged with so many fast-food wrappings, newspapers, beer bottles and chicken bones that it looked like a roadside waste pit.
"Think about the children in this area," she said. "When they walk through a trash-strewn neighborhood every day, sooner or later they are going to wonder, 'Why is there so much trash? Maybe I'm trash, too.' "
And then, turning away as if she could no longer bear the sight of so much decay, she added defiantly: "You wouldn't see this on Columbus Avenue downtown."
 
Private Crews
 Community leaders like Ms. Shepard maintain that the service reductions are not only ravaging their streets and sidewalks, but are also giving rise to a kind of sanitation segregation.
In some prosperous neighborhoods, business improvement districts -- private groups financed by surtaxes on businesses -- are hiring their own sanitation workers to cushion the blow from the cuts. In midtown Manhattan, for example, these crews have reclaimed streets that were once considered among the city's filthiest.
But poor areas have become dirtier because residents cannot afford to turn to the private sector to keep their streets clean. They also have less political influence, so they have trouble lobbying for and obtaining scarce city services, the community leaders say.
"This is basically the message now from the city: Those who have the money and power can expect certain services," said Luis Garden Acosta, executive director of El Puente, a community development group in Williamsburg, a heavily Hispanic section of Brooklyn.
 
Widening Gap
 The city's studies point to the widening gap between rich and poor neighborhoods. The stability in citywide cleanliness levels in recent years seems to suggest that as neighborhoods like Harlem or the South Bronx have become dirtier because of service cuts, others have become cleaner.
That contrasts starkly with the ratings after the last municipal cuts in 1975, when the city almost went bankrupt. By 1980, only 53 percent of the city's streets were acceptably clean and 38 of the 59 districts were rated dirty, indicating that the effects were felt more evenly.
Mr. Doherty of the Sanitation Department emphasized that despite the cuts, the department has taken steps in recent years that have helped prevent the citywide cleanliness rating from dropping. It has stepped up cleaning of vacant lots, which are often used as illegal dumps, and removed more abandoned vehicles from streets.
The department is also coordinating its efforts with the business improvement districts, whose cleaning crews are having a striking effect on sanitation around Times Square, Grand Central Terminal and 34th Street in Manhattan and the Metro-Tech complex in Brooklyn.
 
7,500 Pounds a Day
 Around Times Square, one of the most heavily trafficked areas of the city, the percentage of streets rated acceptably clean has jumped from 28.9 in 1991 to 74.4 now, the city says. That increase largely reflects the work of the 45 or so street sweepers hired by the Times Square Business Improvement District, who pick up about 7,500 pounds of trash a day.
Executives of the business improvement districts are sensitive to charges that they are Balkanizing New York City by fostering an every-neighborhood-for-itself attitude, and they emphasize that their areas are vital to the city's economy.
"If Times Square is economically healthy, that benefits far more people than the 250,000 who work in Times Square," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District. "That benefits the entire city. There's got to be a ripple effect."
 
'It's a Little Unbearable'
 In any case, many poor neighborhoods, without the private resources of business to step into the breach, have seen their streets continue to deteriorate.
There is an abandoned brownstone at 535 West 152d Street in Harlem whose courtyard has been turned into a makeshift dump. On many mornings, Olu Rowland, 30, a nurse, passes that building when she brings her daughter, Mandisa Bryant, 4, to the Modern School, a private school a few doors down.
"I've always seen trash there," Ms. Rowland said the other morning. "It's a little unbearable. You explain to your child that there are bad people, that this is what they do. But I'm moving out. I can't take making the explanations to her anymore."

HEADLINE: With Oilfields as Battleground, Colombia Adopts New Tactics in Rebel War

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YOPAL, Colombia

 BODY:
With guerrillas waging war on Colombia's vital oil industry, the authorities are fighting back with a new strategy that relies on economic tools like setting bounty for rebels and freezing assets of extortion targets.
Much the way American businesses use cost-benefit analysis to evaluate pollution, Colombian officials now weigh counterinsurgency plans in terms of economic loss and gain. Here in the eastern foothills of the Andes, the benefit of protecting the oil industry is obvious: a newly discovered underground sea of two billion barrels of light crude. 
 "This is Latin America's only low sulfur crude -- it is going to be very attractive to U.S. Gulf coast refineries," said Nicholas P. Connolly, general commercial manager for the exploration arm of British Petroleum PLC. BP is a production partner in a consortium that includes Triton Energy Corp. of Dallas, Total S.A. of France, and Ecopetrol, Colombia's state oil company.
With oil having displaced coffee in 1991 as Colombia's largest export product, the oil sector attracted $328 million, half of the total, in foreign investment last year. Oil flowing from these rich fields 100 miles east of Bogota is expected to allow Colombia to supplant Ecuador as South America's second-largest oil exporter, after Venezuela.
 
The Cost of Bombings
 The costs of bombings by Colombia's three guerrilla armies are equally clear. In 86 dynamite attacks on Colombia's two oil-exporting pipelines in 1992, the guerrillas cost Ecopetrol $100 million in lost sales. Pipeline repairs and cleanup of 230,000 spilled barrels cost the company an additional $4 million. In December, pipeline attacks were so severe that Colombia suspended exports and had to import oil for the first time since 1985.
In this cost-benefit equation, a $30,000 reward paid last month for the capture of a National Liberation Army explosives expert nicknamed "Molotov" was a bargain.
"It is proving to make economic sense," Defense Minister Rafael Pardo said of the new bounty program, which offers up to $1.4 million for the capture of top guerrilla leaders.
Bounties for guerrilla leaders, freezing the assets of kidnapping victims' families, sanctions against banks caught handling guerrilla accounts, and cancellation of state oil and mining contracts with foreign companies caught paying protection money to guerrillas are all part of an arsenal of economic weapons adopted over the last six months to thwart rebel attacks.
 
Auditors Battle Guerrillas
 In another move, teams of Government auditors are now inspecting state and municipal finances to insure that governors and mayors do not pay protection money to local front groups for guerrillas.
The tough measures were adopted mainly in response to an attack on an oil field in southern Colombia that left 26 policemen dead last November. "We are going to attack with decision and firmness the sources of subversion's financing," Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, said at the time.
With the collapse of Cuba's economy and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Colombia's guerrillas now raise virtually all their money locally. Last year, Semana, Colombia's largest-selling weekly news magazine, calculated that the nation's 8,000 guerrillas earned $200 million a year through extortion, kidnapping, and ties to cocaine and heroin traffickers.
The nominally Marxist groups have gained such notoriety as extortionists that 56 percent of the respondents to a recent poll by Semana judged that the guerrillas were motivated by personal enrichment rather than politics.
For the first time in more than a decade, a majority of respondents -- 53 percent -- said they supported a military solution to the guerrilla threat. Only 38 percent said that peace could be obtained through negotiations with the three groups: the National Liberation Army, the Popular Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. [Peace talks between the Government and a faction that claims to represent one-third of the National Liberation Army's 2,000 guerrillas began in April.]
 
Leftists Turn Against Rebels
 "Your war lost its historic validity some time ago," read an open letter to the guerrillas signed last November by 47 leading left-wing intellectuals, including Gabriel Garcia Marquez. "The corruption that you reject has contaminated your own ranks through your business with drug traffickers."
Capitalizing on the public's supportive mood, the Government has levied a series of taxes on companies and local government revenue in recent months. Oil companies now pay 78 cents for every barrel produced. Since January, oil-producing states have been placing 20 percent of their oil revenue into a national defense fund.
The Governor of Casanare state, Oscar Leonides Wilches Carreno, complained in February during a visit here by President Gaviria that the new levy "means that we have to suspend the execution of social investment projects that are fundamental for guaranteeing the very same peace." But with billions of dollars in future oil revenue at stake, Government officials argue that a cost-benefit analysis justifies an increase of 15 percent, or $190 million, this year in its military budget.
The budget increase includes money for nine new counterinsurgency battalions, 44 military intelligence units, and the stationing of 18,000 police and soldiers around oil installations. Colombia's state agency for land reform received money to expropriate thousands of acres of ranchland around oil fields to create security zones patrolled by the military.
"Attacks on pipelines have already dropped," said Juan Maria Rendon Gutierrez, president of Ecopetrol, which has 86 contracts with foreign oil exploration companies.
 
Stepped Up Army Patrols
 Army patrols and expanded use of military intelligence have also held off an expected guerrilla infiltration of this area, Colombia's richest oil-producing region. "We always have a helicopter fueled and ready and soldiers standing by," said Col. Jaime Uscategui, chief of staff of the 16th Brigade, a new army unit stationed here in December.
In the only two fatal incidents over the last four months, a car packed with dynamite exploded prematurely in December, killing seven people here, including the guerrilla squad. In January, two guerrillas were blown up as they prepared to dynamite a pipeline.
Oil companies and their subcontractors appear to be heeding the Government's orders not to pay extortion money, which are reinforced at monthly meetings between business officials and army commanders.
"It seems that the foreign companies are not paying to be 'vaccinated,' " said Col. Miguel Angel Meza Lara of the police, using local slang for guerrilla protection demands. In one exception, an American seismic company apparently paid a ransom to win the release last December of a kidnapped employee.
To win support from residents of oil-producing areas, a consortium of state and private interests called the Oil Pipeline Foundation has lined up the financing for social projects in 112 towns and villages along Colombia's pipelines.
 
'Wanted' Posters on TV
 For most Colombians, the most visible aspect of the Government's economic war on the guerrillas are televised "Wanted" posters that flash nightly before news programs. By paying for information, a practice still considered a novelty here, the Government has captured the second in command of the People's Liberation Army, the fourth-ranking leader of the National Liberation Army, and several commanders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces since December.
The National Liberation Army began a revenge bombing campaign against urban targets last December, including luxury hotels in Bogota and traffic control towers in provincial airports.
Accustomed to maintaining economic growth during 30 years of guerrilla warfare, many Colombians believe that attacks on oil installations can be limited to such a manageable level that security will come to be viewed simply as another cost of production.
"Repairing the pipeline now takes about 36 hours," said Mr. Rendon of Ecopetrol. "It's become routine."

HEADLINE: Many in Litchfield Want to Keep the Little Jail on the Common

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITCHFIELD, Conn., April 17

 BODY:
Benjamin Rodriguez shakes his head in frustration when he thinks about the Governor's proposal to close the jail he has called home for six months.
It's not just that the window across from his cell looks out on one of the prettiest town greens in New England, or even that he is allowed to have a day job outside the jail. Mr. Rodriguez, who began his four-year sentence on a drug-related crime at the state prison in Enfield and has 14 months remaining to serve, says the Litchfield jail simply gives him hope. 
 "To come from a place like Enfield to a place like this is like turning off an endless highway onto a side street and finding someplace where you belong," he said. "There are a lot of guys who would do so well in a place like this. The place should stay open for them."
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s 1994 budget calls for closing six small Corrections Department sites by next year. If adopted, the jail here, the state's oldest and smallest, would be among the first to shut down. The others are in Brooklyn, New Haven, Windsor Locks and Hartford, where two would be closed. The Legislature is to vote on the proposal in June.
The decision to close the correctional sites was based on economics, said a Corrections Department spokesman, Bill Flowers. The six are to be replaced by three new ones, which are ready to open, he said. Just one of the new centers can absorb the inmates and operations now spread among the six to be closed.
While mothballing the smaller, antiquated centers makes economic sense, opponents of the Litchfield closing -- including many residents who volunteer at the jail -- say they hope it is blocked.
That's a far cry from the mood less than a year ago when most people would have been glad to see it close forever.
 
Clearly Antiquated
 Until last year, the jail, which enjoys a quirky notoriety for sharing a wall with the Farmer's Savings Bank, was almost as primitive as it was when it was built in 1812. Cots hung from chains. The old gallows yard had filled with debris over the years, but it still looked much as it had when public hangings were commonplace.
Until the mid-1980's, inmates used to squeeze through a broken screen in a third-floor window, jump to the ground and run across the street to the liquor store. Hiding the stash in their shirts, they would rescale the jail's brick wall, using the warden's office window frame as a foothold. The inmates' booze-buying days came to an end, however, when a prisoner's foot slipped one day and smashed the warden's window.
Then, last summer, two inmates, one charged with the murder of his grandfather, escaped and went on a crime spree for more than a week before being recaptured. Angry residents called for an immediate shutdown of the jail.
The Corrections Department, however, had another idea. Within a matter of weeks, the jail went from a maximum security site with 150 inmates to a minimum security drug- and alcohol-treatment center with room for only 28 "clients." An airier cellblock with plumbing was opened. Qualified prisoners could work in the community and be granted weekend furloughs. Today, the jail houses 22 inmates whose crimes were primarily drug and alcohol related, though nonviolent. To qualify, they must be within two years of finishing their sentences, and they must attend a substance-abuse program at least three times a day, seven days a week.
 
A New Approach
 Robie Irizarry, a former parole officer who is now the counselor-supervisor in Litchfield, is credited by inmates and many in the community with turning the jail into a place where hope and self-confidence can be restored.
Mr. Irizarry ordered the open-cell policy and the removal of heavy iron doors between rooms. He set up an informal lounge with soft-drink and candy machines and a phone.
"One of our goals is to give back to the community as much as we can," Mr. Irizarry said. Inmates volunteer their services to the town, including to the Litchfield Performing Arts Center. They recently spent a day cleaning the banks of the Naugatuck River, and soon will be helping to build a community playground.
Supporters of the jail say it offers inmates a chance at rehabilitation they would never find in a larger prison. In the long run, they maintain, successful rehabilitation will reduce the number of repeat offenders. Mr. Irizarry says the recidivism rate is hard to measure because the program is so young, but already, three former inmates are working in the community.
Those who favor the closing, however, argue that the Corrections Department does not have the expertise to operate a drug- and alcohol-treatment program. Even many of the local volunteers who want to see the jail stay open say they would prefer it to be run by a group specializing in substance-abuse treatment.
For now, the correctional center is operating as if it will go on for another 181 years. And if it is closed, "We're thinking of turning it into a halfway house-restaurant," said Mr. Flowers. "The warden already has a name: Litchfield Bars and Grills."

HEADLINE: Hospitals Plan Strategies To Counter Competition

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
New York City's hospitals are scrambling to prepare for a new era of competition -- not even defined yet, but almost surely on its way.
New York Hospital has taken control of nearly a dozen other hospitals, clinics and nursing homes, so it will eventually have beds available in every borough. About a dozen other major hospitals are spending $5 million to create their own health maintenance organization. 
 The municipal Health and Hospitals Corporation has begun sending employees to two-day training sessions where they are taught to be nice to patients, for fear that public hospitals will not be able to compete once everyone has health insurance.
The level of activity being created by the Clinton Administration's efforts to overhaul health care is particularly acute in New York, administrators and experts say, because the history and structure of the New York health care system mean the city and state are ill-prepared for the looming changes.
 
Worries About Change
 "I've never seen the hospital community more anxious, worried or frustrated," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents the city's private hospitals and nursing homes. "The thinking is extremely hyperactive all over town. They're all trying to figure out how to best position themselves for an enormous amount of change in a short period of time."
In the past, New York State in general, and the New York City area in particular, have been extremely resistant to the concept known as managed care, under which patients receive all their health care from groups like health maintenance organizations.
According to the most recent figures from the Group Health Association of America, a trade association for H.M.O.'s, 11 percent of people in the New York City metropolitan were enrolled in the plans in 1989, compared with 46 percent in San Francisco, 32 percent in Los Angeles, 28 percent in Boston and 16 percent in Chicago.
Much of the reason, Mr. Raske said, is that state regulation of hospital rates in New York is among the strictest in the country, meaning that there is little room for H.M.O.'s to negotiate lower rates with hospitals. At the same time, hospital occupancy rates in New York are higher than anyplace else in the country, meaning there is little incentive for hospitals to give lower rates.
 
Alliances Across Geography
 Competition and negotiation, however, are expected to be the mainstays of the Clinton plan. If the advance word from Washington is correct, large collectives in need of care will search out large providers of care and settle on the cost. Should that change come to pass, health experts and hospital administrators say, New York is not ready.
"If it were to happen tomorrow, it would overwhelm us," said Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. "If you're in California or Minnesota, or areas where managed care has been developed extensively, then this is simply the next step in a progression that has been going on for the past five years. But for New York the transformation will be more dramatic."
Hospitals are taking different approaches in positioning themselves for the transformation. Perhaps the most ambitious plan, and the one that has been the longest in the making, is that of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan.
Four years ago, anticipating a changing marketplace, the hospital's trustees decided to form the New York Hospital Care Network, under which New York Hospital will effectively take over smaller institutions.
Eventually, administrators hope, the large consumer collectives expected under the Clinton plan will find such regional diversity appealing. "If you work in the city and live in the other boroughs we can be there for you," said Dr. David B. Skinner, president of New York Hospital.
 
The Search for Economies
 So far, the network includes: the Amsterdam Nursing Home, Gracie Square Hospital, New York Downtown Hospital, the Stanley Isaacs Healthcare Center for Senior Citizens and the Rogosin Institute, all in Manhattan; Community Hospital and the Methodist Hospital, in Brooklyn; and Booth Memorial Medical Center, Booth Silvercrest Extended Care Facility, The Healthcare Center of Western Queens and the Rogosin Institute Dialysis Center, all in Queens.
New York Hospital paid to acquire only one of these institutions, Booth Memorial, said Dr. Skinner, who declined to give the purchase amount. In every other case, he said, New York Hospital gained control by contracting the right to select the institution's board.
"The boards of the several institutions have done their own strategic planning," Dr. Skinner said. "They looked to the future and they saw they could not survive on their own. They need to be part of a network."
Dr. Tracey E. Strevey, president of Booth Memorial, the most recent addition to the network, said the only way that his hospital could weather the Clinton plan was to ally itself with a larger organization that could help it reduce costs. "Hospitals that are not prepared to maximize their economies of scale and cannot be competitive will not survive," he said. "There's only one place all these billions in spending cuts can come from, and that's from reduced revenues to those providing services."
The network, he said, plans to use a single billing and bookkeeping system and a central laundry center and warehouse.
 
Hospitals Form H.M.O.'s
 Mount Sinai Medical Center is attempting to form a similar network. Last year Mount Sinai affiliated with the Queens Hospital Center and, several months later, with the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. Earlier this year, Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester County was added to the list.
"We want to position ourselves," said John W. Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Mount Sinai Hospital.
Not every hospital can expand with the force of New York Hospital or Mount Sinai, and many say they do not want to.
"Our strategy has not been to acquire additional facilities simply for the sake of growth," said Dr. Robert E. Newman, president of Beth Israel Medical Center, which consists of hospitals in two locations, a private practice building in Manhattan and a nursing home in Westchester. "Our strategy has been to focus on quality in the facilities we already have."
Beth Israel is one of about a dozen hospitals that have spent the past year creating a H.M.O., called HealthFirst, under the auspices of the Greater New York Hospital Association. The $5 million start-up costs are being paid by the hospitals, Mr. Raske said, although the list of participants is growing and is not yet official.
 
Patients to Get Choice
 The program could be in operation by June, Mr. Raske said. It is intended to provide care to Medicaid patients under the state's new plan to improve health care for the poor, and its founders hope to enroll 180,000 Medicaid patients within its first year. When in need of hospitalization, those patients would be sent to the hospitals that created the plan.
The Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's 11 municipal hospitals, is also forming an H.M.O. Currently a pilot project at Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan, the Metropolitan Health Plan will be expanded to include all the municipal hospitals, said Dr. Billy E. Jones, the corporation's president.
The Clinton plan would lift some of the burden from public hospitals by providing insurance for people whose care is currently underwritten by the hospitals. But with insurance, patients will feel freer to go to any hospital they choose. Public hospitals, where the level of care and the physical plants are often not competitive with private hospitals, could be at a disadvantage.
Last month the municipal corporation attempted to address that problem, with the first of a series of intensive staff training seminars. Eventually everyone who works in the public hospitals -- from doctors to custodians -- will attend.
"In public facilities there is the notion that you can treat people any kind of way," Dr. Jones said. Under the Clinton plan, he predicts, "that won't be the case."
"Everybody can vote with their feet as to where they want to go," he said. "We have to get ready for that. I think everyone has to get ready for that. We have a lot of getting ready to do."

HEADLINE: SERVICE JOBS FALL AS BUSINESS GAINS

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Scores of New York City employers -- from New York Telephone and Arthur Andersen to Merrill Lynch and Grey Advertising -- are making quantum leaps in learning how to produce ever more work with ever fewer people, according to economic data and a large amount of anecdotal evidence.
Ultimately, this remarkable innovation could help rejuvenate New York's ailing economy, by increasing its competitiveness in the intensifying battle for global markets. 
 But in terms of producing jobs today for New Yorkers, it is a disaster. Indeed, the city's jobs performance at this point in the national recovery is the worst of any comparable period since records began to be kept in 1950.
 
Recession Over, but Not Plunge
 From March 1991, when the national recession officially ended, through last February, the number of jobs nationally grew by eight tenths of one percent -- hardly a stellar performance. But jobs in New York City plunged by 145,900, or 4.3 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since April 1989, New York has lost more than 350,000 jobs, nearly 1 in 10.
The steady growth in the output per worker -- productivity gains, in economists' terms -- helps explain why government and private economists expect virtually no job growth in the city this year even though its economy has been expanding since last June.
"You're probably talking the end of the decade before we put all the jobs back lost during the recession," said James P. Brown, an analyst at the New York State Labor Department.
What is happening here reflects something happening throughout the country. Companies that provide services -- from banks and insurers to accounting and law firms to phone companies, airlines, retailers and hotels -- are finally following the lead of manufacturers in making great strides in getting work done with fewer employees, mainly because of advances in technology.
These gains, however important, are inflicting anxiety, pain and, in many cases, a plunging standard of living on hundreds of thousands of people, from clerks to middle managers and professionals. They are out of work or bounce from one temporary or part-time job to another in a professional limbo that pays no benefits like health insurance and pensions.
Consider Elizabeth E. Brager, a talented professional who seems to be making a go of freelance work.
At the moment, Ms. Brager, 40, has her hands full with assignments from three major investment firms. A specialist in creating promotional materials for selling financial services products, she has been freelancing for 14 months, since losing her job as a vice president at Citibank when it eliminated her department.
At this moment, she is receiving two to three times her Citibank salary, she said, radiating confidence and pride as she talked about how her clients really depend on her expertise. But only a month ago, she was in an emotional valley -- between jobs and anxiously waiting for some response to her dozens of calls and letters in search of work.
"It's a juggling act -- working and lining up future jobs at the same time," she said. "It's an emotional roller coaster. But right now, I love the ride."
 
Better Paying, but Fewer
 Skilled professionals like Ms. Brager may be the lucky ones.
The city's economy appears to be creating fewer, though better-paying, full-time jobs. From 1987 through 1991, clerical jobs in the city plummeted by 80,000 or 12 percent. That is an ominous development for a city with more than one million people receiving public assistance.
"What we may be moving towards here is a tale of two cities: growth in higher-paying jobs and a shrinking in lower-paying jobs," said City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. A failure to create lower-skilled jobs "will create turmoil -- more social dislocation, more crime, more poverty," she warned.
At Grey Advertising, the "reconfiguring" of the work force, as Edward H. Meyer, the company's chairman put it, is a case in point.
While the advertising industry has slumped, Grey Advertising has prospered. But Grey's New York employment has remained flat for two years at nearly 2,000, and lower-level jobs are vanishing.
 
Computerized Advertising
 In Grey's media-buying operation, for example, the number of clerical workers, trainees and junior professionals have fallen to 154 from 178 since 1989. By contrast, Grey's cadre of senior professionals and executives has doubled to 115.
The main reason is computerization. A dearth of software had long prevented ad agencies from exploiting the plunging cost of computing power. But that problem is now being overcome since the advent of personal-computer networks and the proliferation of easy-to-use software that can be customized.
Stagnant throughout the 1980's, productivity in private, or nongovernment, services in the United States grew 2.75 percent in the last year, estimates Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
"That's a significant turnaround," he said. "And the productivity story is here to stay."
That matters a lot for New York, where services account for 9 of 10 jobs, versus 8 of 10 nationally. "Regions like New York, which clearly do have a disproportionate share of their activity tied up in the services sector, will be increasingly hard pressed on the job front in the years ahead," Mr. Roach said.
 
New York Industries Hit
 The productivity revolution is in full swing in industries that fueled the 1980's boom in New York City: financial, business and professional services like banking, insurance, accounting, advertising, consulting and law.
From March 1991 through last February, jobs in financial, business and professional support services shrank by 49,200. Moreover, virtually everyone expects employment in these areas to grow much more slowly relative to their profits and sales over the next decade than it has historically.
"It's difficult to envision a scenario of job growth for New York City without a strong job recovery in these key sectors," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It's like trying to do Hamlet without the prince."
In many cases, services companies are simply doing much better at tapping the labor-saving potential of computers -- ever cheaper and easier to use -- high-speed telecommunications lines, and voice-mail systems that render secretaries obsolete.
 
People Less Necessary
 Doing the tax returns for a client who worked in, say, five states, accountants at Arthur Andersen & Company used to enter the information into the computer six times: once for each state and once for the Federal return. Thanks to software perfected two years ago, the numbers are now entered once. The computer then produces all six returns and the supporting documents required.
At the New York Telephone Company, "expert" computer systems are increasingly making people unnecessary. Executives at its parent company, the Nynex Corporation, say some programs can spot problems on phone lines, diagnose the causes and then dispatch repair crews.
In the mid-80's, when a corporate customer had a problem with a circuit that carried large amounts of data between its computers, seven New York Telephone employees were required to take the call, test the circuit, make a diagnosis and send out a repair order.
Now some customers can contact New York Telephone's electronic doctors themselves. Sometimes even that is unnecessary because of a new system that continuously monitors special circuits.
 
No More Form Fillers
 "People who know how to look up things in a book and fill out forms are not going to be the people we are going to hire," said Edmond J. Thomas, vice president of Nynex's science and technology division.
But computers are not the only reason for the rise in productivity in services. Many companies are finally getting serious about identifying and getting rid of superfluous jobs.
Traditionally, companies laid off people in tough times and rehired them once business improved. A new approach dubbed "process re-engineering" aims to avoid such surges. It examines whether each function -- purchasing or customer billing or public relations -- is necessary or "adding value" and whether it is being done most effectively.
Gone are all the lower-level people in customer accounts at Grey Advertising, the people who generated reams of reports, detailing product sales and ad expenditures by clients and their competitors. It turned out clients did not want this work.
 
Time and Motion Studies
 Andersen conducted time and motion studies of hundreds of audits. "We were able to wring out anywhere between 10 and 25 percent of the hours in a typical audit," said Louis P. Salvatore, head of audit, tax and business-advisory services in the firm's metropolitan New York operation.
Nynex was able to cut by more than half the 100-plus steps once involved in designing and installing high-capacity circuits that corporate customers use to transmit computer data or to connect their phone systems directly to long-distance carriers. It can now provide the service within a day versus the 30-day average before.
Companies are also asking whether a task can be done by hiring another company or freelancers in the huge talent pool produced by the recession and the re-engineering binge. Because freelancers are not employees of the company, it is usually not responsible for paying fringe benefits and can let them go at will.
 
Adapt or Move On
 "It is not as necessary to add people to the payroll as business improves because of all the freelance art directors, copywriters and the like out there," said Mr. Meyer, Grey's chairman. "When a freelancer we highly regard says, 'I have a job offer from Young & Rubicam,' that's the day I have to sit down and say, 'Wait a minute.' "
With this attitude the rule, freelancers like Sarah Anne Peckham, a producer of television commercials, know they must adapt or move on.
"I love television production," said Ms. Peckham, who is 54. "Now I'm going to find out if I'm temperamentally suited to the freelance life style." She has had two jobs and worked a total of five weeks since January, when she was dismissed by Young & Rubicam, where she had been a senior producer for 12 years. She is now working freelance at Chapman Direct Advertising, a Young & Rubicam subsidiary.

HEADLINE: What Small Business Really Wants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The small-business men and women I know would give up all the "little apple seeds" of tax incentives the Administration is promising in exchange for the elimination of two of the rotten apples in his plan -- the tax increase on individuals and the energy tax. ("Clinton Plan -- Small Businesses Smile," March 28.) 
 President Clinton's quest to raise taxes on the so-called "wealthy" actually falls flat on the backs of small businesses and family farms. He is asking small businesses that are organized as Subchapter S corporations, sole-proprietorships and partnerships to pay higher marginal tax rates than I.B.M. or General Motors. Small businesses also are the least likely to be able to absorb the additional costs of the energy tax.
And yet, the President still is expecting small businesses to continue creating the majority of the new jobs in our country!

HEADLINE: Moving Ahead on Head Start

 BODY:
President Clinton wants to increase funding for Head Start by $1.3 billion, a whopping 46 percent increase. It's a big vote of confidence for a program that's weathered a lot of criticism recently. But, Mr. Clinton has made the right decision. Continued careful expansion of Head Start, addressing its problems along the way, is desirable.
Probably the best known and most successful of the Great Society efforts, Head Start is a comprehensive early childhood development program that aims to give low-income children educational and social skills needed to succeed in school. Beyond that, the program gives its 3- to 5-year-old participants health and nutrition services and offers a range of social services to their families. It also places heavy emphasis on parent involvement. 
 How well does it work? Several studies indicate that the immediate intellectual gains made by Head Start children fade after a few years and that the program fails to permanently raise scores on intelligence tests. But the program never claimed to have these everlasting effects.
Other studies have shown that by the end of the program Head Start participants are further along in terms of mental, social and emotional development and self-esteem than non-participants. And the provision of social services strengthens the family's ability to help the child.
There is evidence outside Head Start that an enriched preschool experience can have lasting effects. In the most famous study, children in the Perry Preschool Project in Ypsilanti, Mich., are still,two decades later, more likely to have finished high school, held a job, and avoided teen-age pregnancy and trouble with the law than children from similar backgrounds who did not participate.
The key issue is the quality of the program. Dr. Edward Zigler, one of Head Start's original planners, estimates that 50 percent of the Head Start programs are "excellent," 25 percent are "marginal" and 25 percent are "poor." Internal reports from the Department of Health and Human Services, which has responsibility for Head Start, found that many of the programs were not properly managed and others failed to provide needed health services, like immunizations. The reports also suggested that expanding the program to serve 100 percent of eligible children, instead of 35 percent, could be thwarted by a lack of qualified teachers and adequate buildings.
Some of Head Start's problems stem from efforts by the Reagan Administration to spread resources too thinly; enrollments increased, but staff training and oversight suffered severe cutbacks.
Now the Clinton Administration aims to do better. The economic stimulus package includes $500 million for a summer extension of Head Start. An additional $874 million is being requested for the program next year. And Mr. Clinton wants to come as close as possible to enrolling all eligible 3- to 5-year-olds in the next five years. Beyond adding dollars, the Clinton Administration has promised to address some of the concerns about quality, although specific proposals are still being developed.
Clearly, Head Start is not a panacea for the years a disadvantaged child spends in poor health and housing, with little or no intellectual stimulation and only the prospect of advancing to poor public schools. But, with careful monitoring and adequate safeguards, it can give poor children a boost to success in school and community.

What You See

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
I remember visiting an apartment in Brooklyn several years ago that had almost no furniture except for two televisions. There were two of them because one was broken but was used as a stand for the working one. The TV provided background music to fractious family life and copacetic child care, little eyes glassy in the reflected glare.
But it also brought the world into a place where most people were afraid to go out after nightfall. Or at least the slice of the world that television shows, which had about as much to do with the life of this family as an Amy Fisher mini-series has to do with "Masterpiece Theater." The image of the two televisions stayed with me, a symbol of how powerful TV is in the lives of so many families just like that one. 
 "They show all the happy white people on TV," Tara Dalley said the other day, hanging with her friends outside Washington Irving High School, and when I considered her words I thought about that power all over again. "Black people are shown as bad people, the reason for a bad situation."
As we digest the verdicts in the second Rodney King case, as we talk about the negative effects of seeing images of police preparing for rioting as though it were as inevitable as rainfall, as we see once again the videotape in which Rodney King is beaten by the white police officers, it's worth talking to a few of the kids about what television shows them.
Not about what it has shown them about the treatment of one black man. But about what they think it has been telling them for years about where they fit into the world, a message that has surely laid the groundwork for anger.
They grow up, so many of our children, with TV the single most potent force of myth and image in their lives. And if they are struggling and black they see, almost close enough to touch, a world of well-dressed white people with perfect homes and families. For some of them, the only things that seem true to life are the shoot-'em-ups on cop shows.
They don't know how much better it is than it used to be, how short a time ago there were virtually no people of color on the tube at all. But even when they see black people in television programs, the situations often have an air of unreality. "On 'Cosby,' " said a 16-year-old named Jasmine Roscoe, "excuse me, but where they finding families like that, where the father is a doctor and the mother is a lawyer?"
It's interesting that the show random groups of kids mentioned positively most often was "Roseanne," the sitcom about a family living close to the economic bone, tussling and cussing, led by a strong, smart-mouthed woman. It's a class thing, not just a black thing.
Their complaints about television news range from being ignored to being reviled. A white person is shot, they say, and it leads the newscast; a black person is shot and it is ignored. "Maybe they don't think it's important," said Jasmine. "Another dead black body, just pick em up. It's usual."
"Black people are shut out," said Tara, as the girls around her nodded.
Yesterday, if they were watching our regularly scheduled verdict, they saw people who looked like them all over the television news, black citizens triumphant, feeling they'd seen some measure of justice when two of four police officers were found guilty of violating Rodney King's civil rights.
But that's not what they see most of the time. For most of their young lives this box in their living rooms, the thing around which so often all the other furniture is arranged, has told them, they say, either that they are insignificant or that they are bad. I know television doesn't seem to reflect any of our lives, but it has a whole lot more to do with a comfortable white existence than a struggling black one.
Seeds of anger in the black community are sown in many ways, from the contempt of law enforcement to the grinding poverty of many neighborhoods to a case like that of Rodney King. But maybe for some of our kids the anger grows just hanging around the house, watching a soap opera. "Everybody rich, everybody always wearing fancy clothes," said Yesenia Evans outside the high school. The world comes into your home every day, and it's a world that much of the time seems to exclude or revile you. Life's a party, almost close enough to touch, and you're not invited.

Pretending About Bosnia

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
After some legitimate dallying and weighing of options, the Clinton Administration has adopted the European approach to Bosnia: Let nature take its course toward a Serb victory over the Muslims -- while pretending to do otherwise. Today, watching Srebrenica fall; tomorrow, Sarajevo.
This policy is very "realistic." It avoids all the political and military risks of getting trapped in a place hardly anyone cares about, especially when nations must tend to their own domestic woes. It is also devastatingly cynical. And for that reason alone, President Clinton should reconsider it. 
 Cynicism feeds on itself and spreads like a cancer. In time, little matters. Not Boris Yeltsin, not a tiny country like Haiti, not Kosovo, not injustice abroad, not injustice at home. Cynicism also corrodes democratic leadership, since it's hard to debate what's not acknowledged.
No Clinton Administration official openly admits to such a cynical policy, although some have come close in private. Perhaps they can't admit what they're really doing, even to themselves. But their policy has been quite clear for weeks.
In the current phase: Go along with Europe's funneling only minimal relief supplies to dying Muslims, pretend to be trying hard to reach a "peace" settlement, stay clear of direct military intervention and assume the Serbs will effectively win the war in the next three to six months.
After the Serbs triumph: Don't formally recognize or in any way legitimize the victory, maintain economic sanctions against Serbia and try to stop the Serbs from using force against Kosovo and Macedonia.
Since the outbreak of the war, the Serbs have allowed only the bare minimum of U.N.-provided food, fuel and medicine to reach Muslims; often less. Worse, last week U.N. relief workers howled that their warehouses were near empty, with little new Western aid in sight. Why let this happen, when it will only weaken the Muslims and lead them to surrender?
The U.S. and its European cohorts say they favor a Vance-Owen-type peace, dividing Bosnia into ethnic enclaves. But they've ruled out using force, or even the threat of force, to make the Serbs accept it. So the Serbs openly laugh at their timidity. Mr. Clinton's only comeback is to say he's "keeping all options open." The Serbs laugh at that, too. Why give the Serbs this kind of free ride, when they can only take it as a wink?
Western leaders now speak of tightening the economic embargo against Serbia as a way of getting Bosnian Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen plan. But why weren't these tougher measures imposed long ago? Was it simply because Moscow threatened to veto the effort? Are the Russians any likelier to go along now? And why such emphasis on economic sanctions when Western leaders know well that sanctions have never worked? Why, if not mainly for show?
Still, world leaders continue to protest their devotion to the Vance-Owen "plan" or "process" and their willingness to put it into action. Yet not one of them has firmly pledged a single peacekeeper to keep the peace.
NATO experts estimate upward of 100,000 peacekeepers, including 40,000 Americans, will be required to do the job. Where will they come from, and who will put up the $5 billion to $10 billion annually to keep them in the field? Why the total failure to commit this money and manpower? Why, indeed, unless Western leaders are simply playing a very cynical game?
In what passes for candor among Western officials, some will privately say that Bosnia is just too far gone, that they will make their stand against Serbia in Kosovo and Macedonia. But it's hard to imagine that Belgrade will move against Macedonia, or that Westerners will protect Kosovo since they all recognize it as a province of Serbia. In any event, why should the Serbs fear Western military power in these places when the West did nothing to stop genocide in Bosnia?
And now what was suspected is confirmed. Regular Serb forces are part of this war. Isn't this enough for the West to end its charade?
At some level, everyone understands these games. "Realist" pundits even praise Mr. Clinton for his pretense; anything to them seems better than the risks of military involvement. But the cynicism will eat away at the Clinton Presidency and at U.S. foreign policy. Bosnian Muslims will pay with their lives, and Americans with their faith.

Senate Childishness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Our Government should not be run by filibuster. As a responsible Republican who cares more for country than for party, I deplore the power games being played by the Republicans in the Senate (news article, April 13). Their stall and obfuscation tactics lead to the conclusion that, like spoiled children, if they can't set the rules they won't play the game. 
 Bill Clinton won the election. He deserves the chance to put his jobs programs in place. For 12 years my party did nothing, and now we have more unemployed people than ever in recent history. And the Republicans are acting to insure that nothing continues to be done. Such an attitude is shameful in the face of our country's urgent needs. The Republican Senators should start being responsible legislators.

HEADLINE: Republicans Hold Clinton Accountable

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Dances of the Cranes" (editorial, April 7), you castigate Senate Republicans for stymieing President Clinton's $16.3 billion economic stimulus plan. According to your analysis, the Republicans are thwarting the will of the voters by preventing the Democratic President and Democratic Congress from enacting the program they were elected to enact. Such reasoning is seriously flawed since 43 percent of the voters who supported candidate Clinton never endorsed a program that would tax the middle class and increase Government spending by $202 billion from 1993 to 1997. 
 During the Presidential campaign, candidate Clinton's economic plan promised a middle-class tax cut and an increase in the marginal tax rate to 36 percent for families earning more than $200,000 a year. During the last Presidential debate Mr. Clinton promised he would not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs and that spending programs would be scaled back before such a tax increase would be contemplated.
President Bush charged that Mr. Clinton could finance his campaign promises only by raising taxes on every family earning more than $36,000. Candidate Clinton responded: "It is a disgrace to the American people that the President of the United States would make a claim that is so baseless, that is so without foundation, so shameless, in an attempt to get votes under false pretenses."
When President Clinton announced his economic plan, he shamelessly raised taxes on families earning more than $30,000, violating his campaign promises, as Mr. Bush charged.
Fortunately, the Senate Republicans are holding President Clinton accountable for his violated campaign promises by preventing enactment of a wasteful Government spending program that we simply cannot afford. Instead of excoriating Republicans for such actions, perhaps you would consider analyzing why President Clinton should be allowed to enact a spending program that he misrepresented to the voters.
William Jefferson Clinton might better heed the words of Thomas Jefferson: "A wise and frugal government . . . shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits . . . and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Fans Out to Condemn Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MERRIMACK, N.H., April 17

 BODY:
Taking a page from the Clinton and Perot playbooks, Congressional Republicans held town meetings today in 13 states to condemn the President's budget plan, especially his package to stimulate the economy, as a collection of special favors for constituents.
In this heavily Republican New Hampshire town, 90 people gathered at the American Legion hall to hear their Representative, Bill Zeliff, and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas speak against the President's plans and vent their own frustrations about rising local unemployment, health-care costs and welfare. 
 And in New Jersey, about 40 people turned out to hear Representative Dick Zimmer, Republican of Middlesex County, N.J., attack the President's jobs bill as more deficit spending.
 
Appealing to Perot Backers
 The Clinton package, now reduced to $15.5 billion, is stalled by a Republican filibuster in the Senate, and Republicans hoped the publicity they would attract from today's events might help them challenge larger parts of the President's program as well. The Republicans said they also wanted the meetings to mark the beginning of their effort to win back middle-class voters who abandoned President George Bush to vote for Ross Perot last November.
"There's no question there are a lot of Perot people out there looking for a vehicle by which they can express their feelings," Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, said on Friday. "We want to get back to the grass roots."
President Clinton insists his stimulus proposals are popular because they include financing for summer jobs, AIDS research, highway construction and money to rehire police officers laid off by local governments. In an effort to rescue the package, which initially cost $19.5 billion, he offered on Friday to cut $4 billion from it, but that gesture has been rebuffed by Republican Senate leaders so far.
In the meeting here, Mr. Gramm pushed the Republican argument that Mr. Clinton's stimulus package was nothing more than a pork-barrel payoff to Democratic constituencies. Giving examples of what he said were the kinds of programs the President's plan would support, he said, "How do you stimulate the economy by building an ice-skating rink warming hut in Connecticut or an Alpine slide in Puerto Rico so the people in Puerto Rico can pretend they're in Switzerland?"
 
Quips and Punch Lines
 Mr. Gramm, who has an eye on the 1996 Presidential race, and Mr. Zeliff worked the audience in tandem like two performers exchanging quips and punch lines.
When Mr. Gramm said, "The problem is the money doesn't come from heaven, it comes from the pockets of working Americans," Mr. Zeliff slid next to the Texas Senator and displayed the plastic cover of his checkbook. "Are you telling me," Mr. Zeliff asked with a mock smile, "we can't write a check with an empty check book?"
For the most part, the two lawmakers were preaching to a choir of conservatives who have no fondness for more spending and borrowing. When Mr. Zeliff asked for a show of hands of those who favored the stimulus package, only six went up.
"When you talk about swimming pools and bike paths, I want to remind the people here that we built a beautiful playground," Shelly Uscinski, a 35-year-old housewife, told the lawmakers in a question-and-answer period. "If other communities want such things, they can go out and do that themselves."
Claira P. Monier, executive director of the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, spoke up to say that the Community Development Block Grant portion of the Clinton plan would be wasted by poor planning in bureaus like hers because the money needed to be spent before Dec. 31. "We have needs in New Hampshire, but we need time to develop good projects," she added.
 
Why the Meetings?
 Three weeks ago, House Republican leaders came up with the idea of the town meetings in opposition to the stimulus package, but only 24 out of the 175 Republicans in the House agreed to participate. "If we had more time, it could have been more broadly based," Mr. Michel said.
In addition to New Hampshire and New Jersey, town meetings were also held today in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming.
In East Brunswick, N.J., Representative Zimmer said he sponsored the town meeting today "to try to explain to the American public that there is another way to eliminate the deficit and that's the old-fashioned way that every family and business understands."
He added, "If your revenues aren't sufficient to meet your expenses, then cut your expenses."
In Joplin, Mo., Representative Mel Hancock criticized President Clinton's budget plan and bill to stimulate the economy, saying they would add to the budget deficit.
"The people in this room understand you can't spend yourself wealthy," Mr. Hancock said.
When the Missouri Republican asked for a show of hands to see how many in the audience of about 250 were willing to pay more taxes, only two people raised their hands.
One was Bennett Wilson of Carthage, Mo. He said that while he was not excited about paying more taxes, it was a necessary evil to begin reducing the Federal debt.
 
Where Was the Party?
 "I'd like to know where the Republican Party was the last 12 years when they had control of the dialogue in the country and they didn't deal with the budget deficit," said Mr. Wilson, a Democrat who voted for Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Gramm used the occasion here in New Hampshire to increase his visibility in the nation's first Presidential primary state. At the event in Merrimack, he arrived early and left late, then spent time giving interviews to local reporters, dutifully posing for pictures with children. He even wore a red, white and blue tie that Mrs. Zeliff gave him last October when he attended a fund-raising event she put on for him.
Peyton Hinkle, a 55-year-old commercial real estate appraiser and volunteer in Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand America, got up to challenge Mr. Gramm's support for the free trade agreement with Mexico.
Mr. Gramm was careful to point out that he was working closely with Mr. Perot to enact a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget, but explained his disagreement with Mr. Perot on trade in no uncertain terms. "We can't hide under a rock," the Texas Republican said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a Republican town meeting in New Hampshire misstated the purpose of a political fund-raising event last October. It raised money for Representative Bill Zeliff of New Hampshire, not Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.

HEADLINE: As Building Slows, So Does Demolition

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
WHATEVER goes up must come down, the old saw goes. But the saw-maker wasn't thinking of buildings, and certainly not those that have gone up so recently that they have never even been occupied.
It has fallen to Big Apple Wrecking and Construction Corporation, a 14-year-old Bronx contractor, to take down the top 12 floors of the never-occupied but largely completed 32-story residential building at 108 East 96th Street, condemned as in violation of the height restrictions in New York City's zoning code. Big Apple believes it is making demolition history by taking down so large a piece of newly built space that is both structurally sound and economically viable. It is happening at a time when demolition for its more accustomed purpose -- site clearance in preparation for something new -- is at a low ebb. The lack of work underscores the low state of expectations for new private commercial or residential construction. 
 "What we're doing has never been done before," said a wind-blown Peter Kowalevich, the 67-year-old site foreman at the $1 million job, as he stood amid a scene of incipient wreckage on the building's roof last month. "I enjoy this because it's a challenge, but it's ridiculous."
It is not ridiculous, of course, to East Siders upset by what many consider a blatant and perhaps purposeful code violation. "If the law cannot be enforced when people are fairly active and have a following, what can happen in other parts of the city?" asked Genie Rice, president of Civitas, the Upper East Side community organization that brought the violation to the attention of city officials and opposed possible remedies less drastic that demolition.
But to the demolition people it's work, and they will take it. The Buildings Department, accustomed to monitoring construction of 65 to 75 major buildings simultaneously in the 80's, is now monitoring only one of more than 15 stories -- 1992 Broadway, Millennium Partners' 47-story mixed-use condominium at Broadway and Columbus Avenue between 67th and 68th Streets.
Filings for new-building construction permits last year covered only 13 million square feet of buildings. About a quarter of the space is in public-sector projects. The number of applications filed was 3,000, down from 3,900 in 1991; 4,500 in 1990, and 5,700 in 1989.
Most of the current major demolition work is at airports, hospitals and utility-company facilities. There is little work in progress for private builders. Even the public and institutional work is reduced from the level of the 80's, contractors say. But it is almost all that is left with the collapse of new residential and commercial construction.
In Harlem, Crossbay Contracting Corporation of Brooklyn is taking down the San Juan theater on Broadway at 165th Street and part of the Audubon Ballroom, in preparation for the construction of a Columbia University research building. At the same time, the facade on Broadway is being restored and preserved, as is the portion of the ballroom where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965.
In Corona, Queens, the School Construction Authority reports, the old and vacated P.S. 92 will be demolished in May by the West Coast Construction Corporation of Queens to create a park in front of the new P.S. 92 behind it, at 34th Avenue and 99th Street.
A FEW miles away, Big Apple has laid low three contiguous buildings on the property of Jamaica Hospital, at Van Wyck Expressway and 89th Avenue, to make room for a five-story ambulatory surgery and mental-health facility. In Manhattan, it is demolishing the old Hospital for Joint Diseases at Madison Avenue and 123d Street, following the completion of the new North General Hospital last year.
Big Apple is also busy at La Guardia Airport. The customer is Morse Diesel International, construction manager for USAir. Drivers on Grand Central Parkway whose glance falls on a Continental sign on a hangar next to the USAir Terminal may be surprised to learn that there is no longer a structure behind the facade, which will also come down. Continental bowed out of a venture involving the hangar, and now USAir wants to provide more maneuvering space for planes as it adds boarding capacity to its adjacent terminal.
Stephen Chasin, co-owner of Big Apple, which has done 5,000 demolitions in the last 14 years, said he had never encountered a demolition of newly built usable space like the one the company is doing on 96th Street. "I don't think that anywhere in the world they would make an owner do something like this," he said.
Many demolitions are of small scale, often involving unusable or unsafe old buildings in locations where no new construction is planned. The bigger jobs are handled by perhaps half a dozen contractors in the city. In a good year the total business might generate $40 million in work, the contractors say. Now, they say, the total is perhaps a third to a half of that.
One of the larger jobs in prospect this year is a demolition planned by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for a 10-story, 1,000-cell detention center. It will occupy a portion of a three-acre site at Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, between Second and Third Avenues and 29th and 30th Streets. The construction would be the final stage of a project that will start with the renovation of 200,000 square feet of old warehouse space at the eastern end of the property.
The western portion is to be demolished by Blanford Land Clearing Corporation of Brooklyn using the implosion method. Dynamite demolitions are unusual in New York, but Federal and state demolitions are not subject to New York City rules.
"We haven't permitted explosives or swinging balls in at least 25 years," said Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for the Buildings Department. Much demolition work is still handwork in New York City, with strong men wielding hammers, crowbars and chipping tools.
But the big jobs, about 5 percent of the total number of demolitions, use mechanical means, with the permission of the borough building superintendents. The machines of choice include the Brokk 250 from Sweden, whose mean-looking steel claw is operated by remote control from a cab on a wheeled platform. It drills and chips and hammers and pulls the debris to the deck, from which a laborer dumps it into a chute.
Also useful is a Melroe Bobcat 743, a small front-end loader that removes material once it has been smashed to bits by the Brokk 250. Sometimes a huge Caterpillar front-end loader sits on the ground and loads debris passed down a chute into bins on the ground, to be carted away by truck.
All this equipment is on view at the 96th Street demolition, where VJB Construction Corporation of Manhattan, construction manager for the Parkview Associates, the owner, is overseeing the demolition. The reinforced steel columns are to be burned away with acetylene torches, said Vincent J. Bagnoli Jr., president of VJB Construction.
FROM the 20th floor to the top the building has been wrapped for safety with steel screening, wired to outside scaffolding sitting on steel beams. "Nothing bigger than a pea can get out," said Richard Morano, VJB's construction supervisor.
The Buildings Department has an inspector, a member of the Building Enforcement Safety Team, on duty all day. The contractor has a professional engineer on hand to be sure the demolition won't affect the integrity of the structure below the demolition area.
The task began in February and is expected to take four or five months. Already the main roof is out and the walls betwen the 31st floor and the roof are mostly out.
In densely populated areas, demolition work never creates friends among people living in the vicinity. Besides safety, the problems are noise and dust. ("You can never control dust enough," said Mr. D'Agostino of Crossbay Contracting.)
The cost of demolition for new construction has been greatly increased in recent years when there has been a need to first remove asbestos from the building coming down. With no asbestos involved, a typical major demolition costs between 25 cents and $1 a cubic foot in a standard building. The old Jamaica Hospital buildings, for example, cost about 50 cents a cubic foot to demolish.
However, when there is a question of removing asbestros from the building, the cost can double. For example, at the site of the old North General Hospital there was over $1.5 million in asbestos removal to be done before the $2.5 million demolition could begin.
At the former Gimbels building on 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, gutted in the 80's for a new mixed-use condominium, the razing cost about $10 million, of which $5 million was for asbestos removal, a highly regulated procedure, said Mr. Chasin of Big Apple. The gutting of a Gimbels on 33d Street for another mixed-use building, including a new A & S store, cost more than $20 million, but asbestos removal was only $1.5 million. The difference was a result of the type of asbestos to be removed. On 86th Street, beams, columns and ceilings had been sprayed with asbestos. On 33d Street, only the pipes and boiler plant had been covered with asbestos.
The regulatory process is complex and the penalties for disobeying it potentially extremely severe. Officials have not forgotten the 1985 demolition of several buildings on West 44th Street done for the Macklowe Organization without a permit before utilities had been turned off. A lawsuit brought by the city was settled when Macklowe agreed to pay $2 million to assist single-room-occupancy housing.
Contractors need to supply original documentation that utilities have been cut off. They also have to pay the fines due on building violations on old properties, long ignored by earlier owners. That sometimes raises costs as much as $100,000, Mr. Chasin said. And they must get an asbestos-free certification from the Department of Environmental Protection.
"THE activity is slow now," Mr. Chasin said. "Until you see demolition pick up, you won't see construction pick up."
As for the 96th Street project, Laurence T. Ginsberg, principal in Parkview Associates and also in the Algin Management Company of Forest Hills, Queens, a family-owned investment owner-builder, described himself as "resigned" to these losses and eager to put the whole situation behind him. Mr. Ginsberg and his father, Albert, bought the land for the 96th Street project from Mount Sinai Hospital in the late 70's. Algin Management owns and manages about 35 properties in Manhattan and Queens, with about 3,500 apartments.
The demolition is the first stage of new construction on the site that zoning does permit. The shortened building plus new construction on what was to have been a plaza beside it will provide 112 apartments (more than the 97 of the original tower) in structures 19 stories high. The footprint for the new building will be in the plaza that was to have been created on the eastern side of the original tower. The architect remains Peter Claman, of Schuman Lichtenstein & Claman, whom Mr. Ginsberg says he considers blameless in the costly error in design.
"The experience has been enormously frustrating," Mr. Ginsberg said. "Now we want to put it behind us."

HEADLINE: Many Gay and Lesbian Groups Want Big March to Back Clinton

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

 BODY:
Just a week away from a huge gay march on Washington, leaders of gay and lesbian organizations are rallying behind President Clinton, trying to prevent the demonstration from becoming a protest against him. But some other homosexuals and AIDS organizers, disappointed in the President, are threatening anti-Clinton outbursts at the march next Sunday.
"Clinton talks a good game," said Adam Mailor, a 24-year-old Seattle teacher. "But what's he doing? We need to put the heat on him." Mr. Mailor plans to carry a sign that asks: "Bill, Where's the Beef?" 
 Asked if the march should be a protest against the President, David B. Mixner, a longtime gay friend of Mr. Clinton, said: "We have spent all our lives hidden and quiet. If people feel concern and anger, they should express it."
 
'Experience of a Lifetime'
 On Friday, after an hourlong meeting with the President in the Oval Office, leaders of gay and lesbian organizations were starry-eyed. "It was the experience of a lifetime," said Billy Hileman, a co-chairman of the march.
Tim McFeeley, the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, summarized the meeting this way: "It's not just what the President said, but how he said it. It's a feeling you got by looking into his eyes."
Participants described the President as committing himself to signing an executive order to end the ban on homosexuals in the military, an issue that they said he was confident of winning. They said he urged the leaders to get out the stories of discrimination in the military against real people.
"On the military issue," Mr. McFeeley said, "he talked in terms of 'we' and 'our.' "
The leaders of the gay and lesbian organizations said Mr. Clinton embraced their struggle as a civil rights one. When it was suggested that some White House staff members seemed uncomfortable addressing homosexuality, the President countered by pointing to three gay and lesbian White House staff members who were present: Bob Hattoy, Keith Boykin and Alexis Herman. Mr. Hattoy spoke of how movingly symbolic it was that he, as a gay man with AIDS, was serving in the White House.
The issue of AIDS was raised by Mr. Clinton, not the gay organizations' leaders, who said it had not been on their agenda because it had been discussed at another White House meeting earlier in the day. That meeting was not attended by the President.
Mr. Clinton, those who met with him said, committed himself to naming a director of the Government's fight against AIDS in about a week and to preserving AIDS allocations in his package to stimulate the economy. He also renewed his support for legislation that would allow the spending of the full amount previously authorized for AIDS programs but never spent.
"He didn't waver at all in his commitment on our issues," William Waybourn, the executive director of the Victory Fund, which gives money to gay candidates, said of the meeting's overall tone.
But looking from outside the glow of the Oval Office, some homosexuals argued that the organizations' leaders had been used. With gay and lesbian Americans about to march on the capital in numbers they say could reach one million, their political leverage is considerable, the dissenters point out. Yet, they say, the leaders of the gay organizations came out of the meeting with no more than they had going in.
Mr. Clinton turned down their request that he appear in person at the march, saying that he had several commitments, including a Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown, Va., on April 24, and a speech the next day to the newspaper publishers in Boston.
 
Meetings' Results Assailed
 "We fell for his pitch hook, line and sinker," said the playwright Larry Kramer, a critic of Federal efforts to combat AIDS, who was not at the meeting. "It's an indication of how desperate we are. The man has welshed on all his AIDS promises, every one, and the caliber of the names coming up for AIDS czar are all fourth-rate."
A leading advocate of homosexual rights who was not at the meeting, Urvashi Vaid, disagreed with the dissenters. "I understand the frustration of people like Larry who have been dealing with H.I.V. every day for 10 years," she said. "And Clinton has not shown extraordinary leadership on AIDS. But the meeting was historic, the first of its kind in the Oval Office, an important nod of recognition from the President of the United States at a crucial time in our movement."
Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the campaign to allow homosexuals in the military, who was at the meeting, said, "I had a sense that we were being welcomed into the family that had scorned us for so long."
Leaders of the gay organizations said Mr. Clinton recalled a college friend's telling him that his Administration would be remembered for two things -- overhauling the health-care system and gay rights. They said Mr. Clinton smiled as he recalled telling the friend, "You're probably right."
The White House meeting came as gay and lesbian Americans throughout the country were preparing for the march. For months, march posters and notices have dotted gay enclaves from Manhattan to Seattle.
In New York City, bars and clubs and restaurants are organizing their own buses. Organizers are hoping for 300,000 from the metropolitan area.
Many are making a fancy day of it. For $37, Florent Morellet, who owns the Manhattan restaurant Florent, is offering round trip on a bus, breakfast and a lunch bag, as well as cocktails in the parking lot of the Pentagon. He has filled 10 buses.
The enthusiasm is not just on the East and West Coasts. In Omaha, for example, leaders of gay and lesbian groups say the 200 airline seats they booked are all taken. They estimate 100 more people have either booked seats separately or are making the trip by automobile.
"One hundred more is a conservative figure," said Amy Meek, a 26-year-old lesbian. "People are getting together in vans or however they can make it. The word is out: 'Get to Washington.' "
By comparison, in 1987, Omaha sent only 57 people to a similar march, which drew about a half-million people. The enthusiasm for this march is greater because of the battle to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military and their opponents' depiction of homosexuals as sexual predators.
In addition, throughout the country, there is a fervor among gay and lesbian Americans that their time has come, that they need to show Congress and the President their numbers.
Most of them laugh at a recent survey that found only 1 percent of men identifying themselves as homosexual.
"I like Clinton," said Alan Wolk, a San Francisco painter. "But I'm wary of him. I think we need to say, 'Hey, Bill, look at us. We won't let you forget us.' "

CORRECTION-DATE: April 18, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about plans for a gay march on Washington next Sunday described a White House meeting last Friday between President Clinton and leaders of gay and lesbian groups. The article said the President pointed "to three gay and lesbian White House staff members" at the meeting, and it gave three names.
The description of Mr. Clinton's action was not attributed in the article, and was based on a misunderstanding of a report by someone at the meeting. Two of the three named staff members had publicly discussed their sexuality. But the third, Alexis Herman, had not, and she said yesterday that she was not homosexual.
The Times erred in failing to ask Ms. Herman about the report, and in naming her in this list.

HEADLINE: Struggle in the Balkans;
U.N., With Abstention by Russia, Tightens Its Sanctions on Belgrade

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 17

 BODY:
After a day of tense negotiations, the United Nations Security Council brushed aside a new cease-fire agreement in the battered Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica and voted late tonight to impose Draconian new sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro.
 Russia had fought hard to delay the vote until after the April 25 referendum on President Boris N. Yeltsin and his economic reforms because his nationalist opponents sympathize with the Serbs. But after hours of brinkmanship, Russia finally accepted defeat and abstained instead of using its Security Council veto to block the new sanctions. China also abstained. 

 
Total Isolation'
 But all 13 other Security Council members voted in favor of the punishing new sanctions, which France's representative, Jean Bernard Merimee, described as "the total economic and financial isolation of Serbia."
 The tightening of the noose around Yugoslavia indicated that the anger of many of the world's nations was not lessened when Bosnian Serbian commanders agreed in Sarajevo to call a cease-fire in Srebrenica and permit limited United Nations evacuations. The cease-fire, in effect, was a victory for the Bosnian Serbs in their drive to occupy Muslim-held lands. [Page 16.]
 The final vote was a victory for France and five of the Council's developing nations -- Venezuela, Cape Verde, Morocco, Djibouti and Pakistan -- which insisted on bringing the new resolution to a vote. They were convinced that Russia was bluffing when it repeatedly threatened to veto the measure or warned that it would only encourage the Serbian forces to massacre the tens of thousands of Muslims in and around Srebrenica.
 But to win Russia's abstention, France and its five allies agreed that the new sanctions would not take effect for nine days, or just after the Russian referendum.
 
Patience Exhausted
 Diplomats said all Council members except Russia wanted to vote on the new sanctions now, despite today's cease-fire in Srebrenica, because they had lost patience with the Serbs and their relentless "ethnic cleansing," which has continued unabated despite numerous cease-fires and repeated claims that the Serbs really want peace.
 The Council thus ignored a new letter from the Bosnian Serbian leader, Radovan Karadzic, in which he promised to cooperate fully with the United Nations in carrying out the resolution that the Security Council passed on Friday night declaring Srebrenica a "safe area."
 It also ignored a suggestion by Under Secretary General Chinmaya Gharekan that a vote be postponed for 72 hours to see whether the new cease-fire in Srebrenica would hold.
 Instead Council members argued that the Serbs had lost all credibility by refusing to sign an overall peace agreement the Croats and Muslims accepted last month and by their continuing brutal campaign of "ethnic cleansing." Compared with this record, they argued, the Srebrenica cease-fire was irrelevant.
 
An Incomplete Accord
 Many also criticized several provisions of the agreement hammered out at the Sarajevo airport. Mr. Merimee, of France, pointed out that Serb forces are not required to pull back from around Srebrenica, as the Security Council ordered Friday, and can continue to occupy surrounding villages.
 Diplomats also complained that the Sarajevo agreement provided for the United Nations to "demilitarize" Srebrenica, which appears to mean that it will help disarm the town's Muslim defenders without disarming the aggressors who surround them. Only "seriously wounded" and "seriously ill" people are to be evacuated, in United Nations helicopters, suggesting that the Serbs will retain control over the less badly injured.
 The new sanctions are intended to isolate Yugoslavia in the hope that the suffering this will inflict on its people will force Belgrade to compel its Bosnian Serbian allies to make peace.
 The new measures are intended to end violations of current sanctions by banning even the transshipment of goods through Yugoslavia to other countries and tightening controls on barges moving along its stretch of the Danube. They ban all ships from entering Yugoslavia's territorial waters. And they require countries to impound any Yugoslav trucks, ships, aircraft or rolling stock within their jurisdiction.
 They also freeze all foreign Yugoslav financial assets, a move that is expected to put the overseas branches of Yugoslav banks and companies out of business, and penalize private foreign companies in which Yugoslavia's leaders are believed to have hidden assets.
 
Surprised by an Accord
 The debate on sanctions began earlier today in an atmosphere of farce and confusion as journalists in Bosnia began reporting on the new cease-fire agreement, which United Nations officials in New York said they knew nothing about.
 One embarrassed official said he admitted that his commander on the spot, Lieut. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren of Sweden, had inexplicably failed to report the cease-fire to headquarters before his spokeswomen had briefed the press in Sarajevo.
 The agreement clearly met some of the demands the Security Council sought on Friday, including a cease-fire, helicopter evacuation of the sick and wounded, the opening of land corridors so relief supplies can enter the town, and the deployment of a Canadian peacekeeping force to monitor conditions in Srebrenica.
 
A Serb Is Adamant
 But Dr. Karadzic said his forces would continue to occupy the villages surrounding Srebrenica, even if they promised not to enter the town. And the plan to disarm Muslim troops in Srebrenica leaves the town's inhabitants at the mercy of the Serbs.
 Earlier in Paris, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had demanded that the Security Council action cut Yugoslavia off from the rest of the world "at the earliest possible moment," adding that "the fall of Srebrenica can come from one moment to the next. It is truly a turning point in this drama."

The United Nations Security Council voted last night to tighten sanctions against the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro. These are the main points covered by the resolution:
 FINANCIAL ASSETS Freezes funds overseas held by the Yugoslav authorities, including funds derived from property, commerical, industrial or public utilities. ADRIATIC TRAFFIC Allows NATO to guard a 12-mile martime exclusion zone barring all ships from entering the territorial waters of Yugoslavia except in emergencies and with special permission of the Council's sanctions committee. CONVEYANCES Empowers countries to impound all Yugoslav vessels, trucks, rolling stock and aircraft found abroad, which can be forfeited if found violating sanctions. If ships, trains, trucks, aircraft from other countries are suspected of violating sanctions, they must be detained. If they are guilty, they must be impounded and can be forfeited.
 PEACE PLAN Calls on Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace plan devised by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, and for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to present detailed military plans on its implementation. OVERLAND TRAFFIC Prohibits goods shipped to or through Yugoslavia except for relief supplies, which have to be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Council's sanctions committee. Freight transport can pass only at a limited number of road and rail crossings approved by the Council. Supplies going to the United Nations and other relief agencies in Bosnia and Croatia need agreement from those countries. DANUBE TRAFFIC Bars Yugoslav traffic on the Danube outside of its own borders. Other vessels passing through Serbia must carry a monitor and get approval from the council. OTHER SERVICES Prohibits all services, financial and others to anyone in Yugoslavia except for telecommunications, postal and legal. Services necessary for humanitarian aid or "other exceptional purposes" have to be approved by the Council.

HEADLINE: At the Coachman Hotel De Facto Permanence

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IT takes imagination to see a playground's swings and slides where there is nothing but a parking lot strewn with broken glass and garbage or to hear the sounds of hammers and saws in the familiar spring symphony of renovation, instead of the frustrated shouts of tired mothers trying to shepherd their children back to their rooms.
Under a plan first proposed last year by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, those are the sights and sounds that the homeless families living in the Coachman Hotel might have expected by now. 
 But when Mr. O'Rourke's proposal to lease the hotel from its owners, Universal Hotels, for $8.9 million, and bring in Westhab, a nonprofit housing agency that provides counseling and other services to homeless families, was put on hold by the New York State Division of the Budget, the families who remain in the Coachman, a temporary shelter that for many has become de facto permanent housing, ended up in a limbo of red tape.
When it had initially appeared that the Coachman was going to be renovated and that Westhab would be providing all the necessary services, the Urban League's Project Move, which had provided on-site case management and support services to the Coachman's residents, decided to pull out. With Project Move gone, the financial support that had come from International Business Machines and the United Way also disappeared. With the loss of those services, many social work experts said, an already difficult situation for the Coachman's families became worse.
Since August, Westhab, although it has not been able to provide the full services outlined in Mr. O'Rourke's proposal, has been offering educational support services. Moreover, a spokesman for the County Department of Social Services said that there is a caseworker at the Coachman daily.
 
'An Unmanaged Situation'
 "It is common knowledge that most people would rather not be at the Coachman," said a social worker who agreed to be interviewed only on condition of anonymity. "It has been a bad situation for a long time. Unless it is going to be turned over to a real facility with a real delivery of services, it is just a joke."
Added Eloise Kates Julius, a family therapist from White Plains who volunteers at the Coachman's Learning Center, an after-school tutoring program: "You have unmanaged people in an unmanaged situation, and it is a rough environment. The sorrowful part is that initially the Coachman was considered one of the safer havens for the homeless, and now it has become a travesty. There had been a hopefulness that people would receive case-management support and get the skills to cope with the world. We have seen it get worse."
White Plains residents who were frustrated by local and state government inaction on the Coachman recently formed an ad hoc coalition called Citizens Concerned About the Coachman, which held a protest rally in front of the hotel on March 18. The coalition -- which has representatives from the Westchester Coalition of Food Pantries and Soup Kitchens, Grace Episcopal Church and the Jewish Community Center, all in White Plains, as well as some local business owners -- wants to close the hotel or compel government agencies to renovate it.
"When everyone was feeling optimistic about the Coachman, everyone pulled out," said Stanley Schear, director of a nonprofit agency, the Bridge Fund, which offers temporary loans to people so they won't be evicted. "The county is paying $115 a day for each family to the Coachman's owners to house people there. That's a rent roll of $4 million a year, but we are wasting lives and money."
 
Problems in the Area
 Edward Majonis, owner of Esy's Cafe and a former social worker, added, "Without social services or a supportive system for the people who live there, you are just breeding problems for society."
Merchants in the retail area surrounding the Coachman have reported seeing youngsters 5 and 7 years old on the streets at 11 P.M., and in front of their stores they have found used crack vials, which they said come from hotel residents. Several have complained about break-ins or shoplifting by teen-agers from the Coachman. Still others are concerned about the 319 police calls involving the Coachman last year and 422 fire department calls.
"Our fire inspectors are in there every day," said White Plains Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio. "That building is not wired for hot plates, and yet the young mothers need to heat up baby food. God forbid we have a fire in there."
Julian Di Donato, owner of Dakota Dry Goods and president of the White Plains Merchants' Association, said: "A lot of stores are moving away from that area. There are lots of vacancies down there, and the stores that come in are lower-caliber stores. It has definitely hurt Upper Post Road."
In response, Charles Goldberger, a lawyer for Universal Hotels, said: "There are certainly some problems there, but there's not a lot the hotel can do without running afoul of the residents' civil rights. We cooperate with the police and we cooperate with the county. They're the ones charged with the conduct of those in the hotel."
 
'An Ominous Quality'
 A major concern for those who volunteer at the Coachman, either as tutors in the Learning Center or as meal providers, is the decline in the building's physical condition as well as the pervasive harassment that affects them and the residents. "It gets enough cleaning to not be in violation," said Dorothy Fox, a volunteer tutor at the Learning Center and former director of the program. "But there is an ominous quality when you come in. This is not a happy atmosphere. A 5-year-old child came in one day and said, 'This is a dump." Walls are drab and have holes in them. Carpets are frayed, and the lighting is harsh.
"A lot of families were moved out during the last week," Ms. Fox added, "and we are at a point of deciding whether to recruit more volunteers."
As of last Tuesday there were 52 homeless families at the Coachman. At times, however, there can be as many as 120 families. A spokesman at the County Executive's office said that some families had recently been placed in permanent housing while others had left for full-service shelters.
Harley Lewis, director of the Westchester Coalition of Food Pantries and Soup Kitchens, observed: "After the march, there was hell to be paid for the residents. They were in absolute fear of being dispossessed. The children were scared and asked the volunteers where they would go if they couldn't live there anymore. And the volunteers were told they couldn't park in the parking lot anymore." Residents refused to be interviewed for fear of repercussions.
 
Effects on the Children
 Margarita Rivera, director of the Daily Bread program, which provides breakfast at the Coachman on weekdays and an early dinner on three weekdays, is worried about the effects of the deteriorating environment on the children. "The children are exposed to drugs, drinking and fighting," Ms. Rivera said. "They see people selling drugs to their mothers just outside the building. I've seen young kids walking around with knives, and that really scared me."
While the Coachman remains in transition, possibilities are bleak for the youngsters who live there. "It's a situation where obviously the children are caught in the middle," said Daniel Owens, program associate with the Plan for Social Excellence in Mount Kisco, a private foundation that finances and reports on innovative educational programs and recently published a report called "Slipping Through the Cracks," which looked at the educational needs of homeless children in the county.
"There is no safety net for these kids," Mr. Owens added. "One person could not serve the needs of hundreds of people or know how many students are falling through the cracks."
Without sufficient services, said Evan Jeske, director of community relations and development at Grace Church Community Center, "there's a problem of unsupervised youngsters." Ms. Jeske added: "Before, people could go somewhere. When there was a service coordinator, there was a person in charge on the premises."
Derrick Byrd, coordinator of children's services at Westhab, who works at the Coachman, said: "I have a caseworker who delivers educational case management. We're responsible for making sure that the youngsters are tracked through a school district and that parents know about their options. Our priority is seeing that the youngsters get to school."
As part of their services, Westhab informs parents at the hotel about the services provided by the Learning Center as well as those offered by the Head Start program at St. Bernard's Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Byrd also works with a Girl Scout troop, the Hudson Valley Writing Center and Greenburgh's Open Door program, a drug-prevention and -treatment program, representatives of which come once a week to work with youngsters. Mr. Byrd conceded: "It's not anywhere near where we would like to see it. There is no after-school recreational program."
Many observers are still skeptical about progress at the Coachman. "I think the Coachman is an abomination," said Mayor Del Vecchio. "I don't believe we're doing these homeless people any favor by keeping them there -- warehousing them with a minimum of services."
The Mayor continued: "There have been some valiant efforts by volunteer groups, who do the best they can, but the solution won't be taken care of by volunteers. The solution needs government intervention and government money. I'm not convinced anything is going to happen."

HEADLINE: A Reader's Guide to the Balkans

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a contributing editor of The Atlantic, is the author of "Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History."

 BODY:
HISTORY, like hate, is the product of memory, and memory is composed of unforgettable detail -- sights, smells, sounds, exalted emotions, grim statistics and cruel ironies. A memory is not subject to condensation. Made to fit inside the narrow strictures of a television sound bite or a newspaper column, it loses all meaning. It becomes just another lifeless fact that can never convey how people have come to think and behave as they do.
The Balkans are a region of pure memory: a Bosch-like tapestry of interlocking ethnic rivalries where medieval and modern history thread into each other. More complicated and less visually exotic than the Middle East, the Balkans are unsuited to the reductions of the television camera. (A recent ABC News special, "Land of the Demons," showed footage from Bosnia, but even with rock music playing in the background the effect was flat.) Whereas the Middle East is a game of checkers -- Arabs versus Israelis, with a modern history that began only in 1918 -- the Balkans are three-dimensional chess. 
 So in a sense the ascendancy of the Balkans as a news story in the 1990's means a victory for print over television. Yet it is not only the television correspondents who can't do much with the Balkans. Neither can the newspaper pundits, since the region is not an extension of America's own ethnic and racial obsessions, the way the Middle East and South Africa are. The Balkans are truly foreign. They require pure intellectual curiosity, nuance, not op-ed polemics. There is no getting around it. To understand the Balkans, you have to read books.
The key word for understanding the Balkans is process: the process of history and the process of memory, processes that Communism kept on hold for 45 years, thereby creating a kind of multiplier effect for violence. Balkan violence is not a phenomenon of "modern hate," like that in Algeria and the West Bank, fed by rising economic expectations and demographic stress. Southeastern Europe is a caldron of history -- of unresolved border disputes and nationality questions created by the collapse of the multinational Hapsburg and Ottoman empires.
By "process," I mean the fact that in the Balkans each individual sensation and memory affects the grand movement of clashing peoples. For today's events are nothing but the sum total of everything that has gone before. Process is something that is more emotional, physical even, than rational. It often has no direction: the asides and footnotes can be more meaningful than the main story line. You have to feel. You have to be able to imagine all the details of the past. That is why the best books about the Balkans are old and frequently eccentric -- granting access to a psychological universe that no television camera will ever penetrate.
Here is my own Balkan reading list, consisting mainly of books that, although written long ago, explain the essentials of today's violence:
Dame Rebecca West's "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon," first published in 1941, is the perfect literary metaphor for the Balkans. Dame Rebecca takes nearly 1,200 pages of small print to describe Yugoslavia. Her book is filled with the most subtle of tangents, which go on for thousands of words. By concentrating on the minutiae of memory, she illuminates how people who basically look the same, speak the same language and have virtually indistinguishable names can hate one another with primitive ferocity.
Because Dame Rebecca experienced Yugoslavia in the late 1930's, during the buildup to fascism in Croatia, she is more critical of the Croats than of the Serbs. This serves a useful purpose for the modern reader, however: it shows that the present civil war is merely the second half of one that began in the midst of World War II, only to be interrupted by 45 years of Communist rule. The Croats were responsible for much of the brutality in the first half; the Serbs are guilty now.
Dame Rebecca's clairvoyance is demonstrated by Slovenia's absence from her travelogue. As the current war shows, Slovenia has always been a sideshow to the Yugoslav drama, owing to its lack of ethnic Serb and Croat minorities and its position in the extreme northwest of the federation. Wisely, Dame Rebecca concentrated on Bosnia, and she pointed to Macedonia as the pre-eminent Balkan problem, since it is the region where territorial and linguistic disputes dissolve into an anarchy of formlessness.
Like all good books about the Balkans, "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon" is politically incorrect, because it recognizes national character as historical destiny. Culturally, the Balkans may be the world's most intractable area. People are born equal there, but what happens to them afterwards -- the lies they are fed, the truths they are fed, the way they drink and the way they worship -- makes them profoundly different from one another by adulthood. For example, Roman Catholic Slovenia has experienced decades of Communism, even as Eastern Orthodox Greece has been a member of the Western alliance. Yet Slovenia's economic future appears to be brighter than Greece's. This is geography, character and history speaking, not policy.
Because the national character in question today is mainly that of the Serbs, I recommend several books, each profoundly incorrect, that take you inside the minds of some of the world's best haters.
"The Mountain Wreath," by Petar Petrovich Njegos, first published in 1847, is the great epic poem of the Serbian language. Njegos, the Bishop of Montenegro, was an unreconstructed Serb nationalist who justified the 17th-century mass murder of Albanian converts to Islam as part of a larger struggle against the Muslim Turks. The reader can experience a hundred pages of fiery verse like this:
 
 Our struggle won't come to an end until
 we or the Turks are exterminated. . . .
 we . . . set their houses ablaze.
 Out of their mosque and of a small building
 we made a pile of accursed rubble there. . . .
"The War in Eastern Europe," by John Reed, with drawings by Boardman Robinson, is the author's 1916 account of his Balkan travels during World War I. Beneath a sketch of a Serb soldier at the book's beginning, a caption reads, "Half-savage giants dressed in the ancient panoply of that curious Slavic people whose main business is war." When Reed asked a Serb soldier if he was afraid of foreign intervention, the soldier replied: "Let them all come! Serbia can whip the world!"
Reed, best known today for "Ten Days That Shook the World," his account of the Bolshevik Revolution, reflected in "The War in Eastern Europe": "I thought with wonder of these Serbians, their origin and their destiny. They alone of all the Balkan peoples have been one unmixed race. . . . They held their narrow passes against the Tartars of Bulgaria, the Dacians of Rumania, the Huns and Tcheks of the North. . . . When Europe imposed foreign dynasties on Bulgaria, Romania and Greece, Serbia was ruled by her own house. With such a stock, with such a history, with the imperialistic impulse growing daily, hourly, in the hearts of her peasant soldiers, into what tremendous conflicts will Serbia's ambition lead her!"
ANOTHER book that conveys just how little this far-off corner of Europe has changed is C. L. Sulzberger's "Long Row of Candles: Memoirs and Diaries (1934-1954)." In 1939, Mr. Sulzberger, who was later to become a foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times, met a Slavic Macedonian who was forced to Bulgarize his name after the Bulgarians invaded his homeland, and then to Serbicize his name after the Serbs invaded. This caused the fellow to say: "No wonder the rest of the world calls stew a macedoine. . . . When will we smash our fetters and gather round our capital in Solun?" Solun is the city of Salonika -- in Greece. It is such irredentist attitudes over the decades that fuel the seemingly irrational attempt by Greece to prevent the recognition of Macedonia as an independent state.
The mother lode of Serbian culture and national aspirations is its Orthodox monasteries in "old Serbia," a region where the medieval Serbian kingdom was born and grew to greatness in the 13th and 14th centuries, but which is now inhabited by Albanian Moslems and is known as Kosovo. In "The Saga of Kosovo" (1984), Alex N. Dragnich and Slavko Todorovich chronicled the history of this region in delicious and convoluted depth. They did it from an ardently pro-Serbian standpoint, allowing the reader to see how even well-educated ethnic Serbs can sneer at Muslim Albanians and, by implication, the Muslims in Bosnia.
According to Mr. Dragnich and Mr. Todorovich, Serbia is a modern nation that has grown organically from a well-developed medieval civilization, while Albania is "culturally not ready" for nationhood, owing to its "total involvement in the passing Turkish civilization." Notice how both Njegos in the 1840's and Mr. Dragnich and Mr. Todorovich in the 1980's see Balkan Muslims as the historical appendage of the hated Ottoman sultanate that ruled in Serbia from the late 14th century through the 19th century.
For an Albanian view, turn to "The Albanians: Europe's Forgotten Survivors" (1977), by Anton Logoreci. While the Serbs see their defeat by the Turks in Kosovo in 1389 as the end of Christian enlightenment and the beginning of Muslim barbarism in the Balkans, Mr. Logoreci sees the medieval Serbian army as a feudal rabble that was defeated by "the more disciplined and better trained" Turkish troops. His theme is that the Albanians have always been victims of aggressive neighbors, especially the Greeks and the Serbs, forcing his people to turn to Hapsburg monarchs and Ottoman sultans for help.
In their age-old battles with the Albanians, the Muslims and the Croats, the Serbs have drawn psychological sustenance from Russia, their big, Slavic Orthodox neighbor to the north. In the first section of Milovan Djilas's "Conversations With Stalin" (1962), appropriately called "Raptures," the former Yugoslav Vice President under Tito described his first visit to Russia, in 1944, as being like "returning to a primeval homeland, unknown but mine." Mr. Djilas wondered: "Was this not the homeland of our ancestors, whom some unknown avalanche had deposited in the windswept Balkans?" As he writes about how the "limitless gray steppes" of Russia released "unknown inner urges," Mr. Djilas suggests the irrational but real impulses that have brought the Serbs and the Russians together through the centuries.
Blood ties and hatred can be tricky. On a recent television talk show, a Croatian American and a Bosnian Muslim both attacked me for failing to note that in Sarajevo, at least, Muslims, Croats, Serbs and Jews had usually got along. I recommend that they and others read "The Damned Yard: And Other Stories" by Ivo Andric. A Bosnian Croat, Andric won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961, mainly for his novel "The Bridge on the Drina." In one of his stories, "A Letter From 1920," first published 73 years ago, Andric explained:
"Yes, Bosnia is a country of hatred. That is Bosnia. And by a strange contrast . . . there are a few countries with such firm belief . . . so much tenderness and loving passion . . . or with such a thirst for justice. But in secret depths underneath all this hide burning hatreds, entire hurricanes of tethered and compressed hatreds. . . . Thus you are condemned to live on deep layers of explosive, which are lit from time to time by the very sparks of your loves and your fiery and violent emotion."
Andric said that the people of the region denied this hatred, and consequently hated outsiders who mentioned it to them. The often invisible border between hate and love, and unity and disunity, is further explored in Andric's novel "The Days of the Consuls" (1945), about the small Bosnian town of Travnik in the early 19th century, and the political atmosphere found there by the French and Austrian consuls.
Sorting out all these passions in a clinically objective fashion is what Misha Glenny, a BBC correspondent, has done in "The Fall of Yugoslavia: The Third Balkan War" (1992). He describes how an awful history is now made worse by morally corrupt and incompetent regimes in Serbia and Croatia that are the legacy of Titoism. In addition to "Conversations With Stalin," Milovan Djilas has written a number of books exposing Tito, who imprisoned Mr. Djilas for the crime of advocating glasnost three decades before Mikhail S. Gorbachev did. Particularly readable is Mr. Djilas's "Rise and Fall" (1985), about the author's own tragic career in the Yugoslav Communist Party and how it mirrored the fall of Titoism, the rotten system in which economic war between the regionally based ethnic groups substituted for a shooting war -- until 1991, that is.
THE Yugoslav conflict impinges on neighboring Balkan countries, which in this decade will face dangerous historical reckonings following the collapse of Communism and the false division of Europe. Since national character will write the script in these places, too, look again to history -- and therefore to good books -- as a guide. The best survey of the historical personalities of the region's peoples, in my opinion, was originally published in 1915. "The Balkans: A History," by Nevill Forbes, Arnold J. Toynbee, D. Mitrany and D. G. Hogarth, is particularly good on Yugoslavia. Forbes explained that the Serbs and the Croats were one people, divided by religion and history, not by race and language -- whatever Croats and Serbs today may tell you. The book was written before the collapse of Ottoman Turkey, and its advantage is its emphasis on earlier history in the development of ethnic identity.
Greeks may be the best known and least understood of the Balkan peoples. They are a nation whose political personality flows from two millenniums of Byzantine rule and Ottoman despotism, rather than from Periclean Athens five centuries before Christ -- or, for that matter, from the superficial and contentious period of American tutelage following World War II. The finest book I know about the Greek political character is the British journalist David Holden's "Greece Without Columns: The Making of the Modern Greeks." Holden painstakingly stripped away the fantasies of the university classicists, enamored of the ancient Greeks, and described an authentic Greece, one built on Eastern Orthodox ritual and political intrigue. Published 21 years ago, the book is more relevant now than ever.
In one of many telling observations, Holden noted that "fashionable Greeks . . . still unconsciously acknowledge their Eastern heritage by saying they are off to 'Europe' when they visit Rome, Paris or London." Holden's unstated premise was one I share: that the 20th century has been a disappointing one for Greece, owing to the loss of Greek colonies in Asia Minor in the 1920's, the civil war in the 40's, the disastrous right-wing dictatorship in the 60's and 70's, and massively corrupt left-wing populist rule in the 80's. Greece is still struggling to rejoin the very world it once invented -- that of the West. Its obsession with Macedonia may further complicate this pursuit.
The false image of Greece entertained in the West is a principal theme of modern Greek poetry. "What I Love," by Odysseas Elytis (translated by Olga Broumas), the "Collected Poems" of George Seferis (translated by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard) and the "Greek Poems" of C. P. Cavafy (translated by Memas Kolaitis) all provide poignant references to what it means to be a modern Greek. Cavafy in particular saw the Greek Orthodox Church -- not the Parthenon -- as the Greek symbol, one that recalls "the greatness of our old Byzantine days."
The most intractable -- and to me, the most fascinating -- culture in the Balkans is not Greek but Romanian: a blend of Latin sexuality and flair, Eastern Orthodox mysticism and superstition, and Byzantine intrigue. Not surprisingly, Romania has been responsible for some of the most inspired writing on the Balkans.
"Athene Palace" (1942), by R. G. Waldeck, a German-Jewish magazine writer, is a textured miniature painting in words of Romanian manners, as seen from the lobby of the Athene Palace Hotel in Bucharest during the fascist revolution of 1940-41. Had correspondents who covered the revolution of 1989 that deposed President Nicolae Ceausescu read Waldeck's book, they would have realized that far from being unique, the 1989 revolution was a natural extension of what had occurred in the same streets almost half a century earlier: a fascist-style monarch was being overthrown by a usually docile population, which every few decades explodes in a bout of orgiastic fury.
Yet things in Romania are never as bad as they seem. Conquered and abused throughout history, Romanians, Waldeck noted, have learned to "fall artfully, soft and loose in every joint and muscle as only those trained in falling can be." That is, they know how to corrupt each successive fascist and Communist regime in order to soften its effects.
"The Prodigals" (1962), by Petru Dumitriu, is a sweeping novel that brilliantly satirized how the author's fellow Romanians could corrupt a ruling order to such a degree that the whole house crashed down on them. Mr. Dumitriu wrote about the period leading up to World War II. But his book is relevant for today, as brothels proliferate and mafias once again come out of the shadows in Bucharest. One shouldn't forget Bram Stoker's "Dracula," first published in 1897, whose early chapters provide a wonderfully evocative description of the geography, customs and ethnic complexities of what Stoker called "one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe."
For more fun, and not a little insight into the chaos and anarchy now being unleashed in the Balkans, turn to Eric Ambler's "Coffin for Dimitrios" (1939). Here is a tale of drug smuggling, assassination and political intrigue, set in the early part of the century, that perfectly captures the atmosphere at the end of the century, as political crime networks make their return not just to Bucharest, but even more so to Belgrade and other former Communist capitals.
This is a world far removed from the calmer realities of London and Paris. In the television special about Bosnia, "Land of the Demons," Peter Jennings kept repeating how Yugoslavia is "in the heart of Europe" -- making it sound as if it is a scandal that Western Europe hasn't done anything about the war there. But Western Europeans have never thought of the Balkans as Europe, and their inaction only expresses their deep psychological desire, based on historical precedent, to formalize the division they perceive. For Western Europeans, Europe has always ended where the Ottoman Empire begins -- in Yugoslavia. Mr. Jennings, and others as well, would be wise to read "Eothen" (Greek for "from the East"), by Alexander Kinglake, a mid-19th-century British traveler, who began his account this way:
"At Semlin I still was encompassed by the scenes and the sounds of familiar life. . . . Yet, whenever I chose to look southward, I saw the Ottoman's fortress -- austere, and darkly impending high over the vale of the Danube -- historic Belgrade. I had come, as it were, to the end of this wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the Splendour and Havoc of The East."

HEADLINE: A Reader's Guide to the Balkans

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a contributing editor of The Atlantic, is the author of "Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History."

 BODY:
HISTORY, like hate, is the product of memory, and memory is composed of unforgettable detail -- sights, smells, sounds, exalted emotions, grim statistics and cruel ironies. A memory is not subject to condensation. Made to fit inside the narrow strictures of a television sound bite or a newspaper column, it loses all meaning. It becomes just another lifeless fact that can never convey how people have come to think and behave as they do.
The Balkans are a region of pure memory: a Bosch-like tapestry of interlocking ethnic rivalries where medieval and modern history thread into each other. More complicated and less visually exotic than the Middle East, the Balkans are unsuited to the reductions of the television camera. (A recent ABC News special, "Land of the Demons," showed footage from Bosnia, but even with rock music playing in the background the effect was flat.) Whereas the Middle East is a game of checkers -- Arabs versus Israelis, with a modern history that began only in 1918 -- the Balkans are three-dimensional chess. 
 So in a sense the ascendancy of the Balkans as a news story in the 1990's means a victory for print over television. Yet it is not only the television correspondents who can't do much with the Balkans. Neither can the newspaper pundits, since the region is not an extension of America's own ethnic and racial obsessions, the way the Middle East and South Africa are. The Balkans are truly foreign. They require pure intellectual curiosity, nuance, not op-ed polemics. There is no getting around it. To understand the Balkans, you have to read books.
The key word for understanding the Balkans is process: the process of history and the process of memory, processes that Communism kept on hold for 45 years, thereby creating a kind of multiplier effect for violence. Balkan violence is not a phenomenon of "modern hate," like that in Algeria and the West Bank, fed by rising economic expectations and demographic stress. Southeastern Europe is a caldron of history -- of unresolved border disputes and nationality questions created by the collapse of the multinational Hapsburg and Ottoman empires.
By "process," I mean the fact that in the Balkans each individual sensation and memory affects the grand movement of clashing peoples. For today's events are nothing but the sum total of everything that has gone before. Process is something that is more emotional, physical even, than rational. It often has no direction: the asides and footnotes can be more meaningful than the main story line. You have to feel. You have to be able to imagine all the details of the past. That is why the best books about the Balkans are old and frequently eccentric -- granting access to a psychological universe that no television camera will ever penetrate.
Here is my own Balkan reading list, consisting mainly of books that, although written long ago, explain the essentials of today's violence:
Dame Rebecca West's "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon," first published in 1941, is the perfect literary metaphor for the Balkans. Dame Rebecca takes nearly 1,200 pages of small print to describe Yugoslavia. Her book is filled with the most subtle of tangents, which go on for thousands of words. By concentrating on the minutiae of memory, she illuminates how people who basically look the same, speak the same language and have virtually indistinguishable names can hate one another with primitive ferocity.
Because Dame Rebecca experienced Yugoslavia in the late 1930's, during the buildup to fascism in Croatia, she is more critical of the Croats than of the Serbs. This serves a useful purpose for the modern reader, however: it shows that the present civil war is merely the second half of one that began in the midst of World War II, only to be interrupted by 45 years of Communist rule. The Croats were responsible for much of the brutality in the first half; the Serbs are guilty now.
Dame Rebecca's clairvoyance is demonstrated by Slovenia's absence from her travelogue. As the current war shows, Slovenia has always been a sideshow to the Yugoslav drama, owing to its lack of ethnic Serb and Croat minorities and its position in the extreme northwest of the federation. Wisely, Dame Rebecca concentrated on Bosnia, and she pointed to Macedonia as the pre-eminent Balkan problem, since it is the region where territorial and linguistic disputes dissolve into an anarchy of formlessness.
Like all good books about the Balkans, "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon" is politically incorrect, because it recognizes national character as historical destiny. Culturally, the Balkans may be the world's most intractable area. People are born equal there, but what happens to them afterwards -- the lies they are fed, the truths they are fed, the way they drink and the way they worship -- makes them profoundly different from one another by adulthood. For example, Roman Catholic Slovenia has experienced decades of Communism, even as Eastern Orthodox Greece has been a member of the Western alliance. Yet Slovenia's economic future appears to be brighter than Greece's. This is geography, character and history speaking, not policy.
Because the national character in question today is mainly that of the Serbs, I recommend several books, each profoundly incorrect, that take you inside the minds of some of the world's best haters.
"The Mountain Wreath," by Petar Petrovich Njegos, first published in 1847, is the great epic poem of the Serbian language. Njegos, the Bishop of Montenegro, was an unreconstructed Serb nationalist who justified the 17th-century mass murder of Albanian converts to Islam as part of a larger struggle against the Muslim Turks. The reader can experience a hundred pages of fiery verse like this:
 
 Our struggle won't come to an end until
 we or the Turks are exterminated. . . .
 we . . . set their houses ablaze.
 Out of their mosque and of a small building
 we made a pile of accursed rubble there. . . .
"The War in Eastern Europe," by John Reed, with drawings by Boardman Robinson, is the author's 1916 account of his Balkan travels during World War I. Beneath a sketch of a Serb soldier at the book's beginning, a caption reads, "Half-savage giants dressed in the ancient panoply of that curious Slavic people whose main business is war." When Reed asked a Serb soldier if he was afraid of foreign intervention, the soldier replied: "Let them all come! Serbia can whip the world!"
Reed, best known today for "Ten Days That Shook the World," his account of the Bolshevik Revolution, reflected in "The War in Eastern Europe": "I thought with wonder of these Serbians, their origin and their destiny. They alone of all the Balkan peoples have been one unmixed race. . . . They held their narrow passes against the Tartars of Bulgaria, the Dacians of Rumania, the Huns and Tcheks of the North. . . . When Europe imposed foreign dynasties on Bulgaria, Romania and Greece, Serbia was ruled by her own house. With such a stock, with such a history, with the imperialistic impulse growing daily, hourly, in the hearts of her peasant soldiers, into what tremendous conflicts will Serbia's ambition lead her!"
ANOTHER book that conveys just how little this far-off corner of Europe has changed is C. L. Sulzberger's "Long Row of Candles: Memoirs and Diaries (1934-1954)." In 1939, Mr. Sulzberger, who was later to become a foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times, met a Slavic Macedonian who was forced to Bulgarize his name after the Bulgarians invaded his homeland, and then to Serbicize his name after the Serbs invaded. This caused the fellow to say: "No wonder the rest of the world calls stew a macedoine. . . . When will we smash our fetters and gather round our capital in Solun?" Solun is the city of Salonika -- in Greece. It is such irredentist attitudes over the decades that fuel the seemingly irrational attempt by Greece to prevent the recognition of Macedonia as an independent state.
The mother lode of Serbian culture and national aspirations is its Orthodox monasteries in "old Serbia," a region where the medieval Serbian kingdom was born and grew to greatness in the 13th and 14th centuries, but which is now inhabited by Albanian Moslems and is known as Kosovo.

Blood ties and hatred can be tricky. On a recent television talk show, a Croatian American and a Bosnian Muslim both attacked me for failing to note that in Sarajevo, at least, Muslims, Croats, Serbs and Jews had usually got along. I recommend that they and others read "The Damned Yard: And Other Stories" by Ivo Andric.

Here is a tale of drug smuggling, assassination and political intrigue, set in the early part of the century, that perfectly captures the atmosphere at the end of the century, as political crime networks make their return not just to Bucharest, but even more so to Belgrade and other former Communist capitals.
This is a world far removed from the calmer realities of London and Paris. In the television special about Bosnia, "Land of the Demons," Peter Jennings kept repeating how Yugoslavia is "in the heart of Europe" -- making it sound as if it is a scandal that Western Europe hasn't done anything about the war there. But Western Europeans have never thought of the Balkans as Europe, and their inaction only expresses their deep psychological desire, based on historical precedent, to formalize the division they perceive. For Western Europeans, Europe has always ended where the Ottoman Empire begins -- in Yugoslavia. Mr. Jennings, and others as well, would be wise to read "Eothen" (Greek for "from the East"), by Alexander Kinglake, a mid-19th-century British traveler, who began his account this way:
"At Semlin I still was encompassed by the scenes and the sounds of familiar life. . . . Yet, whenever I chose to look southward, I saw the Ottoman's fortress -- austere, and darkly impending high over the vale of the Danube -- historic Belgrade. I had come, as it were, to the end of this wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the Splendour and Havoc of The East."

Letting the Good Times Roll

BYLINE: By SUSAN KARLIN

 BODY:
HUMAN bowling, Velcro wall jumping, tricycle races and TV theme singalongs aren't exactly by-the-books business strategies. But they've helped two brothers turn one restaurant/bar into a multi-million-dollar franchise during both a recession and an era of drinking less.
In six years, the two brothers, John and Jim Ressler, who've yet to turn 30, have opened six successful places in Manhattan and Long Island under their umbrella company, Global Enterprises, with themes from the Wild West to a fraternity basement. Their current venture is the Aces & 8's bar in the East Village. 
 Three more are planned for this summer: Caddyshack in Manhattan, and North Carolina Cattle Company and a new Delta House, both in Wilmington, N.C.
Wilmington? "It's the 14th fastest-growing city in the U.S. and the No. 1 for relocation," said John Ressler. "It's going to be the new Greenwich Village in the next six months," he added, with a trace of hyperbole.
The Resslers were not always so confident about operating several establishments. They pretty much went into the business blind. "We opened a restaurant because everyone wants to be in the restaurant business," John said. As it turned out, he added, just about everyone is already in the restaurant business.
"As the booze market got weaker," Mr. Ressler said, "we had to do things beyond installing a couple of pinball machines." Now, drawing gimmicks from pop culture and college bulletins, the Resslers attract a carefree twentysomething crowd by throwing toga and beach parties and donning pig and gorilla suits as promotions.
"We were looking to have people do something other than just drink. So we decided to sell fun," said John.

HEADLINE: Corporate Vows to Aid Poor Produce Little in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 18

 BODY:
Almost daily a group of well-dressed business executives announces with great fanfare a financial commitment to revitalize this city's poor neighborhoods in the aftermath of last year's riots. At last tally, 200 corporations had pledged more than $500 million in aid.
But these pledges have so far done little to change the bleak economic conditions of the inner city. Most of the corporate money will come in the form of donated equipment, buildings and services and support for educational and job training programs -- not for the factories, distribution centers, outlets and other operations that would create jobs in low-income areas. 
 "We've heard a lot of companies announcing what they plan to do for South-Central in the past year, but it's mainly been a bandwagon for large businesses to jump on for their own promotional purposes," said Eric Mann, director of the Labor Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles, an advocacy group that deals with labor and environmental issues.
 
City Is Quiet
 Los Angeles was quiet today after the convictions on Saturday of two police officers on Federal charges of violating the civil rights of Rodney G. King. But public figures ruffled the peaceful atmosphere by pointing out that the court case did not solve the city's underlying problems. One called the verdict "both epochal and irrelevant." Another said, "All the root causes of what happened a year ago are still there." [Page B11.]
Efforts to persuade companies to invest in the inner city have been hampered by a stubborn recession that has brought enormous layoffs as well as by California's stringent environmental and labor regulations, which add to the cost of doing business. And promises of Federal and state aid have not materialized so far.
While some corporations have pledged to increase the number of contracts that go to minority-owned businesses and to invest in healthy inner-city businesses and banks as a means of creating jobs, few residents have found work because of these efforts.
The results in the 11 months since the riots that followed the acquittal of four police officers on state charges in the beating of Mr. King have come as a major disappointment to many government officials, community leaders and economists here who have been looking to the business community to help solve the economic and social problems of troubled areas.
"If you are looking for shiny new factories and thousands of new jobs, you won't find them," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County. "The economic situation in these areas is about the same as it was a year ago, and it would be naive to think that within a year you could plop down a huge new plant in that area and put thousands of people to work."
 
Transferring Workers In
 As a result of the recession, companies say they are extremely limited in the type of assistance they can provide. For example, the Hughes Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of General Motors, has promised to give $18 million to the South-Central area and to move one of its business divisions there.
But $15 million of the Hughes money represents contracts that the company plans to set aside for minority-owned businesses. And the military contractor does not plan to hire local residents to work in the division it relocates; the workers will be transferred from other locations.
Richard Dore, a Hughes spokesman, said it would be unrealistic to expect the company to build a factory in South-Central Los Angeles at a time when the company was likely to eliminate 15,000 jobs in the metropolitan area and move many operations to other states.
The International Business Machines Corporation, which posted losses of $5 billion last year and announced its first layoffs in a half century, has pledged $31 million over the next five years to improve economic conditions in poor Los Angeles areas.
But none of that money will go directly toward new jobs or operations. About $19 million will be contracts given to businesses owned by members of minority groups; $5 million will go to support job-training centers that the company has sponsored with the Los Angeles Urban League and the Bank of America since 1968, and the remainder will be used to provide computer equipment and services to the centers and to Rebuild L.A., the public-private consortium charged with reviving the economy of the city's poor areas.
"When we first sat down with Peter Ueberroth he asked us if we could build a computer plant in South-Central and create jobs," said William E. Brown Jr., project director for I.B.M.'s rebuild program. "But with I.B.M. eliminating 100,000 jobs and phasing out plants around the country, his idea was clearly not feasible." Mr. Ueberroth, the former Baseball Commissioner best known for organizing the highly successful 1984 Summer Olympics here, heads Rebuild L.A.
The group faces a gargantuan task: A management consultant has estimated that an investment of about $6 billion and the creation of 75,000 to 94,000 jobs are needed to heal the inner city.
In recent months, Rebuild L.A. has come under fire for what critics say has been its failure to attract enough corporate support to create meaningful jobs.
 
Rebuild L.A. Sees Progress
 Mr. Ueberroth, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said that the pace of revitalization in the inner city has been slower than he expected, mainly because of the economy and the lack of government incentives for corporate investment.
But other officials of Rebuild L.A. say that the consortium has made significant progress in the 11 months since its formation, and that about 5,000 jobs have been created directly and indirectly.
"You don't have $500 million invested and not have jobs," said Barry A. Sanders, a co-chairman of Rebuild L.A. "Unfortunately people are looking for a quick fix, but we cannot correct decades-old problems overnight."
He cites a vocational automotive training center built by Toyota Motor Sales Inc. and the Los Angeles Urban League. The center trains about 100 people a year as entry-level automotive technicians and assists them in finding employment.
Mr. Sanders said that real job growth in the inner city would come mainly from the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses and that Rebuild L.A. would soon announce a program to provide capital for such growth.
Officials of Rebuild L.A. say they are being asked to fulfill a role that the Federal and state governments have not been willing to assume. While Federal and state officials have promised increased financing for troubled areas like the South-Central neighborhood, little has been forthcoming so far. Nor have there been regulatory revisions and financial incentives that government officials acknowledge are necessary to encourage investment.
Community advocates here say the main barriers to economic development in areas like South-Central Los Angeles are negative stereotypes that Corporate America harbors.
"There's a general assumption by large corporations that investments in these areas will not be recouped and that there are only marginal profits to be made," said Denise Fairchild, director of the Los Angeles office of the Local Initiative Support Corporation, an economic development group.
 
Supermarket Chains Expand
 Ms. Fairchild said the expansion of major supermarket chains into the inner city was starting to debunk these assumptions. She points to plans by Vons supermarkets to spend $50 million to build five stores in low-income areas of Los Angeles. The stores, scheduled to be completed by next year, will generate 500 to 1,000 jobs.
While Vons had planned to expand into the inner city before the riots, the company says it has accelerated those plans, which include an additional $50 million investment in other disadvantaged areas. "We are doing this because we know that we can be profitable in these areas that have long been underserved and also because we feel some social responsibility," said Mary McAboy, a Vons spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: As Health Plan Comes Together, Big Price Tag Comes Into Focus

SERIES: Health Agenda: Tallying the Costs -- A special report.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR with DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Just one month before President Clinton is scheduled to send Congress an ambitious proposal to guarantee comprehensive health care for all Americans, Administration officials are beginning to realize that it may involve huge costs and tax increases bigger than any previously proposed.
The White House has spent 12 weeks developing ideas for guaranteeing all Americans a rich package of health benefits. But only recently has the task force sorting through the ideas begun to focus on the costs. 
 President Clinton would probably finance his health plan by asking Congress to impose new taxes, amounting to hundreds of dollars a year even for middle-income families, including millions who already get health insurance coverage through their employers. In return, the Administration says, the health plan would provide peace of mind for all Americans because people would be assured of coverage if they moved, changed jobs or became sick.
 
How Many Billions?
 Officials say they cannot yet estimate totals because Mr. Clinton has not decided what the precise ingredients of his package will be and because even the members of the health-policy team cannot agree on reliable figures for individual elements of the plan.
But if the plan included guaranteed insurance coverage for prescription drugs, mental health care and long-term care, benefits recommended by the staff, these items alone could easily reach more than $50 billion a year, say health-policy experts and actuaries in and out of the Government. Parts of the health program might be put into effect gradually, so that the tax increase would be less abrupt, and perhaps more politically palatable.
In February, Ira C. Magaziner, manager of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, said in a memorandum that "universal access could mean $30 billion or $90 billion of additional annual expenditure by the Government by 1997." The ultimate cost may be toward the upper end of that range if Mr. Clinton's proposal includes many items under discussion.
 
Surprised by an Uproar
 As attention turns to the costs of new health benefits, the options for raising revenue also come into focus, as do the political risks that may accompany such proposals.
Aides to Mr. Magaziner, a business consultant from Rhode Island with limited experience in government and politics, say he was surprised by the political uproar last week over the disclosure that the Administration was considering an indirect form of national sales tax known as a value-added tax to pay for the health program.
Government actuaries and statisticians told the White House that if all the benefits recommended by the staff of the task force were included, a 14 percent value-added tax might be needed, a rate much higher than politicians have ever contemplated.
Two senior Administration officials said recently that Cabinet officers had pressed Mr. Magaziner for more detailed cost estimates and had been frustrated at his not factoring cost into the deliberations earlier.
Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, said these matters were "so complex and the data so limited" that reliable estimates were probably impossible.
What follows is a description of the potential costs of individual elements of the President's plan that are under discussion and the possible sources of revenue to finance them.
 
The Costs
Many Needs Mean Huge Expenses
 Lack of health insurance inhibits the use of health care. Providing coverage for the uninsured would increase their use of care and improve their health, but would also contribute to an increase in spending.
"If you give people an insurance card, they will go to the doctor more often," said John F. Sheils, a vice president of Lewin-VHI, a consulting concern that specializes in medical economics. "The uninsured use about 60 percent as much care as insured people with similar characteristics."
Mr. Sheils said health-care spending for people now uninsured would rise by $30 billion a year if they all became insured. The uninsured now get $41 billion a year in medical services, including what they pay for themselves as well as what they receive from public hospitals and programs, and they would get $71 billion worth if they were insured, he estimates. To prevent overuse of services, Administration officials would encourage patients to see general practitioners or family doctors before specialists.
One unresolved question is whether to upgrade Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 35 million elderly and disabled people, to include all the benefits now offered by private health-maintenance organizations. Such enhancements could cost $15 billion to $20 billion a year.
These other elements are under consideration:
Prescription drugs It would cost the Government perhaps $10 billion a year to provide insurance covering the cost of prescription drugs to people who do not have such coverage.
The Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, estimates that $44 billion, most of it private money, will be spent on prescription drugs for people outside hospitals this year. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association says 72 million Americans have no insurance coverage for prescription drugs. One-fourth of these people are 65 years old or over.
If the Government required employers to cover prescription drugs as part of the standard package of employee health benefits, it would, for political reasons, almost certainly have to provide drug coverage under Medicare.
Elderly people account for 13 percent of the population, but they are responsible for 34 percent of all spending for outpatient prescription drugs. Medicare generally does not cover the cost outside a hospital.
Long-term care Standard health insurance policies do not cover the cost of nursing homes or medical and social services provided to people in their own homes over a prolonged time. Medicaid, the Federal-state program, finances a substantial amount of such long-term care for low-income people, at a cost to the Federal Government of $35 billion a year.
But many other people need such care. Donald N. Muse, a statistician who has worked for the Congressional Budget Office and for the Medicare actuary, estimates that "a medium-size package of long-term care would cost the Federal Government $50 billion a year," beyond what it already spends.
Generous, comprehensive coverage under a public program could cost $100 billion a year, Mr. Muse said. By contrast, he said, the cost to the Government might be $20 billion a year under a program of the type favored by the nursing-home industry, which relies heavily on private insurance.
But Mr. Sheils said: "There's a lot of unmet need for nursing homes and home health care. If you had full coverage for long-term care and eliminated supply constraints, you would probably see a 30 percent increase in utilization of nursing homes, and the use of home health services could double."
Mental health President Clinton's proposal holds out the prospect of mental health care for millions of people who need such services but do not get them. His plan, at a minimum, would guarantee coverage for people with severe mental illnesses. But it would probably cover little psychotherapy for people who function reasonably well at work and at home.
In a report to Congress last month, the National Institute of Mental Health said it would cost $6.5 billion a year to provide coverage for treatment of severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, major depression and manic-depressive disorder.
"Currently," the agency said, "60 percent of people with severe mental disorders use services during a given year. This number would probably increase to about 80 percent with full coverage." The Government says that 5.1 million adults and nearly 1 million children have severe mental disorders.
Mr. Clinton's plan could also help some people whose illnesses were less than severe.
Confidential work papers from the task force say people will be eligible for mental health care if they have disorders that meet criteria in the diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association and if these disorders "create a serious risk for functional impairment."
Subsidies Mr. Clinton wants to require employers to provide health benefits to employees; workers would bear some of the cost. But Mr. Clinton will propose subsidies to reduce the burden on poor people and on companies with many low-wage employees.
Such subsidies could quickly become expensive for the Government. Under one option favored by senior members of Mr. Clinton's health team, the Government would subsidize premiums so that a private employer's contribution would not exceed a specified proportion of payroll -- say, 7 percent. Such a guarantee, Mr. Sheils says, would cost the Government $20 billion a year in premium-subsidy payments.
But he points out that health costs are growing faster than wages. To cover such costs, insurance premiums must also rise rapidly. As a result, Mr. Sheils said, more employers will find their health costs exceeding 7 percent of payroll. More employers will thus qualify for the Federal subsidies, and employers will need bigger subsidies.
 
The Taxes
A Few Proposals, None Painless
 Politicians, scholars and others at the center of the debate disagree over how to pay for universal health care, but a consensus exists on one point: some new form of tax with which Americans have no experience will almost certainly be needed.
More than 90 percent of Federal revenue is now raised through individual and corporate income taxes and through payroll taxes from employers and workers for Social Security and Medicare. No one is seriously proposing higher income or payroll taxes to meet the cost of the health program.
Mr. Clinton has already asked for a steep increase in income tax rates to reduce the Federal budget deficit, and another increase is out of the question politically. He can hardly ask employers to pay a further tax, since they would already bear much of the cost of universal coverage.
The financing problem is worsened by the fact that the Government will lose billions of dollars in tax revenue if additional workers are covered by their employers. That is because either companies or workers will owe less in income taxes: If companies swallow the additional cost of covering workers, they will get a new tax deduction. If, instead, companies offset their cost by lowering employees' pay, the workers would owe less in income taxes.
Administration officials have said that more than a dozen potential sources of new revenue are under consideration. As a practical matter, only a handful seem plausible. These are the most widely discussed:
Sin taxes The President has said he favors new taxes on tobacco and alcohol products, and opinion polls show that the public would favor such a step. But these taxes would not raise nearly enough money to cover all the Government's new costs.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, an increase in the Federal cigarette tax, now 24 cents a pack, to $1 would raise an additional $10 billion a year. An increase to $2 would raise nearly $20 billion.
The most commonly discussed proposal on alcoholic beverages would, for example, increase the tax on a six-pack of beer to 81 cents from 33 cents. Such a tax on alcoholic beverages would raise nearly $5 billion a year, according to the budget office.
These taxes have the advantage of taxing behavior that leads to poor health, Administration officials say. But if people cut back on drinking and smoking, the tax base would erode, and officials believe the revenues from those taxes would not keep pace with the rising cost of health care.
Value-added tax Such a tax, called a VAT, would be imposed at each level of production and would ultimately be paid by consumers, meaning it would essentially be a sales tax. Food, housing and medical care would probably be exempt, but most other products and services would be covered.
The main advantage of a value-added tax is that it would raise large sums of money. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that a 5 percent VAT would generate nearly $60 billion the first year it was fully in force, and the amount would rise annually as the economy grew and prices of goods and services rose.
Theoretically, value-added taxes also encourage saving, since no tax is paid until money is spent. Psychologically, consumers can feel a small degree of control over what they pay, since they can avoid taxes by keeping their wallets shut.
The biggest disadvantage is that this is what economists call a regressive tax, meaning that the poorer people are, the heavier their tax burden.
Middle-income families could pay more than $1,000 a year in additional taxes with a VAT as low as 4 percent, even with exclusions for food, shelter and medical care. Politically, this would be an extraordinary proposal for a Democratic President who campaigned on the theme that the tax system was unfair to the poor and middle class.
Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, seized that theme today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." Calling a value-added tax one that "hits low-income people the hardest," the Kansas Republican said he would not support a VAT "unless it replaces maybe the corporate income tax or part of the income tax."
States and local governments would also complain, because they see sales taxes as their province.
Tax on Insurance Employers can take a tax deduction for the entire cost of paying medical insurance premiums for workers, and no matter how generous this fringe benefit, employees get it tax-free. Most experts believe that overly generous insurance coverage encourages overuse of medical services and raises the overall cost of care.
The Congressional Budget Office reviewed a proposal to place a tax on employer-paid premiums of more than $165 a month for individuals and $400 for a family, approximately the cost of the average policy.
The tax could be imposed either by disallowing the employers' deductions for the additional amount or by requiring employees to pay taxes on the excess as if it were income. Limiting the deduction is probably more attractive politically. Either way, according to the budget office, $20 billion to $30 billion a year could be raised.
This proposal is a favorite of economists and health-policy specialists. But it is vigorously opposed by labor unions that have forgone large wage increases in favor of medical benefits.
Payroll Tax for Part-time Workers This tax is nearly a sure bet. Employers would not have to provide medical insurance for employees who worked fewer than a certain number of hours, but they would have to pay a tax to cover the Government's cost of buying insurance for such workers.
Lewin-VHI, the consulting group, calculated that if companies had to pay a tax of 8 percent of part-time workers' wages, it would raise about $4 billion a year for the Government.
Tax on Hospitals and Doctors In theory, hospitals and doctors would get a windfall from universal coverage because they would be paid for care in charity cases that now go unreimbursed. Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems and a lobbyist for private hospitals, estimates that on average hospitals spend 5 percent of their budgets on charity patients.
By one estimate, a 3 percent windfall tax on the hospital revenues and doctors' incomes could raise $10 billion to $12 billion a year. But without price controls, this could become a tax on the sick, since doctors and hospitals would pass it along to their patients.

HEADLINE: Scallopers See a Livelihood Imperiled

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BEDFORD, Mass., April 18

 BODY:
Like the 19th-century whalers who lived and labored here before them, scallopers say they fear they may become the next fallen icons of New England, remembered only in museums, books and the tall barroom tales of fishermen.
Dwindling stocks of sea scallops, foreign competition and increased enforcement of Federal fishing regulations have turned their once-pleasant trade into an ordeal that threatens their way of life, say the men and women who work the seas. 
 Situated on Buzzard's Bay, New Bedford and the neighboring town of Fairhaven share a port that brings in a $200 million catch each year, the largest in the nation. Memorialized by Herman Melville as a whaling port in "Moby Dick," the Buzzard Bay area has long attracted fishing families from Portugal and Norway.
An estimated 300 vessels, 120 of them scallopers, compose the commercial fishing fleet, which in large part fuels the economy of this poor, working-class community. Unemployment here was 15.2 percent in February, compared with 7.7 percent nationally.
 
Raids Spark Tension
 Tensions soared last month when Federal agents raided 22 scalloping vessels in the Port of New Bedford, seizing $126,220 worth of scallops. The agents, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, charged six boat owners with catching undersized, or baby, scallops and a seventh with unloading a catch outside the 5 A.M.-to-5 P.M. "window" set by Federal officials.
Scallopers, their families and many others in this closely intertwined community of about 116,000 said they were outraged by what they considered overzealous enforcement of rules they say are complex and leave scant room for error in judging the maturity of scallops. Fines for such violations can be as much as $100,000.
"We're not drug runners; we're not murderers; we're not rapists," said Bobby Bruno, a 52-year-old scalloper who started as a deckhand 33 years ago and now owns the Alpha & Omega II, a 96-foot scalloping ship. "We're just fishermen, and we go out and we work hard so we can come home and be with our families and be happy."
Federal agents acknowledged that tensions were high during the seizures, but they said that part of the tension had been caused by numerous death threats against agents and their families. A Federal investigation of the threats is under way, said John McCarthy, special agent in charge of the Northeast region for the National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the Commerce Department that regulates the fishing industry.
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who inherited the New Bedford area in last year's Congressional redistricting, said of the fishermen: "They get hammered by huge fines. Some of these guys feel like they're the last guys shot in the war before the truce. They're not hurting anyone. They are guilty sometimes of working too hard."
 
Regulations at Issue
 At issue are two Government regulations that scallopers say have made them feel, and sometimes behave, like criminals, while forcing them to work harder for smaller catches.
One involves the Hague line, a boundary set by the World Court in 1984 to delineate the fishing waters of the United States and those of Canada. Fishing on the Canadian side of the line, patrolled by the Coast Guard and Canadian submarines, can bring penalties of up to $100,000, the forfeiture of boats and the loss of fishing permits.
In January, 12 boats, most of them scallopers, were cited by the Coast Guard for crossing the line. Eight of the catches were seized and sold, the proceeds held in an escrow account without interest pending appeals.
The second regulation is one devised by Federal officials in 1982 to protect baby scallops and thus future stocks. The rule, known as the meat count, limits the number of small scallops in an average pound. A catch is considered in violation if a random count shows that a pound contains more than 36.3 scallop meats per pound.
The biggest problem with the system, scallopers say, is that the maturity of a scallop cannot be accurately judged until the shell has been pried open to reveal the meat size, a process that kills the scallop, making it impractical to throw the undersized scallops back into the sea to reseed.
At sea, scallopers open the shells and weigh the meat in one-pound cranberry juice cans. The meats are then put in cloth bags and stored in the ship's hold on ice until they return to shore, where Federal inspectors often meet the boats to do random counts of the meats in the cloth bags. Scallopers complain that the system is ineffective and inaccurate and that counting meats at sea is difficult and time consuming.
 
Scallopers Rally
 After the recent Federal raids, the scallopers held a series of rallies demanding that the Government abolish the meat count. On Thursday, six scallopers tied their vessels to the pier, the fishing equivalent of a strike.
The scallopers want the meat count replaced with a "gross catch quota," which would simply limit the number of pounds per trip a vessel could harvest. They also want a moratorium on new commercial fishing permits.
On Monday, about two dozen fishermen, family members and fishing industry representatives are to go to Washington to lobby Commerce Department officials.
While the scallopers will fight on, Mr. Bruno said, their way of life seems to have been changed forever. Trips that once took 10 days at sea have been averaging 12 days since the meat count went into effect, and even the joy of returning home is gone.
"It used to be the nicest part of the trip," Mr. Bruno said of sighting the port. "Now it's hell day.
With all the tensions of the meat count, he said, "You're not looking forward to seeing your family after 12 days. You're worrying about whether your trip's going to get seized. You're worrying that you counted wrong. You're worrying about the fines."

HEADLINE: Gore Meets Resistance in Effort for Steps on Global Warming

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
As President Clinton prepares to commemorate Earth Day with a speech on the environment, a dispute has broken out in the Administration over efforts by Vice President Al Gore to persuade Mr. Clinton to fulfill a campaign promise on specific steps to reduce the threat of global warming.
Mr. Gore, say aides in the White House and in several Cabinet agencies, has urged the President to commit the United States to freezing at 1990 levels the amount of global-warming pollutants pouring from cars, trucks and factories, a standard that would be reached by the year 2000. 
 Mr. Gore, the aides said, is arguing that such a commitment, promised during the 1992 campaign, would send an unmistakable message that the Clinton Administration is taking the lead in battling global environmental threats. Last year, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore criticized President George Bush for rejecting an identical commitment proposed by the European Community.
 
Secretaries' Reservations
 But Mr. Gore's proposal has met resistance from several Cabinet members, principally Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary. Senior aides said both Secretaries contended that the Administration had not clearly studied how limiting air pollution from carbon dioxide, the principal source of scientific concern about global warming, would affect American industry.
The aides said such a commitment could also further endanger the energy tax Mr. Clinton has proposed. Opponents in Congress, the aides say, would seize on the commitment as proof that the Administration would seek to cut consumption of fossil fuels by drastically increasing the tax.
The aides, who spoke about the dispute only on the condition of anonymity, said that by the year 2000 the United States will be pouring 100 million metric tons more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it did in 1990. If Congress approves the energy tax, the Administration estimates that the amount of carbon dioxide would be reduced by 25 million metric tons by the end of the decade.
But the Administration has not yet figured out how to eliminate the rest, the aides said, and until it does officials in the Energy and Treasury Departments have urged the President not to make a commitment on global warming.
 
Balancing Earth and Economy
 Although the aides differed about the intensity of the dispute, they agreed that it has provided the most revealing look yet at the enormous political pressures involved as the Administration tries to make environmental and economic goals compatible.
The struggle also is crucial for Mr. Gore, who has made a political reputation and a best-selling literary debut by discussing ecological problems and how to solve them. Last month the White House overruled Mr. Gore, who had promised to shut down a hazardous waste incinerator in Ohio after the White House overruled him. And he has been virtually silent on environmental issues since his inauguration.
Marla Romash, the spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, said nothing had been decided about the proposal and that the President's speech, which he is to deliver on Wednesday, a day before Earth Day, was not yet written. "The President plans to commemorate Earth Day and to make clear this Administration's commitment to growing the economy and protecting the environment," she said. "There are no disagreements that I know of at all."
But aides at several other agencies who have been involved in the discussions at the White House about the speech contradicted Ms. Romash.
"We all want to get to the same goal but we are not in agreement on what is the most cost-effective way to benefit the global environment and the American economy," said a top aide at the Department of Energy. "It may take more time to work this out than we have before the President's speech. We support the commitment made during the campaign. The issue is how to get there."
Just as he did during the 1992 campaign, when he used Earth Day to deliver an important environmental policy address in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton is apparently ready to make a splash again.
Aides in the White House and in other agencies say Mr. Clinton is considering announcing that he will reverse the Bush Administration's position and sign an international treaty to protect endangered plants and animals. Mr. Bush was widely criticized for his decision at the Earth Summit last year in Rio de Janeiro.
Mr. Clinton could also announce that he has approved Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's plan to reorganize the scientific divisions in his department and establish a better scientific basis for managing the Department's more than 500 million acres of land.
But none of the ideas the White House is considering for inclusion in Mr. Clinton's speech have caused as much disagreement as the global-warming proposal. A commitment to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide that the United States puts into the atmosphere would affect every American, and put even more pressure on American industry to compete with Japanese and German manufacturers who already use energy more efficiently.
Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of burning oil, coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels and the only way to control it is to be much more judicious in using energy. The United States poured 1,381 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 1990 and is expected to increase that amount to 1,475 million metric tons by the year 2000, the Department of Energy says.
Carbon dioxide traps infrared radiation from the sun in the atmosphere, which raises the temperature on the ground. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have been rising steadily over the last century but there is considerable dispute among scientists about whether that will present a significant ecological threat.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
AFTER Apple Computer Inc. announced a decline in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, analysts rushed to revise their estimates for the year. Some revised them downward, as one might expect, but some raised their estimates and others even issued new buy recommendations. Apple shares closed up 87.5 cents, at $48.125, when trading ended on Friday.
Analysts at Bear, Stearns; S. G. Warburg; Salomon and Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded their investment ratings. Lehman Brothers and First Boston maintained buy ratings, while analysts at Hambrecht & Quist; Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs were negative. 
The Apple bulls contend that the pricing pressures on the company will abate in the second half of the year as new products become more available, and sales will continue to grow. The bears say that Apple has been promising earnings growth for some time now, and that maintaining margins will get harder, not easier, in the face of continuing price wars and shaky consumer confidence.
Even before Apple released its second-quarter results on Thursday, the analysts were pretty much split. For the quarter ended March 26, Apple reported earnings of 92 cents a share, below the $1 average of analysts' projections. But among individual analysts, the estimates had been as high as $1.15, while others were as little as 85 cents. So, the quarter was a big disappointment to some but a pleasant surprise to others.
"There was no consensus," said Doug van Dorsten, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in San Francisco. "There was an arithmetic mean of $1 a share, but there were no analysts at $1." He said any weakness in Apple's stock price represented a buying opportunity. Many of the new products introduced in the March quarter are only beginning to be shipped in quantity, he said, and they will contribute to sales growth.
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with First Boston, also maintained his buy rating. Apple's managers, he noted, "are very bullish on the second half of the year."
"They expect to start cutting into their backlog," he said. "Gross margins might continue to deteriorate, but not nearly at the same rate as in the first and second quarters when they really slashed prices."
In anticipation of the new models, Apple sold older Macintosh models at deep discounts, which contributed to the erosion of its profit margins. Many of the products Apple introduced were "supply constrained," Apple-speak for not immediately available, and have added to its backlog. Bearish analysts say Apple may have missed the opportunity to sell these machines if consumer buying slows.
"The overall climate for PC sales is softening," because of changes in the tax code and a weakening of consumer confidence, said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. "About the time Apple is ready to meet demand, there may be a lessening of demand."
While Apple has been saying it would show earnings growth in the second half, he added, "there doesn't seem to be much possibility of earnings growth before the fourth quarter."
Michelle Preston of Merrill Lynch also had a negative outlook. "We still expect an acceleration in revenue growth, but we now expect margin pressures to offset this improvement, resulting in a negative earnings comparison for the third quarter," she said. "While Apple's market-share gains and accelerating revenue momentum are positive, until we see the potential for positive earnings growth, we are remaining neutral on the stock."
Still other analysts said there was too much emphasis on the negative. "There is an excessive amount of concern about the quarter they just reported," as well as "an excessive amount of fear about the summer," said Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns, who raised his recommendation to "strong buy."
At Friday's closing price, Mr. Neff said, Apple has "a valuation of 10 times calendar-year earnings for what is probably one of the most profitable computer companies in the world."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
For Those Who Deliver, a Good Take

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Five years ago, Lois O'Neill found herself at a dead end. Her life had come down to a divorce, an unrewarding office job and three children to put through college.
So she took a small inheritance and bought a bread delivery route in Bergen County, N.J., for $18,000. She began going to work at 1 A.M. seven days a week, wearing a sweat suit rather than the high heels to which she was accustomed. 
 It paid off. By dint of hard work, she increased her number of stops to 45 from 20, thereby raising her annual income to $80,000 a year. She is now trying to sell the route for $110,000 so she can move to Arizona.
There has been just one drawback, the social one. "You don't meet the president of I.B.M. delivering bread at night," Ms. O'Neill says.
 
Big Business in Routes
 Truth to tell, she may have made some wiser economic decisions than I.B.M., considering how fast things are changing in this crazy economy. Some of the most unlikely folks are popping up in this arcane precinct of entrepreneurship -- the delivery of much of the merchandise you find on the shelves of grocery stores, delicatessens and even auto body shops.
"With so many people laid off and so few new job opportunities, men and women are now clamoring for routes," says Kenneth Sussman, president of The Route Brokers, a Great Neck, L.I.-based company that has made a business of matching buyers and sellers of routes.
Route Brokers, which employs nine agents in three metropolitan area offices, sells about 150 routes a year at an average price of $89,000, for which it earns a 10 percent commission paid by the seller. A buyer can expect to make $800 to $1,200 a week before taxes, and considerably more if he hustles to sign up more stops or more sales at existing stops.
In the last five years, Mr. Sussman says, more than 40 percent of the routes have been bought by people who previously had white-collar jobs. Women, who rarely used to be in the business, now account for one-tenth of route purchases.
"If you're a sales-oriented person, you can make a fortune," Mr. Sussman declares. Routes can sell for as little as $25,000, or as much as $500,000, he says.
He cites the success of a Long Island man whose brothers owned profitable Pepperidge Farm routes. Instead of following suit, the man took a chance on a Martin's Potato Rolls route in his native Brooklyn. He paid $39,000 for the route, then built its income to more than $1,200 a week through aggressive salesmanship. He sold the route in five pieces for a total of more than $200,000.
 
A List, a Territory and a Truck
 What you get when you buy a route is a list of customers, often a protected territory, usually a small truck of some sort and the right to pick up merchandise from a company like Coca-Cola, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream or Wise's Potato Chips. But what you can almost never get is bank financing: sellers usually take a sizable downpayment, with the remainder in a personal note.
There are an estimated 7,500 independently owned routes, mostly in the food business, in the New York metropolitan area. Each month, Mr. Sussman or his staff hears from 250 owners interested in selling. About 125 turn out to be serious.
Companies began selling routes to independent drivers in this region in the mid-1960's, Mr. Sussman says, prompted partly by desires to escape vehicle maintenance and insurance. More important, a route owner has considerably more incentive to increase sales than an employee who is drawing a salary.
"If you have a personal stake in what you're doing, you'll do it a lot better than somebody who doesn't have that stake," says Neil Churchill, director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. "You can build a business with low capital, some ingenuity and a lot of perseverance."
Daniel J. Feld, the owner of the Saratoga Potato Chip Company, a five-year-old maker of gourmet snacks, studied a number of distribution systems before deciding on owner-operated routes. Initially, his approach was to give the routes away. Since then, some original owners have made profits by selling parts of their ever-more-profitable routes.
"This is the only way to make these routes work," Mr. Feld says. "It's a funny kind of arms-length, but very close, relationship."
Some see another aspect to the decision by some companies to sell routes. Audrey Freedman, an independent labor economist in Manhattan, says the practice is driven by companies' desires to shun unions, avoid wage and hour laws, and save on benefits. "Anything at all they can do to avoid having a permanent employee on the payroll, they'll do," she says.
 
'You Can Hustle'
 There are many roads to the route business. Frederick Berryhill of Freeport, L.I., worked for 11 years in sales support for the Xerox Corporation. He left Xerox in October to buy an auto tool route for $30,000, and began operating it in December. He enjoys not wearing suits, but even more, he relishes being his own boss.
"You can hustle," he says. "That's the whole idea."
Yamira Lopez, a 22-year-old mother of two who lives in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, used $39,000 from a jury award after an automobile accident to buy an Italian bread delivery route. She makes a pretax income of $1,000 a week, of which $200 goes to a part-time helper.
Her work days start at 3 A.M. and end around 11 A.M., when she returns home to ride herd over two preschool children. She hopes to sell the route in a year or so and buy a bigger one.
"I love having my own money in my hands," she says.

HEADLINE: Apartment Owners as Both Tenant and Landlord

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
It is a bizarre New York City game, a real-estate version of musical chairs. To participate one only needs to own a co-op or condominium that cannot be sold and have a need or desire to live somewhere else.
While there are no hard figures on how many people have been thrust into this sometimes costly game, where apartment owners are landlords and tenants at the same time, anecdotal information suggests that the number of co-op owners who are subletting their apartments while they rent other places is growing. 
 The result is a convoluted spiral that can look like this:
Jerry Harmyk, who was moving his antiques dealership from the Upper East Side to Greenwich Village, wanted to live near his business. But with nary a nibble close to his asking price for his one-bedroom co-op on York Avenue in the 80's, he found a tenant instead, then signed a lease for a smaller apartment in the Village.
Now he is renting from a couple who also could not sell their apartment. And they in turn are renting from a family who were unable to sell their co-op near Columbia University.
 
Facing a Sure Loss
 "I started trying to sell my apartment just as the market started to drop," Mr. Harmyk said. "And because I took a second mortgage, if I sold now it would surely be at a loss. In fact I don't think I would even get the value of my mortgage out of the deal."
Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, one the largest rental agencies in the city, said situations like that of Mr. Harmyk and the other couples involved in his rental circle are becoming more common. Two-thirds of the 4,000 apartments Feathered Nest currently lists are in co-op or condominium buildings, she said, and the majority of them are being offered by people who either live or lived in them.
"When we first started listing condominiums more than 10 years ago, most were owned by investors who never occupied them," Ms. Packes said. "But as the co-op sales market worsened, we began seeing more apartments offered for rent by owners who could not sell but who wanted to move on."
The problems co-op and condominium owners have in selling their units can be traced to a four-year housing slump that has left many apartment owners reeling in the wake of declining prices. So severe has been the slide in prices -- 30 percent since the market's peak in 1988 -- that subletting apartments offers the owners the only palatable alternative to a financial bath.
While the phenomenon does not stop at New York city's borders, renting as an alternative to selling is more common in the city than in the suburbs because the city has more apartments and its rental tradition is stronger.
 
Subletting No Panacea
 The trend toward subletting is by no means a panacea. In some cases, co-op boards have refused to allow sublets. In others, the boards have added monthly fees for owners who sublet their apartments. At the same time, a soft rental market has meant sometimes accepting tenants who pay less than what is needed to meet mortgage and maintenance payments.
And for many people, the unaccustomed role of landlord is fraught with the usual perils of deadbeat, demanding or destructive tenants and the cost of having to make repairs. Some co-op and condominium owners admit to being squeamish at playing the roll of the hard-nosed landlord.
For their part, some tenants contend that subletting in co-ops and condominiums offers some of the nicest living spaces in the city, but the arrangement has its down side. What some apartment owners know about their responsibilities as landlords, some tenants say, leaves a lot to be desired. Other subletting tenants said they have been caught in the crossfire when apartment owners and their co-op boards battle over matters like subletting rights and apartment repairs.
"You are at the mercy of the quality of your owner's relationship with the board," said Leslie Deamer, who is renting a one-bedroom co-op in Brooklyn. "If the relationship is not good it can be a real burden."
Many owners with apartments they cannot sell bought them at the crest in the wave of co-op and condominium conversions that moved across the city in the 1980's, when prices seemed to escalate by the week and there was no end in sight to the dizzying rise in value.
 
Home Plan Fizzles

But starting with the stock market crash in 1987, prices for co-ops and condominiums started to tumble and a regional economy that refuses to be revived has kept a recovery at bay.
Susan Walsh, a secretary at a New York law firm, is one of those who bought just as the market was beginning to turn sour. Now she finds that trying to sell is harder than she ever imagined. After her divorce, Mrs. Walsh paid $165,000 for a studio apartment in the 70's on the Upper East Side. The plan was for her to live in the apartment for a year or two before selling, possibly at a profit. She expected to use the money from the sale for a home in the suburbs.
It did not work that way. Not realizing that the market was unraveling, Mrs. Walsh passed up an offer that would have allowed her to break even. Soon it became apparent that any sale would result in a loss.
Mrs. Walsh does live in the suburbs now -- in an apartment she rents on Long Island.
"I just signed a lease with my third tenant," said Mrs. Walsh, who moved out of her Manhattan apartment five years ago. "I am relieved to have someone in the apartment but it is frustrating that I can't get my money out so we can buy a house."
 
Subletting 2 Studios
 Marlene Lee and her husband, Paulo Bolivar, are also frustrated owners who cannot sell. They recently bought a two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. But each has a tenant in studio apartments they owned and occupied before they married. Mr. Bolivar, a New York-based news producer for a Brazilian television network, admits that his first effort at subletting was a disaster.
"I was not tough enough with the first tenant and he really took advantage of that," Mr. Bolivar said.
The tenant dodged Mr. Bolivar's efforts to collect the rent and eventually moved without notice, taking with him an Oriental rug and other furnishings.
"The apartment was a mess when he left," said Mr. Bolivar who has turned the couple's property-management chores over to his wife.
Even though they have found responsible tenants for both apartments, Ms. Lee said, their subletting headaches h have not ended. The co-op board of the building where she owns recently introduced a policy requiring a $105 monthly fee for sublets.
"There is only so much you can charge these days for a studio apartment," said Ms. Lee, who works in the design department at Donna Karan in Manhattan. "I do not see how I can pass this on to my tenant."
She has heard that other owners in the building are angry about the fee and plan to fight it. If the policy is not rescinded, she will have a monthly shortfall between what her tenant pays and her own expenses.
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, a nonprofit support organization for co-ops and condominiums, said that some co-op boards use the fees as a way of discouraging subletting without banning it.
"The subletting issue is one of the most difficult that boards now face," said Ms. Rothman, adding that many boards are trying to extend relief to apartment owners facing financial hardship while at the same time addressing the concerns of other shareholders about sublets.
One of those concerns, Ms. Rothman said, is how subletting might affect other units. Some banks have tightened their requirements for issuing mortgages, often requiring that at least 50 to 60 percent of the units be occupied by the owners.
Permission to sublet is not what is keeping Dr. Edward Soufer's apartment vacant. Dr. Soufer bought two condominiums during the boom years with the intent of making them into one large unit. He later decided instead to rent one of the units, a two-bedroom with spectacular views of downtown Manhattan and the East River. Though he does not need any approval to put in a tenant, he has not been able to replace the family that moved out last August.
"First I could not find a buyer," said Dr. Soufer, who is asking $3,500 a month for the apartment. "And now I can't find a tenant. How far do values have to drop before we see an end to this?"

Confronting Urban Ills, 2 Senators Face Reality

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
THERE he goes again.
This time, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan did not single out blacks. But the searing lecture he delivered last week on the social consequences of family disintegration managed to offend, among others, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Representative Charles B. Rangel by waxing nostalgic about the good old days when more families may have been intact, but neglecting to mention that the old days were not so good for blacks still subject to legal segregation. 
 In some respects, though, many blacks face even tougher hurdles today because of the very social conditions that Mr. Moynihan had the courage to acknowledge. And critics who also faulted him for being short on solutions forget that no elected official has been hectoring the Clinton Administration more to make meaningful changes in the welfare system.
Mr. Moynihan was expanding on a theme he sounded earlier this year in The American Scholar, when he wrote that "we have been redefining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized." He offered three categories of redefinition: "The altruistic, may be illustrated by the deinstitutionalization movement within the mental health profession that appeared in the 1950's. The second category, the opportunistic, is seen in the interest group rewards derived from the acceptance of 'alternative' family structures. The third category, the normalizing, is to be observed in the growing acceptance of unprecedented levels of violent crime."
While New York's senior senator was delivering his stern warning to civic leaders in Manhattan last week, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey was in Paterson gauging the depth of despair and the grounds for hope that inspired him to introduce a six-point "urban community-building initiative."
"I've gotten a lot of personal stories that confirm the basic three problems of violence, joblessness and family disintegration," said Mr. Bradley, who last year qualified, like Mr. Moynihan before him, as a profile in candor for articulating America's unspoken obsession with race.
One elderly couple who had lived in Paterson for three decades said their neighbors were pretty nice except for the occupants of one house on the block. Drug dealers? Mr. Bradley asked.
"I'm afraid to say anything," the woman replied.
"But the premise of my urban package was also confirmed," Mr. Bradley said. "A Hispanic couple was waiting at the teller's window in one of the few bank branches in the area. They said they were putting in only $100. I asked how much they made and saved a year and they said they have five kids, made less than $20,000 and still managed to save $3,000. There are the people who need to be given a better chance."
Mr. Bradley's modest $1.44 billion-a-year package seeks to replicate what works. His Assets for Independence Act would allow anyone with an income of up to twice the poverty line to contribute up to $2,000 to an "individual development account" to buy a first home, pay for college education or for retirement or to start a small business. Government would provide money to community-based nonprofit groups to match the savings.
His package also includes a Neighborhood Reconstruction Corps to train youths and match private investment in public works; money to keep schools open after normal hours to provide students with a safe haven and a mentor; support for community development financial institutions that re-invest deposits in the community; grants to community colleges and community development corporations to train people for self-employment; Federal subsidies to expand community policing; investment in van services and other means of connecting jobless city dwellers with suburban jobs; and a network of "Fifteen-Month Houses" that offer poor and young mothers a place to live, health care and counseling during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first year of life.
He echoes the Kerner Commission report -- and a follow-up this year sponsored by the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation -- that American cities are suffering from "not just the failure of spending, but the failure of imagination." In contrast to President Clinton's stalled jobs bill, the Senator said, "These are all new, innovative, grass-roots-up programs -- not Federal bureaucrats putting a pot of money out there and attracting people who want the money. These provide resources at points of leverage.
"The eight bills in this initiative are based on creative programs that have already worked on the local level, supported by communities and undertaken without government assistance," he said. "This initiative gives these local programs a national test, so we can see what works and what doesn't. The cost of the program is $1.44 billion per year -- slightly more than the cost of four days of rioting in South Central Los Angeles last April."
Even after the rioting last year, Mr. Bradley said, "I was astounded at how few people stood up and said, 'Let's confront our reality.' " Will the quiet riot that consumes America's cities every day inspire public officials to confront reality as boldly as Senators Bradley and Moynihan have? Will Congress compromise on the President's jobs bill, much less seriously consider Mr. Bradley's urban agenda?
"If Los Angeles were to erupt again, there's usually a paroxysm throughout the nation that lasts about a month and that says we have to do something about the cities," Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn said last week. "The timing, in a perverse way, is that may be the month when the jobs compromise has to be negotiated."
So no blood, no guts?
"Strange world we live in," Mr. Schumer said.

HEADLINE: Privatization To Reshape Peru Market

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
In Latin America's most radical privatization program, Peru has embarked on a plan to auction off virtually all its state-owned companies over the next two years -- including oil, electric, telephone, and mining companies and the railroad that takes tourists to the Incan ruins at Machu Picchu.
With investors already poring over company prospectuses, the privatizations are expected to reshape Peru's economy in a free-market mold, tripling foreign investment and dismantling a socialist legacy left by a leftwing military Government of the 1970's. 
 "There are no sacred cows," said Carlos Montoya, a Stanford-trained economist who is overseeing the drive to sell 70 state companies by 1995.
 
Investment Missions Overseas
 When the dust settles, it is unclear whether the United States will retain its traditional rank as Peru's largest foreign investor. Investment missions are promoting Peru in China and Japan, and to encourage Asian investment, the Government is adopting a program of granting Peruvian passports to foreigners who pay $25,000 to Peru's treasury. Latin American neighbors are also being courted.
"Now is the precise time to invest in Peru, since it is just opening to foreign capital," Miguel Bauzar, a Chilean businessman, told reporters after leading a delegation of Chilean investors here for a meeting with President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru. "Now is when we Latin American businessmen have the chance, because later on the multinationals will arrive and we will not have so many opportunities."
In recent months, investor confidence has soared in Peru. Police have captured leaders of the nation's two guerrilla groups. And the inauguration in January of a new Congress has softened international criticism of Mr. Fujimori's authoritarian rule.
By the end of 1992, Lima's stock index had risen in real terms by 138 percent, ranking it second only to Jamaica's in terms of growth among world markets. With an eye on the coming privatizations, investors had bid up stock prices on companies scheduled for full privatization this year. Last month saw the debut of the first internationally traded mutual fund for Peru.
"We have doubled our staff, from 33 last year to 60 today, and have added a stock brokerage," said Ivan Carrillo Chavez, a vice president here for Citibank del Peru, the only United States bank operating in Peru.
In December, the United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation signed an agreement with Peru to extend insurance protection and investment credits to American investors here. The last agreement was suspended by Peru's military rulers in 1968.
 
Negotiating Loan Repayments
 In March, with the United States providing financial and political support, Peru repaid debts to the World Bank and to the International Monetary Fund and re-entered the international financial community after a six-year absence. Low-interest loans from multilateral banks are expected to amount to $1 billion this year. In May, talks are to start to negotiate repayment terms for Peru's $8 billion debt to private foreign banks.
Further increasing Peru's attractiveness has been the adoption of an investment code described by one American economist here as "the most open foreign investment regime on the continent." The code allows free repatriation of capital, erases legal distinctions between national and foreign capital, and allows international arbitration of disputes.
"Peru is offering a friendly economic and political environment -- and we are encouraged by that," said D. Michael Rounds, a spokesman for the Cyprus Minerals Company of Englewood, Colo. The company, a major copper producer, has been inspecting state mining properties that are to be sold. Mining accounts for half of Peru's export revenues.
"American mining companies seem to be showing interest through their Chilean subsidiaries," Daniel Hokama, Minister of Mines and Energy, said. Chileans, who share an Andean geology similar to Peru's, endured terrorism and political turmoil during the 1970s.
 
Foreign Investment in Mining
 Reflecting growing American interest, the Newmont Mining Corporation, which is based in Denver, is starting a $36 million investment to develop a gold mine in northern Peru. In projects bound to reverse Peru's declining minerals production, five foreign companies have drawn up plans to invest almost $1 billion in Peruvian mining operations through 1995.
Given Peru's reputation as a high-risk nation, properties here are considered to be among the cheapest in the world.
"Because of the situation that Peru has endured for the last 10 years, values are well below their real value," President Fujimori said in an interview in early April. Last year, Mr. Fujimori succeeded in lowering inflation to 57 percent, its lowest level in 15 years. But economic activity has continued to fall, dropping 20 percent since 1980.
Last fall, Mantos Blancos, a Chilean subsidiary of the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa, paid $12 million for a copper deposit owned by Minero Peru, a state company. In Chile, Mantos Blancos paid $190 million for a deposit of similar size.
With $500 million in oil-related investments planned for Peru over the next two years, 12 of the 20 private oil companies operating here are American, including the Petrotech International Corporation, which won the bidding to operate for 20 years the offshore reserves of Petromar, a subsidiary of the state comnpany. Starved of investment, Peru's oil industry saw production drop by half in the 1980's, converting the nation from an oil exporter to an importer.
Private business participation accounts for the Government's confidence that it will sell all 70 companies by July 1995, the end of Mr. Fujimori's presidential term.
To get Peru's state companies in shape for sale to private investors, the Fujimori Government restored public utility rates to profitable levels and slashed payrolls and costs. The cutbacks, which eliminated tens of thousands of jobs, reduced state company losses to about $300 million in 1992 from $3 billion in 1990.
Although entrenched interests have tried to block each of the 14 privatizations carried out so far, completed sales have netted the Government $250 million.
"When we sold the gas stations, it turned out that the man responsible for renewing licenses was charging $50,000 under the table and had built up a small real estate fortune in Miami," said Jaime Yoshiyama, a Harvard-trained businessman who directed the privatization campaign before becoming president of Peru's Congress in January.
Initially, employees of Enatru, the state bus company, opposed its sale. It turned out that fare collectors were sweeping ticket stubs off floors, ironing them and reselling them, tripling their salaries but draining millions of dollars a month from the company.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo's Rebate Card

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18

 BODY:
Wells Fargo Bank has introduced a credit card offering consumers up to $1,000 in yearly rebates to trim their mortgage costs.
The new "California Advantage" Visa or MasterCard, announced last week, will offer a $5 rebate for every $100 purchase made with the card. The rebate can be applied to closing costs or interest charges when customers take out a home loan or refinance a mortgage from Wells. 
 The rebate limit on a regular card is $700 each year with a $3,500 five-year maximum; for the Gold Card, the figures are $1,000 each year up to a $5,000 maximum.
Wells Fargo officials hope the card will enhance the bank's mortgage lending business. It ranks far behind a main rival, the Bank of America.
Wells's standard card holder would have to charge $14,000 a year -- more than six times the average charged on credit cards -- to earn the maximum rebate.
Interest rates on the Advantage card are slightly higher than on other Wells cards. And if the customer cannot qualify for a home loan, the rebate would be worthless.

HEADLINE: Wicks Law Reform Can't Wait

 BODY:
Here's a simple question for New York State legislators: Do they answer to taxpayers, or to the powerful trade unions that contribute to their re-election campaigns? That's the issue as debate renews in Albany over a relic known as the Wicks Law.
Enacted in 1921, the law bars local governments from awarding construction jobs by low bid to a single general contractor. That's the system widely used in private industry, by the Federal Government and most states. In New York, however, municipalities must hire at least four separate contractors: for general construction, plumbing, electrical, and heating and ventilation work. 
 The law was intended to increase competition and reduce costs. But the result is a coordination nightmare that scares away responsible bidders and leads to huge overruns, shoddy workmanship and endless court fights.
Indeed, the state budget office has estimated that the multiple contracting requirement adds nearly $400 million a year to the cost of government construction. A new report by a team of outside economists hired by the New York City School Construction Authority concludes that projects exempted from Wicks cost 13 percent less and were completed 15.6 months more quickly than Wicks projects.
For years, the plumbing, electrical and heating trades have fought efforts to rescind the law with lobbying and political gifts to both parties. But with government money still tight, and local officials and school boards now joining the fray, Wicks law reform stands a chance this year.
A measure sponsored by Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat, and Senator Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican, would give local governments the option of following the law or not. With fine-tuning to prevent unfair bid shopping by general contractors, the bill deserves passage.
Governor Cuomo pledged not to seek repeal of Wicks until next year, when the School Construction Authority's five-year exemption from the law expires. But, with a reform movement clearly under way, he has voiced strong support for scuttling Wicks now. His help is needed to persuade legislative leaders not to stall another year.

HEADLINE: Tax Balloons and Common Sense

 BODY:
President Clinton's agents have once again floated the notion of a national value-added tax to pay for universal health care. Until he broaches the health plan, though, it is idle to speculate about how he would finance it and senseless to let the financing divert everyone's attention.
As a seasoned politician, Mr. Clinton surely knows the risk of coupling two major controversies -- over health care and a new system of taxation. Indeed, the talk of a valued-added tax may be nothing more than the White House signaling that the health plan's cost will be formidable. 
 The President mentioned the possibility of a value-added tax in February, but acknowledged then that it would mark a "radical change" in the nation's taxation, suggesting that it might be considered at some future time, but not now. A value-added tax is a tax on the value that is added to goods and services at each step through the entire process of production and marketing -- finally, a tax on consumption.
Value-added systems are widely used in other industrial countries. They are favored by a growing band of American politicians -- at least partly because they can yield huge revenues -- and by economists concerned about America's low rate of savings and investment.
But liberal opponents argue that valued-added taxes, like sales taxes, are fundamentally regressive; they hit the poor disproportionately, because the poor spend more of their income than the rich do. And conservatives, worried about the growth of government, quail at the gusher of revenues the taxes can produce, undetected by consumers who can't see how much tax is built into a product's price.
Whatever the merit of a value-added system, one thing is sure: If President Clinton proposes yet another new tax, the Republicans won't let him forget it. On this move, all the political signs flash caution. Moreover, the rules of common sense say that before floating trial balloons about taxes, the White House should consult the bipartisan Senate group that is studying consumption-based taxes. If a consumption tax is coming, it should fit in with a considered plan for tax reform.

HEADLINE: Economy Looks Up, at Least for Now

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
When a blizzard gripped the East Coast in March, it took a wicked slice out of the economy and raised questions about the durability of the expansion. But as the weather has improved, consumers have been returning to stores -- and business executives and economists are breathing easier.
"Once the weather broke, they're flocking back into the stores," said Bernard Marcus, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer. 
 Judi Freni, an associate merchan
diser at London Fog Ladies Sportwear, a national chain of discount outlets, also saw an improvement. "In the last week our business has picked up dramatically," she said.
Nor are the gains limited to retailers. Car sales in early April were above early February's level. Mortgage applications remain at a high level. Weekly jobless claims have edged down. And the ABC/Money magazine poll suggests that consumer confidence has rebounded in the last month.
That is not to say that the rest of the year will continue on track.
Executives and economists alike worry that the talk of new taxes from Washington could hurt consumers' willingness to spend -- or throw even more sand into the gears of the sluggish jobs recovery. They are particularly worried that a national sales tax in the form of a value added tax would weaken consumption and that possible new mandates for employers -- like a minimal health insurance package for workers -- would drive up business costs, including the costs of hiring new workers.
"Merchants and shoppers are concerned that higher taxes would affect discretionary spending," said Mark Hunter, general manager of the Woodland Hills Mall near Tulsa, Okla.
And Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of Dayton Hudson, the department store and discount retailer based in Minneapolis, added: "We think consumers remain extremely leery, with good reason. They are being bombarded with budget news. They are being bombarded with health-care plans. Last Thursday, they were treated to the V.A.T. tax."
Nor does the improvement settle the question -- asked by Clinton Administration officials who are plugging for a public works jobs package -- of whether job gains will pick up strength.
A reliable reading on the economy's basic momentum, economists say, probably will not be available until May data start to come in. March was knocked down by bad weather. April is being affected by catch-up buying and the fact that Easter fell earlier this year than last.
The unexpected weakness in March may have reinforced feelings that the economy is still vulnerable, and could strengthen the President's hand in winning some kind of public works jobs program. At the same time, though, it could inhibit the Administration on other fronts.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has said that he will not ask for a higher minimum wage now and, according to members of the health-care-policy task force, has warned that placing too great a burden on employers could lead to even fewer jobs for younger, less skilled workers.
For now, at least, economists are concluding that consumers probably will keep spending, if cautiously, and that the basic ingredients for modest increases in spending are there.
"We won't get back to the 4 or 5 percent rate of last fall," said David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, speaking of the nation's growth rate, "but we'll grow at around a 3 percent rate when all this weather clears up."
Take income and jobs. The March drop in employment followed two months of solid gains, and the economy added twice as many jobs in the last quarter as in the fall, 713,000 vs. 297,000.
 
More Hiring Seen
 "We got a lot of output from the productivity boom at the end of last year," said David Kelly, an economist at the Boston Company. "But now, employers are biting the bullet and hiring more workers. That's generating wage income to fuel the recovery."
In the last six months, Mr. Kelly estimates, real disposable personal income has been growing at a 3.5 percent annual rate.
Then there is consumer confidence. Confidence, which zoomed after President Clinton's election, dropped sharply this winter, reversing more than a third of that rise between January and early April. But the ABC/Money magazine poll, a weekly survey that more analysts are paying attention to, suggests that consumers may be starting to feel a bit better, not so much about the economy in general, but about their own finances.
The latest reading of the poll, for the April 10-11 weekend, shows that 51 percent of the respondents rated their personal finances excellent or good -- the highest level since the mood started to darken at the beginning of the year. That was up from 43 percent a month ago
 
Home Prices Stabilize
 "Consumers feared taxes for 1992 were going to be horrendous, and it hasn't turned out to be quite as bad," said Jordon Goodman, who directs the poll for Money magazine. "A lot of people I talked to are getting refunds that they didn't think they'd get."
Consumers' balance sheets are also in slightly better shape than they were a year ago. The price of most Americans' biggest assets -- their homes -- is no longer falling. Income has been growing slightly faster than consumer installment debt. And refinancing of mortgages has put more dollars into many peoples' pockets. That has helped make consumers slightly more willing to squeeze savings and take on a bit more debt.
"Consumers have swung from being slight repayers to slight borrowers," said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
The biggest impetus for moderate increases in spending, though, is that consumers have put off buying for so long.
"The average age of a car is now 7.9 years," Mr. Kelly of the Boston Company said. "There's underlying pent-up demand."
Sales of clothing were especially strong last year, he added. "You can only go so long without new clothes," he said. "That pent-up demand surfaced strongly in 1992 even though the economic fundamentals weren't that great."
Some of that buying is already heartening merchants.
At J. C. Penney in Chicago, sales have rebounded since mid-March, said Ira Silver, a marketing manager for the store. Occupancy at the Woodland Hills Mall near Tulsa just hit 95 percent, according to Mr. Hunter, the general manager, and mall traffic has been heavy in recent weeks, he said.
 
Housing Is Optimistic
 Housing industry executives are also cautiously optimistic. "We expected housing to be very strong in February and March," said Mr. Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Bad weather kept that from happening. So we expect better-than-modest home buying activity in April and May."
Of course, all this activity is still not expected to push the economy to the 4.7 percent growth rate of the fourth quarter of last year. It is widely expected that growth this year will be closer to 3 percent.
And despite the zigs and the zags, business experts say that number is likely to hold.
"When the year is done, it will be a little better than last year but a little less good than many retailers expected," Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 22, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about signs of improvement in the economy misstated the period in which employment growth more than doubled, and the comparative period in 1992. The economy added 713,000 jobs in the six months ended March 31, compared with 297,000 jobs in the six months ended Sept. 30.

HEADLINE: Having a President to Battle With Gives Dole a New Spirit and Verve

SERIES: The Lawmakers: Portraits of the Titans Of Capitol Hill -- Fourth article
in a series.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
In this power-focused capital, an ultimate insider is finding new satisfaction in a seemingly diminished role, the minority leadership of a party suddenly thrust from power.
 After eight years of trying to serve the competing interests of two Republican Presidents and a few dozen Republican senators as the party's leader in the Senate, Bob Dole is having the time of his life. He is now in a role that really suits his personality better, the scrappy underdog challenging a popular President. 
The Senate minority leader has baffled the Clinton Administration and united the sometimes fractious Senate Republicans in opposition to the President's plan to stimulate the economy. He has already won on that fight; President Clinton's retreat to $15.5 billion from $19.5 billion on Friday was probably only the first step on a road toward a compromise that will have to be counted an Administration setback.
 
Liberation From Defeat
 One reason Mr. Dole succeeds is single-mindedness and persistence. It is no burden for him to hold one meeting after another, with the same people, on the same subject, in search of consensus.
 "Politics is his life," observed Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader. "You might be sitting at a dinner with Bob Dole and somebody might be talking about ball scores and somebody else about Washingtoniana and Bob would say: 'I think there's a primary going on in the Fifth District of California. Let's see how it's going.' "
 Under President George Bush, Mr. Dole loyally supported White House programs despite doubts about them and a bitter 1988 primary campaign when he made it clear that he considered Mr. Bush privileged and shallow. Now Mr. Bush's defeat seems to have liberated the Kansas Senator.
 Mr. Dole did tell a recent Gridiron Club dinner that Mr. Bush's 1992 campaign had gone pretty well, considering it was Dr. Jack Kevorkian's first try as a campaign manager. But the Senator's conversation is not dotted, as it once was, with class-conscious references like charges that when Ivy League colleges admitted relatives of alumni, mostly white males, they were violating the Civil Rights Act.
 The political difference between having a Republican President to support and a Democratic President to challenge is even more obvious. In opposition "you sort of get to pick your shots," Mr. Dole said last week in his Capitol office overlooking the Mall and the Washington Monument. "But if you're out there for the Administration, every day is a new bucket of water," defending programs someone else devised.
 
Personality Is Unchanged
 Now Mr. Dole can gauge Republican sentiment, and decide not to battle a widely supported family leave bill, then mount a filibuster against a less popular economic stimulus measure after Republican anger over Democratic steamroller tactics mounted.
 But if the political environment has dramatically changed, the personality of the five-term Senator has not. Mr. Dole bantered easily with hecklers in New Hampshire several times last Thursday, until one said the Senator did not care about America. Then Mr. Dole glared and, before striding off, pointed to a lapel pin of the Society of the Purple Heart, which he earned from a wound in World War II that cost him the use of his right arm.
 Last Wednesday, on the 48th anniversary of the battle in the Po Valley where he was wounded, he told fellow veterans of the Italian campaign with the 10th Mountain Division, "Maybe those of us who have been in combat or somewhere, understanding how bad it can be, can understand" the need to provide aid to bolster democracy in Russia. "It's in our interest if we want to avoid future conflicts, which may involve our children or our grandchildren."
 He talked at one stop after another about the fight against Mr. Clinton's package to stimulate the economy, insisting that Republicans would rather cut spending than add to the deficit. Today on the NBC program "Meet the Press," Mr. Dole again rejected Mr. Clinton's proposal, saying it "doesn't focus on the basic issue, which is paying for it." But he has said that in a $6 trillion economy, the money involved in the bill itself was rather inconsequential.
 Mr. Dole has never been known as a legislative innovator, but instead as one who takes his greatest pleasure in untangling snarls -- that he may have helped to create -- and saving a crucial measure, like the civil rights and unemployment bills of 1991. And in fact he talks of the fight against the economic stimulus bill as a tactical success that may help on bigger issues.
 "I hope it's a signal to the people who run the White House, not just the President, but others, that we have quite a few thoughtful people on our side," he said in the Capitol interview.
 As he continued, Mr. Dole made it clear how that signal should be read. "We thought we were going to be consulted on health care," he said, "and we haven't heard zip, not since Mrs. Clinton stood right here and talked to 35 of us" on Feb. 4.
 He made the same points whenever he was questioned on the subject as he traveled the country last week. "If ever there was one issue that cried out for bipartisan or nonpartisan consideration, it's health care," he told the Chamber of Commerce in Manchester, N.H. Health care, he told former campaign workers there, is "one of the most important issues that I've been exposed to in all the time I've been here."
 But if health legislation is something he wants to help pass, there are plenty of other measures Mr. Dole would like to block. He predicted a successful filibuster against legislation to revise campaign financing, for example, saying Democrats would write a bill to help themselves, not the country.
 He is plainly sensitive to the risk that if a bill is popular the public will see the delayers as the villains. The Administration has earnestly shouted "gridlock" about the stimulus bill, saying Republicans were thwarting efforts to create jobs. In Praise of Gridlock
 So Mr. Dole is trying to rehabilitate the word "gridlock" itself from the scorn into which it fell as a description of the inability of the Democratic Congress and the Republican President to get anything done last year. "If you're against something," he told some editors in Concord, N.H., "you'd better hope there is a little gridlock."
 In fact, Mr. Dole says he does not expect to thwart Mr. Clinton all that often, although Senate Republicans have delayed almost every bill this year for a while. "You're not going to win them all by a long shot," he said, because Republicans "don't always agree on everything." The most obvious example was the family leave bill, which Mr. Dole strongly opposed but 16 of the 43 Senate Republicans voted for.
 And there will be times, as he insisted to one audience after another, when Republicans will be providing support that Mr. Clinton cannot do without, on issues like aid to Russia or international trade.
 Then he told the Chamber of Commerce: "We're not mad at each other. We're both adults. We both understand that from time to time we'll have differences." And he said again and again that while Republicans disagreed with President Clinton "we're not trying to embarrass" him.
 Mr. Dole's national reputation for bitter comments is at odds with the sense of most senators that his humor is a useful safety valve to relieve tension. Nationally, he is remembered for speaking of "Democrat wars" in his first national campaign, for the Vice Presidency in 1976, and in 1988 for demanding that Mr. Bush and his aides stop "groveling in the mud" in attacking his wife, Elizabeth, and "stop lying about my record."
 
Humor and Honesty
 But Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah recalls that Mr. Dole's dry humor relaxed Republicans uncertain about how to proceed with questioning in the hearings involving Prof. Anita F. Hill's accusations against Judge Clarence Thomas. And Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island recalled how Mr. Dole broke up Mr. Clinton and Republicans at a caucus; the President was given a mystery novel titled "Murder in the Senate" and observed that he was troubled that the victim was a Democrat. Mr. Dole quipped, "Yes, it had a happy ending."
 His humor sometimes turns on himself, as an instinctive check. Mr. Dole was holding forth in the Senate on Inauguration Day about how Republicans had no intention of blocking Mr. Clinton's initiatives. Then, as if overcome by honesty, he added, "Except maybe once in a while."
 And at one point in his complaints about exclusion from the President's health-care task force, he reflected: "I'm trying to be objective. What would we do if we had the majority in Congress and the White House? Would we care what the other party thought? I think we might." But he then acknowledged that Republican White House aides might not.
 One consequence of his new prominence as his party's leading spokesman is a flurry of talk about his running for President in 1996, and Mr. Dole enjoyed teasing New Hampshire Republicans about it last week.
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, says Mr. Dole would be "a formidable opponent" for President Clinton. But Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dole are friends, who respect and try not to surprise each other. In fact, Mr. Dole's considerable political skills have rarely traveled well outside the singular circumstances of the Senate or audiences of highly partisan Republicans.
 
Great Strength in Senate
 But if there is little reason to think Mr. Dole can improve on his past performance as a national candidate, there is little doubt of his strength in the Senate. Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, a less conservative Republican than Mr. Dole on most issues though a firebrand on the economic stimulus bill, nominated him for the leadership after the 1984 election and said, "Bob Dole has soul." Last week Mr. Danforth said Mr. Dole was "not a bomb thrower; he's a legislator."
 In the Bush Administration, Mr. Dole was often caught between conservatives who wanted to fight the President from one side and moderates who were dissatisfied from the other, though it was the conservatives who gave him the most trouble.
 But none of them are complaining these days.
 Senate Republicans are surprised to be so united and so effective. For, as Mr. Dole says, under the Senate rules, which require 60 votes to shut off debate, "As long as we have 41 standing together, they can't pass anything."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Radio Station Consolidation Threatens Small Operators

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
In the seven months since the Federal Communications Commission eased regulations to allow a single owner to buy up to four radio stations in one metropolitan area, 730 stations, or nearly 7 percent of the industry, have signed deals that will lead to ownership changes.
The consolidation set off by relaxing the ownership rules is likely to reduce the number of owners among the nation's 9,700 stations by 25 percent or more by 1994, industry experts estimate. 
 "If it unfolds to its natural conclusion, it will be an industry of haves and have-nots," said Dan Duman, president of York Street Partners, an investment banking firm that specializes in media deals. "Mom and pop broadcasters will be forced to sell."
Broadcasters have pressed for years for liberalized ownership rules, noting the many stations in distress. Since 1982, competition for advertisers has heated up, as the Government granted broadcasting licenses to 1,700 more stations and as cable television became a greater rival for both audiences and advertising dollars.
Radio industry revenue fell 3 percent in 1991, to $8.6 billion, the first decline in more than a decade. Nearly 59 percent of stations were unprofitable in 1991, according to the most recent figures available from the National Association of Broadcasters.
 
One Owner Can Have 36 Stations
 The new rules permit a station owner to have 18 AM and 18 FM stations, including 2 of each in a single market. Previously, an owner could have no more than 12 AM stations and 12 FM stations nationwide, with only one of each in a single market.
Proponents of the changes say listeners will benefit as economies of scale return financial vigor to stations, which can then afford more public-service programming and music aimed at niche audiences.
"The business dictated these changes," said Richard Blackburn, president of Blackburn & Company, a radio broker in Washington. "When revenue declined, even while the economy was healthy, new entrants in markets undersold each other and led to a downward spiral." He said that one of his clients, who owns a classical music station, had told him, "I'm a niche player, and if I don't get bigger, I'm going to go away."
It is also likely, however, that industry employment will shrink and that small broadcasters will be squeezed out. Some critics have opposed the changes for fear that broadcast mergers, by reducing the diversity of ownership, will reduce viewpoints and programming choices.
Bill Shearer, owner of KGFJ-AM in Los Angeles and former chairman of the National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said most of the owners who are members of minority groups might find themselves at risk. The association's members own 160 stations, many of them poorly financed and with weak signals; if deals are done, they are more likely to be targets than buyers.
And Mr. Shearer said that he feared the new owners would be large, white-owned companies with little taste for black radio formats. "Fear is lack of knowledge," he said. "They will back away from urban music."
But radio executives say that programming at their newly acquired stations has largely been left untouched, while savings are coming from cuts among a station's average work force, usually about 20 employees. General managers, business managers, bookkeepers and receptionists typically are the first to get pink slips.
 
Group Owners Take the Lead
 As expected, broadcasting groups are leading the way in buying stations, making deals that would not have been permitted before the rules took effect in September.
For example, Shamrock Broadcasting, based in Burbank, Calif., has agreed to acquire the Malrite Communications Group of Cleveland in a stock swap valued at $300 million. The merger will be the industry's largest, and Shamrock's holdings will jump to 21 stations from 14. The company will own two stations each on AM and FM frequencies in San Francisco alone.
Most group owners are scrambling to double their AM-FM holdings in markets where they own a property. Many of the marriages stem from the exercise of option-to-buy clauses granted by hard-pressed broadcasters, who have effectively leased their stations to other operators under so-called local marketing agreements.
Such deals were unheard of three years ago, but now about 250 exist, according to Radio Business Report, a trade publication based in Springfield, Va.
 
Economies of Scale
 Established broadcasters say they achieve several objectives by pairing stations. They can consolidate operations, reduce costs, increase market share and typically increase advertising rates.
In a no-cash deal worth about $15 million, Viacom International Inc., based in New York, and Noble Broadcasting of San Diego, swapped stations in Seattle and Denver. Viacom's KDSG-FM in Seattle catered to adults 35 to 55 years old, with oldies music. Now it is paired with Noble's former station, KNDD-FM, known as the End, which plays modern rock with appeal to 18- to 34-year-olds.
"That gives us a real nice spread," said William Figenshu, president of Viacom's radio group. "It allows us to build market share to a completely separate market. We had no shot at beer or soft-drink money; now we do."
In Salt Lake City, Apollo Radio Ltd. merged KALL AM-FM, bought from the Communications Investment Corporation for $1.8 million in January, with its market-leading FM country station KKAT. Apollo estimates $1 million in annual cost savings.
"KALL did very little community involvement," said William Stakelin, president of Apollo, which now has 10 stations. "They didn't have the resources to do anything but stay on the air. When we are buying a second facility, we want to make it more successful. We don't go into any of these deals to strip them of their services."
Dana Horner, Apollo's Salt Lake City general manager, said the merger of KKAT with KALL's AM talk and FM oldies stations resulted in 37 job cuts. But the stations' combined 16 percent market share gave it new airwave-power allure.
"Larry King Live" was added. So was headline news from a local network TV affiliate. And a request for a KKAT promotion by a March of Dimes executive led to an unsought chat on KALL's AM morning show. "These are things that don't normally happen," Mr. Horner said.
Not surprisingly, one company's ownership of two AM or two FM stations is not popular among some advertising agencies. Kaye Bentley, a buyer of radio time for DDB Needham in Los Angeles, told participants in a Southern California Broadcasters Association seminar last month that the mergers rob advertisers of flexibility and present them with "must" buys.
And as combined stations end up with a single news director, that individual's biases will influence a larger audience, warned Andrew Schwartzman, director of the Media Access Project, a public interest group in Washington. Of the 70 dual-ownership deals approved, he could cite no specific example, however. "I'm sadly confident they are coming," Mr. Schwartzman said.
Ken Costa of the Radio Advertising Bureau said group owners were unlikely to try to cut costs by using the same broadcast on several stations. "Programming is what keeps them in the race," he said. "Syndicated material will never dominate our industry like television; stations want local flavor."

HEADLINE: John Kluge Gives Columbia $60 Million to Aid Minorities

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
John W. Kluge, the chairman of the Metromedia Company and a 1937 graduate of Columbia University, presented his alma mater last night with $60 million for minority scholarships. It is the largest gift the university has ever received.
In making his gift, Mr. Kluge recalled what a hardship it was for him to afford his tuition -- only $500 a year at the time -- when he was earning $7 a week working in the school dining hall. Fortunately for him, he said, Columbia helped by giving him a scholarship. 
 "Columbia made a difference really in my life and I really want to assure that it will continue to make a difference for others," Mr. Kluge said in an interview from his office in Manhattan. At 78, Mr. Kluge, who made his fortune building up a string of radio and television stations, is one of the wealthiest people in America.
By itself, the $60 million donation is believed to be the fifth largest to any university or college. When added to the $50 million Mr. Kluge already donated to Columbia in two previous gifts, it would be second only to the $125 million pledged to Louisiana State University in 1981 by Claude B. Pennington.
One of Mr. Kluge's two previous gifts of $25 million, presented in 1987, was also for minority scholarships and the other, in 1990, went to aid young scholars and junior faculty members.
The new gift comes at a critical time as Columbia battles serious fiscal problems. With its $1 billion operating budget, the university has a $15 million deficit this year and is working to cut costs to balance its budget for next year.
 
Luring Minority Candidates
 But officials of the university said it was unclear whether the gift, because it was specifically for scholarships for undergraduates, would have any impact on the deficit.
The gift would, they said, help the university attract minority candidates who might otherwise go to other universities better able to help them with steep college costs.
Fred Knubel, a spokesman for Columbia, said last night that the gift would provide at least 300 students a year with grants of $10,000. Mr. Knubel said that the money would be used in the form of an endowment, and that its interest would go to help minority students selected for admission.
The university has a "need-blind admissions policy," dating back to the 1960's, which means that qualified students are admitted without regard to their ability to pay. The university then provides financial aid to all those who need it.
About 36 percent of the 3,422 students at Columbia College, the undergraduate school, are members of minority groups. Of the 862 students in this year's freshmen class at Columbia College, 421 receive some sort of financial aid, officials said.
Mr. Kluge (pronounced KLOO-ghee), who was named the richest American by Forbes magazine in 1989, '90 and '91, said he was not interested in having buildings named after him.
"I'd rather do something for human minds than for a monument," he said. "It's been offered to me time and again, not only at Columbia but at other colleges, but I'm not interested in having my name on a building. "This is really what this fund is about, for minority students who would ordinarily not be able to go to school," he said.
When he was asked why he particularly wants to benefit minority students through, Mr. Kluge answered simply: "I think the need is there. In my small way, I'm addressing that need."
 
Started With a Radio Station
 Mr. Kluge, who was born in Chemnitz, Germany, came to the United States when he was 8 years old. He has admitted to interviewers that he is as surprised as anyone that his financial gambits brought him from a poor upbringing in Detroit to the head of a company that is one of the largest private concerns in the nation.
Mr. Kluge served in Army Intelligence during World War II, and afterward bought a radio station and formed Metromedia. Eventually, he bought a string of radio and television stations that no one else seemed to believe were profitable, but he usually made money.
In later years, Mr. Kluge continued to amass a fortune, buying billboard companies, the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ice Capades and the Bonanza and Steak & Ale restaurant chains among other businesses. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Mr. Kluge was worth $5.5 billion.
 
Known for Generosity
 Known for his generosity to other causes, Mr. Kluge delighted especially in timing his gift so he could announce it last night during a tribute to his friend Michael I. Sovern, who is stepping down as Columbia's president June 30.
Mr. Sovern, who was somewhat surprised by the gift, said he too was thrilled. "He really did want to give me a nice send off, God bless him," he said.
Historically, according to information from the university's Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Columbia has had the highest percentage of students on financial aid of any of the Ivy League universities.
Mr. Sovern said that dwindling Federal and state aid to education, coupled with the huge tuition increases that the university -- like many others -- has had to impose, has made it more difficult for some students to pay for a Columbia education.
 
About $24,000 a Year
 Tuition is $16,514 a year, and tuition, room and board and other incidentals bring the cost of a year at Columbia to about $24,000 per student.
When Columbia offered him a scholarship in 1933, Mr. Kluge recalled yesterday, he had offers from other colleges, and he did not believe he could afford Columbia with the amount they were offering. So he decided he would be aggressive, he recalled, and asked them to double the scholarship.
Columbia officials agreed, and four years later, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics.
"I really had no money at all," he said about those days.
"I guess taking the $50 million I already gave them, and doubling it is the basis in kind," he said. "They doubled my scholarship so I'll double theirs."

HEADLINE: New Country Is Like Prison to Asenhat, 18

SERIES: Children of the Shadows: The eighth of ten lives of the cities.

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Asenhat Gomez used to peer out the windows of her childhood home in the Dominican countryside and relish a landscape of willowy palm trees and verdant fields where her extended family would gather for daylong reunions.
In her new home in Brooklyn -- a cramped apartment on Williamsburg's South Side -- the windows frame a claustrophobic vista of brick walls, and the few relatives she has in this country are so preoccupied with making ends meet that family get-togethers seem as long gone as the father who died a dozen years ago. 
 It has been nearly a year since Asenhat was reunited with her mother, who six years before had left her children with their aunt and illegally entered the United States in search of the opportunities that had eluded the family in the Dominican Republic.
 
Longing for Home
 But the immigrant journey of Asenhat Gomez is only beginning. For 18-year-old Asenhat, the joys of reunion are constantly tempered by the struggles of life in a hard new land. Hundreds of miles from all that was familiar, unable to shake her longing for home, she tentatively ventures into a future that beckons with equal measures of promise and fear.
In many ways, hers is the oldest of immigrant stories, played out time and again by wave after wave of newcomers to America's shores. But for today's immigrant children, in places like Williamsburg, that process of adjustment is made all the more difficult by the modern plagues of drugs, guns and recession.
Asenhat, a shy girl, has become even shyer since arriving last May, the strangeness and the frustrations coalescing in a sometimes overwhelming feeling that she is trapped.
 
'Sense of Confinement'
 "Everybody talked about the sense of confinement," she said recently, recalling her first weeks in New York. "I expected that, but just not so much.
"Lying in bed I would think about what I left behind. There you got accustomed to visiting people, my friends from school, since we were infants. The whole place was different; you could go out to play. I miss my school."
Williamsburg -- its bumpy narrow streets lined with age-worn two-family homes and apartment buildings closed in by the shadows of hulking waterfront factories and the Williamsburg Bridge -- can seem forbidding to someone used to the easy freedom of the countryside. The family's two small bedrooms are shared by six people who subsist on meager earnings.
Still, even as she bridles at her confinement, it has become her defense mechanism in a city whose ways and language are not her own. She seldom ventures beyond her neighborhood, partly from fear of getting lost on unexplored streets and subway lines and partly from fear of drug dealing and violent crime on nearby blocks.
"It makes you feel insecure," said Asenhat, a short girl whose floppy ponytail and baggy jeans give her the look of someone just entering her teen-age years. "You can be going down the street and not know what can happen."
She has few friends, feeling that she has little in common with American-born teen-agers, who she says are too "liberal" -- so preoccupied with boyfriends, clothes and the latest fads that they squander the opportunities available to them.
She has tried, and failed for lack of English, to find a job. Even her hopes for improving the family's lot through education are in limbo. An honor student who breezed through high school and a year of premedical studies in the Dominican Republic, she plans to continue her studies at Hunter College in Manhattan. But she has been forced to sit out a year while she learns English and qualifies for financial aid.
In her own reticent way, Asenhat (pronounced ah-seh-NET) will admit to a certain disappointment with her new life. "It's been more difficult than I thought," she says. And while she allows that "there are more opportunities here," she is quick to add that "there, people looked out for you."
Still, she resolutely hews to the immigrant dream.
"After a while I'll feel better," she said. "Especially after I learn English. After I begin school. I like to study, and that's the best way to progress."
 
Death on a Farm
 Asenhat Gomez was born in the countryside near Moca -- a farming community in the Cibao region of the Dominican Republic -- where her family owned a comfortable three-bedroom house, with a big yard filled with fruit trees, on land where her father and uncles grew plantains and cassava.
She still recalls how on weekends, her father, Vicente, would take her and her friends to fairs or for a cool ice cream, or how they would all gather with relatives to spend the day eating, talking and playing.
But there were hints of darker times ahead, she said; her father suffered from depression that seemed to feed on itself.
"When he got sick with that problem, he would get depressed because he could not work," she said. "He went into a clinic."
 
'There Was No Other Way'
 When Asenhat was nearly 6, he accidentally shot himself to death while cleaning a pistol, the family says. She was in the room when it happened. She talks little about it.
With three children and no husband, Asenhat's mother, Esperanza, tried in vain to keep the family afloat, getting money and food from her in-laws. But seven years ago, she took the children to her sister's house, told them she was going to take a nursing course in a nearby city and slipped off on a nine-day journey through Guatemala, Mexico and California and finally to New York.
"There was no other way," she says now. "A mother does it only thinking of her children."
Working as a live-in maid in Brooklyn, she would send money back home, promising to send for the children as soon as she had legal residency, which happened last year.
Esperanza had told them some of what they could expect, but she knew, too, that her advice could go only so far.
"Talking about it," she said, "is very different from living it and seeing it."
 
Arrival
Disappointment,
4 Flights Up
Asenhat had barely arrived in New York last May when the disappointment hit. In her new home four flights up a dimly lighted stairway, she and her 20-year-old brother, Harold, shared a bedroom with their sister, Amalia, 14, who had preceded them to America by several months. Her mother slept in the bedroom off the kitchen with her new husband, Jose Aybar, and their 3-year-old daughter, Josephine.
"This house looked so strange to me," Asenhat said. "It was so confining, such a big building with so many people and such little apartments."
Life inside the apartment, with her new family, was strained. At first, Josephine would jealously cry "Mami mia!" whenever Asenhat approached her mother. Relations with her stepfather have remained cool.
"He is almost illiterate," she said. "We don't have that much in common." They barely speak.
"I would like to talk about my dreams," she said. "Sometimes I miss my father a lot because he was close to us. He was very caring, very sweet with us."
 
'I Don't Go Out Alone'
 For a while, however estranged she felt, fear of what lay outside, of being speechless in an English-speaking city, kept her imprisoned in the apartment. She spent her days reading the Bible or absent-mindedly watching television. She lost weight.
"There are no places for people to go around here," she said. "I don't go to the park. I don't go out alone."
While her block is relatively calm, the surrounding streets have seen an increase in drug dealing and violence. There was a shooting at her sister's school. Sometimes, she hears gunshots at night.
She remembers how in Moca, gunshots were sometimes heard ringing out in celebration of some holidays. "Here," she said, "it's not because people are happy."
The one solo venture she made early on -- to enroll in a summer youth program -- ended in tears in Bushwick after she couldn't speak English with the person taking her application, who angrily shouted at her. Her frustration and fear only increased when she wandered outside and quickly got lost.
"I was scared to ask for directions because I didn't think anyone spoke Spanish," she said. Finally, she got up enough courage to ask a Spanish-speaking passer-by.
"He said I was lost," she said. "I knew that."
Even now, her daily schedule is an unwavering routine played out within six blocks of home: a noontime visit to her mother's job, English classes, several hours at a local youth center and back home to her family.
Asenhat's confinement can be as much emotional as physical, made worse by being sidetracked in her schooling. While her parents were never able to go to college, they wanted to make sure their children would. Asenhat's belief in the bedrock American value of success through education seems absolute. When she talks about becoming a doctor, "a professional," her face brightens and she sits up a little prouder.
Both Asenhat and her brother Harold -- who studied civil engineering and worked in a medical laboratory in Santo Domingo but now works six days a week at a bodega -- plan to attend the City University of New York. But they have had to wait a year to qualify as New York City residents for the cheaper tuition and to learn English.
The only studying she does now is in her daily English class at the Brooklyn Public Library, where her afternoons are filled with children's songs and dialogues.
"It's like being little again," she said of the class, though she might have been describing the entire humbling experience of learning English.
Asenhat also realizes that while the constant presence of Spanish in her neighborhood makes it easier to adjust, it makes it harder, too.
"It's more difficult to learn English here because everybody speaks Spanish," she said. "If you hear more English, your ears get used to it faster."
A few nights ago, Asenhat slowed down as she approached her building, where two boys boxed playfully. As she got nearer, one of the boys smoothly pulled out a knife, opened it and feinted a slash at his friend. She barely blinked as she sweetly asked them if they had a key to the wrought-iron lobby door that always is locked.
After 11 months in Brooklyn, she still finds it hard to decipher the rituals of her American-born counterparts.
"For me the most important thing is to study," she said. "For them it's boyfriends, going places and buying clothes. That doesn't matter to me. A person's worth isn't what they wear, but what they are and how they feel."
Her friends at home, she insists, were different. "We were more united over there," she said. "I think sometimes that those who grew up here are more superficial. There may be more opportunities here, but over there people looked out for you."
Even the people she meets at El Puente, a youth center two blocks from her home, don't always understand what she is going through. Some don't even understand her language, although they are children of Hispanic parents. Her closest friends are Lilin Fong and Danilda Torres, both of whom came from the Dominican Republic several years ago.
The three are active in a natural healing class at El Puente, and they often sit together, chatting in Spanish. Lilin thinks Asenhat is adapting as well as she can.
"I used to count the days I had been here," she said. "I knew the hour I arrived."
Asenhat nodded. "I count the months, too," she said. "I wanted to return home." She lowered her voice. "Sometimes I still feel like going."
 
Dona Mercedes
Dispensing Advice
To 'Daughters'
Good thing Mercedes Mendez didn't hear that. The last time Asenhat revealed her homesickness, Dona Mercedes -- as she is known to all -- looked at her as if she were insane. "Don't even think of going back!" she scolded. "You have to be with your mother."
Each day, Asenhat passes by Dona Mercedes's apartment for lunch and a brief visit with her mother, who works as a home attendant caring for the 71-year-old Puerto Rican woman. Dona Mercedes, who walks stiffly because of knee replacement surgery a dozen years ago, busily looks after Asenhat, calling her "one of my adopted daughters."
Dona Mercedes is one of several women who have rallied around Asenhat, intent on making sure that nothing keeps her from her goals. Dona Mercedes, who came to the mainland in 1946 and worked for years packing tomatoes and cooking for the field hands on a New Jersey farm, often regales her with tales of how hard her life was when she arrived. She cautions her against talking to strangers or following the crowd.
 
Mother's Worries
 "Most of all, take care of your virginity," Dona Mercedes admonished. "Don't wander off with boys; you can get easily lost out there."
Esperanza nodded in agreement. But far from worrying that her daughter will be led astray by friends, she frets that she spends too much time alone.
She also wishes Asenhat would be a little more accepting of her new husband, who, she says, has had a hard enough time coping with his extended unemployment and his mother's illness.
Asenhat would like to get a job, to help the family out. She has looked a few times, to no avail.
"She talks about work, anything she can do," said Cecilia Figueroa, a health coordinator at El Puente. "But there's not much she can do with no language and no experience. She doesn't have anything."
Esperanza says she only wants her daughter to keep striving toward her goal of becoming a doctor. To help her learn English, she is buying her a $950 set of language cassettes, on the installment plan.
"There are few mothers who would do what Esperanza did," said Dona Mercedes. "She's only had God's help."
And the help of Esperanza's sister, Mirope Ortiz-Lisardo, who took in the three children when she came to the United States. Asenhat is so close to her aunt that she calls her "Mami," and after almost a year apart, she could barely contain her glee during Mirope's recent visit.
When it came time to leave, on a bitter-cold Saturday, the house grew quiet. Mrs. Ortiz-Lisardo walked up to Asenhat and reached out to her. They hugged, gazing into each other's eyes. A kiss, another hug, and then her aunt stepped into the hallway and began her journey back to the friends and places in the homeland her niece had left behind.
Quietly, Asenhat flopped onto the couch and sank into a corner, clutching her sister's talking teddy bear. Her mother sat next to her and stroked her arm. The girl shook her head when asked if she was sad.
Asenhat hugged the toy, and its voice broke the silence.
"Dream with me," the bear sang in tinny, electronic tones.
She hugged it tighter.
"Dream with me."

HEADLINE: Vietnam Report on Prisoners A Fake, Reputed Author Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, April 19

 BODY:
A Vietnamese general denied today that he had written in 1972 that Hanoi held more than twice as many American prisoners as it ultimately released. Any such report attributed to Hanoi is a forgery, he declared.
And a special envoy, sent by President Clinton to tell the Vietnamese that relations could not improve until the matter was cleared up, said he saw no reason to disbelieve the Vietnamese denial. 
 Nearly two weeks ago, Russian archivists turned over to the United States a Russian translation of what was said to be a secret report to Hanoi's Politburo given by Gen. Tran Van Quang, described in the document as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese armed forces at the time. The document said Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners of war in September 1972.
 
591 Released in 1973
 Because Vietnam released only 591 prisoners in 1973 and has maintained repeatedly that there were no other prisoners, the Russian translation raised the recurring question of whether Hanoi had kept some prisoners back, and if so, what happened to them. An alternative explanation offered by some experts was that Hanoi might have killed hundreds of prisoners.
Hanoi immediately denied the accuracy of the Russian document, saying it was a "fabrication."
In a meeting today, General Quang told President Clinton's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., that he did not write the 1972 report on which the Russian translation was supposedly based. If the Vietnamese report exists, General Quang said, it is a forgery that may have been prepared by someone interested "in undermining advances in relations between Vietnam and the United States."
At a news conference today after meeting with General Vessey, General Quang said of the 1972 report: "I did not write it. I tell you, never in my life have I made such a report, because it was not in my area of responsibility."
He stressed that although he was Deputy Chief of Staff on two occasions, he was not serving in that post in September 1972 as the document states.
General Vessey, after meeting with General Quang and other senior Vietnamese officials, said he had new doubts about the accuracy of the Russian translation.
The general, a retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his own news conference in Hanoi: "I don't think that one can draw conclusions about the document simply based on General Quang's statements, but I would say that what General Quang has told us is not inconsistent with what we know about General Quang. I have no reason to disbelieve General Quang."
Asked whether he had new doubts about the accuracy of the document, General Vessey replied simply, "Yes."
[But the Harvard-based researcher who discovered the Russian document said in a telephone interview from Watertown, Mass., that he thought General Quang was lying.]
 
Given 'Important' Documents
 General Vessey said Vietnamese officials provided him with "important" documents this week "that may well shed light on the Russian document, at least they appear to, first blush."
The general and American investigators in Hanoi do not question the authenticity of the Russian translation, saying they believe that it is a genuine Russian archival document. Instead, they question whether it was prepared by a competent Russian-Vietnamese translator, and whether the Vietnamese document on which it was based was authentic.
Vietnamese officials have said this week that they are concerned that the documents and the dispute over their authenticity will prevent the Clinton Administration from lifting an 18-year-old economic embargo on Vietnam and will further delay billions of dollars in development loans for Hanoi from the World Bank and other international lending agencies.
 
Issue Linked to Relations
 Mr. Clinton, who is expected to meet with General Vessey when the general returns to Washington on Wednesday, has said he will not move to normalize diplomatic and economic ties with Vietnam until he is convinced that Hanoi is cooperating fully in determining the fate of more than 600 missing Americans.
In a joint statement, General Vessey and Hanoi officials said the Vietnamese documents turned over to American investigators include "archives listing American prisoners of war held during the war, as well as American servicemen who died in captivity in southern and central Vietnam."
On Sunday, the Vietnamese said they had given General Vessey an official Vietnamese Defense Ministry census prepared in the early 1970's stating that only 386 American prisoners had been captured by North Vietnam between April 1964 and February 1972.
American officials traveling with General Vessey said it might never be possible to prove or disprove the accuracy of the Russian translation and the authenticity of the 1972 Vietnamese report. But they said they were struck by discrepancies between information in the Russian translation and what is known about General Quang and his military career.
The Russian archives did not include a copy of the original Vietnamese document on which the translation was supposedly based, but the Russian translation lists General Quang as the Deputy Chief of Staff in September 1972.
According to official biographies published in Vietnam last year, before the Russian document became public, General Quang served in 1972 as a regional military commander in provinces in central Vietnam. He did serve as Deputy Chief of Staff twice, from 1959 to 1960 and from 1974 to 1978, but not in 1972.
"I was not in Hanoi at that time," said General Quang, who is now the director of a Vietnamese veterans' association. "I was never in charge of American prisoners of war. It's that simple and plain."
Asked who might have been responsible for fabricating the document, he replied, "You can ask the Russian intelligence services."
 
Researcher Attacked
 At the news conference with General Vessey, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam attacked the Harvard-based researcher, Stephen J. Morris, who found the Russian document during a search of the Communist Party archives in January.
"I would like to say something about Stephen Morris, the person who publicized this," Mr. Cam said. "He has a long history of opposing Vietnam, since the time he was an Australian student." Mr. Morris, he said, had taken part in "anti-Vietnam groups" in the United States.
The Foreign Minister said he believed that Mr. Morris, a researcher for the Harvard Center for International Affairs who is now working on a book about the Vietnam War, "had certain intentions when he chose the timing" of releasing the Russian document. The translation became public in the United States only days after news reports suggested that Mr. Clinton was prepared to move quickly to improve ties with Vietnam.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
A Liar, Researcher Says
 WASHINGTON, April 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- Mr. Morris, the researcher who discovered the Russian document, challenged General Quang's truthfulness as well as the Vietnamese Foreign Minister's comments.
"I think he's lying," he said of General Quang in a telephone interview from Watertown, Mass. "I think there's a Vietnamese copy in Moscow in the files of the G.R.U. I've got the only Russian-language copy, which is copy No. 6, which means there are five other copies floating around somewhere, and the original."
Told of Foreign Minister Cam's comments about him, Mr. Morris, an Australian, said: "I have a history of opposing the Communist Party of Vietnam, but not the people of Vietnam. I've always believed that South Vietnam would be better off under a non-Communist government."
He added that he does not oppose normalization of relations with Hanoi but believes that it should occur after a full accounting of missing Americans and after Vietnam stops what he called its interference in Cambodian affairs.

HEADLINE: Dredging Stays Mired In a Debate Over Dioxin

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 19

 BODY:
Dioxin is the most virulent industrial poison to date, or maybe it's not. It can destroy entire marine species, infect humans, make the Atlantic Coast unfit for swimming and destroy the fishing and tourism industries, or maybe it can't.
But even in small quantities -- 10 parts per trillion -- it has embroiled a half-dozen state and Federal agencies, a variety of environmental groups, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a divided Congressional delegation from New Jersey in a debate that shows no signs of ending. 
 There is, however, agreement on one point: It has been rough going throughout the process that began with the Port Authority's application on April 11, 1990, to dredge container-ship berths in Newark Bay and dump the muck in the ocean.
Until then, dredging had been an annual rite, a necessity to remove silt accumulation. Without it, ships will have to call elsewhere, threatening the port's 200,000 jobs and $20 billion in annual business. But environmentalists fear that while ocean dumping might save port jobs it could devastate industries like tourism and fishing.
"I start with the assumption that no regulatory process should be allowed to take three years," said Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority. "Prima facie, this is a process that has to be re-examined and retooled and recreated."
With so much time elapsed, there is finally room for hindsight as to how the agencies became mired in the dispute:
*No national standards exist for dioxin contamination in the ocean, so the regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency set about to determine them for this case. The initial threshold for contamination was later made more stringent, leading to more testing and more delays. There is still debate about how the tests were done and whether the E.P.A.'s findings adequately protect both marine life and human health.
*The Corps of Engineers had done considerable research on safe ways to dump contaminants in the ocean, but nothing specifically for dioxin. Environmentalists raised questions about whether dioxin-tainted muck could be effectively kept from spreading across the ocean floor.
*Over the last 36 months, advances in the precision of technology resulted in continual refinement of the scientific data on which regulators, environmentalists and the port were basing their decisions. In other words, the numbers kept changing, often in ways that led the environmental lobby to challenge the regulators.
For the port, the issue seemed straightforward. It asked to deepen about half the 62 berths at its Newark/Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Newark Bay, the harbor's prime container-ship port.
 
No Permit Yet
 But dioxin, a byproduct in the manufacture of the notorious herbicide Agent Orange, was found in the sediment, having leaked long ago from the shuttered Diamond Shamrock plant in Newark, a Superfund cleanup site upstream on the Passaic River.
To date, there is no permit for the dredging. The Corps of Engineers, the only agency authorized to allow the dredging, awaits results of a final review by the National Marine Fisheries Service on the effect dumping might have on endangered species of whales and sea turtles that migrate in or near the dump site, six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J.
The E.P.A., in retesting ordered this year, recently determined that the dioxin level in silt in some berths is within acceptable limits for dumping. If the fisheries service has no problems, presumably the Corps of Engineers would grant the permit, perhaps by the end of the month.
But environmentalists hold out hope that they can pressure Gov. Jim Florio to halt the dredging, which he has the authority to do under an amendment to the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act.
A spokesman for the Governor, Jon Shure, said Mr. Florio would contemplate no action until the regulatory process had run its course. In any event, it is hard to see how the Governor could avoid political risk. If he fails to intervene, he alienates the environmentalists whose cause he has historically defended. If he seeks to ban dumping, he alienates labor at the port. The dispute has already divided the state's Congressional delegation, with northerners, citing the economy, backing the port, and southerners, citing coastal concerns, calling for alternatives to dumping.
 
'A Crisis Waiting to Happen'
 "This was a crisis waiting to happen," said Sarah Clark, staff scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, "because the science of testing and the evaluating system has only recently started to catch up to the regulatory process."
Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, a group based in Sandy Hook, N.J., that promotes tourism and environmental matters, said: "There seems to be no clear authority out there on ocean disposal. And the political situation is that they've cut the issue, jobs versus the environment. What we're saying is that you don't need to make the choice, that there are alternatives, that it is a win-win situation."
The environmental groups favor building containment islands for the dredged material or segregating the material on barges or ships until an effective and economical means of decontamination becomes available. The Port Authority contends that the cost for this would be exorbitant, and that finding space for ships or containment islands would be difficult.
Col. Thomas A. York, the district engineer for the Army Corps of Engineers, said: "You get to a point of frustration covering the same issues so many times. That's the wrong approach."
Speaking of the concerns of environmental groups, which have complained that the Corps of Engineers had excluded them from meaningful participation, Colonel York said, "It's easy to armchair quarterback, but open forums would have been a much healthier environment."
Mr. Brezenoff said: "This process is set up with many players, each of whom operates independently. That's by design. Maybe it needs to be more collaborative. Maybe the Congress has to take a look at the regulations it established."
There is a hint of change. William J. Muszynski, acting regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, is organizing a forum for regulators as well as labor and environmental groups to examine issues that came up in the dredging dispute.

HEADLINE: Italians Support Political Reform By a Big Margin

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, April 19

 BODY:
After months of scandal, recession and Government paralysis, Italians voted overwhelmingly for political change in a referendum on Sunday and today that repudiated the country's leadership of the last 48 years, but that left the future uncertain.
Final computer projections late tonight, 10 hours after polls closed, showed 82 percent of voters endorsing a proposal to scrap the current system of pure proportional representation for most of the Senate and replace it with the majority voting used in other parts of Europe and the United States. 
 The magnitude of the vote is expected to put heavy pressure on legislators to enact similar changes in the lower house, or Chamber of Deputies.
The ballot had assumed the proportions of a popular judgment on Italy's postwar political system, and the result was widely interpreted as a mandate for a new government to press through broader electoral reform.
That, in turn, would set a political calendar for new elections -- and thus a fresh start -- after a debilitating corruption scandal that has tainted much of the political and business elite and exposed ties between some government leaders and the Mafia.
While some of Italy's traditional parties, notably the Christian Democrats and the former Communists, would probably survive the process of reform, many smaller parties and the discredited Socialists are seen as likely to fall by the wayside.
Within minutes of the first projections, the same politicians that had been rebuked by the referendum results fell into their characteristic bickering, promising not so much renewal as a repetition of the feuding and horse-trading that has stymied Parliament for months.
Under Italian law, referendums may abrogate legislation and suggest new laws. But it is up to the Parliament itself to enact the replacement legislation within 70 days.
The referendum thus means that Italy's Parliament must begin framing laws that will automatically mean its dissolution, an unsavory prospect for many in a discredited legislature who are certain to lose their seats in new elections under new laws.
As the results emerged, Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, the Socialist head of a collapsing four-party coalition, visited President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to begin the process of resignation and to explain "the reasons he considers his Government's mission to be exhausted," a presidential statement said.
He is expected to go before Parliament this week to debate the Government's future before finally resigning. Before the referendum, Mr. Amato had indicated he was prepared to head an interim administration, but today it seemed his own party had disowned him and it was unclear who the next Prime Minister might be.
Giorgio Benvenuto, the Socialist Party Secretary General, was asked on television whether he favored a second term for Mr. Amato or a new government. "I'd say a new government," he replied. "Repeat performances don't usually last long."
Well before the final results, politicians began staking out widely divergent interpretations of the referendum's significance. "We are heading for a phase of political confrontation," said Sergio Garavini, head of the small, hard-line Communist Refounding and a loser in the referendum.
Former President Francesco Cossiga declared, "It will be chaos."
Supporters of the referendum, especially Mario Segni, a particularly reform-minded former Christian Democrat, reacted to the preliminary results with jubilation. Hundreds of people, playing guitars and drinking wine, gathered in Piazza Navona in Rome and other public places across the country to celebrate the yes vote, which far exceeded the reform movement's expectations.
"Today is the first real act Italians have made in rebuilding," Mr. Segni told reporters. "Let us leave the divisions of the past behind us and build a great future."
The result greatly enhanced his personal status because he is closely identified with the effort to force the authorities to hold the referendum, and some commentators said he could become Prime Minister.
Although he does not have a formal political party to support him, he heads a cross-party committee formed three years ago to promote a referendum and reform. "I was not the winner; neither was the committee," he said today. "The Italians were the winners."
The referendum on electoral reform was by far the most important of eight ballots held in the last two days. The others called for changes including softer punishment for personal drug abuse and the scrapping of government financing for political parties.
All eight referendums were approved.
The most contested was the referendum on drug abuse, which scraped through by some 55 percent. The least challenged question, sliding in with 90 percent yes votes, was the vote removing government subsidies from the country's disgraced political parties.
The results showed a high average turnout of more than 75 percent of Italy's 47.5 million voters, although the number of people voting in the north, the electoral fief of the reform-minded Northern League, seemed markedly higher than in the Mafia-dominated south, where the Christian Democrats have long held sway through the politics of patronage.
 
Billions in Bribes
 The leader of the Northern League, Umberto Bossi, a clear winner from the vote, took the result as a triumph for his brand of federalist reform. "The will to change has triumphed," he declared in Milan. "The people have triumphed. Courage has triumphed. The League has triumphed. Now people understand what federalism means."
For its supporters, the referendum on electoral reform represented a historic turning point 48 years to the day after Italy's existing political system took root.
It was on April 18, 1945, that the Christian Democrats took power in Italy's first Government after World War II to become permanent dominant figures in the country's politics as 51 frail coalitions followed one after the other.
The Christian Democrats dominated all of them, but, in national elections a year ago, their popularity, built on a broad anti-Communist platform, slipped, eroded by the end of the cold war and the sense among Italians that the political system no longer worked.
Since then, a widening kickback scandal has discredited most of the country's traditional political elite as investigators have uncovered a vast web of illicit deals between politicians and businessmen trading public works contracts for bribes totaling sums that reportedly run to billions of dollars.

HEADLINE: In Congress, Urgent Calls for Action Against Serbs

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
As pressure mounted today on Capitol Hill for the United States and its allies to take immediate military action in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Administration continued its debate on what it can do to stop Serbian aggression without getting Washington too deeply involved.
The Administration remains divided about whether to press its allies to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims and carry out air strikes against Serbian positions. 
 Despite a seven-hour meeting on Saturday and further discussions by telephone on Sunday and today, President Clinton's senior foreign-policy advisers have failed to agree on what options to recommend, senior officials said.
One official said that rather than shape the debate, Mr. Clinton preferred to wait until his aides agreed on their recommendations. "The President is still waiting for them to wrestle down the options," one offical said.
President Clinton had planned to speak today to President Francois Mitterrand of France but could not get through, and intends to try again Tuesday, a White House official said.
Leading a growing number of prominent lawmakers calling for more forceful action -- including strategic air strikes and the arming of Muslim forces -- is Senator Joseph R. Biden.
He presented Secretary of State Warren Christopher today with a strongly worded report that castigates the United States and its allies for "confusion and inertia" in responding to Serbian aggression. The report was requested by Mr. Clinton.
The Delaware Democrat, who returned last week from Bosnia, made eight recommendations. They include sending NATO warplanes to escort United Nations relief flights, eliminating the Serbs' heavy weapons by giving them an ultimatum or by launching airstrikes, strengthening the United Nations peacekeeping force to make it a "serious fighting force," lifting the United Nations arms embargo against the Muslims, closing all embassies in Belgrade and deploying a major United Nations force in Macedonia.
"The United States must lead the West in a decisive response to Serbian aggression," Mr. Biden said, "beginning with air attacks on Serb artillery everywhere in Bosnia and on Yugoslav National Army units in Serbia that have participated in this international crime."
 
Bridges on the Drina
 As one example, he called on the West to "destroy every bridge" along the Drina River; Serbia has been using the bridges to supply Serbian nationalists in Bosnia.
Until now, few lawmakers have urged military action against the Serbs, but appeals in recent days reflect the growing conviction that the Bosnian Serbs will never sign the peace plan negotiated by the United Nations and the European Community, and that economic sanctions alone cannot stop Serbian aggression.
In the clearest sign that the mood is changing, Senator George Mitchell, the Senate Majority leader, is urging the Administration and its allies to arm the Bosnian Muslims immediately and launch air attacks.
"If President Clinton proposes, as part of a multilateral effort, to end the arms embargo and to direct that there be some more active use of NATO air power to deal with Serbian aggression, it would be appropriate," Mr. Mitchell said in a telephone interview. "And I believe it would receive good support in the Congress."
Senator Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that American policy "is a sham."
"All we're doing is standing by while the Serbs mop up Bosnia and divide it into 11 little pieces and slaughter all the women and children," he said. "In my view that's not a policy."
Secretary of State Christopher today described the policy review as urgent, and the White House spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, said the White House would continue to consult with the allies, adding: "There's a range of things we're looking at right now. Among those are military options."

HEADLINE: British Urge a New Job For Balkans Be Set Up

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 19

 BODY:
Britain has proposed appointing a new high-level official to take charge of enforcing the economic embargo against the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, after the Security Council's decision over the weekend to tighten these sanctions drastically.
The idea is to give this post to a prominent figure such as a former foreign minister or a former defense minister who has the authority to make Yugoslavia's neighbors comply with the trade ban. 
 Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the American commander in the Persian Gulf war, and Lieut. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who served in the White House as President Bush's national security adviser, have also been mentioned as possible candidates for the job, diplomats here say.

HEADLINE: OTB Is Planning Layoffs To Avoid Red Ink for Year

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Admitting that it is facing a financial crisis, the New York City Offtrack Betting Corporation yesterday said that it would soon begin laying off employees to avoid ending the year in the red.
Otherwise, the agency said, it could wind up losing $2.9 million in the current fiscal year that ends in June and having to reduce revenues that it could turn over to New York City. 
 Critics, including state and city officials, have repeatedly rebuked the agency for its managerial policies and warned that OTB could become the first legal bookmaker in the nation to actually lose money.
Hazel N. Dukes, president of the quasi-independent agency, announced the need for layoffs in a memorandum to 1,978 employees. She attributed OTB's poor performance at the betting windows to harsh winter weather in February and March, which, she said, cut the anticipated handle -- the total amount of bets wagered on horse races.
The dwindling profits are almost certain to increase demands by critics of the agency that it be sold to a private corporation or that it be drastically reorganized.
 
Cost-Cutting Moves
 But Marjorie W. Longley, an OTB spokeswoman, said that through layoffs and other cost-saving measures, the corporation still hoped to turn over about $33 million in revenues to the city this year, the same amount as in the 1991-92 fiscal year. She said the agency was also considering closing several of its 94 branches.
Ms. Longley said that the number of layoffs had not been determined but that all of them would come from 507 employees at the corporation's executive offices and headquarters at 1501 Broadway in Times Square. "It will include managerial people in all departments, at all levels," she said.
In her statement to employees, she said the agency was facing "a $2.9 million shortfall" to cover its operating expenses. She said the financial setback was caused primarily by the closing of all OTB branches for three days after a blizzard on March 13. On eight other days in February and March, she said, OTB parlors were closed or betting was curtailed by severe weather in the city or at thoroughbred and harness racing tracks.
"We have done everything possible to prevent laying off employees," Ms. Dukes said in her statement. "Regrettably that is no longer possible."
OTB is required by law to pay operational costs from "residual" income, profits left after it makes payments from the betting handle to the state and the racing industry. Most of the money OTB gave the city last year came from a 5 percent surcharge on winning bets. It is barred from dipping into the surcharge revenue, which last year totaled $26.7 million, to run its operations.
As profits have withered in recent years, OTB has come under increasing attacks by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan and members of the City Council's Finance Committee for its spending and management policies. Mr. Regan urged OTB in October to close its 21 worst-performing branches and to take other drastic steps to reverse its slide.
Mr. Regan, through a spokeswoman, Ellen Weiman, said yesterday, "We take no pleasure in saying, 'I told you so.' " Asserting that Ms. Dukes's administration had declined to act more quickly to cut overhead, he said, "Instead they became defensive and are now forced to act in desperation to avoid the unbelievable prospect of ending the year in the red."
In March 1992, the Council Finance Committee admonished OTB for what Council members called excessive expenses for office furnishings and entertainment and for poor management practices.
Ms. Dukes, the agency's top executive since July 1990, has maintained that she has reduced the annual operating budget to $96 million, a saving of $11 million since she took over.
Ms. Longley emphasized that 75 percent of the handle -- $669 million -- was returned to customers for winning wagers last year. The racing industry also got $53.9 million and the state received $17 million before any money could go to the city or for OTB overhead, she said.
Last year's handle was $887 million and the agency, in its budget this year, projected a handle of $831 million. However, Ms. Longley said because of the winter weather, the handle is now projected at $820 million, a record low.
"You can't fight God," she said.

HEADLINE: Victoria Journal;
Such a Lovely City! Still, Seattle Holds Its Nose

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VICTORIA, British Columbia

 BODY:
This is a city that is "clean, green and safe," says the Greater Victoria Visitors and Convention Bureau. The bureau does not say that this is the only major municipality in North America still dumping its raw waste in the sea.
Victoria's restored historic buildings, flowering lawns, parks, magnificent seascapes and alluring British influence, including dozens of tearooms and pubs, drew 3.2 million tourists in 1991, about two-thirds American. The visitors pumped $725 million into the local economy, nearly double the outlay five years earlier. When 1992 tallies are completed, numbers are likely to be even higher. 
 At the southern tip of Vancouver Island, Victoria is closer to Washington State than to mainland Canada, and therein lies some of the problem.
 
'Tremendous Conradiction'
 Despite the entreaties of their neighbors, the electorate of this capital and second largest city of British Columbia, one of the richest provinces in Canada, voted in November to continue handling waste about the same way it has been handled for the last 100 years, rather than invest in a sewage treatment plant.
"What a tremendous contradiction for a city that depends on tourist income," lamented Derrick Mallard, a 72-year-old electronics engineer, who with his wife, Gwen, runs a vegetarian restaurant and the Citizens Association to Save the Environment.
At Clover Point, a park where the discharge is screened and then pumped through outfall pipes to an area one mile away and 200 feet deep, several kite-flying enthusiasts are preparing to loft multicolored Tracers, Renegades, Spiro-Jets and Lady Roses. Across the water, structures of Port Angeles in Washington State 8 to 10 miles away are easily made out.
Barry Cameron, 40, a retail sales clerk, is taking the canvas wraps off his Tracer. On the sewage issue, there is no doubt about the way he feels. "When the winds are coming up from the south and the currents change, the smell is quite definite," he said, a half-smile and then a look of disgust on his face.
From Clover Point and another outfall at Macaulay Point, a couple of miles to the west, Victoria discharges nearly 20 million gallons of the untreated sewage daily, the equivalent of the capacity of the Exxon Valdez, into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
Although Victoria officials cite scientific studies to argue that the effect on the environment is negligible, people across the water have reacted with anger, disbelief and now something a bit tougher, a grass-roots tourist boycott.
"Oceans are not for dumping," said Rob Johnson, a member of the state House of Representatives in Olympia whose district embraces Port Angeles, the San Juan islands and part of Bellingham, and who has been the prime mover behind the boycott.
Not only are tourists canceling trips, but big associations are scrubbing conventions. Gerhard Letzing, executive director of the Washington State Trial Lawyers Association, said the group, which would have poured $350,000 into Victoria in 1995, is going to Whistler, a British Columbia resort with state-of-the-art waste treatment.
"We didn't want to support a city where residents do little to improve the environment of the ocean," he said.
Every year the eighth-grade social studies class of the St. Anne School in Seattle makes a trip to Victoria. This year the class wrote to the Capital Regional District Chairman, Frank Leonard, Victoria's top municipal officer, to explain that it was canceling because of the sewage issue.
Mr. Leonard offered to pay for a delegation to come here, tour the installations and hear Victoria's side. Six students, accompanied by their teacher, Mary Lila Gary, came, heard, and left unimpressed. Interviewed around a picnic table just before boarding the ferry back to Seattle, they said they would recommend to their classmates continued support for the boycott.
Here are some of their sentiments: Tony Magnano, 13, "Raw sewage is wrong"; Lindsey McBride, 14, "Victoria must take precautions now"; Jaime Kopf, 13, "If they're worried about the price now, it'll cost a lot more when they do it later."
 
Victoria's Argument
 Essentially, Victoria's argument is that the area is unique because of its cold water and strong tides and that nature takes care of itself.
Mr. Leonard said in an interview: "We have reduced garbage 25 percent in three years through a recycling and composting program. We have brought in clean-air bylaws. We regulate stove-burning and backyard and incinerator burning. We like to think we are aggressive with toxic waste. On sewage, do we build whatever the Americans tell us to, or do we weigh the scientific advice?"
Provincial authorities are embarrassed. They have urged a reluctant municipality at least to agree to begin primary treatment of the sewage within nine years. Negotiations continue.
John Cashore, British Columbia's Minister of Environment and a United Church minister, said: "The province has made clear that dumping of raw sewage is unacceptable. The municipality knows the handwriting is on the wall."

HEADLINE: A New Old Trade Policy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's combative pronouncements on trade have hit the Japanese Government like a series of earthquakes, leaving officials here fuming over the insistent demands that Japan reduce its yawning trade surplus quickly. Some have charged that the Clinton Administration has reversed years of America's commitment to free trade. But the real concern among some trade experts is not that the policy itself is new; it is the assertive new way President Clinton is using the old techniques of managed trade that were accepted when they were employed by the Bush and Reagan Administrations.
As one of its trade initiatives, the Clinton Administration has pushed for the devaluation of the dollar against the yen. This is expected to reduce America's trade imbalance by making Japanese goods more expensive in the United States and American products cheaper here. The dollar has already plummeted in value against the yen, hitting a post-World War II low in Tokyo trading today of 111 yen to the dollar. That was the ninth new low for the dollar against the yen in the last 13 trading days. [Page D25.] 
 Clinton Administration officials have also suggested that Japan set targets for the import of American goods over a period of years and specific reductions in its surpluses. President Clinton, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have made it clear recently that any Japanese response will have to go beyond the sort of one-shot measures frequently accepted in the past. Clinton Administration officials have insisted they also want the Japanese to purchase high-technology American-made goods, not just more agricultural products.
Government officials here agree with the need to strengthen the yen -- if more slowly than the current rate of increase. But just about every senior Japanese official from the prime minister down has insisted that Japan would never agree to specific targets guaranteeing American exporters a share of Japanese markets. The key element of the Japanese defense has been to brand this results-oriented policy a form of managed trade, which violates free trade principles.
The issue is, however, more complex than it appears.
While the previous Administrations pledged fidelity to free trade -- and eschewed any government controls in principle -- they did in fact agree to managed trade deals, saying that they did so reluctantly. The Clinton Administration, however, has unabashedly seized upon managed trade as a tool to pry open the Japanese market to achieve fundamental change.
 
Tokyo Has a Word for It
 The Japanese expressions for these differences between rhetoric and reality are "tatemae," which is one's surface meaning, and "honne," which is one's underlying intention.
"Clearly, the difference is that in the previous Administrations tatemae and honne were different," said Makoto Kuroda, a former top trade negotiator and now a managing director at the Mitsubishi Corporation. "Now the honne has come to the surface. Clinton is writing his policies on a line that already existed."
In fact, the United States has enforced quotas and other mechanisms for controlling the flow of goods across the Pacific since the early 1970's, when the Nixon Administration took steps to slow a flood of cheap Japanese textile products.
"The U.S. managed trade before Presidents Reagan and Bush; they just continued the previous policies," insisted Ryutaro Komiya, a highly respected economist here and now director general of the Ministry of Trade and Industry's research institute. "The speeches they gave were different, but they still managed trade in areas such as automobiles and semiconductors. Before that, it was textiles, then iron and steel, and then televisions. The change was in the shift from light-industrial products to medium-technology products to higher-technology goods."
 
Pressure on Government
 It is thus difficult for Japan to flatly reject President Clinton's form of trade hardball. But the President's stance does put pressure on the Japanese Government to come up with its own recommendations for achieving swift reductions in the trade surplus.
The Government has yet to introduce any new ideas. Some commentators have been critical of the Government's staid policy makers for being slow to realize that a whole new relationship has emerged.
"The conventional approach of meeting selective, specific U.S. demands with principles of free trade or abstract arguments no longer works," wrote the Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper, in an editorial. "Japan needs to respond with a clear understanding of changes in the United States."
The editorial went on, "One should realize that the Japan-U.S. relationship has entered an era of genuine competition in which any attempt at equivocation simply will not do."
Many influential officials admit that all the elements of the American policy have been used before, and were accepted by Japan. The 12 years of the Reagan and Bush Administrations were, from Japan's perspective, littered with deals that managed trade by having government decrees influence the movement of goods rather than the classic determinants, supply and demand.
 
Voluntary Deals Recalled
 These deals ranged from Japanese agreements to "voluntarily" limit exports of autos and machine tools to a pledge to help foreign computer chip makers obtain at least a 20 percent share of the Japanese market. There was also the Plaza Accord in September 1985, which used government intervention to sharply reduce the value of the dollar against the yen.
At times, these conflicts left American trade negotiators in a quandary. When Carla A. Hills, President Bush's trade representative, visited Japan in October 1989, she toed the free trade line and rejected in principle any targets for Japanese imports of foreign goods, including computer chips. But just last year, with Japan's trade surplus expanding again, Mrs. Hills insisted the United States would hold Japan to its 20 percent market share pledge.
The Nikkei Weekly, a leading economic newspaper, wrote in a recent editorial: "Our greatest concern is that the Administration appears to be inclined toward managed trade. This is nothing new for the U.S. -- actually, it is a legacy from the Reagan and Bush Administrations, which practiced managed trade while proclaiming allegiance to principles of free trade."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chase Marks $2 Billion of Bad Loans for Sale

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
In an attempt to put the excesses of the 1980's firmly behind it, the Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that it had set aside $2 billion in troubled commercial real estate assets that would be sold over two and a half years.
By selling the loans and foreclosed properties in a depressed market, Chase expects to receive only 39 percent of the money it originally lent. It took an $884 million charge against its first-quarter earnings to reflect the difference between the expected sale price and the book value of the assets. Because of a gain from accounting changes, the company nevertheless managed to report an 8.5 percent increase in first-quarter profits. 
 To replenish its capital after the charge, Chase said it would sell $750 million in new stock, which would also help finance future acquisitions.
"We are giving ourselves a little room here," said Thomas G. Labrecque, the chairman of Chase, the nation's sixth-largest banking company. "If we are not stupid about what we buy, the equity issue gives us more flexibility to grow the institution faster."
Chase reported earnings of $153 million, or 74 cents a share, for the quarter ended March 31. The loss from the real estate portfolio was offset by a $500 million gain from accounting changes related to income taxes. In the first quarter last year, Chase earned $141 million, or 81 cents cents a share, including $30 million in tax benefits.
Another banking company, the Nationsbank Corporation, the country's fourth largest, said yesterday that its earnings rose 55.2 percent in the first quarter. The company earned $481 million, or $1.89 a share, versus $310 million, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., also benefited from the accounting change on income taxes, which added $200 million to its bottom line.
The accounting rule allows banks to recognize the value of tax benefits that they will be able to take in the future because of previous losses.
 By segregating its troubled real estate assets, Chase is following in the footsteps of the First Chicago Corporation, which established a $2 billion portfolio of real estate for sale and took a $625 million write-off. Other banking companies, including the BankAmerica Corporation and Nationsbank, have sold large pools of troubled real estate assets in bulk to investment firms.
Chase is unlikely to make bulk sales of its real estate assets. It expects to receive more by selling the properties individually or in small packages.
At the end of last year, Chase had a $7.8 billion portfolio of real estate-related assets, including $2 billion of loans that were not current on their payments and $1.1 billion of property that had been repossessed. The $2 billion in assets designated for sale includes $622 million of loans that are current on payments but are considered low quality, $843 million of nonperforming loans and $578 million in property.
The bank cut the book value of the assets by half, taking the $884 million write-off and using $135 million from its existing reserve for bad loans. The markdown to 39 percent of the original loan value was made using the most conservative accounting techniques, the bank said. Chase may realize higher values, depending on actual sale prices.
 
Shifting Gears
 Until now, Chase's approach had been to hold onto its troubled real estate and wait for the market to improve. "We now see a clear picture that the depth and width of the real estate problems are greater than we expected two years ago," E. Michel Kruse, the bank's chief financial officer, said at a briefing for banking analysts in New York yesterday.
The real estate action will help Chase reduce the cost of raising capital, Mr. Kruse said. "The dominant factor in cost of capital for Chase currently is the perceived risk in our real estate portfolio," he said.
Stock market investors, however, are concerned that the new stock issue will lessen the value of existing shares. Chase's stock fell $2.375 yesterday, closing at $34.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"They are raising a lot of equity, well beyond what I thought they needed," said James M. Rosenberg, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "I don't think it's optimal for long-term shareholder value. I think they could have gotten a significantly better price for their stock if they had waited for a year."
Mr. Rosenberg also expressed concern that the new equity would encourage the bank to make acquisitions that would not be in the best interest of existing shareholders.
Mr. Labrecque, Chase's chairman, said the bank company was interested in making acquisitions in all business lines, including mortgage banking, trading, securities-processing services and retail banking in the New York area. Analysts suggested that Chase would like to buy a bank in New Jersey, where it has no branches.
 
Ratings Review
 Although the new capital may be a concern for stock investors, it is good news for holders of Chase bonds. Yesterday, several credit rating agencies said they were reviewing Chase for possible upgrades. Chase's long-term debt is rated triple-B by the major rating agencies, and the bank hopes that rating will rise to at least double-A by 1995.
A higher credit rating allows banks to raise funds at a lower cost and increases their ability to profit from trading currencies and derivative instruments, like interest rate swaps.
 
More Lending at Nationsbank
 Analysts said the most significant aspect of Nationsbank's report was that lending increased by 8 percent, to $73.5 billion, even as commercial real estate assets declined by $2 billion. A big chunk of the overall lending increase, $3.1 billion in loans, came from the acquisition of the consumer finance business of Chrysler.
"The Southeast appears to have a somewhat brighter economic picture than other parts of the country," said Diane Glossman, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers.

Protests Over Lilly's Prices

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, April 19

 BODY:
About 150 protesters today urged Eli Lilly & Company shareholders to restrain the company's drug price increases, but the appeals, delivered at the company's annual meeting, were rejected.
Earlier this month, Lilly pledged to limit price increases for any single drug to 2 percentage points above the inflation rate. United Senior Action, a lobbying group for the elderly, said it wanted independent verification of the prices. 
 "We hope to bring to everyone's attention that we can do something to control spiraling costs that are killing our people," said Forest Handlon, a United Senior Action member.
One resolution at today's meeting asked the company to report to stockholders on its pricing policy. A second demanded that Lilly adopt price restraints.
Stockholders representing just 5 percent of outstanding shares supported the resolutions.
Edward A. West, a Lilly spokesman, said the company's prices were fair and reasonable.

HEADLINE: NO NEW INFLATION SEEN BY FED CHIEF

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Vowing that he would remain vigilant in fighting inflation, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told the financial markets last night not to expect inflationary pressures to re-emerge soon.
In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Greenspan said it was "difficult to imagine inflationary pressures intensifying" when the banking system remained weak and bank lending remained "exceptionally subdued." 
 He gave several other reasons for believing that inflation would remain low, among them a surplus of people looking for work and labor costs remaining under control. He also predicted that the recent run-up in the price of some raw materials would soon slow significantly.
Mr. Greenspan appeared to address his remarks to the bond markets, voicing frustration that long-term interest rates remained relatively high even though the underlying inflation rate was at its lowest level in two decades.
Mr. Greenspan, who has been criticized by conservatives for cozying up to the Clinton Administration, took the opportunity in last night's speech to indicate that he did not plan to bend with the political winds to adopt an expansionary monetary policy.
He vowed not to repeat the mistakes of the 1970's, when the Federal Reserve pumped up the money supply to fuel economic growth, only to produce high inflation. The Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates in the late 1970's and early 1980's to squeeze down inflation, creating a deep recession and surge in unemployment.
"It would be irresponsible for us to dismiss the experience of the post-Vietnam War years and once again allow the destabilizing forces of inflation to undercut economic growth and employment," he said.
 
Growth Seen Slowing
 In another sign that inflation would remain under control, Alan Blinder, a member-designate of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, expressed fears that growth was slowing. In a speech in Washington, he defended President Clinton's $19.5 billion stimulus package, saying the Administration believed that growth had slowed significantly from the fourth quarter. He said first-quarter growth might be just 2 to 2.5 percent, well below the 3 percent the Administration has forecast for all of 1993.
During his speech, Mr. Greenspan often sought to reassure the markets about some recent signs of inflation. He said the increase in wages that the Labor Department reported in March "may reflect nothing more than excess overtime costs of cleanup following the late winter storms."
As for the recent climb of raw material prices, including lumber, he said this probably had "more to do with improving demand" and restoring profit margins to normal levels "than to early signals of sustained inflationary pressures."
In emphasizing the importance of holding down inflation, Mr. Greenspan said low inflation played a pivotal role in the recent upsurge in productivity. He said that when inflation was running at a moderate pace, corporations could easily increase profits by raising their prices, but when inflation was low, "businesses seeking to increase their profit margins perceive that they can do so only by enhancing efficiency."
He said that low inflation -- by helping concentrate the minds of business executives on the need to increase productivity -- might have caused a jump in productivity that is not just cyclical, but perhaps the beginning of a long-term trend.
Mr. Greenspan said the nation had "made very substantial progress" toward achieving price stability over the last decade. He adding that "at current inflation rates, we are quite close to attaining this goal."
He signaled that the central bank would not shrink from its responsibility of protecting the value of the dollar from inflation and from erosion against foreign currencies.
"A society's central bank is rarely popular," he said, adding that it was required "at times to take difficult steps to preserve the value of the currency both domestically and abroad."

3 Drug Giants Post Mediocre Results

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Three large drug companies -- Merck, Warner-Lambert and Eli Lilly -- reported mediocre results yesterday for the first three months of 1993. The drug makers have come under sharp criticism of their prices by President Clinton, but many have already abandoned past reliance on aggressively raising prices to improve profits.
The industry says price flexibility has also been squeezed by large buyers amid growing competition as drugs are copied. Still, there were no surprises because previous company announcements had told investors what to expect. 
 Shares of all three companies rose yesterday on the Big Board, along with other drug stocks, bucking a general market decline. Merck rose $1.875, to $35.875. Warner-Lambert was up $2, to $72.625, after hitting a 52-week high yesterday at $72.875. Lilly rose 62.5 cents, to $45.25.
Merck & Company said profits before adjustments for accounting changes increased by 10 percent in the quarter, its smallest increase in many years.
Warner-Lambert's earnings were up 10.7 percent before accounting changes, although pharmaceutical sales declined 7 percent and overall revenues were flat.
Eli Lilly & Company said net income before accounting changes declined by 16 percent, also on flat revenues.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Merck

Merck said quarterly profits before the adjustments were $613.8 million, up from $559 million the year before. Net income a year ago, after the noncash accounting changes that recognized future health-care and disability costs was $96.6 million, less than one-sixth this year's net.
Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, said worldwide operations had strong gains in unit volume, while "price increases had virtually no effect on sales growth." The company adopted a policy two years ago of limiting price increases to the general inflation rate. Currency fluctuations reduced sales by three percentage points.
Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., has reported steadily declining earnings growth over the last five years.
Noting that Merck had warned investors last month of the latest slowing in growth, Joyce Albers, an analyst at First Boston, said earnings on a per-share basis were actually "better than we expected." She added, "Once they got our expectations down, it didn't look so bad."
Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber Securities projected improving profits in the second half of 1993. He said Merck had extraordinary expenses, starting last summer, as it introduced Proscar, a new prostate treatment, and added salespeople for a joint venture with Astra A.B., a Swedish drug company.
 
Warner-Lambert
 Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., reported a double-digit increase in profits even though sales rose only 1.5 percent. Including several accounting changes, its earnings rose 11.3 percent, to $182.2 million. The company said it had reduced spending for marketing, research and overhead, benefited from falling interest rates, and received increased royalties from product licenses.
Consumer lines, led by Listerine mouthwash and Schick shaving products, had stronger domestic sales in an improving American economy.
 
Eli Lilly
 Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said its operating profits were hurt by reduced sales because of a relatively mild flu season and by increased competition for several products. It was also hit by suspended production at its Physio-Control Corporation unit, increased rebates to state Medicaid programs, and German Government price reductions.
Including several accounting charges in the first quarter and in the 1992 quarter, Lilly's net income rose 11.3 percent, to $362.6 million.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell again yesterday, closing at 6.72 percent, its 16-year low, but it could not dip below that level.
In what traders said was light trading, the price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 10506/32 in the seconday market. It was the second time since last Thursday that the yield dropped to its recent low at the end of trading. But on both occasions, traders and investors were apparently unwilling to buy enough to push the yield down to new lows. 
 "We are still in a trading range," said David Ader, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
Mr. Ader said that there was some selling in the morning as traders expected that the selling on Friday, which pushed the 30-year bond yield back up to 6.75 percent, would continue. But when it became clear that prices would not fall much further, a lot of sellers had to limit their losses by buying, which lifted the market.
There was no major economic news to trade on, which added to the slowness of the market. Because the weather-related slowdown in March is already apparent in the economic data, there may not be any crucial news -- unless there is a surprise -- until the first week of May.
That is when the Treasury will announce the quarterly auction data and is when traders and investors will find out if the rumored cuts in the size of the 30-year bond auction are actually going to occur. Speculation about a cut in the total amount of 30-year bonds to be sold has been one of the factors supporting the price of the bond and bringing the yield lower, traders have said.
In the same week, the Labor Department releases the employment data for May, which could help clear up the debate over how fast the economy is growing.
In other trading yesterday, the prices of Treasury notes were up slightly. At the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rates declined, again reflecting a belief by some investors that the Federal Reserve may have to cut short-term interest rates to insure that the recovery keeps on track. With the declines yesterday, the discount rates fell further below the Fed's 3 percent target for the Federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge on overnight loans.
The average discount rate on the three-month bill was 2.81 percent, down from 2.89 percent last week and the lowest since 2.67 percent on Oct. 5, 1992. The discount rate on the six-month bill was 2.95 percent, down from 3.00 percent last week and the lowest since the 2.95 percent on Oct. 13.
 
Auction Study

A study by a group of economists for the Mid America Institute concludes that the Treasury should continue its experiment with single-price Treasury auctions and that the threat of reopening Treasury issues is a positive approach to dealing with possible market manipulations.
But the study, which was released at a news conference yesterday, opposes any radical changes in the current procedures in the $2.3 trillion government securities market. Specifically, the report contends that any major increase in regulation of the market or new demands for reporting by firms that trade government securities would not be cost effective.
The recommendations against any radical changes are like those from other organizations involved in the government securities market, for example, the Public Securities Association. Among those financing the Mid America study were Wall Street's major firms, including Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley; Goldman, Sachs, and J. P. Morgan.
The study supported both the new single-price auction procedure the Treasury is testing in the two-year and five-year note auctions and the reopening of current Treasury issues to add more supply if there is a squeeze, whether legal or not. Those were two of the major changes made by the Government in the aftermath of the Salomon Brothers Treasury auction bidding scandal in August of 1991.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

Dollar at Yet Another Low Despite Efforts to Curb Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell to another postwar low against the yen yesterday despite remarks by Government leaders intended to slow the rally that has lifted the value of the yen more than 11 percent this year.
The dollar also declined against major European currencies as traders, seeking profits on the yen's recent advance, sold some of their yen holdings to buy German marks, Swiss and French francs and British pounds. But for the most part, they did not buy dollars. 
 Gold rose for the second straight session. Gold for current delivery gained another $1.30, to $340.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $339.90 an ounce, up $1.40.
The yen began its advance overnight in Tokyo as a follow-through to Friday's increase in New York. The yen had soared on Friday after President Clinton made remarks welcoming a stronger yen as a way to curb Japan's trade surplus.
But early yesterday in Tokyo, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who had met with Mr. Clinton in Washington last week, said the yen's rise was too rapid and that Japan's central bank should try to curb its appreciation, even if it was not joined by other central banks. Later in New York, a Clinton spokesman said that the President's comments on Friday were not meant as a major policy statement.
But the remarks in Tokyo and Washington did little to stem the yen's advance.
"The critical thing that's missing here is they want to slow the rise, but neither the U.S. nor Japan is willing to say this is far enough," said Ronald Leven, a currency analyst at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 111.00 yen, down 1.95 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at the same price. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar recovered slightly to a postwar low of 111.10 yen, down from late Friday's 112.30 yen.
In Paris, the French Government cut two key short-term interest rates, but the reduction did not lead to a selloff in French francs. Many participants had feared such a move would prompt speculators to try to drive the franc sharply lower as a way to test the new French Government's resolve to support the franc.

HEADLINE: Waco, Tex., Prices $33 Million Issue

 BODY:
Waco, Tex., priced $33 million of general obligation bonds yesterday through underwriters led by the First Southwest Corporation of Dallas. The underwriters, who had scheduled the financing months in advance, said the storming of David Koresh's headquarters outside Waco yesterday had no impact on the deal.
In fact, the deal went so well that underwriters were able to raise the price on most of the issues, thereby lowering yields by five basis points, or five-hundredths of a percentage point, as well as the cost of servicing the debt for the issuer. 
 The financing, to replace old debt at higher interest rates, offered a maximum yield of 5.65 percent for a general obligation refunding bond due in 2013. Yields on shorter-maturity serial bonds ranged from 2.55 percent in 1994 to 5.60 percent in 2010.
Also for sale were combination tax and revenue certificates of obligation with yields ranging from 3.50 percent in 1995 to 5.65 percent in 2013.
Because all the bonds are insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation for interest and principal payments, the issue carries a triple-A rating by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Biologists Fear Sustainable Yield Is Unsustainable Idea

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
THE concept of sustainability -- the idea that renewable natural resources like fisheries and forests should be exploited with restraint so that future generations can also benefit from them -- has become something of a mantra among environmentalists.
But if history is any guide, sustainability may be far more difficult to achieve than is commonly thought, three fisheries biologists argued in an article in the April 2 issue of the journal Science. 
 For one thing, they say, science is probably incapable of predicting safe levels of resource exploitation. And even if accurate predictions were possible, they contend, history shows that human shortsightedness and greed almost always lead to overexploitation, often to the point of collapse of the resource.
 
'Pretense' of Certainty
 "It's quite depressing," said Dr. Donald Ludwig of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, an author of the paper, written with Dr. Carl Walters, also at British Columbia, and Dr. Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington.
The three scientists nevertheless say there is some hope if policy makers abandon "the pretense of scientific certainty," in Dr. Walters's words, and devise common-sense management plans that protect the resource,and the economy that depends on it, against a range of uncertain possibilities.
As an illustration of the problem, they note that commercial fish populations naturally fluctuate, often unpredictably, under the influence of varying ecological conditions. Yet scientists who advise fishery managers have historically calculated a single, unvarying "maximum sustainable yield," or set number of fish that supposedly can be caught without endangering the resource.
If the number is calculated on the basis of good ecological conditions for fish, as has often happened, fish stocks will be overexploited when conditions turn bad. To complicate matters, scientists disagree on how much exploitation is safe and can never hope to reach a consensus. Catastrophe sometimes results.
 
Loss of a Species
 The record is replete with such examples, the three experts say. In one instance, they wrote, California state scientists warned that limits should be placed on harvesting the California sardine. Fishing interests were able to produce opposing scientists who said it was impossible to overfish the species. Fishing was not reduced, the population collapsed and scientists still argue over why.
The Canadian cod fishery may be another such instance, said Dr. Walters, referring to what he called the "huge disaster" that has befallen the fishery. "That's a really good instance where the scientists were trusted to produce answers," he said. But, he added, "they were way overestimating how many fish were left in the ocean" and "the net result of putting trust in scientists was to put 20,000 people out of work" when the fishery collapsed.
Scientists may never be able to track the fluctuations well enough to advise fishery managers on safe exploitation levels. "The rate of learning might not be faster than the rate of change," Dr. Hilborn said. "That's one of the reasons that over time we might not get more certain. It's a very scary thought."
The only sensible course, he said, is to conceive of sustainability not as an effort to "hold the resource in one place" but rather as an effort to ride nature's cycles by "rolling with changes in the environment."
As an example of how this might be done, he cited the Alaskan salmon fishery. The number of spawners necessary to maintain a healthy population might range from 1 million to 15 million, depending on whether the population cycle is at a peak or in a trough. The safe course in view of this uncertainty would be to leave enough fish so that the fishery as a whole will do well whether it is a good year or a bad one. This would mean taking fewer fish than the fishery would yield in a peak year.
Quite apart from the prediction problem, the three critics contend that the human drive for wealth often leads to overexploitation in this way: Fishermen or loggers harvest as much of the resource as they can. When harvests are abundant and money is plentiful, large capital investments are made in equipment and entire local or regional economies base themselves on exploiting fish or trees. When the resource fluctuates, as in the case of fisheries, or diminishes, as in the case of forests, the vested interests plead for subsidies. The subsidies come, sometimes on a temporary basis, but the effect is to encourage further overharvesting
Here, too, the three scientists see a possible way out. It lies in a common-sense strategy routinely practiced by financial investors in the face of uncertainty: hedging your bets and spreading the risk. When a region or a locality relies for its prosperity on harvesting a fragile and unpredictable biological resource to the exclusion of other economic pursuits, Dr. Walters said, it is as if "an investment manager told his client to put all his money into one stock."
 
Spreading the Risk
 It would be safer for both the economy and the resource, Dr. Walters said, if communities tried to create a more diversified economy. The basic strategy, he said, should be to recognize the uncertainty and risk and "build in economic flexibility and risk-spreading." Had that been done in the case of the cod fishery, he said, it would not have been the disaster it has been.
But he recognized that this strategy is not always easy to apply once a region or locality has cast its economic lot with one resource, as in the case of the bitter fight between loggers and environmentalists over the cutting of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.
"Nobody's come up with a way of doing it" in the forests of western North America, he said. Tourism, for example, "doesn't really seem to cut it" as an economic alternative to logging," he said. "The number of jobs it can generate doesn't seem that large." Of efforts by the Clinton Administration to find a way out of the dilemma in the Pacific Northwest, he said, "I sure don't envy those people."
By and large, the three critics "are right on target, said Walter Reid, an official at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, who deals with the question of sustainability. He said that was particularly true on the basic point that "to wait for a uniform consensus from scientists is a recipe for disaster."
He also agreed that sustainability could not be conceived of as some permanent, steady-state condition. Rather, he said, the normal fluctuations of nature make the sustainable use of biological resources "a moving target." But he said science was of more value in managing resources than the article might suggest, not least because although science cannot remove uncertainty, "it can certainly narrow the envelope of uncertainty."
What science does not do at all, the authors said, is take into consideration the real source of difficulty: people. Most fishery problems, Dr. Hilborn said, "are a result of not understanding how the fishermen behave rather than how the fish behave."
"The resource itself is the easier research problem," he said.
 
New Conservation Ethic
 Including people and their economic needs as part of an ecosystem to be preserved is a major tenet of an emerging new American conservation ethic. Dr. Ludwig, Dr. Hilborn and Dr. Walters argue that such human attributes as the hunger for wealth and the tendency to disregard long-term consequences should also be included as part of the natural system to be studied and managed.
"Resource problems are not really environmental problems," they wrote. "They are human problems that we have created at many times and in many places, under a variety of political, social and economic systems.
These are among the guides to action they offer in summing up:
Rely on scientists to recognize problems but not to remedy them. Distrust claims of sustainability, since past resource exploitation has rarely been sustainable. And confront uncertainty honestly.
"As long as you recognize your limitations," Dr. Ludwig said, "you can begin to cope with things."

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton, Meet Mr. Gore

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's speech commemorating Earth Day later this week might answer some questions. Does he really care about the environment or was that just something he told the voters? And is he paying any attention at all to his Vice President?
Things have not been going Al Gore's way. Months ago, he had every reason to believe that Bill Clinton would become the "environment President" George Bush pledged to be but wasn't. And that he, as the President's political conscience and policy coordinator, would steer the onetime friend of polluters in the Arkansas chicken industry to new heights of global stewardship. 
 Mr. Gore has hardly been heard from on environmental issues since Inauguration Day. The White House has been doing most of the talking, and not in a way that pleases the Vice President.
First it approved a toxic waste incinerator in Ohio that Mr. Gore had pledged to keep closed pending further study. Then it withdrew its support for sensible proposals on mining and grazing offered by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Mr. Gore had no personal stake in these proposals but his sensitivities must surely have been wounded by Mr. Clinton's quick capitulation to powerful interests.
Mr. Gore has a big investment in the issues Mr. Clinton is supposed to address tomorrow, particularly global warming. He knows and cares more about that subject than any other politician in Washington. In his best-selling "Earth in the Balance" he described global warming as "the most serious threat that we have ever faced," and urged the world to act "boldly, decisively, comprehensively and quickly."
At a minimum, Mr. Gore would commit the U.S. to stabilizing annual emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. This was the original goal of many of the nations gathered at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year. President Bush -- citing, among other things, scientific uncertainty and economic costs -- single-handedly engineered a weaker treaty that set no timetables or targets. Mr. Clinton pounced upon this in the campaign and pledged to support the original Rio goal.
Mr. Gore wants Mr. Clinton to fulfill that pledge, made when there were just the two of them riding the bus to the White House. The bus is more crowded now.
Treasury Secretary LLoyd Bentsen and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary resist Mr. Gore's plan. Neither is an unbiased witness; Mr. Bentsen has historically been tender toward business in general and oil in particular, and Ms. O'Leary's last job was as executive vice president of a power company. Both want more study of the impact of diminished energy use on American industry.
Mr. Gore argues that efficiency, conservation and new technologies can limit greenhouse gases without economic disruption. On the face of it, that seems glib, and he cannot expect Mr. Clinton to adopt his strategy without answering tough questions about costs and competing strategies. How much can be achieved through energy efficiency? Will a big carbon tax be required on top of Mr. Clinton's proposed energy taxes? And how much assistance will developing countries need to persuade them to limit energy use without sabotaging economic growth?
But this is not just about details. This is about the broad pathway the Administration intends to follow. What we're hearing from Mr. Bentsen and Ms. O'Leary is a lot like what we heard from George Bush, who shrank from leadership and found fearsome risks and reasons for delay everywhere, whether the issue was global warming or biodiversity or the spotted owl.
Mr. Clinton did not sign on to all of Al Gore's environmental policies when he chose his running mate. But he left the firm impression that he intended to confront environmental problems and educate the American people to their complexities. If he now follows the kinds of instincts that governed him in Arkansas and shuns Mr. Gore's advice, he will have put the Vice President in his place. But that's not the place Al Gore ought to be, which is guiding the President and the Cabinet on issues he knows better than any of them.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Money Without Strings Entangles Political Rivals

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Evanston, Ill., wants a basketball court. Birmingham, Ala., wants pool repairs. And it is now widely known that Manchester, Conn., wants what Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, derides as "that infamous ice skating warming hut."
In the view of Mr. Dole and his Republican colleagues, proposals like these illustrate the wastefulness of President Clinton's plan to stimulate the economy, part of which would finance local wish lists. But to the Democrats, the assortment of proposals embodies something else: the principles of Republican social policy. 
 After all, they say, it is the Republicans who have spent a half-century railing against Federal bureaucrats' meddling in local affairs. And it is Republicans who, while calling for less Federal spending, want fewer Federal rules so that states and cities can spend the money they get as they see fit.
In fact, the Republicans created something called community development block grants to do just that. But ever since Mr. Clinton proposed pouring $2.5 billion into the program, Republicans have attacked it.
To be sure, the main Republican complaint is the cost of Mr. Clinton's plan, not the principle of local decision-making. But to sell their opposition, the Republicans have been mocking the local proposals with what sounds suspiciously like the second-guessing from Washington that Republicans say they oppose.
This has not escaped the notice of Henry G. Cisneros, who as Housing Secretary presides over the block-grant program, behind which he says is the paragon of Republican principles. "Republicans stand for decentralizing decisions out to the lowest levels," Mr. Cisneros said. "It is ironic now that it's been the Republican Senators who've attacked the C.D.B.G. program."
Among those who think that "Henry has a good point" is one of the Republican godfathers of the block grant concept, Richard Nathan, who served as a budget aide in Richard M. Nixon's White House when the idea was hatched. Mr. Nathan, who now teaches public policy at the State University of New York at Albany, said the drive for greater local flexibility had arisen as a response to the social programs of the Great Society under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
Scores of Federal programs blossomed under Johnson, he said, but each had a narrow scope. Federal bureaucrats and Congressional committees liked the power the restrictions gave them, but many local officials complained that the rules had become unworkable.
Among them was Mr. Cisneros, who in 1968 had just landed a job in the San Antonio city government. His first task, he said, was to comb through a Federal grants book.
"You might have to apply to one agency for the swimming pool and another for the land clearance money and another for the street improvement," he said. Since each program had different paper work, deadlines and requirements, "it was almost impossible to bring them together to make a coherent whole."
In a nationally televised speech on Aug. 8, 1969, President Nixon outlined a philosophical alternative. After three decades of centralizing power, he said, it was time for money and responsibility to flow "from Washington to the states and to the people."
In 1974 Congress partly complied by consolidating seven narrow programs into the community development block grant program. Current rules require 70 percent of the money to be used to benefit communities with low or moderate incomes.
The program emphasizes local control, and Republicans have often sought to consolidate other programs in a similar way.
Fast forward to 1993, when Mr. Clinton proposed spending $19.5 billion on programs that he said would jump-start the economy. Wary of increasing the deficit (and perhaps also of ceding power to Mr. Clinton), Senate Republicans were casting about for colorful items that might seem to embody wasteful Federal spending.
They found them in a thick volume published by the United States Conference of Mayors, detailing the projects the block grants might finance. These included $28,000 for the tennis and basketball courts in Evanston, $450,000 for the pool repairs in Birmingham and $30,000 for the much-maligned Manchester hut. Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, even submitted an amendment to ban those and 52 other projects.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, another leader in the Republican opposition, concedes that his party usually champions the cause of local control. "Granted, when we have money to spend, a lot of us would like to have fewer strings attached," he said in an interview last week.
But uneasy in finding himself attaching strings, Mr. Nickles switched the subject. "My big objection is adding money to the deficit," he said.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Set For Europe

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, April 19

 BODY:
An economic stimulus plan aimed at lifting Europe out of its worst slump in 50 years was approved today by the European Community.
The plan, intended to create 450,000 jobs in the next two years, received final endorsement at a meeting of finance ministers of the bloc's 12 countries. 
 The plan focuses on capital projects and research and development. Among the projects already approved for partial financing by the bloc's European Investment Bank are a $1 billion upgrading of electrical power grids in Spain, Portugal and Ireland and a Danish railroad modernization plan estimated at $832 million.
The package also aims to encourage private investment, improve support to small businesses and increase training. It has a further goal of holding down wages, especially in the public sector, in order to restrain public spending.
Restoring prosperity in the community could help the United States economy. The European Community countries are a significant market for United States exports; the United States had a trade surplus of $8.8 billion with the European Community last year.

HEADLINE: Crash Kills George S. Mickelson; South Dakota's Governor Was 52

 BODY:
Gov. George S. Mickelson of South Dakota, who followed his father's career path from a rural law practice to the state's highest office, died in a plane crash in Iowa yesterday, a spokesman for his office said. He was 52.
Governor Mickelson was one of eight people killed in the crash about 15 miles southwest of Dubuque as they were returning from a trip to Cincinnati to promote economic development in the state, the spokesman said. 
 A Republican, Mr. Mickelson was first elected in 1986 and won another four-year term in 1990. He also served six years in the South Dakota House, where he was Speaker in 1979-80.
Lieut. Gov. Walter Dale Miller will succeed him as Governor.
Mr. Mickelson was the son of George T. Mickelson, who served as South Dakota's Governor from 1947 to 1951.
The younger Mr. Mickelson had a home-grown style, often driving a pick-up truck to work. He was a popular member of the South Dakota House for six years, quitting in 1980.
In 1989, Mr. Mickelson's teen-age son, David, was charged with a sexual offense after a 16-year-old girl said she had been raped during a party at the Governor's Mansion. The Governor and Mrs. Mickelson were out of town at the time. David Mickelson was acquitted of the sex charge but was placed on probation for underage consumption of alcohol. He and another boy at the party were ordered to pay the girl's medical bills.
 
Served in Vietnam
 Mr. Mickelson was born in Mobridge, S.D., and lived in the eastern South Dakota city of Brookings and the state capital, Pierre. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration and a law degree from the University of South Dakota.
After two years in the Army in Vietnam, he practiced law in Brookings, S.D., then served as Brookings County state's attorney and assistant state attorney general.
In addition to his son, Mr. Mickelson is survived by his wife, the former Linda McCahren; a son, Mark, and a daughter, Amy.
An obituary on Tuesday, and in some editions on Monday, reported the death of South Dakota's Governor, George S. Mickelson, in an airplane crash.
The obituary included an account of a 1989 arrest of the Mickelsons' teen-age son after an incident during a party at the Governor's Mansion while the elder Mickelsons were out of town.
 While the incident was newsworthy at the time, there was no indication of any lasting relevance to the Governor's career. It should not have been reiterated in his obituary.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. UNVEILS PLAN FOR SOVIET LANDS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
To help the former Soviet bloc's transition to a market economy, the International Monetary Fund unveiled a program today to provide billions of dollars in loans under less stringent conditions than usual to Russia and more than 20 other countries.
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said the program would provide $4 billion to $6 billion in loans during the next 18 months to help former Soviet bloc nations buy imported goods, ranging from food to spare parts needed to modernize industry. 
 Mr. Camdessus said at a news conference that Russia would qualify for about $3 billion of this money and that he hoped it could begin receiving some in a month or two. This $3 billion was counted as part of the $28 billion Russian aid package that the Group of Seven industrial nations announced last week in Tokyo.
 
Some Strings Attached
 The monetary fund is not planning to lend the money without any strings attached, Mr. Camdessus said, adding that Russia would have to take some initial steps to bring its inflation rate of 25 percent a month under control.
Yet he made clear that to receive the money, Russia would not have to commit itself to meeting specific targets in cutting inflation and its budget deficit. These are among the strict conditions the fund usually demands before lending money.
Mr. Camdessus said the fund would lend Russia up to $30 billion during the next four or five years to help its conversion to a market economy.
He said the new program, known as the "Systemic Transformation Facility," was being set up to help Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other former Socialist countries that are hurt by the rapidly rising cost of exports. Many of their trading partners are demanding hard currency rather than soft rubles in payment for their exports.
 
Loans on Easy Terms
 He said several Eastern Europe nations, including Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland, might qualify for loans under the program, as might several Asian countries, including Laos, Cambodia and Mongolia.
The loans would be on easy terms, with repayment within 10 years and only interest payments required for four and a half years. The interest rate would be less than 6 percent.
Mr. Camdessus said he would like the fund's 175 member nations to agree to create more than $30 billion of the fund's own currency, known as special drawing rights, that could be used to help end the global economic slowdown and provide aid for developing nations. In recent years, the United States, Germany and several other industrial nations have blocked this idea.

HEADLINE: Japan Threatens Action to Brake the Soaring Yen

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday April 21

 BODY:
A shellshocked Japanese Government threatened tough action Tuesday to brake the yen's soaring value against the dollar, while complaining that the currency's rise was jeopardizing the economy's nascent recovery from a recession.
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa attempted to sound an aggressive note when he commented to reporters here today that "it's time to intervene" in the market, by having Japan's central bank sell yen and buy dollars. He called the yen's rise "too rapid." 
 Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, also warned in a speech that the rise could have a "massive impact" on Japanese exporters, whose goods are now much more expensive for overseas consumers.
 
Called a Mixed Blessing
 But many economists said it appeared there was little the Government could do to reverse the powerful trend on its own, and described the yen's appreciation as a mixed blessing for Japan. They also noted that the United States and other governments supported a stronger yen as one way to reduce Japan's big trade surplus.
In spite of intervention by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange market Tuesday and today, the dollar tumbled to 109.90 yen here this afternoon, its lowest level against the Japanese currency since World War II, before rebounding above the 110-yen level in later trading. The dollar has seen a decline of more than 11 percent since the beginning of the year. Earlier in New York on Tuesday, the yen was quoted at 110.55 [Page D18.]
Yoshihisa Kitai, a senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank, said that by crimping exports, the strong yen, known here as "endaka," could eventually hurt Japan's economic recovery. A 10 percent appreciation of the yen, he said, decreases Japan's gross national product growth by a half percentage point.
"The point is simple, the profits of exporters are going to start to decline," he said.
On the other hand, he noted, endaka has a flip side: imports, particularly for critical goods like oil, will be cheaper. That is expected to keep inflation below 2 percent this year. The Government may also be pressured to reduce interest rates to temper the yen's rise, which will stimulate economic growth, Mr. Kitai said.
"The problem is just the short term, I think," Mr. Kitai commented. "In the long run endaka is good news for the Japanese economy. The lower interest rates may compensate for the higher yen."
 
Clinton's Remark Recalled
 One factor behind the the yen's rapid rise was President Clinton's remark last Friday after a Washington meeting with Mr. Miyazawa. He characterized the yen's appreciation as a positive trend to help reduce Japan's huge trade surplus, which could reach $150 billion this year.
Traders took the remark as a green light to sell dollars and buy yen, without fear that the Federal Reserve would try to moderate the movement.
Japanese Government officials have continuously said that they are not opposed to a gradual increase in the value of the yen. The swiftness of the latest rise is what has unnerved them and prompted the verbal assaults by Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Mieno on the foreign exchange market.
Mr. Mieno sought to influence traders by offering his own analysis of what President Clinton meant by his remark on Friday.
The President, Mr. Mieno suggested, was not calling for a further rise in the yen's value against the dollar, but was only confirming that broadly speaking a strong yen was one means by which Japan's trade surplus could be reduced. The White House offered no clarification of its own.
European Community officials have also reacted positively to the yen's appreciation, thereby lessening the chances of concerted intervention by the central banks to slow the yen's rise.

HEADLINE: U.S. Prepares to Get Tough With Haiti's Generals

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 20

 BODY:
After weeks of quiet support for United Nations diplomacy in Haiti, Washington has begun sending strong signals that it will not tolerate delaying tactics or outright defiance by military leaders of international efforts to reinstate the country's exiled president.
In recent days, American diplomats have begun privately spelling out a series of new sanctions that the military leadership and its supporters here will soon face unless they accept a United Nations-brokered plan to end the 19-month political stalemate. American diplomats have begun to warn Haitian authorities publicly against further stalling. 
 But in a defiant speech to the nation tonight, Haiti's army-backed Prime Minister, Marc L. Bazin, rejected the United Nations mediation effort, calling it "doomed to failure." Mr. Bazin, whose Government is not recognized abroad, said that "any solution that is not the product of real and frank negotiation can only be imposed by force."
The stepped-up American role comes after United Nations mediators failed last week to conclude an agreement with military leaders that would have called for their resignation and the return of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In exchange for their cooperation, the army leaders had been offered a general amnesty for politically related crimes and violence.
The first sign of the stepped-up American involvement came Saturday, when Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with the United Nations envoy, Dante Caputo, just hours after Haitian commanders rejected Mr. Caputo's settlement terms.
Injecting the United States more directly into the diplomatic effort, Mr. Christopher said Saturday that Washington hoped that given a weekend of reflection, the Haitian military would reverse its decision. "It's time for the military leadership of Haiti to indicate its agreement on the key points of a settlement," he said.
Today, as he voted for a resolution authorizing the deployment of dozens of United Nations human-rights observers here, the United States representative to the United Nations, Edward Walker, said: "To the Haitian parties, we say, you must negotiate seriously, with promptness and flexibility. To the Haitian people, we say, the world has not forgotten you."
Since Mr. Christopher's statement, several Haitians said the special charge d'affaires, Charles Redman, had begun warning people, in private audiences with affluent backers of the September 1991 military coup against Father Aristide, that a series of finely targeted punitive measures were rapidly being prepared.
The United States Embassy here has declined to describe any of the measures, but officials familiar with diplomatic efforts said the sanctions would include the cancellation of visas for coup supporters and their children studying in the United States, the freezing of financial assets and the interruption of commercial air traffic.
If these measures failed, the officials said, stronger sanctions could also be imposed, including severing oil supplies to the island and cutting off trade across Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic. Asked if possible punitive measures had been described to those resisting a settlement, a spokesman for the embassy said: "Positively. We have made them clear."
Since the outset of United Nations efforts in December, many of Father Aristide's opponents have sneered at international diplomacy aimed at restoring him to office. To many of them the essential question has always been the determination of Washington to force the issue.
"The Caputo mission has precipitated a crisis, but in a good way," said one participant in the negotiations. "It has demonstrated that the military is not willing to give in without more pressure, and it is up to the United States to apply that pressure. This is not a time for quiet diplomacy."
Since the rejection of Mr. Caputo's proposals, American officials have said they have felt that, with the crisis close to settlement, a strong push was needed to seal the agreement before momentum was lost. "We really have to move forward," said one official "If we lose time we are really in trouble."

HEADLINE: George Mickelson, 52, Governor Of South Dakota, Dies in a Crash

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PIERRE, S.D., April 20

 BODY:
Gov. George S. Mickelson of South Dakota, who followed his father's career path from a rural law practice to the state's highest office, died in a plane crash in Iowa on Monday night, a spokesman for his office said. He was 52.
Governor Mickelson was one of eight people killed in the crash about 15 miles southwest of Dubuque as they were returning from a trip to Cincinnati to promote economic development in the state, the spokesman said. Engine trouble was suspected. 
 Mr. Mickelson was co-chairman of the National Governors Association's task force on health care.
A Republican, Mr. Mickelson was first elected in 1986 and won another four-year term in 1990. He also served six years in the South Dakota House, where he was Speaker in 1979-80.
Lieut. Gov. Walter Dale Miller, who succeeded Governor Mickelson today, vowed to try "to accomplish all he wanted to accomplish for us."
 
A Home-Grown Style
 Mr. Mickelson was the son of George T. Mickelson, who served as South Dakota's Governor from 1947 to 1951.
When he followed his father into the Governor's mansion, he focused on economic development, encouraging manufacturing growth in a state that is more dependent on agriculture than any other sector.
He sought to raise teachers' salaries, among the lowest in the nation, and in 1989 made two record increases in state aid to school districts by setting aside 56 percent of the state's sales tax revenue.
Mr. Mickelson tried to improve relations between Indians and non-Indians in South Dakota, naming 1990 the Year of Reconciliation. Several times he sat with Sioux leaders and smoked the sacred pipe.
He had a home-grown style, often driving a pick-up truck to work. He was a popular member of the South Dakota House for six years, quitting in 1980.
In 1989, Mr. Mickelson's teen-age son, David, was charged with a sexual offense after a 16-year-old girl said she had been raped during a party at the Governor's Mansion. The Governor and Mrs. Mickelson were out of town at the time. David Mickelson was acquitted of the sex charge but was placed on probation for under-age consumption of alcohol. He and another boy at the party were ordered to pay the girl's medical bills.
 
Served in Vietnam
 Mr. Mickelson was born in Mobridge, S.D., and lived in the eastern South Dakota city of Brookings and the state capital, Pierre. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration and a law degree from the University of South Dakota.
After two years in the Army in Vietnam, he practiced law in Brookings, then served as Brookings County state's attorney and assistant state attorney general.
In addition to his son, Mr. Mickelson is survived by his wife, the former Linda McCahren; another son, Mark, and a daughter, Amy.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 23.50, as Profit Taking Sets In

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Investors could survey a procession of bad news yesterday -- upward pressure on interest rates, worse-than-expected housing starts, even some saber-rattling in the Senate about Bosnia and Herzegovina -- but they needed little excuse to accelerate the stock market's downward slide that began on Monday. "Profit taking" was the phrase of the day.
Moreover, in a paradoxical trading session, news that would have shaken the market a year ago -- a huge first-quarter loss at I.B.M. -- had little effect; I.B.M. shares even closed up by 1 3/8, to 50 5/8.
 
The New Direction: Down
 Market pessimists saw fresh evidence that a market adrift was at last finding a direction: all the major indexes were down. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as 46 points in early afternoon trading before recovering weakly to close with a loss of 23.50 points at 3,443.49. That followed a drop of 11.62 points on Monday after investors Friday had established a record-high Dow of 3,478.61.
The Dow Jones transportation average closed down 22.16 points, to 1,645.01, a sharper drop than Monday's 15.91-point decline. The Dow Jones utility average dropped 2.07 points, to 243.30, almost matching Monday's decline of 2.31 points.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed down 1.30 points, to 245.72, and volume on the Big Board was an especially heavy 318 million shares, up about 30 percent from Monday and about 4 percent higher than Friday's volume. Losing stocks yesterday far outnumbered the winners, 1,232 to 698.
 
Declines Across the Board

 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 closed down 2.36 points, to 445.10, a sharper drop than Monday's decline of 1.48 points. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.06 points, to 661.97, a gentler dip than Monday's decline of 3.75 points.
The market decline seemed to cut through a variety of sectors. Nine stocks dragged down the Dow industrials 2 points or more.
The Dow declining stocks were led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which fell 2 points; American Telephone and Telegraph, which slid 1 3/4, and Goodyear Tire, off 1 3/8. All of those companies' shares had been trading near their record highs and thus were vulnerable to profit taking. These three stocks alone accounted for nearly half of the Dow decline. Offsetting the decliners were shares of the International Business Machines Corporation, whose price rise lifted the Dow nearly 2 1/2 points.
An examination of the S.& P. 500 showed that a broad variety of interest-sensitive stocks were hurt by negative news. Regional banks and money center banks were especially hard hit. Nationsbank closed down 2 3/8 points, to 52 3/8, and Wells Fargo dropped 5 1/2, to 113 7/8, while BankAmerica closed down 1 1/2, to 50 1/4.
Also hurt were American General, a multiline insurance company, which closed down 1 point, to 30 7/8, and Merrill Lynch, the brokerage house, off 1 1/2, to 73 7/8.
The biggest percentage loser on the Big Board, at 21.76 percent, on a decline of 4 5/8 points, to 16 5/8, was Venture Stores. The regional discount store chain said first-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: Panel Receives Familiar Pleas To Retain Bases

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., April 20

 BODY:
They complained of shoddy staff work and secret back-room deals and evoked images of legions of skilled military technicians unfairly tossed out of work. In short, a truly nefarious situation.
In the first of nine hearings nationwide, a Presidential commission that will decide the fate of scores of military bases heard lawmakers, community leaders and union chiefs today make angry and anguished pleas to save their local installations. 
 The Defense Department has recommended closing 31 large installations and shrinking or consolidating 134 others; today's hearing focused on more than a dozen bases in Pennsylvania and Virginia. More than 500 people, including six busloads of off-duty Navy workers from the Naval Aviation Depot in Norfolk, squeezed into a community auditorium here and cascaded cheers and applause on speakers making their case.
No speaker today opposed cutting Pentagon spending in the post-cold-war world, so long as it didn't involve closing a local base.
Virginia, among the states with the highest military spending per capita, stands to lose nearly 15,000 civilian jobs from the proposed closings. In a refrain that has already become familiar from Norfolk to San Diego, speakers warned that the Pentagon's plan would bring economic disaster to their region and ruin to the armed forces.
"We in Virginia have been preparing for reductions in defense spending," said Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. "But we believe the Navy's findings are flawed, and deserve intense scrutiny by the members of this commission."
Commission members tried to sound sympathetic, but the torrent of mail and phone calls from concerned communities since the Pentagon's recommendations were made public a month ago seems to have already stretched thin the patience of most members.
"I can't imagine all the data from every base is flawed," said Beverly B. Byron, a commission member who is a former Democratic Congresswoman from Maryland, after listening to complaints from plant managers and legislators. Pentagon analysts vigorously defend their recommendations.
The eight-member Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission has until July 1 to give its final recommendations to President Clinton, who must accept or reject the findings in their entirety. Congress would then approve or disapprove the package.
Commission members praised the presentations from Virginia lawmakers and community groups representing bases that include the Norfolk depot and a cluster of Navy offices in suburbs outside Washington. In the end, commission members said, the Defense Department simply cannot afford all its bases anymore.
With a panoply of colored charts and graphs, however, the Virginia base supporters made their case.
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, a former Secretary of the Navy in the Nixon Administration, talked about the importance of keeping naval personnel and contracting offices near the Pentagon instead of transferring them 50 miles away to a base in Maryland.
Ross Haines, plant manager of the the Norfolk depot, contended that the Navy used inflated labor costs in its analysis and underestimated the military value of the depot, one of six the Navy uses to repair aircraft and ships.
Members of the commission nodded in acknowledgement, but they also asked the speakers for a little understanding.
 
Data Called 'Hard to Weigh'

"I assure you that every other depot will come in here and make their case and emphasize their strengths," said Harry McPherson, a commission member. "Not only is the data subject to question, but it is hard to weigh."
Not for the many people who crowded the auditorium, including many off-duty Navy workers. During a break in the hearing, Golden Shepard, a 60-year-old electronics technician who has worked at the Norfolk Depot for 38 years, said: "Jobs are very hard to find these days. I just pray to God that the commission will take the truth into consideration and take us off the list."
If the Norfolk depot closes, said James Jones, 43, an aircraft examiner, he would have to move to find work, just as he and his wife are building a new house.
"Working military aircraft is the only thing I've ever done since graduating from high school," Mr. Jones said. "We'd have no objections if we felt this had been done in a fair and reasonable manner. But it hasn't."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Gambling stocks have been a better bet than gambling

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
CASINO gamblers would have fared well last year if they had hedged their bets and invested in stocks of the companies they patronized.
Gambling parlor stocks rose more than 50 percent in 1992, and some have done as well this year, despite concerns about growing competition. Over all, the industry is booming, with dozens of casinos planned for Indian lands and a small fleet of riverboats in the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Earlier this week two small operators, Primadonna Resorts of Las Vegas, Nev., and Jumer Hotels and Casinos, a Peoria, Ill., operator of riverboats, announced plans for public stock offerings to take advantage of the industry's expansion into more states.
With growing evidence that gambling has lost its stigma in the public's eyes, more states are looking to casinos as a source of revenue and economic development. Political leaders in staid Kansas, for example, want to allow casinos on Indian lands to compete with Iowa riverboats. New York last week decided to allow an Indian casino near Syracuse to help the local economy.
Although the opening of new markets is widely expected to steal customers from some existing casinos, many analysts expect spending on gambling to grow fast enough to satisfy old and new casinos, with occasional exceptions for saturated markets. At Wertheim Schroeder & Company, a recent report predicts that casino gambling will grow 15 percent this year and next, nearly three times faster than the economy.
"We are in the throes of a classic speculative bubble," said I. Nelson Rose, a professor of law at the Whittier Law School in Los Angeles and a consultant to the gambling industry. Although the industry may continue growing another two decades, he said some newcomers had "fantasy ideas about the amount of money to be made."
John J. Rohs, an analyst at Wertheim, prefers to ride the growth with stocks of larger, experienced companies. "Right now there are a lot of people trying to take advantage, and there will eventually have to be some shakeout," he said. His only recommended gambling stock is Mirage Resorts, though he has positive opinions on the Promus Companies, Caesars World and Hilton Hotels.
Others see opportunity in smaller, more nimble companies. Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, recommends the Argosy Gaming Company as "a pure play on the proliferation of gaming in new markets." Competition is intense in new markets, but Argosy's managers have "demonstrated political sensitivity," he said.
Until last week Mr. Manson also recommended Showboat, which is expanding in New Orleans and Canada. Donaldson, Lufkin handled the public offering of Showboat stock last year, and its recommendation was suspended while the company prepared another stock offering.
Another New Orleans hopeful is the aptly named Boomtown Inc., of Verdi, Nev., which closed yesterday at $22.50, up $1.50, more than twice the $11 price when it was publicly offered last September.
Just as Iowa's riverboat gambling was decimated when Illinois was opened to riverboats, analysts warn that riverboats on the Mississippi and Gulf Coast should expect stiff competition from a Las Vegas-sized casino planned for New Orleans.
Apart from the dangers of too many casinos, Mr. Rose said the gambling industry could be hurt by a shift in public opinion similar to that after a scandal 70 years ago in the Louisiana lottery.
"Throughout history, every society that has allowed casinos to cater to locals has eventually outlawed gambling," Mr. Rose of the Whittier Law School said. "Nobody cares if the money is being sucked out of tourists, but when it is sucked from the local economy, there is a backlash."

HEADLINE: Gore Congratulates Poland on Its Democracy

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WARSAW, April 20

 BODY:
In his first major speech abroad as Vice President, Al Gore congratulated members of the Polish Parliament today on the progress their country had made in moving from Communism to democracy and capitalism.
Poland, where more than half the workers are in private enterprises and smooth democratic elections have been held, was showing the best economic and political health of the Eastern European countries that ousted Communist rulers in 1989, he said. 
 "In Poland the signs are, after all, a lot better than elsewhere," Mr. Gore told the main chamber of Parliament. "Travelers from the rest of Eastern Europe come to Poland and catch their breath. The Poles are keeping the promises of 1989. There is no lethargy in Poland; Poland is a land at work."
"The rest of Eastern Europe is inspired by your example, and so are we," he added.
Mr. Gore ended his two-day visit to Poland today after meeting with President Lech Walesa and talking to Polish environmental leaders. The focus of his trip was the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.
On Monday he joined the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Mr. Walesa at a ceremony attended by thousands of foreigners and hundreds of Holocaust survivors at the ghetto monument.
Mr. Rabin flew today to the Auschwitz death camp, 200 miles southwest of Warsaw, where as many as 1.6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis. Last year, Chaim Herzog, who was then President, was the first Israeli leader to visit Auschwitz, where the gas chambers are preserved as a museum.
After meeting with Mr. Walesa today, Mr. Rabin went out of his way to advance the often tortuous relationship between Poland and Israel. "After two days I cannot be an expert, but I see a policy that tries to bring about improvement, a change of attitude, an opposition to any kind of discrimination, racism or anti-Semitism," Mr. Rabin said at a news conference.
He regretted, he said, a derogatory statement about Poland in 1989 by Israel's Prime Minister at the time, Yitzhak Shamir, who was born in Poland and whose family perished at the hands of the Nazis. Poles, Mr. Shamir said in 1989, sucked in anti-Semitism with their mother's milk.
"I do not like to comment on statements made in Israel from abroad, but I would have preferred that this statement had not been made," Mr. Rabin said.
Israel and Poland resumed diplomatic ties in 1990, after the Communist Government fell. The Communists had conducted several anti-Semitic campaigns, the most virulent in 1968, when many of the Jews remaining in Poland after World War II left for Israel.
But the prospects for improved relations between the Walesa Government and Israel dimmed when a nearly decade-old controversy over a Roman Catholic convent on the perimeter of the Auschwitz camp persisted. Last week, Pope John Paul II ordered the 14 nuns in the convent to vacate, a move that Jewish organizations had sought.
Mr. Gore suggested today that the new Poland could be a model for tolerance, saying: "Serbia and Poland stand at opposite ends of a moral world. I am here to state my faith in the proposition that the future belongs to Poland's resolve to seek a democratic society, where differences among people are celebrated, not feared."

In a Reversal, Conde Nast Closes HG

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
HG, a leading decorating magazine since its founding as House & Garden in 1901, will cease publication after its July issue, Conde Nast Publications announced yesterday.
"They had a beautiful sensibility about interiors and they really were always right on target about what was happening," said Stephen Sills of Stephen Sills and Associates, a residential and commercial design firm. "It's the end of an era."
 
Deal With Knapp
 HG was done in by its chief rival, Architectural Digest, which officially became part of the Conde Nast family yesterday. In a deal announced last month, Conde Nast acquired Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit from Knapp Communications for $175 million, giving rise to speculation about whether Conde Nast could profitably publish both HG and Architectural Digest, two of the leading interior design magazines. 
 When the Knapp sale was announced, Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast Magazines, said that HG would not be closed and would co-exist with Architectural Digest. But yesterday it was a different story.
"We did the acquisition with the intention that we would continue the two magazines," Mr. Leser said. "But we reluctantly came to the conclusion that with the two magazines continuing as they were, both editors would be putting out a redundancy."
HG is the first core Conde Nast magazine to cease publication. Vanity Fair was discontinued during the Depression but was resurrected by the company in 1983.
As a result of the Knaap deal, Conde Nast now also owns two food magazines: its own Gourmet and Knapp's Bon Appetit. Mr. Leser said yesterday that these could co-exist comfortably, because unlike HG and Architectural Digest, they do not compete head to head for advertisers. Bon Appetit depends mostly on food advertising while the major source of ads for Gourmet, despite its name, is the travel industry.
Mr. Leser called yesterday's action "the hardest, most emotionally upsetting decision" that he and S. I. Newhouse, the owner of Conde Nast, have had to make in their many years at the company. He said the company would place as many of the staff as possible at its other publications. Nancy Novogrod, the editor in chief, will stay on, in the new position of editor, special book projects.
The news that HG would cease publication rippled through a meeting of the American Society of Magazine Editors in New York yesterday.
"It went like wildfire through the group," said Dorothy Kalins, former editor in chief of Metropolitan Home. "It was like the death of a friend. No matter how much of a competitor they were to me, they were like the worthy adversary on the hill. I think everybody was shocked."
The news also sent out a signal that the magazine industry's recovery from the advertising recession may not be as strong as publishers like to suggest. The home-decorating category has been hit particularly hard.
In 1992, Architectural Digest was down 10 percent in ad pages and HG, down 20 percent. Both magazines were privately held, so it could not be determined how much these drops affected their revenues.
But Architectural Digest, with 1,155 ad pages in 1992, was well ahead of HG, with 760. The two were almost equal in circulation. At the end of 1992 HG led with 695,958, compared with 653,648 for its rival, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
Kevin Madden, the publisher of HG who will become publisher of Bon Appetit, said that HG had expanded its advertising base to categories like fashion, beauty and automotive but that even these had not been able to counter the loss of business in its core category of home furnishing.
 
No Thought of a Sale

 Mr. Leser said that there had been no thought of selling HG or of downgrading it to a more mass magazine.
HG, in the days when it was known as House & Garden, was far more of a middle-class magazine than in recent years. In 1981, under its editor in chief, Louis Oliver Gropp, now editor in chief of Hearst's House Beautiful, it began to upgrade itself and compete against Architectural Digest.
In 1987, Anna Wintour, who had been editor in chief of British Vogue, took over and in an effort to revitalize it made the magazine younger and hipper, and changed its name to HG. Many readers were appalled and canceled their subscriptions. Ms. Wintour went on to become editor in chief of Vogue and Ms. Novogrod, second in command, became editor in chief.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Citicorp and Chemical Post Jumps in Earnings

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Citicorp and several other major banks reported sharply increased earnings yesterday, largely because their losses from bad loans had fallen faster than expected.
The loan income of many banks continues to be strong because of the wide gap between the interest they charge on loans and what they pay on deposits. And banks that actively trade currencies and securities have posted stellar results in these areas largely because of declines in European interest rates, which raise the value of their European bonds. 
 In addition, most banks enjoyed an earnings gain in the latest quarter because of new accounting rules that allow them to recognize now the value of tax credits that they will be able to use in the future.
Despite the overall solid performance, bank stocks fell. The Standard & Poor's index of money-center bank stocks declined by 1.9 percent yesterday, and its regional bank index fell by 2.5 percent. Analysts said investors might be worried about the prospect of rising interest rates.
"Every number reported was better than we expected," said Robert Albertson, a banking analyst with Goldman Sachs & Company. "The bottom line is the stocks are down for reasons other than the earnings."
Following are the details of the banks' results:
 
Citicorp
 Citicorp reported a profit of $670 million for the quarter, benefiting from a $300 million gain from the accounting change related to income taxes. The bank's revenue before accounting changes of $370 million was almost double the $183 million reported a year earlier.
The earnings increase at the nation's largest banking company was largely a result of a 44 percent decline in the amount set aside for future loan losses, to $689 million. The bank also benefited from lower losses on credit card loans and increased trading revenue.
The bank took a charge of $64 million to cover costs associated with getting out of the business of managing money in India.
Losses from Citicorp's huge North American real estate portfolio continued to decline. The bank wrote off $168 million of real estate loans, down from $194 million in the fourth quarter and $362 million a year ago. Citicorp sold $125 million in foreclosed real estate, mostly at 67 percent of the original value.
The bank's Tier 1 capital, a measure of its financial strength, increased to 5.2 percent from 4.9 percent at the end of 1992.
At Citicorp's shareholder meeting in New York yesterday, John S. Reed, the chairman, said Citicorp would probably not restore its dividend until next year.
Citibank reported a return on equity of 17.9 percent, or 14.3 percent before the accounting change, up from 7.2 percent a year earlier.
 
Chemical <HGE>
 The Chemical Banking Corporation reported a profit of $374 million, up 44 percent from $260 million a year earlier.
The latest results for the No. 3 banking company were reduced by a restructuring charge of $30 million for its acquisition of most of First City Bancorporation of Texas. The net gain from accounting changes related to income taxes and to retiree benefits was $35 million.
The bank's interest income rose slightly, to $1.2 billion, and the income from trading and fees climbed 15 percent, to $925 million.
Chemical's credit quality was stable, as it charged off $312 million of bad loans, other than loans to developing companies, and replenished its reserves by the same amount. The charge-offs were about the same as in the fourth quarter of last year and down from $375 million in the first quarter of 1992.
Chemical said its merger with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation last year had reduced expenses by $110 million in the quarter. More than 5,500 jobs have been eliminated.
The bank's Tier 1 capital rose to 7.4 percent from 6.6 percent last year. And its return on equity increased to 16.5 percent from 13.24.
 
Banc One
 The Banc One Corporation reported a profit of $272 million in the first quarter, up from $171 million a year earlier. The 1992 results were restated to reflect several acquisitions, including the Valley National Corporation in Arizona.
Earnings at the nation's eighth-largest banking company were bolstered by a 10 percent increase in net interest income and by a sharply lower provision for possible credit losses. Fee income was down slightly.
Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, reported a gain of $18 million related to the accounting for income taxes and a charge of $20 million related to the Arizona acquisition.
Banc One's return on equity reached 19.24 percent, up from 13.22 percent a year earlier.
 
Bankers Trust
 The Bankers Trust New York Corporation reported earnings of $155 million for the first quarter, after a $75 million charge for accounting changes related to retiree benefits, against earnings of $600 million a year earlier, which were restated to include $446 million from accounting changes related to income taxes.
Excluding the accounting changes, profits at the No. 7 banking company rose 49 percent, to $230 million.
Bankers Trust, which concentrates on currency and securities trading, benefited substantially from the volatile European markets. Trading revenues were up 60 percent, to $346 million. Earnings from interest, which are largely related to securities held in the trading account, increased 70 percent, to $270 million.
The bank reported a return on equity, disregarding the accounting changes, of 24.3 percent, up from 19.8 percent a year earlier.
 
Wells Fargo
 Wells Fargo & Company reported net income of $108 million for the first quarter, down 9 percent from $119 million a year earlier.
The nation's ninth-largest banking company attributed most of the decline to higher expenses for salaries, foreclosed property and advertising.
The loan portfolio of the San Francisco-based company, which is a major California real estate lender, appeared to be improving. Wells set aside $210 million for future loan losses, down slightly from $215 million a year earlier and down significantly from the $300 million in the final quarter of 1992.
Charge-offs for bad loans decreased to $155 million from $199 million in the previous quarter, with improvements in commercial real estate and construction loans. The bank charged of $150 million in bad loans in the first quarter of last year.
The bank's profitability slipped, with a return on equity of 12.1 percent, versus 15.4 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Serving Up Blackjack Along With Borscht?;
Catskills Resort Owners Put Their Hopes in New Attitudes Toward Casino Gambling

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIAMESHA LAKE, N.Y., April 19

 BODY:
George Parker is fed up with the name Borscht Belt. As chairman of the Concord, one of the largest resorts in the Catskills, he is tired of being associated exclusively with the comedy, dance styles, decor, music and even food of another era. Sick, in other words, of running on nostalgia.
So as he strolls through his 1,225-room hotel, past the 1968 photograph of a youthful Woody Allen looking like a deer caught in headlights, past the club where his onetime baby sitter, Buddy Hackett, got his start, past the dining room where, indeed, borscht is still served, he is talking about a new vision. A vision with appeal to middle-class families and upscale singles, a vision more exciting than shuffleboard or even Simon Sez, a vision for the 90's. 
 Mr. Parker is talking about slot machines.
"We're already surrounded by casino gambling," he said. "By next year, you'll be able to drive three hours in just about any direction and reach a casino. It's going to be pervasive. And if New York doesn't do something, it will lose out."
For more than a decade, the resort owners of the Catskills -- a dying breed -- have argued that casino gambling was as important to their survival as liquor licenses, golf courses and indoor pools were in the 1940's, 50's and 60's. And for over a decade, the Legislature has voted against them.
But this year, the entreaties have gained a sudden urgency because of the spread of casino gambling nationwide. Last year, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians opened a casino in Connecticut, 1 of 19 states with Indian gambling compacts and the first in the Northeast. In the last five years, South Dakota, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Louisiana and Mississippi have legalized some form of casino gambling off Indian reservations, joining Nevada and New Jersey.
And last week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed a compact that virtually assures the opening of a high-stakes casino by the Oneida Indians near Syracuse. A second compact, with the St. Regis Mohawks near the Canadian border, may be signed within weeks.
Faced with the likelihood that New Yorkers will be traveling in droves to wager millions not only in other states but in non-taxable Indian communities within their own, state legislators are looking at gambling with a fresh and, many say, supportive eye.
"The dynamic is very different than last time this came up," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Republican from Coxsackie who opposes gambling. "Because of the bad economy and because people see other states doing it, they're saying, 'Let's jump on the bandwagon.' "
Quietly and largely behind the scenes, lobbying for statewide gambling is well under way. The Catskills Resort Association, which represents the region's nine largest hotels, has retained one of Albany's best known lobbyists, Lester M. Shulklapper, for $25,000 a year. A statewide hotel association is expected to add its support. And gambling proposals with bipartisan support have been introduced in both houses of the Legislature.
Opponents are hedging their bets. The Racing and Wagering Industry of New York, which represents race tracks, has begun telling Legislators that casino gambling is a bad idea unless it is done in Offtrack Betting parlors or at race tracks.
The battle could be a long one. A constitutional amendment is needed to make for-profit casino gambling legal, and that requires approval by two successive Legislatures followed by a statewide referendum. The earliest a gambling proposal could go before voters would be the fall of 1995.
 
Issue Has Changed
 By comparison, a 1988 Federal law allows federally recognized Indian tribes to open high-stakes casinos once they sign agreements with the states where they reside.
Legislative leaders have said it is too early to gauge support for the measures, and they said no proposal is likely to be brought to a vote soon.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, said: "He's troubled by the expansion of gambling opportunities. But he realizes with gambling on reservations, the idea has to be acknowledged."
From Far Rockaway to Niagara Falls, resort owners have been buoyed by the state's compact with the Oneidas, which they say will soften moral opposition to gambling. And while Indian casinos are exempt from state taxes, casinos in resort communities could fatten state coffers in otherwise lean times.
 
'Where It Does Most Good'
 In Illinois, six riverboat casinos that have been operating since last year generate $8.3 million in state and local taxes each month, according to the Illinois Gaming Board.
"People will now say, we've got gambling anyway, we might as well put it where it does the most good," said David A. Slutsky, vice president of the Nevele Hotel in Ellenville.
Nowhere has talk about casinos been more fervent than in the Catskills, where the once-thriving resort industry has become a shadow of its former self.
Though tourism still generates over $500 million each year and provides over 6,000 jobs in Sullivan County, those numbers have been declining steadily, county officials say. The county's unemployment rate, 11.3 percent, is almost 4 percentage points higher than the state average. And since 1990, three major resorts -- including the famous Grossinger's -- have filed for bankruptcy or closed.
"It's not what it used to be, let's put it that way," said Mr. Shulklapper. "You can see it in the deferred maintenance at hotels. And the attendance is not what it used to be. It's just as easy to go to Atlantic City."
 
Empty Pools, 'For Rent' Signs
 All along State Highway 52 between Ellenville and Liberty are signs of the Catskill's demise: empty swimming pools grown thick with ivy, bungalow colonies with cracked paint and loose shutters that bang in the wind, darkened hotels with "for rent" signs. Here, the billboards seem to advertise only themselves.
Even at major resorts which have weathered and sometimes prospered through recession, there is a sense that time is frozen in the 1950's, the region's heyday. Sound systems play Muzak versions of Broadway showtunes. Jell-O is a featured desert. And mirrors are a major component of every lobby.
To some, that is a sign the region has failed to stay competitive. "Once this generation passes on, they are going to need something to get their children to come," said Mike Cotton, a bartender at the Nevele. "Gambling could be it."
Catskill resort owners say they would market casino gambling as one attraction among many, no different than golfing or tennis, and just as suitable for families.
Mr. Parker of the Concord would convert a 24,000-square-foot lounge into a gambling room. "You could leave your kids and play blackjack for an hour," he said, "and your child wouldn't even know the casino was here."
The third generation of a family that has owned the hotel since 1937, Mr. Parker bristled at the notion that casinos would attract prostitution or crime. "I don't care where you go," he said, "you have those things."

HEADLINE: Democrats Muster Only Weak Majority on Stimulus Package

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
Senate Democrats barely mustered a majority on a test vote today for the scaled-down version of President Clinton's economic-stimulus bill and made no progress toward breaking a Republican filibuster.
Five Democrats deserted the President when the Senate voted, 52 to 46, to make the $15.4 billion measure he proposed last Friday, reduced from an earlier $19.5 billion, the bill it will consider if it ever gets to a final vote. A vote on ending the filibuster is scheduled for Wednesday morning, but most Democrats expect to fall short of the 60 votes that Senate rules require to halt debate. 
 Fifty-two Democrats voted for the $15.4 billion measure. Forty-one Republicans voted against it. They were joined by five Democratic Senators, James J. Exon and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Russell Feingold and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Richard Shelby of Alabama. Two Republicans did not vote.
Earlier, the Senate Republicans had offered an alternative of their own, which was rejected on a 53-to-45 vote. That plan proposed to spend $4 billion for extended unemployment benefits, and another $2 billion for highways, summer youth jobs, immunizations and small-business loans.
 
Wary of the Deficit
 Republicans have insisted that they oppose Mr. Clinton's program because it would add to the Federal deficit, so they proposed to make up for their $2 billion in stimulative spending with $2 billion in unspecified "administrative savings" in the Federal departments that handle those programs.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, sought to make Mr. Clinton the issue. He said Republicans had voted for stimulus programs that increased the deficit when Ronald Reagan was President. But now, he said: "Our Republican colleagues don't want to give the President a chance. They want to embarrass the President and cause his program to fail."
Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, disagreed. "It's not to embarrass the President, but it's because we believe we have come to a day of reckoning," he said. "This is the day of accountability."
He said the issue was not "gridlock," as Democrats argued, but "a distinction of principle between the two political parties." While the 43 Senate Republicans often differ among themselves, he said, "fundamentally and basically we are all fiscal conservatives."
 
Whose Gridlock Is It?
 Mr. Hatfield had failed to persuade his Republican colleagues to support a slightly more expensive program, one with $4 billion in stimulus spending besides the unemployment money, and $4 billion in reductions in administrative expenditures.
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee, said Republicans were willing to pay for jobless benefits but not for programs that would create jobs and get people off the unemployment rolls. He said the "minority perpetuates the gridlock."
Some senators said they thought that the expected failure of Wednesday's vote to end debate would finally lead to the first serious efforts at compromise since the fight began three weeks ago. Others said the Democrats were likely to give up and settle for the unemployment money alone in the Senate and make the case to the country that the Republicans were the party of inaction and stalling.
Mr. Byrd would not predict what would happen if the vote to end debate failed. "We'll roll our britches up when we get to the creek," he told reporters.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Pfizer Inc. and SmithKline Beecham reported robust gains yesterday in American drug sales for the first quarter. The results reflected strong demand for new products at both companies, overcoming the growing pressures on prices that had depressed results at many drug companies.
Pfizer shares jumped $3.25, closing at $65.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, as drug stocks rose again yesterday, continuing Monday's upswing. SmithKline Beecham's American depository receipts gained $1.50, to $34.75, on the Big Board. The London-based company said its American pharmaceutical sales were up 25 percent. 
 Analysts said drug stocks were benefiting as investors sold airlines and other cyclical stocks. "Fear of radical changes in health care may be diminishing," Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, said. "Tides have swung. The health-care marketplace is already visibly reforming, and President Clinton is having his share of problems."
 
Pfizer
 Pfizer's American drug sales were up 23 percent in the quarter over the year earlier, with only about 3 percent coming from price increases. Worldwide drug sales rose 19 percent.
"Virtually all our sales growth was from increased volume," William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer's chairman, said. The New York-based company has promised to keep increases within the general inflation rate.
Sales from continuing operations rose 15 percent in the quarter, and earnings before accounting charges and gains were up 25 percent.
Counting former revenues of three low-profit-margin units that Pfizer sold last year, overall sales rose 6 percent in the quarter. The company sold its Shiley heart valve, Coty cosmetics and minerals businesses for $824 million in all.
Noncash accounting changes last year for future retiree health benefits and new tax reporting rules had depressed 1992 earnings.
Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research, said Pfizer had the "best results so far of the U.S.-based drug companies."
Sales of Pfizer's Procardia XL heart drug increased 27 percent in the quarter, to $333 million. And Zoloft, an antidepressant, rose 23 percent, to $94.5 million.
 
SmithKline Beecham
 Reflecting a sharp decline in the British pound to $1.49 in the quarter, compared with $1.73 a year earlier, net income fell 4 percent in dollars. By contrast, profit in pounds was up 13.6 percent.
SmithKline Beecham's American results marked a turnaround from former heavy dependence on Tagamet, a $1 billion-a-year ulcer treatment. The company's worldwide drug sales rose 15 percent even though Tagamet declined 23 percent in the quarter.
Pointing to its success in selling to mail-order pharmacies and other managed-care discount buyers, SmithKline Beecham said its overall net prices had actually declined slightly in the quarter.

Treasury Yields Little Changed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yields on Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday as investors and traders kept prices in a narrow trading range.
The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.75 percent, from 6.72 percent Monday, as the price fell 11/32 , to 10427/32 in secondary trading. The yield has bounced from 6.75 percent to 6.72 percent since last Wednesday. 
 Prices of Treasury notes were mostly unchanged, or up or down just 1/32 . But the decline in the discount rate on Treasury bills continued. Yesterday, the discount rate on the three-month bill fell to 2.77 percent, its lowest level since Oct. 8, 1992, when many investors and traders were betting that the Federal Reserve would have to cut short-term interest rates to assure that the economic recovery would keep going.
Fewer analysts and forecasters agree with that outlook today, but that has not slowed the recent decline in short-term interest rates.
There was little news to move the market, although the Commerce Department did report that housing starts in March were down 4.6 percent, in part because of bad weather.
But one analyst said that the report was basically ignored because traders and investors had already discounted for the bad weather effect last month.
 
California Issue
 The bond market swallowed a $3 billion issue from California yesterday, the largest single issue in the tax-free municipal market this year. The sale came as the state faced another round of budget cutting and revenue deficiencies that officials are hoping will not degenerate into another long legislative stalemate.
California, which is one of the largest issuers of municipal debt, sold an issue of short-term revenue anticipation notes through Lehman Brothers.
This type of note is used by many states, cities and towns for temporary borrowings in anticipation of revenue collection. The borrowing is needed to even out irregular income flows into the treasuries of states and local government.
The California notes, due on June 24, 1993, have a 3 percent coupon and are priced at a premium to yield 2.50 percent.
Moody's Investors Service gave the issue a MIG-1 rating, its highest for short maturities, while Standard & Poor's gave it an SP-1, a notch below its highest. The short-term top rating for California, given its fiscal problems last year, when it had to issue i.o.u.'s during a long budget stalemate, and the expectation of trouble again this year, is a plus for the state.
 
Lehman Ouster
 Mariel Clemensen, the director of high-yield bond research at Lehman Brothers, was ousted from the firm last week, it was disclosed yesterday. A Lehman spokesman said she would be replaced by Mark Grotevant, an analyst at the firm.
Neither Ms. Clemensen, who has built a reputation for careful analyses of corporate cash flows, nor a Lehman spokesman would say why she had left. But one person familiar with the situation called it a case of conflicting management styles.
Reached at her home, Ms. Clemensen said, "Lehman and I are exploring mutually acceptable means of concluding the relationship." She said she had a number of opportunities in the securities business and in investment management.
Ms. Clemensen came to Lehman almost two years ago, having previously run high-yield, or junk-bond, research, at Citicorp and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. She said she was proud of "completely revitalizing" the high-yield research effort at Lehman.
Lehman said Glenn Reynolds had been appointed to the newly created position of director of investment-grade bond research. He and Mr. Grotevant will report to Martha Dillman, director of fixed-income research.

HEADLINE: Bank for East Europe Lives Well in London

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 20

 BODY:
Jacques Attali has never been accused of excessive modesty in his grand plans for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the institution set up two years ago by the United States and other Western governments to help speed Eastern Europe's transition to capitalism.
Whether the bank will live up to Mr. Attali's goal of promoting democracy and ultimately forging a single vibrant market from Lisbon to Moscow may not be known for years. But Mr. Attali, the bank's president, has made sure it has a headquarters to match his vision. 
 For the last week Mr. Attali has been criticized for spending more taxpayer money on the new headquarters -- and on his flights on private jets -- than the bank has lent so far to the struggling economies of the former Soviet bloc. The Financial Times dubbed the institution "the bank that likes to say yes -- to itself," after it was the first to compare the bank's $300 million spending on itself with the $150 million it has lent out.
Nearly $83 million of its spending was on the new London headquarters, a gleaming building in the financial district that looks more like a Hollywood set designer's version of Big Business than the home of a government-financed bureaucracy. Standard marble was not good enough for the lobby, bank officials decided. So they tore it out and replaced it with higher-quality stone. The cost: $1.1 million.
 
Meeting With Chairman
 Mr. Attali, a French intellectual who discussed the issue today in a meeting with Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister who is chairman of the bank's board, has strongly defended the institution's record. The bank said it was "very cautious in the use of shareholders' money and is subject to auditing procedures, as well as the control of its governing bodies." It said the new building "was found and fitted out in record time, with value for money and within the approved budget."
After the meeting, Mr. Waigel said that there would be tighter controls on the bank's spending.
The timing of the flap is particularly bad for Mr. Attali, who next week will be host at the annual meeting of the bank to the nations that are its owners, including the United States, the largest shareholder.
Many nations, including the United States, have expressed impatience at times with the slow pace of lending to Eastern Europe. Bank officials said they had approved $1.66 billion worth of loans and other investments, and that through the end of March had disbursed $166 million of it. They said the gap was caused by the inability of companies, entrepreneurs and governments in Eastern Europe to complete deals on agreed-upon terms, not by problems at the bank.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Decline Continues; Key Low vs. the Yen Is Near

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued its tumble to postwar lows against the Japanese yen yesterday, closing in on the psychologically important 110-yen level.
The dollar also fell against most major European currencies but managed to end unchanged against the German mark largely because of heavy cross-selling, in which traders sold marks mostly to buy yen and British pounds. 
 Gold slipped in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents an ounce, to $339.90. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $339.50, also off 40 cents.
Currency trading was light but volatile, with the dollar falling against the yen on Asian markets but then holding ground in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to another record low of 110.25 yen, down 0.75 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 110.63 yen. In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 110.55 yen, down from late Monday's 111.10 yen.
Alison Gibbs, an analyst with MMS International, said that as the dollar neared the 110-yen level, traders were becoming nervous about possible action by central banks to stem the dollar's decline.
Many market participants believe that the 110 level is a floor used to guide international currency policy. The United States and other major industrialized nations have expressed support for a lower dollar as a way to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus.
The dollar seemed to decline initially in New York on a Commerce Department report that housing starts slumped 4.6 percent in March. But the market ultimately brushed off the slowdown in construction, concluding that it was largely a result of the mid-March blizzard in the East and was not a signal of a worsening in economic conditions.
Some analysts also traced the dollar's fall to a report of a $200 million sale by the Bank of Finland. The bank was said to have sold the dollars as the final phase of a deal that first involved buying yen, then selling the yen to buy dollars, and finally selling the dollars to buy marks.
"The best thing you can say about today is there was a lot of confusion," Mr. Gibbs said.

Apple Computer Will Open Sales Operation in Mexico

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 20

 BODY:
Affirming its commitment to the personal computing market in Mexico, Apple Computer Inc. said today that it was opening Apple Computer Mexico. The new marketing and distribution development office will provide local sales, marketing, service and support to Apple's resellers, third-party software developers and partners in Mexico.
"The Mexican marketplace offers tremendous growth opportunities for both Apple and our partners," John Floisand, the president of Apple Pacific, said in a statement. "We're convinced we'll be able to build a strong infrastructure in Mexico capable of addressing customer needs in all market sectors." Apple Computer Mexico is part of Apple Latin America, which is one of five regions that make up Apple Pacific. 
 Emerging markets like Mexico are critical to Apple's continued growth through the 90's and beyond, the company said. Mexico has been identified as a key area of expansion for Apple; it is the fastest-growing market in Latin America and would probably grow further under the North American Free Trade agreement with the United States and Canada.
According to the International Data Corporation, the PC market in Mexico is projected to reach nearly $1 billion in sales in 1993, up 29 percent from the previous year. International Data also estimated that the market would grow 24 percent a year through 1995.
 
Mexico Will Be a Growth Area
 Apple would be the first personal computer company to establish a major sales force in Mexico, although the International Business Machines Corporation, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation have had minicomputer sales organizations there, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.
"The Mexican economy has always been viewed as too weak and unstable" to warrant a major effort, Mr. Bajarin said. Apple's move indicated that it expected "that possibly because of Nafta or other productivity gains, Mexico is going to become a growth area," he added.
Allan White, the managing director of Apple Latin America, will lead the organization through the 1993 fiscal year. "The Apple Computer Mexico team is executing on a long-term plan aimed at tapping the $1 billion PC market potential in Mexico," Mr. White said in a statement. "Over the next 12 months, we intend to aggressively expand our presence by implementing high-profile marketing and promotional programs supported by a strong local organization."
Apple said it was applying a proved business model to developing the Mexican market. The Apple Federation model is a network of affiliated, interdependent companies that join with Apple to meet the specific, local market requirements of its customers. In November 1992, Apple broadened its distribution in Mexico to include three new resellers: Vertex, Dicom and Edumac, while continuing a longstanding distribution relationship with Genetec. All four companies are based in Mexico City.

HEADLINE: Mexico Gets Trade Praise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 20

 BODY:
The world trade body GATT praised Mexico's trade practices today as among the most open in the world but criticized its import limits on foreign automobiles.
A GATT report also said the North American Free Trade Agreement should stimulate investment in Mexico and enhance its access to markets in Canada and the United States, but it also warned that the pact might intensify preferential trade. 
 The ruling council of the 109-member General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussed the report at a two-day meeting ending today.
GATT economists said in their report that Mexico had become a largely open economy driven by the private sector. Inflation fell to 11.9 percent last year, the lowest rate in 20 years.
Although the average tariff rate is now 13 percent -- half of the rate 10 years ago -- GATT said tariff protection remained higher than average for automobiles, computers, iron and steel, metal manufactures, basic chemicals and electrical machinery.
Referring to automobile imports still being subject to foreign exchange balancing requirements and to a limitation of a given share of domestic sales, the GATT report said, "Such continued import protection seems incompatible with Mexico's overall policy of trade liberalization."
Japanese and Korean delegates joined in the report's criticism of Mexico's limits on foreign automobiles, according to trade sources who attended the closed-door talks.

HEADLINE: Run vs. Swim? Statistician Says The Score Is In

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
DR. HOWARD WAINER, a swimmer and statistician at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., first began wondering if runners spend energy as efficiently as swimmers when he was an undergraduate in the early 1960's, and used to argue with his runner friends over whose workout was harder.
Now he has put those two interests together in a study published in the current issue of Chance, the journal of the American Statistical Association. 
 The human body, it seems, simply was not meant to move quickly through water. Dr. Wainer's study found that champion runners can go about three and a half times farther than champion swimmers in the same amount of time. But in that time, the less efficient swimmers burn 25 percent more calories.
Swimmers can take solace, however, in the finding that they appear to be better conditioned as athletes. Runners' performances peter out as their distances get longer, while swimmers maintain a much more consistent pace. And female swimmers are faster, compared with female runners, than male swimmers are compared with male runners.
 
Data From Record Books
 If a person is running at top speed for a given length of time, say 20 minutes, and another person is swimming at top speed for that time, Dr. Wainer asked, how far will the runner go relative to the swimmer? To answer the question, he looked at world record times in running and swimming, so as to be sure he was comparing the very best performances in the two sports. He found that the theoretical maximum ratio is 3.75 to 1 for male athletes, which means that in 20 minutes a man can run 3.75 times as far as he can swim. The ratio was 3.5 for women in a 20-minute period. The ratio differs slightly for different times.
The study, said Dr. Sally Morton, a statistician at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., is "creating a buzz in the statistics community among the more athletic biathlete-triathlete types."
One immediate consequence of the results, said Dr. Al Loosli, a sports physiologist at the Center for Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, is that it allows athletes to calculate whether they are more efficient runners or swimmers by looking at the ratio of their best times.
Some statisticians say they are already putting that idea into practice. Dr. Morton, who is a competitive long-distance ocean swimmer, said that she immediately calculated her relative speeds of running versus swimming to see if they came close to the theoretical maximum, which is 3.5 to 1 for female athletes. Her ratio, she said, was 2.6 to 1, indicating that she swims much better than she runs.
Dr. Richard De Veaux, a statistician at Princeton University who competes in triathlons, did the same thing. He said his ratio was exactly the same as the figure Dr. Wainer calculated for male athletes, 3.75 to 1. "The way I look at it, I'm equally bad at both sports," Dr. De Veaux said.
Dr. De Veaux said he was intrigued with Dr. Wainer's analysis. "I thought it was absolutely fascinating," he said.
 
Old Approach Rejected
 Dr. Wainer said that when he analyzed the relative efficiencies of running and swimming, he deliberately rejected an approach that had been tried in the past: to assume that the efficiency of exercise depends on the number of calories that are required to move one gram of body mass a distance of one centimeter. In this sort of analysis, the time factor is ignored, since whether someone walks a mile or runs it, the total energy expended would be the same. This is the basis of advice, often given by trainers in health clubs, who say that people wanting to lose weight are just as well off walking as running as long as they keep their distance constant.
"That idea seemed patently false," Dr. Wainer said. "It seemed to me that the distance traveled isn't the key thing. It's how hard it is to do it."
Dr. John Duncan, an exercise physiologist who is associate director of the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, agreed with this approach. The idea that only distance matters in calculating efficiency "is an old myth," he said. Dr. Duncan said his group found substantial differences in calories expended when women strolled, walked quickly or race-walked for three miles.
Dr. Wainer theorized that the greater efficiency he found in female swimmers, as opposed to men, might be a result of women's having more body fat. He said the body fat might be an advantage for women in swimming, helping them to remain parallel to the surface of the water, but a hindrance in running.
Given the ratios he found for swimmers and runners, as well as measurements of oxygen consumption, Dr. Wainer deduced that champion swimmers burn 25 percent more calories than runners in a given time.
This finding, Dr. Duncan said, is somewhat surprising because swimmers in general tend to have lower heart rates when they exercise than runners. Also, many people who take up swimming to lose weight are disappointed when the sport does little to burn off extra fat, perhaps because they do not exercise at extremely high intensity levels, Dr. Duncan said.

Mets Are Considering Building a New Stadium

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
After nearly two years of consideration, the Mets have begun serious exploration of a plan to demolish Shea Stadium and construct a new stadium -- perhaps domed -- as part of an elaborate development project that could begin construction by the end of the decade.
The plan, which would require the approval of the city and state as well as the participation of any number of private investors, might include a multipurpose convention center, underground parking garages as well as one or more hotels. Construction would be on the stadium's current site or perhaps an adjacent area in the Willet's Point section of Queens. A direct transportation link with LaGuardia Airport might also be involved. 
 The Mets refused to confirm or deny the plan last night. "There's nothing I can say," said Fred Wilpon, one of the team's owners.
 
Idea Floating Around
 But people in the Mets organization familiar with some of the details of the plan said that Wilpon, who has made successful as a real estate developer in New York, has floated the idea with state and city officials in an attempt to sound out the chances for executing the deal.
Evidently encouraged, the Mets have in the last month begun to undertake a complex assortment of feasibility studies -- environmental and economic impact projections among them -- that would be required to gain approval for such an project. According to one Mets official, if the club, the city and the state were to pursue the plan, a minimum of one to two years would be required for the studies and it would be difficult for construction to start much before the year 2000.
Shea Stadium, which opened in 1964, is owned by the city and is run by the Department of Parks and Recreation. The Mets are tenants, and their current lease runs through the year 2,004.
The Mets official stressed last night that the plans remain exploratory and that the Mets were not irrevocably wed to any of specifics, including the idea of a domed stadium. The official also said that no specific adjacent property had been officially targeted for purchase, but that the nearby Willets Point Industrial Park was being investigated.
Vincent Tese, the chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, said last that he had been told by Wilpon several years ago that the organization might be interested in developing a plan for a new stadium, but that he had not been apprised of any more specific proposal.
"There has always been a morsel of a plan," said Tese.
Asked if the state would consider becoming involved in any such a development, Tese declined to be specific.
"If it makes business sense," said Tese.
The issue of stadium development in Queens and on Long Island has surfaced any number of times since the Jets decided to leave Shea Stadium for Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., after the 1983 season. In fact, a New York State Sportsplex Corporation was formed, and in 1986 the corporation investigated the idea of constructing a domed football stadium in Flushing Meadows in an attempt to lure back the Jets. That project, which involved Donald Trump as the developer, raised concern among area businesses which would have been forced to relocate. The plan did not go forward.

3 Reasons To Stay Involved

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
THE SPORTS industry is approaching full throttle: hockey playoffs are under way, pro basketball is rushing toward a dramatic conclusion, and pro football's annual draft is set for Sunday.
And baseball's back.
The boycotts threatened by Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition for Fairness in Sport never materialized: Players played; fans paid. 
 On opening day in Baltimore, a small group of demonstrators stood in a drizzle and sang "We Shall Overcome" as they picketed at Camden Yards. But their voices were drowned out by organ music and cheers from inside.
Meanwhile, critics within the sports industry advised Jackson that, with all the ills afflicting minorities in other areas of society, he would do better not to concern himself with something as trivial as sports.
Stick to the inner city.
Jackson should not allow himself to be run off. He is precisely where he needs to be, and his presence might encourage economists, historians and others who once passed off sport as a trivial pursuit in the black community to refocus on this small but fertile preserve.
But why, critics ask, is Jackson so concerned about sports? Ego? Visibility? Broadening his political base?
Perhaps a bit of each. But the deeper rationale may be a matter of correcting an oversight that he and other activists made 25 years ago.
The thrust of the civil rights movement has been the dramatic fight to secure rights for the disenfranchised and the battle for equal access. The movement overlooked adding athletes of color: Their numbers were not as high as they are now and, frankly, black athletes were not seen as a group the movement needed.
Twenty-five years later, Jackson has come to see a larger picture of sport as a sprawling industry. He now sees it as a viable industry whose raw resource for the last two decades has been black and Hispanic athletes, yet one that has largely excluded those groups -- and women -- from participating at the high ends of management.
Now all three groups are key pillars in a growing civil rights movement in sports, and are perhaps the three reasons Jackson should stay involved.
What seems to concern those who would have Jackson turn his attention away from sports is that the new movement is going above the playing field, beyond the stadium, and attacking the appendages of this billion-dollar industry.
It is as if someone has lifted a huge stone and discovered a flourishing subculture of private enclaves that have functioned as a boys' club in the industries surrounding sports: in journalism, merchandising, public relations, special-event planning, concessions and management.
Critics advise political activists to keep out of sport. But the absence of an aggressive push for equal opportunity beyond the playing field is precisely why so-called minorities find themselves in their present predicament: failing to have significant control in an industry they have played a major role in building.
"Many years ago we picked cotton balls," Jackson told a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Sunday. "The dishonor and the disgrace was not in working, but that we could not own the land, we could not bale and sell the cotton.
"Today we're picking basketballs with as much skill as we picked cotton balls. But when it comes to the vertical growth beyond the field, we're still locked in at the raw material base. That is not fundamental progress."
The chief problem with Jackson's plan is that he began the movement by targeting professional athletes, presumably because their visibility is highest and the potential for wielding political and economic clout is greatest.
But he has had a difficult time getting this group to respond, primarily because professional athletes, as a group, have been increasingly held hostage by their checkbooks. Jackson cannot expect to come in at the end of a process that discourages activism -- beginning in junior high school -- and expect to have a following.
In any event, Jackson's presence in sport has created discomfort and resentment. He's leading a movement to exert pressure on an industry which for decades has played by its own exclusionary rules, made change at its own pace and on its own terms.
Critics once implored Jackson not to run for president, citing it as an unrealistic aspiration. Now critics advise that he not become involved in sports.
Quite the opposite, Jackson -- and others across the nation -- should add sports to their portfolios. It's a movement whose time has arrived.

HEADLINE: On Environmental Cost-Benefit Scale, Prevention Scores High

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your "What Price Cleanup?" series (March 21-23) raises valid questions about environmental priorities and economic imperatives, but your evidence, outlook and conclusions are gravely flawed. 
 Considerations of priority and efficiency are not the invention of a "vanguard" sweeping away a national environmental program "gone seriously awry." These are considerations every serious environmentalist in this country has dealt with for at least 10 years. They continue to shape and improve the complex, evolving -- and essential -- environmental protection program of the United States.
The series contains numerous inaccuracies. Some of the most troubling:
* Superfund is painted as a program that spends millions to clean minutely contaminated industrial sites. In fact, 82 percent of Superfund sites are in residential neighborhoods. Ninety-one percent are within a mile of an operating drinking water well. The vast majority are grossly contaminated. Further, because Superfund holds polluters, rather than taxpayers, responsible for clean-up, it operates as a powerful incentive for industries to avoid polluting.
* The series plays up the scientific debate over the health effects of dioxin. But the Environmental Protection Agency is discovering that dioxin's impacts on the immune system and on wildlife make it more, not less, dangerous than first thought.
* You portray the 1988 ban on ocean dumping of New York City's processed sewage sludge as hasty and of questionable environmental value. Congress passed an ocean-dumping phase-out law in 1977; yet New York City and eight nearby communities continued, though the practice helped turn a near-shore site into a virtual toxic dead zone, and its effects at a deep-water site were unknown. The series further suggests that converting sludge into fertilizer is uneconomical -- yet for years many other cities have created jobs and revenue by thus using sludge.
* The series maintains that scientists are questioning the use of animal studies in identifying chemicals that can cause cancer in humans. Yet the National Academy of Sciences just issued a report by a panel of the country's top experts, which repeatedly confirmed the need for animal testing. Scientists have long recognized that animal studies, like most scientific methods, have limitations; but they are the best available alternative for protecting human health.
Finally, the series heralded cost-benefit analysis as the future of environmentalism. But this country has already moved beyond the cost-benefit paradigm -- a stale, 19th-century reasoning -- which serves primarily as an excuse for the fortunate to ignore disproportionate toxic burdens borne by others.
Current environmental thinking focuses on preventing problems in the first place, by means of energy efficiency, safe substitutes for toxic chemicals, whole-ecosystem land-use planning and many other practices. Nothing scores better on the cost-benefit scale than prevention, and nothing protects health and ecology so completely.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Prevail, Sinking Clinton's Economic Stimulus Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Senate Republicans killed President Clinton's economic stimulus program today, maintaining their filibuster until Democrats surrendered and agreed to limit the bill to $4 billion for extended unemployment benefits.
Mr. Clinton's first serious legislative defeat was marked by complaints from Democrats in the Senate and the White House. But Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, was satisfied that the Republicans had shown that they deserved to be taken seriously. He avoided gloating, and promised occasional cooperation with the President. 
 A brief, harsh outburst from Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, served as the eulogy for Mr. Clinton's original $19.5 billion measure, which was proposed in February. He said Republicans would accept "billions for unemployment, not one cent for jobs."
 
A 'Difference of Philosophy'
 On the winning side, Senator Dole quietly argued that Republicans, too, want jobs. But asserting that "a fundamental difference of philosophy has brought us to this point," the Kansas Senator said his party viewed the plan as too expensive and fatally flawed because it added to the deficit instead of having its spending matched by cuts elsewhere in the budget.
As originally offered, the bill included about $4 billion to extend unemployment benefits, $2 billion for education grants, $6 billion for highways and public improvements and $2 billion for summer jobs. The Republicans were especially critical of $2.5 billion in community development block grant spending, which they said would pay for pork barrel projects.
Senator Dole minimized the ramifications of today's action. "It's just a bump in the road for President Clinton," he said, adding that Republicans would support him on other measures, including the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The White House was not buying his argument.
 
'Politics Before People'
 "The minority leader showed that playing politics is a lot more important than putting people to work," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "The real losers here are the hundreds of thousands of Americans who won't get jobs this summer and beyond, because a minority of Republicans put politics before people."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said the White House would "come right back next week" with another version of the parts of the legislative package that were killed. He did not say how, but a regular supplemental appropriations bill for some popular elements of the program could be brought up in the House quickly.
The House is expected to act on the $4 billion in unemployment benefits money on Thursday. And while Democrats are expected to denounce the Senate Republicans for their success in killing the Clinton package, the shrunken bill is all but certain to pass.
This morning the Democrats, who hold a 57-43 majority in the Senate, failed for the fourth time to break the filibuster; under Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to end debate.
Once again, they failed to get a single Republican to vote to cut off debate. Fifty-six Democrats voted to end debate, while one, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, voted with the 42 Republicans who were present to keep the filibuster going. Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, did not vote.
Last Friday Mr. Clinton cut his original $19.5 billion package to $16.4 billion. Then, after today's vote to end the debate failed, the Democrats offered another version, with $12.9 billion in spending and $5 billion of it offset by cuts elsewhere.
But the Republicans spurned that suggestion and offered a counterproposal of their own, with $6.55 billion in spending, up from the $6 billion plan they offered on Monday.
There were brief talks about each of these schemes, but nothing approaching serious negotiation.
Democrats had hoped that some Republicans who frequently vote with them on other issues would desert their filibuster, and tried to put heat on them at home. But one of their prime targets, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, said he fully agreed with the rejection of the Democratic offers. The Republican proposal, he said, was offered in the knowledge that there was "no likelihood it will be accepted."
That same theme was heard again tonight from Mr. Stephanopoulos, who said other losers were "the good moderate Republicans out there who wanted to come forward with a real jobs package but were prevented by their leadership."
 
Moderates Did Not Waver
 But at no point during the Easter recess did any of the moderate Republicans in the Senate appear to be wavering. Some may have hoped that a deal would be struck, but none moved to make it happen.
After the Senate voted the unemployment money by unanimous consent, Mr. Dole told reporters that he believed the Clinton Administration would now understand the value of consulting with Republicans on such future issues as health care. "I think the White House may have misjudged the fact that when we stick together, we have some influence," he said.
But Senator Byrd was unwilling to see the issue that way.
"While the other side is busy congratulating each other on proving that they are a force to be reckoned with, they have only proved to the American people that they are the guardians of gridlock," he said. "While the champagne corks are popping, millions of Americans will open a can of beans and wonder whether they are going to find a job."

HEADLINE: CLINTON DECLARES NEW U.S. POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Repudiating two major Bush Administration environmental policies, President Clinton said today that the United States would sign an international treaty protecting rare and endangered species and follow a specific timetable to reduce the threat of global warming.
In his first major speech on environmental policy, President Clinton declared: "We cannot walk away from challenges like those presented by the biodiversity treaty. We must step up to them." 
 Speaking on the eve of Earth Day observances to environmental groups who had gathered at the Botanical Gardens in the shadow of the Capitol, Mr. Clinton said, "We also must take the lead in addressing the challenge of global warming that could make our planet and its climate less hospitable and more hostile to human life."
 
Bush Rejection Based on Cost
 President Bush had rejected both initiatives, saying they might be too expensive and would unfairly penalize some American companies.
President Clinton committed the United States "to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000." Greenhouse gases, so called because they trap heat in the atmosphere like the glass panes in a greenhouse, include carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels.
Mr. Clinton said that his Administration would put forward a plan for limiting greenhouse gases by August. Such limits are not expected to impose immediate, significant new costs on private industry or on the Government, although opponents of the restrictions on greenhouse gases say the restrictions will raise costs in the long term and increase Government regulation of business. Many companies and Government agencies have already started taking steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
 
A Victory for Gore
 Though Mr. Clinton had pledged the action during the campaign, his announcement on global warming was an important victory for Vice President Al Gore over Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary, who, among others, had argued that such restrictions would harm American industry.
The dispute had continued into late Tuesday, with Administration officials still unsure about what to put in the speech on reducing emissions.
The treaty to protect the diversity of the world's living things, known as the biodiversity treaty, will require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. White House officials said they did not expect major legislative opposition.
The treaty also stipulates that biotechnology companies must share profits and technologies with any countries whose biological resources they use in developing products.
Mr. Clinton has said he shares some concerns raised by Mr. Bush that this provision would weaken patent protections for biotechnology companies, discouraging research and innovation.
To get around those misgivings, the White House met with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as environmental groups, to draft an "interpretative statement" that Mr. Clinton will attach to the United States signature on the treaty.
Vice President Gore, who has been overruled on other environmental matters like his pledge to keep a toxic waste incinerator closed in Ohio, sounded elated today over Mr. Clinton's announcement. "There was no fight on global warming with me," he told reporters. "I made a commitment and we're going to keep it."
In campaigning last year as Mr. Clinton's Vice Presidential running mate, Mr. Gore frequently described Mr. Bush's refusal to support the environmental initiatives as an embarrassment to the United States.
Mr. Bush disregarded the advice of his own chief environmental official in opposing the treaty, angering environmentalists attending the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro last June.
The speech today raised Mr. Clinton's stock with environmentalists, many of whom had attacked his decision last month to back off from a shift in Federal land policy that would have led to increased mining and grazing fees.
 
'It's a Timely Move'
 "President Clinton has brought America back into step with the rest of the world on environmental protection," said Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.
William K. Reilly, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who had pressed Mr. Bush to sign the biodiversity treaty, said of Mr. Clinton's action: "It's a timely move, a positive new direction for the Administration. It will be very welcomed, particularly in the developing world."
Mr. Clinton also announced that he would sign five executive orders directing the Federal Government to take steps to reduce pollution in Federal agencies.
They would instruct the agencies to change their purchasing policies to use fewer substances that are harmful to the ozone layer; commit the Federal Government to buy thousands more American-made vehicles that use fuels like natural gas, ethanol, methanol and electric power; require agencies to do more to buy and use recycled products; require agencies to purchase energy-efficient computers, and require Federal offices that use toxic chemicals to publicly report their wastes and releases.
The President also announced an energy and environmental audit of the White House, to find ways to reduce waste in the lighting, heating and cooling systems.
 
A Different Course
 "For too long, we have been told that we have to choose between the economy and the environment," Mr. Clinton said, "between our jobs, between our obligations to our own people and our responsibilities to the future, and to the rest of the world, between public action and private economy. I'm here today in the hope that we can together take a different course of action, to offer a new set of challenges to our people."
White House officials said the interpretative statement to accompany the biodiversity treaty would assure American companies that they would not have to share technology with developing countries that provide resources for products manufactured by those companies.
"We think we have done the work necessary to protect the intellectual property of American industries and to protect the environment," Mr. Clinton told reporters. "We believe that all the difficulties have been worked out and that this effort will be supported by both the businesses involved and the American environmental community."
G. Kirk Raab, president of Genentech Inc., which was part of the coalition that developed the interpretative statement, said, "This is a major step forward for both businesses and environmentalists."
But some environmental organizations, in a letter to Mr. Clinton, accused him of compromising the protection of species to insure profits for biotechnology companies.
 
'Dangerously Shortsighted'
 "The Clinton-industry proposal, which undercuts international attempts to regulate the creation and release of genetically engineered organisms, is dangerously shortsighted and scientifically naive," said Andrew Kimbrell, policy director of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation, one of the groups that signed the letter.
Despite their general praise for Mr. Clinton, several environmental groups said their one concern was that he did not say whether he would move to cap greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000. White House officials said no decisions had been made on that course of action.
"Unless the President commits America to capping emissions and leads the world in that direction," said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, "it will be like going on a diet and then gaining all the weight back."
But John Shlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, a business group, warned that further targets and timetables for emissions reductions, if carried out in an arbitrary fashion, "could jeopardize the economic health of the nation."
 
'Greatly Encouraged'
 More typical from environmental groups were the comments from Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters. "We were holding our breath on global warming," he said, "and we got everything we had hoped for. We were also pleased by what Mr. Clinton said on Federal facility compliance. We felt we were going to struggle with that issue for a long, long time."
Peter A. A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society said, "With President Clinton's commitments today, integrating environmental and economic goals, setting an example from the White House and setting out an agenda of Federal actions to conserve energy, to curb or clean up pollution, we are greatly encouraged."

Chart: "Preserving the Earth's Bounty"
 As the global economy expands and the world's population soars, people are destroying natural ecosystems and habitats so fast that some biologists say up to a quarter of the world's plant and animal species could be extinct in the next 50 years.
 Last year, at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, about 150 countries, signed a treaty aimed at protecting the world's living things. The agreement, known as the biodiversity treaty, commits countries to these goals.
 
Draw up national strategies for conservation.
 
Integrate plant and animal preservation into economic planning.
 
Set up protected areas and promote the protection of entire ecosystems as well as individual species.
 
Manage biological resources outside of protected areas.
 
Take steps to restore degraded ecosystems.
 
Take inventory and of biological resources and monitor them.
 
Allow countries that are rich in species but poor in cash to share in profits from sales of pharmaceutical products or other products derived from their biological resources.

HEADLINE: Brazilians Vote Down Kings and Keep Presidents

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, April 21

 BODY:
Rejecting appeals to restore the country's 19th-century monarchy, Brazilians voted today to retain the system they borrowed from the United States 104 years ago -- a presidential republic.
But in a reflection of the enduring fascination with the Bragancas, Brazil's royal family, about 12 percent of voters, or eight million people, apparently obeyed the monarchist command to "vote for the King." 
 Finals results are expected Sunday. Surveys of voters leaving the polls today indicated that Brazilians also rejected another option, a parliamentary system. In a plebiscite marked by apathy and abstention, many voters told interviewers that they voted only because they were required to by law.
Paradoxically, instead of strengthening Brazil's political system, the vote today is expected to unleash a new period of political instability for Latin America's largest nation. Brazil's $450 billion economy -- roughly the size of China's and Russia's -- appears destined to face two more years of low growth and high inflation.
"The vote marks the start of a very bitter presidential campaign," said Bolivar Lamounier, a Sao Paulo political scientist. "We could have a lame-duck President for the next 20 months."
Political support is expected to rapidly peel away from Itamar Franco, who assumed presidential powers after Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in September. Already, half a dozen major political candidates are campaigning, each one trying to emerge as leader of the opposition.
 
 In the first seven months of his presidency, Mr. Franco has experimented with three Economy Ministers. But none have been able to reduce inflation below its current rate of 25 percent a month. Today, Brazil's highest denomination bank note, the 500,000 cruzeiro bill, is worth $16.
Mr. Franco's approval ratings, as measured by the DataFolha polling organization, have dropped from 36 percent to 18 percent since February.
Continued erosion of political and public support will strip Brazil's already weak executive of the power to combat inflation. For relief, Brazilians will have to wait until a new President is elected in November 1994 and is inaugurated on Jan. 1, 1995.
With recent headlines proclaiming "The Beginning of the End," and "Itomar Against Them All," the President has counterattacked, warning politicians about the danger of "a conflagration of ambition."
"Be careful with the matches, be careful with the gasoline tank," he warned two weeks ago.
Last Friday, he announced to a military audience, "The President of the republic will never be a hostage to the results of the plebiscite, of succession politics."
Despite an hour of daily prime-time television advertising, the plebiscite failed to create public interest. Last Friday, fewer than 100 people turned out for a march held by parliamentary advocates in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.
 
Half the Voters Stayed Home
 Polls indicated that about half of the electorate of 90 million did not understand what the referendum was about. Today, voter surveys indicated that about half the electorate stayed home or did not cast valid ballots.
"People don't even have the money to buy a newspaper," said Roberto Bernardo, a 27-year-old salesman as he waited in line to vote in Rio. "Why bother with a plebiscite? Now the politicians have stopped working to dedicate themselves to the presidential succession."
The front-runners appear to be Paulo Salim Maluf, the conservative Mayor of Sao Paulo, and Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva, a Socialist who is president of the Workers Party.
Whoever wins will face the challenge of forging a working majority in Congress from 19 political parties now represented.
The political track record is not encouraging. Since the army overthrew Brazil's last reigning Braganca in a coup in 1889, only one elected President, Juscelino Kubitschek, has finished his term in office.

HEADLINE: Distinct Choice in Los Angeles Race

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 21

 BODY:
The two victors of Round 1 in the Los Angeles mayoral race are expected to present Angelenos with the clearest clash of political ideals and approaches seen in modern memory here, a memory dominated by the pacifying aura of the sphinx-like Tom Bradley for 20 years.
In Tuesday's nonpartisan election a tough-talking Republican businessman and veteran power broker, Richard Riordan, ran a strikingly strong first in this liberal city, getting 33 percent of the vote in a field of two dozen candidates. The runner-up was City Councilman Mike Woo, a polished liberal Democrat who is heir to Mayor Bradley's multiethnic coalition, with 24 percent. 
 Since neither got more than half the vote, the two men will face each other in a runoff on June 8, with the winner taking office on July 1. The election comes after two years of turmoil in the nation's second-largest city that began with the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by police officers and seems to have come to an end on Saturday with the conviction of two officers on Federal civil rights charges.
Despite widespread demands for better police protection, voters failed to approve a ballot measure that would have financed the hiring of 1,000 police officers with a surcharge on property taxes. The measure received 58 percent of the vote, short of the two-thirds required to increase taxes in California. They did approve a limit of two terms for mayor, council members and other top elected city officials.
 
Few Similarities
 The Riordan-Woo face-off brings a sharply defined clash over how to rebuild this ethnically riven and economically depressed metropolis.
"They are both men, but I cannot think of a lot of other similarities," said Joseph R. Cerrell, a political consultant here affiliated with neither camp. He predicted a "very nasty campaign."
The 62-year-old New York-born Mr. Riordan (pronounced REAR-dihn), a lawyer and entrepreneur, calls himself a fiscal conservative and a social moderate. His largely self-financed campaign calls for shrinking city government and leasing the operations of Los Angeles International Airport to raise money to hire 3,000 additional police officers. Given widespread fears over racial disorders, his tough-on-crime stance has earned him considerable support among white and older voters, though he denies making a racial appeal.
By contrast, the boyish-looking 42-year-old Mr. Woo, a former Vietnam war protester and an urban planner who has represented the Hollywood district for eight years, has a stronger faith in the government's ability to solve problems. He promises $100 million in city-backed loans to businesses in South-Central Los Angeles and hopes to hold together the fraying coalition of blacks, liberals, Jews and business leaders that kept Mr. Bradley in office for so long. Mr. Woo has also promised to place a homosexual on the Police Commission.
 
Ideological Swipes
 In his comments on Tuesday night, Mr. Woo signaled his plan to paint Mr. Riordan as a defender of the privileged and a right-wing Republican. "Dick Riordan gets his marching orders from Ronald Reagan and his economic ideas from Michael Milken," he said, referring to the junk-bond dealer who went to jail on security-fraud charges.
In an interview today, Mr. Riordan said the race was not about class but personal safety and jobs. "Mr. Woo is trying to define me as something I am really not," he said. "This race is not about race, party or class; it's about leadership, about which of us can face the issues of safety and jobs."
The unusual demographic facts of life in Los Angeles are such that Mr. Riordan has a fairly good chance of being elected Mayor of this heavily minority and liberal city even though only 30 percent of the voters are Republican. Though about two-thirds of the population of 3.6 million is made up of Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Asians, blacks and other minorities, the electorate is still two-thirds Anglo, as non-Hispanic whites are called here. The city's huge immigrant population is largely disenfranchised because many of them are not citizens.
Only 32 percent of registered voters turned out Tuesday, meaning that Mr. Riordan led the race with only 1 in 10 voters. If turnout in the runoff is similar, the new mayor will be chosen by as few as 226,300 people, or 16 percent of registered voters or 6 percent of the population.
 
Candidates Eliminated
 On Tuesday, the other leading candidates were far behind. They were City Councilman Joel Wachs with 11 percent; state Assemblyman Richard Katz with 10 percent; Linda Griego, a former Deputy Mayor with 7 percent; Stan Sanders, a prominent black lawyer with 4 percent; and Councilman Nate Holden with 4 percent.
Mindful that he won only minimal support in minority communities, Mr. Riordan today tried to broaden his appeal, having breakfast with black and Hispanic business leaders in South-Central Los Angeles.
In a survey of voters leaving polling places on Tuesday, voters told The Los Angeles Times that the top issues in the race were jobs and the economy, crime and gangs, education and improving the Police Department. Of those voting for Mr. Riordan, more than two-thirds cited his record as a businessman as their reason for voting for him, while a good majority of Woo voters cited his reaching out to minorities and his early call for the ouster of the former chief of police, Daryl F. Gates.
The battle lines for the June 8 runoff, then, are clearly drawn.

HEADLINE: Miscalculation, Then Embarrassment

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
As Democrats have been forced to negotiate away almost all of President Clinton's package to stimulate the economy, a vexing question has emerged: How did such a small economic initiative turn into such a large political embarrassment?
By holding out for a plan that even Administration economists knew would have modest impact, Mr. Clinton expended much of his early and precious political capital on a proposal that he had never intended to make his biggest fight. And the resulting political defeat has left the Administration vulnerable to future assaults by Republicans, who surprised even themselves by finding unity. 
 With the conclusion of a deal today between Senate Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Clinton was not even able to salvage a face-saving compromise.
In recent days the second-guessing of Administration strategy has come fast and furious among Congressional Democrats and Clinton advisers. Some suggested that the President should have cut and run early in the process when Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and David L. Boren of Oklahoma, both Democrats, proposed a compromise that would delay some of the spending.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers began investing political and intellectual capital in the stimulus plan even before the inauguration, making it a centerpiece of his plan to revive the economy.
Once the Administration became entangled in the fight for the plan, which they insistently called a jobs bill, they left themselves no room to retreat. House members who had supported the measure with the understanding that it would send money to urban development projects, summer-jobs programs and unemployment benefits called for it to remain intact.
And Mr. Clinton himself, flush with the early legislative success of his blueprint to reduce the budget deficit, insisted several times that the entire package was necessary.
There is evidence that Mr. Clinton missed critical opportunities to win support early on and handed his foes the weapons with which to embarrass him. In a recent interview, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said he was surprised that the fight over the jobs package -- which he characterized as a "flyspeck" in the larger scheme of things -- developed into such a contest of wills.
"Nobody really thought much about this stimulus package," said Mr. Dole, who has missed no opportunity to criticize it since those early days.
 
Looking for the Silver Lining
 White House officials today continued to attack the Republicans as blocking a virtuous effort, but their arguments rang hollow compared with their previously vigor defense of the bill.
"I think the majority of the American people, a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate, all support the President's jobs package," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "But the Senate leadership was tempted to score what they thought was a political victory."
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, was eager to focus on the larger picture, saying of the President, "Obviously, he's committed to the jobs bill, but that's just one component of his larger economic plan."
And Clinton allies in Congress, wary of battles to come on campaign finance and health care, were just as happy to change the subject.
"We need to move on to something else," Senator Breaux said. "We have other big battles to fight."
Others, mostly Republicans, contended that Mr. Clinton would have fared better had he more astutely negotiated the shoals of Senate politics.
"Bill Clinton has succeeded in doing something George Bush never did," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. "He united the Senate Republicans."
But it is the recriminations within the White House that signaled the magnitude of Mr. Clinton's defeat most clearly.
"Anybody who claims that with hindsight they would not have done something differently is not to be trusted," one White House official said.

HEADLINE: For Neighbors, Plan to Replace Shea Hits Home

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A day after the Mets disclosed plans to replace Shea Stadium with a new domed stadium and development project, public officials welcomed the initiative, while neighbors expressed dismay.
In discussing what were described as highly tentative plans on Tuesday, a Mets official indicated that a new stadium could be built adjacent to the present stadium in Flushing, Queens, or as part of a more ambitious scheme in the Willets Point neighborhood to the east. Plans could include hotels, shops and even a convention center. 
 A similar project was proposed for the area in 1985. Developers were planning a domed football stadium, but they never pursued the project, which had won the backing of city and state officials. The new plans were also welcomed by some officials yesterday.
 
Mayor's Office Interested
 Jeff Maclin, a mayoral spokesman, said that there had been no detailed discussions with the Mets but that Mayor David N. Dinkins's office would be delighted to "explore any viable plan that would keep the Mets and the Yankees in New York through the 21st century and preferably lure the Giants and the Jets back here, too."
Such a development would fit into the plans of the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, who has been looking for an "upscale" economic development in an area now dominated by heavy-construction companies, body shops, a sawdust factory and several towing and scrap-metal businesses, said her spokesman, Dan Andrews.
Mr. Andrews said Ms. Shulman's staff was putting the final touches on a report that would call for private development of hotels and other upscale businesses in the area, which needs an estimated $25 million in street, sewer and other repairs.
"You wouldn't want to spend that kind of money on the area as it is now," he said.
That is hardly news to Ralph St. John, who owns a construction company in Willets Point. He said he had complained often about the lack of what he considers basic, essential services to small-business owners like himself.
 
Some Would Suffer
 He objected to the plan because, he said, his own business and scores of other employers might be sacrificed to make way for an upscale development on his blue-collar ground.
"When it gets valuable, they have to destroy somebody," he said, describing eminent domain, the government's right to take over property after paying the market price, as "legal tyranny."
Others who might object to a domed stadium in Willets Point could be the Airline Pilots Association. In 1985, after the Federal Aviation Administration had approved a domed stadium just across Flushing Bay from La Guardia Airport, the group complained that the stadium would pose a hazard for planes.
Details of the stadium remained a mystery yesterday, although a model, designed by Jack Gordon, an architect, has been built and city officials have been invited to take a look at it.
Parks Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum, the Mets' landlord, expects to examine the model within the next couple of weeks, said Ms. Gotbaum's spokesman, Stewart Desmond.
That suggests that the Mets plan to build the new stadium on Parks Department property in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, perhaps on a present Shea parking lot.

HEADLINE: Administration Offers Plan for Better Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today unveiled its plan to improve the nation's public schools through a set of broad guidelines not only on school and student performance but also on the skills that young people will need to survive in an uncertain economy.
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley was joined by Labor Secretary Robert W. Reich to announce the $420 million package of legislation, which would create a board of 28 educators and representatives from business, labor, state and Federal governments. The board, which would get $15 million under the Goals 2000 legislation, would identify a broad variety of occupations for students who are not bound for college and the skills needed for those jobs. 
 Labor Department officials today said that the specific jobs and skills had not yet been identified. But they are likely to include occupations in such industries as telecommunications and health care, two areas in which jobs have gone begging for a lack of qualified workers.
Establishment of the standards board would complement a separate $270 million program between the Education and Labor Departments to improve the transition from school to work for students not college bound.
 
Goals for Year 2000
 The legislation offered today would also write into law the six national education goals that were adopted by the Bush Administration and the nation's governors -- led by Bill Clinton of Arkansas -- in 1990. The goals are intended to make American students lead the world in math, science and other core subjects by the year 2000; the Clinton package would add foreign language and the arts.
"No one will disagree that our educational system must be improved," Mr. Riley said. "By encouraging education reform across America, Goals 2000 will help create a high-skill, high-wage work force that is the best in the world."
But despite some progress on each of the goals, many educators and analysts say it is unlikely that schools will meet any of them by 2000.
The goals and the standards in the package would be voluntary, but states would be under pressure to participate or risk falling behind those who do.
Some critics wondered whether states might gain too much power from localities as a result of the legislation and whether $420 million was enough to do all that the package proposes. But even skeptics of the plan said they supported the Clinton package because of it gave a national umbrella for the national movement to restructure schools and stressed job training, two areas that even those in education circles acknowledge have been deficient.
The Bush Administration began initiatives on both national school restructuring and improved job training, but analysts said the Clinton package went well beyond those initiatives, particularly in job training.
 
Seeking Some Uniformity
 "Clearly, we ought to develop skills standards," said William H. Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business, a group of 3,500 companies promoting a better work force. "You can't separate education from kindergarten through 12th grade from work, and you shouldn't separate it."
The Clinton package also includes a strategy to inject some unformity into the uneven effort to improve the nation's schools. It proposes to award grants totaling $393 million to states in the first year. Those grants would be used to develop 10-year school-improvement plans based on principles like setting statewide standards for local schools, allowing individual schools more say in decision making and upgrading teacher training.
The proposal would establish curriculum standards, national tests to check whether students were learning those subject areas and standards to judge how well schools were performing.
Efforts to set curriculum standards are already under way in several subjects. Already established, for example, are mathematic standards that call for introducing the concept of probability to 5-year-olds and emphasize math's real-life applications.

Choice and Journey's End In Canadian Hotel Venture

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Choice Hotels International, the franchise hotel giant, said yesterday that it had formed a joint venture in Canada with the Journey's End Corporation, Canada's biggest hotel management company. The venture, to be called Choice Hotels Canada Inc., will initially have 174 inns, 120 of them currently owned by Journey's End.
"Together we expect to have over 500 hotels in the Canadian market in the next four or five years," said Gerald Petitt, president and chief operating officer of Choice, who described the joint venture as "a truly equal partnership." The board of directors will be "50-50," he said, "and we'll split the profits right down the middle." 
 With headquarters in Silver Spring, Md., Choice, a subsidiary of Manor Care Inc., had franchise revenues last year of just over $100 million. Its seven chains operate under the banners Clarion, Comfort, Econo Lodge, Friendship, Quality, Rodeway and Sleep Inns. Because they range from economy to upscale, two or more sometimes operate side by side.
 
Revenues of $116 Million
 Journey's End, with headquarters in Toronto, had revenues last year of about $116 million. Most of its properties are in Canada, although it also has a hotel in midtown Manhattan. The company's stock lost 50 cents yesterday, closing at $5.50 (Canadian) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Maurice Rollins, its founder and chief executive, will become chairman of Choice Hotels Canada. Its motels will be called Comfort Inns by Journey's End, its hotels Quality Hotels by Journey's End and its suites Quality Suites by Journey's End.
The venture will not affect ownership of current Journey's End properties, most of which are owned through limited partnerships.
The venture links the management ability of Journey's End with Choice's marketing muscle and sophisticated reservations system. That two-year-old system lets each hotel monitor and change its own room rates and inventory, as well as book guests at other Choice-brand hotels at their prevailing rates.
 
Strategy Accelerated
 The venture also accelerates the strategy of Choice to seek growth outside the United States through relationships with local franchise operators.
Canada is an especially good markeplace for Choice's strategy, Mr. Petitt said, because about two-thirds of its hotels there are independent operations, compared with only one-third in the United States.
James Carper, editor in chief of Hotels, the magazine of the international hotel industry, said the venture appeared to be a good one.
"One reason the franchise operations have to grow outside the United States," he said, "is that there isn't much more opportunity in this country. That's why they're grabbing each others' hotels and going abroad."
While only about 310 of Choice's 2,900 hotels are outside the United States, in 29 countries, many more are under construction or in development abroad.
For example, Choice signed a franchise agreement last year with CDL Hotels International of Singapore, to develop more than 30 hotels in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Hong Kong, the Philippines and mainland China. Choice's partner in Mexico, Hoteles Calinda, has 16 Choice-brand hotels there. Other franchise agreements call for 20 new Choice-brand hotels in Venezuela and 10 in Costa Rica.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agency executives unite to urge the ad cure for ailing branded products.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
BRAND-BUSTERS, beware! The American Association of Advertising Agencies is getting its act together and going after you.
As the industry organization opens its 75th annual meeting in Laguna Niguel, Calif., its members -- the top executives at the nation's leading agencies -- seem united in a single cause: a concerted plea to their clients, the country's consumer-product marketers, to recognize the brand-building powers of advertising. 
 "We've got to proclaim the value of advertising, we've got to prove it, and we've got to protect it," said Roy J. Bostock, chairman and chief executive at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York.
At a meeting yesterday, the association's board elected Mr. Bostock as the 1993-94 chairman of the Four A's, as the organization is known, effective at the end of the conference on Saturday.
The remarks by Mr. Bostock, who is the Four A's vice chairman for 1992-93, echoed those last year of Robert L. James, the chairman and chief executive at McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, who is the outgoing Four A's chairman. That continuity contrasts with the zig-zag pattern the association often traced in previous years, as each chairman pursued a different project during his one-year term.
"I met with Roy last year and I told him what I was going to be doing," Mr. James said, "and I asked him to agree that there would be a two-year focus on this issue. And I'm sure Ed Wax will be agreeable, too." The reference was to Edward L. Wax, chairman and chief executive at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, whom the board elected 1993-94 vice chairman, also effective Saturday, making him the association's likely chairman for the 1994-95 term.
The organization's unanimity of purpose on the need to bolster brands could not come at a better time. Since April 2 -- or "Marlboro Friday" -- advertisers, their agencies and the media have been fixated on the question of whether name-brand products are losing their appeal among consumers. On that day, Philip Morris said it would begin discounting the price of Marlboros in the face of surging sales of cheaper cigarette brands. That announcement, which plunged the company's stock 23 percent and stirred a wave of selloffs among consumer product stocks, also set in motion a frenzied re-examination of the concept of branded merchandise sold at premium prices.
For advertising agencies, still struggling amid an industrywide recession about to enter its fifth year, the fate of familiar name brands is a matter of survival. After all, marketers spend far less on advertising for store brands and private-label products, and any cut in brand-name advertising threatens to deny agencies the main source of their profits.
Mr. James acknowledged that the association's concentration on brand-building might make agency executives appear as "guys in the advertising business who have an ax to grind." Even so, he asserted, unless marketers "communicate what a brand is, consumers will buy on price -- and you won't stay in business if they buy on price."
Mr. Bostock said, "We've got to make advertising work harder to build into brands the equities that make them more attractive to consumers."
The Four A's joined with the Association of National Advertisers and nine media organizations last November to form a group called the Coalition for Brand Equity, intended to help make the case for advertising's ability to increase marketers' profits by increasing the value of their brands. Larry Light, the coalition's chairman, is scheduled to address the Four A's meeting this morning on "reselling the role of advertising in building brands."
"A lot of people are saying, 'Larry, I feel so sorry for you,' " Mr. Light said in a telephone interview Tuesday from Stamford, Conn., where he is president of the Arcature Corporation, a marketing consulting company.
"I tell them, 'I couldn't have choreographed this better,' " he added. "You couldn't give me a better time than this to talk about refocusing our attention on the importance of creating, maintaining and restoring the economic value of brands."
Providing a preview of his address, Mr. Light said that Marlboro Friday and its aftermath "don't mean that brands are going out of business or that consumers are less brand loyal." Rather, he added, marketers have been "brand milking" by stinting on ad spending in favor of alternate bouts of sharp price rises and short-term promotional price cuts.
"You can't say, 'Because I make a quality product, I can charge anything I want,' " he continued. "If you don't put quality and value together, at some point consumers will say your product is not a good value."
About 445 people are expected to attend the annual meeting, which is being held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel. That compares with about 420 at last year's meeting in Naples, Fla.; the increase in attendance would be the first in several years.

HEADLINE: Europe, U.S. Reach Partial Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced today that it had reached a partial agreement with the European Community in a Government contracts dispute, but that it would proceed with trade sanctions anyway because a full settlement had not been achieved.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said that the United States had agreed to drop "Buy American" rules for the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Energy Department's five electric power administrations. 
 In exchange, the European Community agreed to eliminate "Buy European" rules for its $20 billion electric utility equipment market.
But Mr. Kantor said the Administration would impose sanctions soon because the community did not agree to abandon its "Buy European" rules for its $13 billion telephone switching equipment market.
 
 
Scope and Timing Are Unclear
 Under the sanctions, European companies would be barred from bidding for certain Federal contracts, he said. But Mr. Kantor was unclear about their scope and timing, but said that he expected them to take effect soon and that no further negotiations were scheduled. The sanctions were originally scheduled to take effect on Thursday.
Mr. Kantor said that the sanctions would have to be narrowed and redrafted to reflect the compromise on electric power equipment, and that this could not be done today.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's commissioner for external economic relations, praised today's agreement but not with much enthusiasm. "It is very important psychologically that we have withdrawn from the brink of a trade war," he said, while adding that the community reserved the right to retaliate if it did not like the American sanctions.
While the dispute over Government contracts was not as large in financial terms as those involving auto exports or computer chips, it was the first trade issue taken up by the Clinton Administration after it took office. As such, it has retained symbolic importance as a barometer of trans-Atlantic trade relations.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the General Electric Company led the lobbying for the Administration to confront the European Community on Government contracts. Randall L. Tobias, A.T.& T.'s vice chairman, said in a telephone interview today that his company supported the Administration's handling of the issue, but that it would prefer an agreement to sanctions.
R. Michael Gadbaw, General Electric's vice president for international law and politics, said that he was "definitely satisfied" with the deal. The pact will allow General Electric to compete for $400 million to $500 million a year in European contracts for giant turbines used in power generation, he said.
Mr. Kantor had originally threatened to bar European companies from bidding on Federal contracts worth nearly $50 billion a year. But European businesses have been winning only $40 million to $50 million a year of these contracts, which were mostly for such local services like maintaining cafeterias in Federal buildings.
Another American official said that no decision had been made on how much the sanctions would be narrowed, but said that the narrowing would be figured in terms of the overall $50 billion in contracts on which bidding would be barred rather than focused on the $40 million to $50 million that European companies have traditionally won.
The deal reached today did not come up in talks with Sir Leon here on Monday and Tuesday, said an official involved in the negotiations, who insisted on anonymity. Instead, it was developed during the first of three trans-Atlantic telephone conversations between Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon an hour and a half before Mr. Kantor's news conference, the official said.
Mr. Kantor threatened trade sanctions at the start of February in a hard-line stand that drew praise from Congress. But there were also criticism from the European Community that the United States was engaging in "unilateral bullying" and was risking a trade war.
Mr. Kantor presented today's partial deal as one that expands trade rather than closing markets. In addition to the electric utilities deal, each side also agreed to put $7 billion to $13 billion of Government service contracts, like those for the construction of Federal buildings, under international free-trade rules. The rules guarantee that foreign companies will receive equal treatment for their bids with American companies.
 
 
New Rules
 At the heart of the Government contracts dispute is a provision of the European Community's new rules on Government contracting. The new rules took effect on Jan. 1, as part of the creation of a single European market, and replaced widely differing rules in the community's 12 member nations. American Administrations have been trying unsuccessfully since the 1960's to open the European market for electric power generation equipment.
The disputed provision requires that state-owned and private European utilities award contracts to European suppliers unless they are underbid by at least 3 percent by a foreign supplier. The rules also authorize utilities to dismiss any bid for which more than half of the goods are manufactured outside the European Community.
Six Federal power utilities, which supply 8 percent of the United States' electric power, award contracts to American companies unless they are underbid by at least 6 percent by a foreign supplier.
 
 
Today's Agreement
 The United States agreed today to drop the 6 percent price preference in exchange for the community's agreement to drop the 3 percent price preference and European content requirement for the community's electric utilities. But the community retained these restrictions for telecommunications, municipal water supply and urban mass transit.
According to a recent study, European companies hold 13 percent of the American telephone switching market, 28 percent of the gas turbine market and more than half of the steam turbine market. By contrast, American companies hold less than 2 percent of the European telephone switching and steam turbine markets and 13 percent of the European gas turbine market.
But European officials interviewed recently in Brussels said that these figures were deceptive, since most of the equipment sold in the United States was manufactured here by American subsidiaries of European companies. As such, they say, very little trade takes place that actually creates jobs for European workers.
The community officials also contended that the new rules replaced varying and more restrictive regulations by the community's 12 member nations.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Voters Approve 69% of Education Budgets

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 21

 BODY:
For the second year in a row, New Jersey voters treated their school districts with relative kindness, approving 69 percent of the local budgets.
The approval rating Tuesday was far above the recent low -- 52 percent in 1990 -- but a bit less than the 73 percent recorded last year. Education officials said the 31 percent of the budgets that were defeated were victims of the perpetual concern about property taxes and a low turnout at the polls. 
 Unlike New York City, where liberal and conservative alliances have formed to elect candidates in battles over social concerns like condom distribution and curriculums that teach respect for homosexuals, New Jersey had no statewide ideological furor this year that carried over to local school board races.
But state and local officials said that voters, particularly in the state's many middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs, were still sensitive to stringent reductions in state aid that were ordered almost three years ago, when Trenton directed that large amounts be shifted from the suburbs to poor urban and rural districts.
Nevertheless, the relatively high percentage of budget approvals continued what appeared to be a calming trend among voters, who in 1990 and 1991 passed barely 50 percent of the budgets statewide in direct response to Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package and the Quality Education Act, which redirected aid and put caps, or limits, on local school budget increases. The caps have forced many districts to present leaner budgets by eliminating administrative jobs, special enrichment programs and elective courses.
"This strong showing of support for school budgets across the state indicates taxpayers' willingness to stand behind school officials who exercise prudence and responsibility," said Mr. Florio, who must overcome an enormous residue of anti-tax anger to win a second term in November. "People are willing to invest in quality education programs, as long as school districts are accountable and live within their means."
The state Education Commissioner, Mary Lee Fitzgerald, echoed Mr. Florio's comments and pointed out that nearly half the districts that sought voter approval to spend beyond the budget cap received it. The cap limits spending increases to 5.6 to 6.6 percent.
Although the 69 percent approval rate was slightly below last year's, the executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, Dr. Robert E. Boose, took heart.
 
No Cuts in State Aid
 "Considering the nagging recession, high unemployment and the sentiment of many taxpayers," Mr. Boose said, "an approval rating in excess of two-thirds is remarkable."
In a statement, he said the results were attributable to several factors: a compromise school financing plan worked out in January between the Governor, a Democrat, and the Republican-led Legislature, that insured almost all districts the same amount of state aid in 1993-94 that they received this year; the fact that the plan held down property-tax increases and program cuts, and the response by school boards, which generally produced streamlined budgets.
But voter turnout, which the association estimated at 12.8 percent, was the lowest since 1987, when only 10.1 percent of the registered voters went to the polls. Turnout last year was 16.8 percent.
The association blamed low interest on frequent changes in election dates over the years and on the fact that more than two-thirds of the electorate do not have children in the public schools.
For school boards whose budgets were rejected, there is some recourse. The local board has 48 hours, or until Thursday, to submit its spending plan to the local governing body for review. The governing body can choose to adopt the original plan, compromise with the board on some reductions or order cuts. This must be done by May 14. If cuts are made, the school board can appeal to the Commissioner, the State Board of Education or the courts, though such lengthy appeals are rare.
Much of the horse trading will take place in Monmouth County, a center of anti-tax anger that approved only 37 percent of its budgets in 1991 but voted for 75.9 percent of them last year. On Tuesday, only 29 of the county's 53 budgets passed, 10 fewer than last year, for an approval rate of 54.7 percent.
Bruce Quinn, the school business administrator for the county, said Monmouth had a number of fairly wealthy districts that were ineligible for more state assistance.
And voters in some communities, like Neptune, which has had high taxes for years, continued a tradition of rejecting budgets. For the Neptune board it was the 13th defeat in a row.
"Once you get into a habit of voting them down, it's hard to break," Mr. Quinn said.

Airlines Lead Rise in Corporates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of corporate issues moved slightly higher yesterday, led by a jump in the bonds of the three major airlines.
Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds held steady and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond bounced a little, but finished at 6.75 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. 
 The corporate market was flooded with more than $1.86 billion of new issues yesterday as corporate treasurers continued to take advantage of low interest rates.
But the real focus was on the airline bonds, which seemed to move higher as one after the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, reported a net loss of $22 million in the first quarter, a much smaller loss than expected. The results also started a rally in airline stocks.
 
Hard Times Over?
 The news seemed to make many investors believe that the worst of the hard times for airlines was over. The prices of long-term bonds for American, Delta Air Lines and the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, were all up about a point as their yields fell by about 10 basis points, said Geoffrey Kurinsky, a vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services.
That means the bonds have now rebounded from the lows they hit when they were downgraded to below investment grade by Standard & Poor's on March 11. At that time, the spread, or differential, between the yield on the airline bonds and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was 350 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, for Delta, 240 for American and 260 for United. Yesterday, the spreads narrowed to 300 basis points for Delta, about 200 for American and 210 for United.
Mr. Kurinsky said that the recovery of the bonds still had a way to go, however, noting that the spread between the yield on American Airlines bonds and the Treasury's 30-year bond was 150 basis points before the price of the bonds began to decline.
 
Municipals
 The prices of municipal bonds have rebounded from declines that came when the rally in the Treasury market stalled in the first week of March. And this has pushed yields lower again.
The recent low in yields, based on a basket of long-term, high-rated bonds kept by the Bond Buyer, was 5.71 percent on March 4. As Treasury yields rose in March and early April, the yield in the Bond Buyer index jumped to 6.17 percent by April 2. By late yesterday, the yield had fallen back below 6 percent to 5.92 percent.
But the yield has still not been able to regain its recent lows, although the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has retouched its 6.72 percent low of March 8 and the yield on the 10-year note has neared its 5.82 percent low of March 4.
Traders and analysts said the reason was the continued heavy selling of new issues into an already saturated municipal market.
"The thing that has kept us away from the lows is supply," said Michael A. Bauer, a vice president in the municipal bond department at Gruntal & Company. "We are seeing up to $8 billion a week in new issues and we can't swallow all of that and move the price upward."
 
Treasuries
 The Treasury announced yesterday that at its regular monthly auction it would sell $15.25 billion of two-year notes Tuesday and $11 billion of five-year notes Wednesday. Because there was no change from the previous month in the amounts to be auctioned, the announcement provided no new clues on what revisions the Treasury might make in the quarterly auction next month.
The speculation that the Treasury may cut the size of the 30-year bond auction and even skip the auction scheduled for May has sent the price of the bond higher. The Treasury is under pressure to find some borrowing-cost savings by shifting its mix to shorter-term, lower-interest-rate securities because the Clinton Administration has assumed $16 billion of such cost reductions over the next five years in its deficit reduction plan.
In late trading in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market yesterday, the yield on the two-year note was 3.78 percent and the yield on the five-year note was 5.05 percent.
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed at the end of a volatile trading day yesterday. The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 10427/32 and the yield remained at 6.75 percent. Prices of Treasury notes were only 1/32 or 2/32 higher although the market got a little help when traders saw the Federal Reserve buying Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: High Mexican Interest Rates Are Luring Wall Street Cash

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Lured by eye-catching interest rates of 16 percent or more, American money managers and a few risk-taking individuals are investing billions of dollars in Mexican Treasury securities and thus helping to finance Mexico's move to an industrial economy.
The investors are gambling that their investments will not be wiped out, as many were in the late 1970's when Mexico ordered a sweeping devaluation of the peso that when measured in dollars immediately shrank the size of the savings that thousands of American retirees had built up in Mexican banks. 
 This time, the American risk takers are not retirees but Wall Street money managers, brokerage houses and mutual fund operators with names like Fidelity, Scudder, Merrill Lynch and Bear, Stearns. Over the last year alone, foreigners -- mainly these American organizations -- have amassed $9 billion worth of Mexican Government securities, or nearly triple their holdings at the end of 1991, according to Banco de Mexico, the nation's central bank.
"There is no other country in the world where I can buy Government securities that yield so much and are safe," said Robert Beckwitt, manager of various mutual funds at Fidelity Investments with big holdings in Mexican Government securities.
Americans have been buying these securities since January 1991, when the Mexican Government first made them available for foreign purchase. In addition to the $9 billion in Treasury holdings, foreigners hold about $20 billion in Mexican bank certificates of deposits, which earn as much as 22 percent annually. The booming investment in Mexican securities reflects the American quest for interest rates higher than in the United States.
 
Other Nations Succeeded
 The higher rates also reflect President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's policy of keeping rates high enough to reduce inflation and to draw foreign capital to help finance rapid industrialization. Inflation has fallen to an annual rate of 12 percent, low for Mexico.
Other developing nations bent on rapidly creating a modern manufacturing industry have also sold short-term securities to foreigners to finance big outlays to equip new factories. South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, for example, relied on foreign investment to pay for imports of capital goods until export income rose sufficiently to cover the purchases. And these countries managed the transition to manufacturing economies mostly without major devaluations.
The gamble for Americans buying Mexican securities is that Mexico might become the exception. The Salinas Government hopes to pay off the securities with dollars raised from a rapid increase in exports of manufactured goods. Right now, that is not happening. Instead, Mexico is importing huge quantities of machinery and materials for the new factories. Imports, as a result, shot up by 26 percent last year while exports of manufactured goods rose by only 4.4 percent.
If those percentages are not reversed in a year or two, many experts say, then the Government may be forced into a major devaluation -- one that might help exports by making them less costly, but at the expense of foreign investors. A sudden major peso devaluation might make a $10,000 investment in a one-year Treasury note worth, say, $6,000, including the 16 percent interest that it had earned. The interest earnings are free of Mexican taxes.
"These investors have been extremely lucky until now," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist and consultant in Mexico City. "But there is a point at which you cannot eat your cake and have it, too. You cannot have high rates of return and not have a devaluation risk."
The last major devaluation came in 1987. Since then, the Government has adhered to a policy of tiny, almost daily devaluations that have added up to no more than 5 percent a year. "We have enough flexibility to continue this policy and to maintain a sufficiently stable exchange rate," said Guillermo Ortiz, an Under Secretary of the Treasury.
Perhaps no American counts on that assurance more than Mr. Beckwitt of Fidelity. The funds he manages include holdings of $750 million in Mexican Treasuries. Various other Fidelity funds managed by others hold hundreds of millions of dollars more, making Fidelity probably the largest single owner of Mexican Treasuries, Mr. Beckwitt said.
"I am as convinced as I can be that the risk of an overnight major devaluation is extremely small," he said. "The Mexican Government knows from its experiences in the 70's and 80's that if it did that again it would return itself to the status of a third world country."
A 5 percent annual devaluation still allows Mr. Beckwitt a handsome profit. It means that the peso will go from 3 pesos for one American dollar today to 3.15 pesos to the dollar a year from now. Even at that, an American investor holding a one-year $10,000 Treasury note yielding 16 percent, for example, would come away with a net gain of 11 percent, or a total of $11,100, once the Mexican security was converted into dollars.
That is still far above the 3.15 percent yield today for a similar Treasury bill in the United States. But if the Mexican Government were to change course and suddenly decree a 50 percent devaluation in a single day, the American investor would end up with only $5,800 in his pocket.
 
Parking Cash in Mexico
 Brokerage houses like Nomura and Bear, Stearns also invest their own money in short-term Mexican securities, and they act as agents for various mutual funds, as well as a few wealthy individuals who purchase Mexican Treasury securities. Often, the mutual funds, having sold American stocks or bonds, park cash temporarily in the high-yielding Mexican Treasuries.
"Keeping cash in Mexico is a sign of huge confidence in that country," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns.
A similar confidence in the 1970's prompted thousands of American retirees living in Mexico to keep their savings in Mexican banks. The peso had remained steady against the dollar for years. But with foreign exchange reserves nearly depleted, the Government lacked enough dollars to maintain this stability. So it suddenly decreed a huge peso devaluation that greatly increased the number of pesos necessary to purchase a dollar.
That reduced the drain on the nation's foreign exchange reserves, but it also diminished the savings of the American retirees, when measured in dollars. Today, in contrast, Mexico's central bank boasts an $18 billion dollar reserve as a buffer against a sudden devaluation.
 
Burned on Oil Collapse
 In the late 70's and early 80's, American banks took a different gamble. They lent billions of dollars to Mexico, and counted on revenue from that country's oil exports to service the debt. When oil prices collapsed, Mexico defaulted and has still not repaid much of this debt.
This time the peso's strength is tied to manufactured goods rather than oil. In a nation bent on rapid industrialization, the hope is that exports of manufactured goods will rise sharply, especially with the successful conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
That would bring sufficient revenue without having to sell so many Treasury securities and bank certificates of deposit to Americans. Normally, revenue from exports would have paid the $46.3 billion import bill last year. But export revenue was only $25.2 billion, so the dollars to pay for the imports came in effect from the sale of Treasuries and C.D.'s to foreigners.
When revenue from other international transactions like tourism are included, Mexico's total shortfall, or current account deficit, is $23 billion at an annual rate -- unusually high for a nation of Mexico's size. This is the shortfall that the Mexican Government is financing mostly through the sale of securities to foreigners.

Money Fund Yields Mixed As Focus Turned to Taxes

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week, reflecting seasonal tax pressures and uneasiness in the stock market.
According to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report, tax-exempt money fund yields rose sharply in the week that ended Tuesday. Yields jumped an average 8 basis points, and investors withdrew $2.7 billion from tax-exempt funds, which now total $108 billion, The Money Fund Report said. 
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist for The Money Fund Report, said that the April 15 deadline for filing tax returns prompted investors to withdraw money from funds to pay tax bills. Another factor for the decline in assets, he said, might have been that the very low short-term yields were forcing investors out of money market funds and into bond funds and longer maturities in search of higher returns.
For the week, fund managers shortened the average days left to maturity of securities held in their portfolios to 49 from 50.
 
 
Tax-Exempt Yields Up
 The IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded tax-exempt fund yield rose 8 basis points, to 1.95 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield up 9 basis points, to 1.95 percent. The average 30-day compounded yield was 1.96 percent, and the simple yield was 1.94 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Not including state and local taxes, the taxable bond equivalent yield for the average seven-day yield is about 2.74 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket and about 2.86 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
Among the tax-exempt funds with more than $100 million in assets, the Money Fund Report said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund had the highest yield for the week, at 2.61 percent, up 3 basis points from last week's best.
The average seven-day compounded taxable fund yield slipped 2 basis points, to 2.66 percent, in the week that ended yesterday, according to IBC/Donoghue. The average seven-day simple yield fell 1 basis point, to 2.63 percent; the average 30-day compounded yield was 2.69 percent, while the average 30-day simple yield was 2.65 percent.
 
 
Assets of Taxable Funds Rise
 Assets of taxable money market funds rose by $7 billion, to a total of $490.5 billion. Assets of institutional funds rose by $4.8 billion, to $173 billion, and retail assets rose $2.2 billion, to $317.5 billion. Analysts noted that about a third of the gain in retail assets came from the addition of two new funds.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios rose to 63, from 62. They said that this trend left the impression that money managers were not worried about yields.
"If they were, they would be shortening up," Mr. Frank said. "Instead, the managers are reaching out for higher yields in the longer maturities as yields continue to slump."
Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund turned in the highest return this week among general purpose taxable money funds, yielding 3.48 percent, or a basis point better than last week's best.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investors' cash, shaved a basis point off their average yield in the week, to 2.58 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Japan Intervenes and Lifts ollar From Historic Lows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Waves of intervention by the Bank of Japan lifted the dollar from historic lows against the Japanese yen yesterday, inspiring a broader advance that spilled over into key European currencies.
As many traders had expected, the central bank's tolerance for a lower dollar was tested when the United States currency broke below the crucial 110-yen level in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan was widely reported to have intervened three times, and the dollar managed to touch 111 yen during the New York session. 
 The rally helped the dollar advance against the German mark despite a report of a sharply higher money supply in Germany, which seemed to diminish the chances for a supportive cut in German interest rates.
Gold slipped in New York after sharper declines overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents a troy ounce to settle at $339.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $339.25 a troy ounce, off 25 cents.
 
Reports That Others Helped
 Geoffrey Dennis, a currency strategist with James Capel & Company, said there were unproved rumors that other central banks had joined the Bank of Japan actions. But the widely reported Japanese intervention was significant enough by itself to spur participants to take profits on the yen's recent gains, he said.
"The 110 level is a key psychological point," Mr. Dennis said. "Now that we got there, the market has turned a bit nervous."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 110.35 yen, up 0.10 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 110.95 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was worth 110.71 yen, up from late Tuesday's 110.55 yen.
In Germany, the mark failed to gain against the dollar despite the report that the money supply rose 3.2 percent in March, much higher than expected.
The report, which raised inflationary concerns, deflated some hopes that the Bundesbank would cut short-term interest rates. Lower interest rates, which would increase the dollar's value, can also aggravate inflation. Later comments from a top Bundesbank official that the money supply increase was not abnormal seemed to soothe some concerns.

HEADLINE: Budget Gap Is Narrower

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
The United States posted a budget deficit of $44.577 billion for March, but the shortfall was down 12.1 percent from a year earlier because of higher revenues, the Treasury said today.
Taxes and other kinds of income were higher than in March 1992, when the Government posted a deficit of $50.712 billion. Interest payments also fell, reflecting lower rates. 
 "The economy is improving a tad," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
In addition, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of disposing of bad loans and other assets of failed savings and loans associations, reported a small profit last month. In years past, the agency cost taxpayers money as it liquidated or sold off failed savings institutions.
By category, the Government's March receipts totaled $83.453 billion, while expenses totaled $128.029 billion, including $18.007 billion in interest on the public debt.
For the fiscal year to date, the United States is running a budget deficit of $182.825 billion compared with a $199.361 billion deficit for the similar period of the 1992 fiscal year.
For all of the 1992 fiscal year, the United States reported a record deficit of $290.203 billion. The 1993 fiscal year deficit could widen to $321.954 billion, according to White House projections.
For February, the United States reported a budget shortfall of $47.594 billion.

HEADLINE: Bond Refunding For Los Angeles

 BODY:
A $559.4 million refunding by Los Angeles County for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was by far the largest municipal offering yesterday as debt issuers continue to take advantage of low interest rates to refund issues sold when rates were higher. Some of the Los Angeles bonds to be refunded carry interest rates as high as 6.90 percent.
Strong demand allowed underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company to reprice the sales tax revenue refunding bonds a little higher, thereby lowering yields. The maximum yield is about 5.7419 percent for a bond due in 2013, with a bond due in 2021 priced to yield about 5.6603 percent and one due in 2018 priced to yield about 5.7377 percent. 
 Shorter-maturity serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.50 percent in 1995 to 4.50 percent in 1998, 5.20 percent in 2003 and 5.65 percent in 2009.
The bonds due in 2018 and 2021 are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, respectively. They are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation. All other maturities are rated A-1 by Moody's and A+ by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The U.S. could regret getting its way on trade with Japan.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ANYONE for Japan-bashing? It has long been a riskless sport in Washington. Labor approved, as did most big businesses. And Japanese leaders, loath to tamper with the alliance, have carefully confined their contemptuous ripostes to domestic audiences.
But the tone of the relationship is changing. While President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa agreed to disagree, no one familiar with the bland diplomatic rhetoric that the Japanese have honed to an art form could interpret last week's exchange on trade as business-as-usual. 
 Mr. Miyazawa's reluctance to assume the traditional position of little brother does not mark the beginning of a cold economic war. The American connection is simply too important to Japan to be allowed to rupture over the details of rice quotas and imported auto parts. Indeed, to many economists dismayed by the Clinton Administration's campaign to guarantee American companies a minimum share of the Japanese market, the biggest worry is that the gods may punish Mr. Clinton by giving him much of what he wants.
Stripped to essentials, Washington's beef is twofold. First, American products have been discriminated against by Japan's clubby corporate system in which back-scratching matters more than quality or price. As important, Japan has locked itself into an export-or-stagnate mode in which growth can come only at the expense of foreign competitors and domestic consumers.
But in the view of many economists, this conventional political wisdom is at odds with the facts. Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, concedes that Japan is guilty of trade protectionism. But he points out that America has been an equal sinner, notably in clothing, steel, dairy products, sugar and autos.
What's more, Japan has walked many a mile to mollify Americans in recent years, transplanting much of its export capacity to American shores. "Since 1985," Mr. Saxonhouse notes, "our exports to Japan have grown more rapidly than our exports to Europe, while our imports have grown more slowly." The only reason the trade gap between the two countries has recently widened, he argues, is because Japan is heading into a recession while America is already out.
Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, worries less about the nature of the American trade complaint than the proposed fix. The President, Mr. Bhagwati points out, is taken with "managed trade" -- the trade equivalent of affirmative action. Mr. Clinton is not asking the Japanese to plead guilty to discrimination against American products, and then agree to go and sin no more. Rather, he wants Tokyo to guarantee that a minimum percentage of Japan's industrial needs will be purchased from American suppliers.
That might seem harmless enough if the products in question were, say, microprocessors or communications satellites, where American technology and prices are very competitive. But once you start down this road, Mr. Bhagwati says, it is the weak industries that fight hardest for guaranteed markets, not the strong ones. "If you don't want to become a cynic," he concludes, "don't study trade policy."
The new political enthusiasm for managed trade has driven much of the free market-oriented economics establishment to embrace what is seen as lesser evils: managed currency exchange rates or managed Japanese domestic demand.
Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in Washington thinks an additional 5 to 10 percent appreciation of exchange value of the yen with respect to the dollar would go a long way toward pricing Japanese products out of America and pricing American products into Japan. And he thinks governments can pull off a managed appreciation by buying and selling the two currencies. "Intervention works," he said flatly.
An alternative, pursued by the Bush Administration and certainly not opposed by the Clinton White House, is to encourage the Japanese to consume and invest more at home, leaving less surplus production to export. That is one reason why Japan announced a big fiscal stimulus package on the eve of the Miyazawa visit to Washington.
One catch is that the stimulus probably will not have as much oomph as advertised. The $115 billion-plus package looks more like $60 to $70 billion to economists who know their way around arcane Japanese fiscal accounting -- enough to generate only a mild economic recovery in domestic demand. The Japanese, it seems, loathe budget deficits even more than they loathe conflict with the man from Hope.
But the bigger catch, one that calls into question the whole thrust of the Clinton diplomatic exercise, is that we may soon regret any success in making the Japanese more like us. Among the rich countries, only Japan is, on balance, a major exporter of capital. And if Japan is bullied into joining the no-money-down crowd, where will the trillions of dollars worth of fresh capital be found to bring Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, China, India and most of Latin America into the community of developed economies?
