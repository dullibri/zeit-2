HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT;
Democrats Endorse Dodd For a 3d Term

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 25

 BODY:
Connecticut Democrats today nominated Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who is running for his third term, as their candidate for the United States Senate, and basked in the party's new-found optimism after its national convention in New York earlier this month.
The one-day state Democratic convention, attended by more than 1,400 delegates, offered few surprises, as Mr. Dodd had already declared his candidacy and was unanimously nominated. The 48-year-old Democrat also received the support of the fledgling party founded by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., A Connecticut Party, which met in Wallingford tonight. 
 Mr. Dodd took the opportunity to denounce what he called negative campaigning by the Republicans.
"Last week at the Republican state convention, they didn't want to talk about George Bush and Dan Quayle," he said. "Our candidates stand for a future. The only thing the Republicans offered was to engage in personal attacks."
Mr. Dodd will face the winner of the Sept. 15 Republican primary, either State Representative Christopher B. Burnham, whom the party has endorsed, or Brook Johnson, a Greenwich businessman who has said he will spend his own money to match the Democratic campaign effort.
 
Kerrey Denounces Bush
 Throughout today's convention, speakers offered spirited denunciations of the Bush Administration's handling of the economy and what many called the demagogic campaign tactics and unrealistic promises of Republican candidates.
"We see that the President is massively confused about what's going on in this country," said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Presidential nomination this year and delivered today's keynote address.
After the convention, some Democrats made their way to Wallingford for the first convention of A Connecticut Party. The executive committee of the party last week had called for the endorsement of Mr. Dodd and four Democratic congressional candidates -- incumbents Barbara B. Kennelly, Sam Gejdenson and Rosa L. DeLauro, as well as Lynn H. Taborsak, who is challenging Gary Franks, a Republican -- and 98 candidates for the state legislature. These included 79 Democrats, 3 Republicans and 16 candidates of A Connecticut Party.

HEADLINE: Fighting Corruption and Tradition in the School System

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
As vast and intricate as it is, New York City's Board of Education is viewed by insiders as an intimate shop with its own peculiar customs, a place where people know one another for decades and watch their lives become entangled.
Into that shop has come a stranger, Edward F. Stancik, a lean, blue-eyed 37-year-old Chicago native whose career has not been spent in education but in criminal prosecution. In 1990, he was appointed the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the school system, charged with ferreting out corruption within it after a mayoral commission found that the board's own internal investigative arm had grown too cozy with those it was supposed to keep honest. 
 Within the school system family -- the seven central board members as well as administrators and teachers -- Mr. Stancik is sometimes resented. That resentment peaked last week when he charged in a report that a favorite of the board, Bruce A. Irushalmi, the executive director for school security, and his two top aides had engaged in a variety of misdeeds. These included a private real-estate deal between Mr. Irushalmi and one of the aides, Joseph Capalbo, that violated conflict-of-interest laws, Mr. Irushalmi's cursory internal inquiry into Mr. Capalbo's conviction for possession of a stolen car, and his cavalier attitude to the hiring of a dozen relatives by a second aide, Henry R. Murphy.
 
Resistance From Board
 Some board officials contend that because he was unfamiliar with longtime board mores and with the realities of negotiating a labyrinthine bureaucracy, Mr. Stancik was too rigid in dealing with the conduct of Mr. Irushalmi and his aides. One board member, Michael J. Petrides of Staten Island, said Mr. Stancik had taken a holier-than-thou attitude toward Mr. Irushalmi, whom Mr. Petrides described as having restored professionalism to a ragged department.
But Mr. Stancik suggests that precisely because he is an outsider, he has been unafraid to tackle corruption cases at the board.
"There is a sort of culture at the Board of Education that is difficult to pierce," he said. "When trouble develops, the attitude should be 'Let's get to the bottom of this.' At the Board of Education, the attitude often is 'Let's get our friends out of this.' "
In his first six weeks on the job, Mr. Stancik arrested five teachers and school workers on charges of sexually abusing students. Most of the cases had been languishing under the board's old Inspector General's office.
 
Strictly Independent
 Mr. Stancik enjoys an uncommon degree of independence. He was appointed by the city's Commissioner of Investigation, Susan E. Shepard but does not report to her or to the Board of Education. He reports to no one and can be dismissed only if the Commissioner of Investigation files public charges. Only his budget can be held hostage by the board, not his job, and he tangled with Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez to secure the $3 million budget he sought.
This arrangement is unique in the city, where most agencies have inspector generals that report to the Commissioner of Investigation. Mr. Stancik is also alone in having subpoena power, the power to take testimony under oath and the power of arrest.
Mr. Stancik has virtually disbanded the board's old Inspector General's staff, keeping only a quarter of its employees and assembling a new staff that includes 40 investigators and eight lawyers. In May, in a gesture as rich with symbolism as it was expensive, he moved the investigatory office out of board headquarters in downtown Brooklyn to spanking new quarters at 25 Broadway in Manhattan. Whistle-blowers and witnesses had been reluctant to go to the old office for fear they would be recognized, he said.
The man some board officials see as a new Savonarola is said by friends to be far less severe. Mr. Stancik lives in a TriBeCa loft and likes to cook for friends and to relax by fly fishing in the Adirondacks. A bachelor, he has been dating a woman who works in publishing for two years.
 
Son of a Printer
 Michael Cherkasky, chief of the Investigation Division in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, says Mr. Stancik has a dry wit that enlivened a recent going-away party for a prosecutor.
"We do not find we make a lot of friends, and Ed's got the courage to understand being independent," Mr. Cherkasky said. "We can't ask our children to apply moral standards when the people in charge of security don't apply moral standards."
A devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Stancik serves as a reader at St. Patrick's Cathedral. For 11 years he has been a Big Brother, shepherding a fatherless boy into college. "It provided a relationship that didn't exist anywhere else in my life," he said.
Mr. Stancik, whose name bespeaks his Slovak ancestry, was an only child whose mother died when he was 14. His father, a printer, helped put him through the University of Illinois, where he majored in economics.
"Until he retired his hands were dark blue," Mr. Stancik recalls affectionately. "It took a year for his hands to return to normal."
 
Upholding the Law
 After graduation from Columbia University Law School, Mr. Stancik went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert A. Morgenthau, for 11 years. "I was intrigued by the mystery of New York and the excitement and intensity of it all," he said. He rose to deputy chief of the rackets bureau and earned a reputation as a discerning administrator and a skillful trial lawyer.
There are some who suggest that Mr. Stancik has too much of a good-vs.-evil view of the world. A major accusation against Mr. Irushalmi is that his division hired retired police officers who continued to collect their pensions as well as their salaries, which violated "double-dipping laws." Defenders of Mr. Irushalmi say he had no alternative at a time when hiring police retirees was crucial to a security force trying to control an increasingly violent school system.
Mr. Stancik responds that it is his responsibility to uphold the law.
"I don't think you can simply ignore the law when it's inconvenient for you," he said in an interview.
Mr. Stancik says some central board officials are angry because they expected him to pursue corruption only in the city's 32 local school districts, not in the central board.
"There are a lot of people at the board who talk tough on corruption when it is in the outlying school districts," he said. "They leave their hearts in a hurry when the target gets closer to home."

Going Once, Going Twice. Forget It. It's Yours.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
To be blunt, the bottom line at the Keeneland horse auction in Kentucky last week hit bottom. The average price per horse was down 19 percent from last year's July sale and the gross was down 35 percent. And nobody in the Bluegrass forgets that last year's prices were already 11 percent lower than in 1990.
The auction has been touted for years as the world's most prestigious horse sale. But in recent years, it has served as a warning signal to the horse world that the market is still plunging after a wild decade of soaring out of control in the 1980's. 
 In three days at the manicured and clubby little race track next to Calumet Farm last week, 265 "selected yearlings" were sold for $54.1 million, an average of $204,151 a horse. Last year's gross for 332 horses was $83,324,000; the average, $250,976.
The highest price paid for a yearling this year was $1.3 million, posted by Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai for a Claiborne Farm yearling by Mr. Prospector. The price was a tenth of the world record amount for a thoroughbred: $13.1 million paid by Robert Sangster of Britain at the 1985 July sale at Keeneland. He gave it for Seattle Dancer, son of Nijinsky II and half-brother to the champion Seattle Slew.
But price doesn't guarantee performance. Seattle Dancer went to the races only five times, won twice, finished second once and third once, earned $150,000 and was retired at the age of 3. The previous record for a horse at auction was $10.2 million, paid by Sheik Mohammed for a colt who never raced.
Last July, the four Maktoum brothers spent $25 million in three days at Keeneland. This year, $13.9 million. Sheik Maktoum al-Maktoum, the senior brother and the ruler of Dubai, spent nothing this time.
"We're not recession-proof by any stretch of the imagination," said Bill Greely, president of the Keeneland track in Lexington, Ky.
 
Krone Near Belmont Title
 Julie Krone raced past her 29th birthday on Friday and prepared to pass another milestone in her career as the most successful female jockey in racing history. With only two days to go at Belmont Park's summer meeting, she holds a substantial lead over Mike Smith, who has won seven consecutive riding titles at New York tracks.
Krone has won the riding title at Monmouth Park and at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and last winter was No. 1 at Gulfstream Park in Florida. But if she's still first after tomorrow's last race, she will be the first woman to win the championship at Belmont Park. Then, it's on to Saratoga, where Smith last year replaced Angel Cordero Jr. as top rider.
 
New England Horse Ban
 New York fine-tuned its response to the horse virus in New England last week. It banned horses from New England until the epidemic subsides. Previously, it had quarantined 14 horses returning home from New England tracks, notably Rockhingham Park in New Hampshire and Foxboro and Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts. But the quarantine was lifted last week when no signs of the virus were detected here.
Dr. W. Theodore Hill, chief examining veterinarian at Belmont Park, said the ban on shipping from New England was intended "to protect horses stabled on the grounds at Belmont Park, Saratoga and Aqueduct."
"These restrictions will be re-evaluated and may change," he said, "when the outbreaks have been controlled." Meanwhile, horses from New England will not be welcome when Saratoga opens Wednesday.
 
Victory for Ratings
 Speaking of betting coups, the Sheepshead Bay Handicap at Belmont yesterday was won by the Augustin Stable's Ratings, who had half a length on his stablemate, Ristna. And Ristna had a head on Dancing Devlette in a crowded photo finish. The entry paid $10,80 for $2 to win, with Jean Cruguet riding the winner, who covered the mile and three-sixteenths in 2:15 flat.

HEADLINE: When Skinflintery Is a Way of Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bidding the Wage Wars Goodbye" (At Work, July 5) was written for me. The article about Ron and Melodie Moore's venture into publishing Skinflint News could not have been appreciated more by any reader.
It was not so much the intriguing new career the Moores have fashioned from their "career discontent" and from opportunity that attracted me as the underlying philosophy and sense that frugality is a way of life. There is indeed more to it than mere economizing or seeking bargains. 
 I have spent countless years being a skinflint, and perhaps a tightwad and curmudgeon to boot. My wife has resisted my saving ways; my children have complained; my friends have, shall we say, questioned. Now I feel exonerated. No longer will I feel weird when I scrounge scrap wood from neighborhood trash piles and chop it up for next winter's kindling. No longer laughable when I recycle the dehumidifier's catch for watering house plants and washing screens. No longer suspect when I get a pair of shoes resoled and wear them for another year, or cut up junk-mail envelopes for kitchen note pads. No longer guilty when I cut those packaged paper napkins in half.
To the Moores, I say right on! I am a true believer, and I agree that skinflintery is good discipline. I am making neither a living nor a buck off my harmless habits, but I estimate that I save $300 per year. I am sending $12 of that for a subscription to Skinflint News.

HEADLINE: The Cart Before the Capital in Eastern Europe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Why is it that whenever a story appears on an eastern European economy ("Czechoslovakia's Wall Street Brigade," June 21), the emphasis is heavily on what Wall Street is doing? Haven't we learned from the experience of the 80's and early 90's that when it comes to getting an underdeveloped economy going, Wall Street is the last resort and not the first?
I've been teaching marketing strategy at the International Management Center in Budapest. My students are from the big state trusts, the newly privatized firms, the rising entrepreneurs. What don't they know? 
 Well, first they don't know what a market is. They don't know how to identify the market they want to serve, based on whatever skills, technology or facilities they bring to the game. They don't know how to determine what potential customers need, what drives those needs, what competition is already doing to serve those needs. That's marketing intelligence, and they don't know they need it -- or how to get it.
These countries have not been in the business of satisfying what potential customers need and will pay for. It's the very first thing they now have to understand.
Next, our East Bloc friends have to learn that, based on this marketing intelligence, they have to adapt their products and services to match what people will pay for. Function. Quality. Price.
America's steel industry learned to its distress that when foreign competitors paid attention to those things, Americans lost out.
Third, eastern Europeans don't know how to tell the market what it is they offer and why anyone should buy it. How to build a perception of quality and of value. Advertising has long been regarded with disdain in the East Bloc. But smart marketers know how it sets up the sales situation, paves the way to make the sale possible. Ask Du Pont, ask 3-M, ask General Electric whether it works.
Finally, eastern Europeans don't know how to make a product so easy and attractive to buy that the consumer can't afford not to.
It is a process -- a controllable, manageable system for doing business. That process defines the skills East Bloc companies need to learn from the West. When we show them how to move goods, capital will flow in their direction. Nothing succeeds like success.
So that's what's needed. It's what successful businesses all over the world do. But, pour capital and advice about setting up stock exchanges into companies and governments that don't have working businesses, and you can kiss both -- the capital and the capitalist system -- goodbye.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Economy;
Perot's Bitter Budget Pill: Higher Taxes to Cure Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Ross Perot has unveiled a far-reaching economic plan that would eliminate the budget deficit in five years by increasing income taxes on the rich, imposing higher taxes on Social Security for upper-income recipients and taking other painful steps that most Presidential candidates have shied from in recent years.
Details of the plan, being reported in the next issue of U.S. News & World Report, show in far greater detail than previous news accounts the pain that Mr. Perot's proposals would inflict on Americans of all income levels. It calls for raising gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon, doubling taxes on cigarettes and taxing some employer-paid health insurance plans as if they were income. 
 The plan, which was being prepared for the Dallas businessman before he abandoned his campaign for the Presidency 10 days ago, focuses on trying to make American industry more competitive by providing tax credits for new investments and for worker training, and by diverting money from military research into the civilian sector.
 
Plan to Press Candidates
 "It's certainly a bold plan," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "Candidates usually don't issue such plans because of the enormous turmoil and complaints they would cause, especially from the elderly."
The article in the magazine's issue that is scheduled to be on the newsstands on Monday quoted Mr. Perot as saying he would "do whatever I have to do" to press Presidential and Congressional candidates to consider the plan. U.S. News provided The New York Times with a copy of the plan today.
"This is a plan that Mr. Perot has put out to be debated by the American people," John P. White, the Perot issues director who is the plan's main author, said in a telephone interview today. "This is not the final answer, but we are committed to balancing the budget.
"Balancing the budget, in order to get us back on a growth path that will make the United States competitive, is an issue too important not to be fully and openly debated by the candidates."
 
Promising a Budget Surplus
 In the U.S. News article, Mr. Perot voiced optimism that his plan could have a major effect on this year's campaign, saying "if a consensus exists, within three weeks both parties will have adopted the plan or a version of it."
Political analysts say that Mr. Perot's plan, by discussing in detail the types of difficult measures needed to balance the budget, is likely to step up the pressure on President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, to address what they would do to eliminate the deficit.
The White House said this week that it could eliminate the budget deficit, projected to be about $350 billion this year, by 1998 if Congress would pass all of President Bush's economic proposals and significantly faster economic growth resulted. The calculations came in a mid-year review by the Office of Management and Budget, which said the new projection was based on Congressional approval of a cap on Medicare and other entitlement spending and passage of a long-sought cut in the capital gains tax.
Mr. Perot's plan promises to turn the present deficit into a surplus of $8 billion by 1998.
Mr. Perot would subject 85 percent of Social Security benefits to taxation for individual recipients with income of $25,000 or more and for couples filing jointly with income of $32,000 or more. At present, just 50 percent of those benefits are taxed.
His plan also proposes allowing businesses to deduct just 50 percent of entertainment expenses, down from the current level of 80 percent. It would also limit deductions on mortgage interest to the first $250,000 of a mortgage.
Mr. Perot also proposed cutting farm subsidies by a total of $17 billion over the next five years.
"It means some pain, and I don't want to minimize it, but it means modest adjustments for most people," Mr. White said. "It means taking away some things which are favors, but it gives back some things in the form of investment incentives for what's needed for growth so we all have a much better future."
U.S. News said that a study by an economics consulting firm commissioned by Mr. Perot found that his plan would result in somewhat slower economic growth and somewhat higher unemployment during the mid-1990's because reducing the deficit would be a drag on the economy by slowing down spending.
 
Plan in Bureaucratic Language
 But the consulting firm, DRI/McGraw Hill, based in Lexington, Mass., found, that the plan would increase exports, reduce long-term interest rates and result in an additional $1 trillion in private investment over the next decade. The study said that the plan would ultimately speed up growth and increase economic output about $2,000 for each American family by the year 2002.
The plan, which is written in dry, bureaucratic language, without Mr. Perot's usual, rhetorical punch, calls for increasing fees for use of many publicly supported operations, such as for private pilots who use air traffic control towers and for people who use inland waterways and Federal recreation areas.
Mr. Perot's plan would take a hatchet to a lot of Federal spending. He would cut military spending by $40 billion more than President Bush plans over the next five years. He suggests massive cuts in mass transit and arts programs and recommends eliminating the proposed space station. U.S. News quotes him as calling that "a vacation home in space."
He also calls for cutting other Federal discretionary programs by 10 percent across the board. All told, he would cut discretionary spending by $33 billion in 1998.
In light of all the hardships the plan would engender, Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a research group, and an economic official in the Carter Administration, said, "I bet it wouldn't have seen the light of day if he had stayed in the race."
The plan proposes raising the highest income tax bracket to 33 percent, from its current 31 percent, a measure that Perot aides said would hit the richest 4 percent of American households. Mr. Perot said he would increase the rate to 35 percent if additional steps were needed to balance the budget.
Noting that employer-paid health insurance is not taxed as income, Mr. Perot's plan says this tax-free income creates an advantage to individuals who receive health insurance through their jobs relative to people who pay for their own health insurance. The plan calls for taxing health-care premiums for families coverage worth more than $335 a month.
 
Extending Medicare Tax
 The plan also would extend the 1.45 percent Medicare tax beyond the current wage ceiling of $130,000. And it would increase insurance premiums for some Medicare programs.
In addition, it would limit the cost-of-living increase for Federal retirees to two-thirds of inflation. The plan says these programs typically exceed those received by private pensioners.
"I think most economists would say this is exactly the type of plan that the American public has to think about," Mr. Bosworth said. "Maybe they'd do some different combination of things, but I think it's a good mix because they sort of hit every group, although they would hit the elderly a little bit harder because they focus on those parts of the budget growing most rapidly and a lot of those programs involve the elderly."
The Perot plan also anticipates saving $52.8 billion in 1998 by containing costs of Medicare and Medicaid. His plan did not specify how that would be done. "What we must do is get costs under control, and we must build a consensus of the participants in the health care system," Mr. White said.
To improve the nation's competitiveness, the plan had numerous measures to increase investment, including a call to cut capital gains taxes. The plan would offer companies a tax credit equal to 10 percent of investments that are above what is calculated to be their expected level of investment. This aims to prevent companies from receiving tax credits on investments that would have occurred anyway.
"The credit will be targeted to the most productive forms of investment, e.g., machine tools vs. office furniture," the plan said.
It also calls for a tax credit for worker training, aimed more at blue-collar workers than at high-paid executives. The plan would invest $40 billion over five years in public property like roads and new telecommunications systems. It would also increase spending on education, cities and research and development by $70 billion over five years.
The plan argues in favor of increased gasoline taxes by noting that this would help conserve energy, reduce pollution and trim the deficit. It says special allowances should be made to help small independent truckers and others hurt disproportionately.
Mr. Perot's plan also calls for eliminating numerous subsidies, saying the potential targets include tax credits to historic buildings, subsidies to the Rural Electrification Administration and Department of Energy subsidies for hydroelectric power.
"There are many direct government subsidies and preference in the tax code that have little economic justification other than to provide benefits for a particular group," it says.

HEADLINE: Working From Home Draws Reprimands From Neighbors

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: IRVINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Amalia Lee and Patrick Molt moved from Manhattan to a gracious white brick house in the expensive Ardsley Park section of this village seven years ago, they were pleased to find not only the home of their dreams but also a place within commuting distance of both of their offices. Dr. Lee, a psychiatrist, practiced in Manhattan, and Dr. Molt, a surgeon, worked at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.
Since they moved here, their family has grown, and Dr. Lee recently converted the garage to an office and put in a tree-lined circular driveway to accommodate parking for patients. She no longer wanted to commute every day and preferred to work at home at least part of the week, close to her 5-year-old daughter and her 15-month-old son. 
 "It seemed like the logical thing to do, not something that would touch off a firestorm," she said. "I simply wanted to be more involved in my children's lives, and at the same time, I didn't want to give up my career."
Dr. Lee's plan to establish a home office -- even though it was permitted under village zoning regulations -- was criticized by her neighbors and has since escalated into a conflict that has become what some people are calling "a civil war in Irvington," pitting neighbor against neighbor.
 
'All Too Familiar Conflict'
 "What we are talking about," said Edward J. Pastucha, a former Village Trustee who has lived in this 2.5-square-mile river community for 31 years, "is an all too familiar conflict between an establishment group that emerges every so often and new people who are bringing changes."
The trouble began with a letter two years ago from Robert and Yvette Dunbar, who live across the street from Dr. Lee, in a neighborhood where, real estate brokers say, houses sell for $600,000 and more. Mr. and Mrs. Dunbar asked the psychiatrist to reconsider her plans for a home office in order to "preserve the character of the neighborhood."
In their letter, copies of which they distributed to other residents in Ardsley Park, the couple described the potential harm to their neighborhood as "a few more cars, another sign, an inquiring delivery man -- the crabgrass of business."
Since Dr. Lee decided to proceed with her plans, her neighbors have formed the Zoning Committee, an ad hoc group of 11 members that is pressing village officials to enact stricter zoning codes.
"No one is opposed to home offices as such; I have one in my house," said Herbert L. Camp, a lawyer and a member of the committee. "The point is no one cares what people do inside their homes as long as it doesn't affect the neighbors. If a doctor wants to bring X-rays home to study them, that's O.K. When he starts running his practice out of the house, that's taking it a step too far."
 
A Counter Group Is Formed
 The controversy intensified recently with the formation of a counter group, the 17-member Committee on Home Offices. That group's members -- which include Dr. Lee and another psychiatrist as well as a writer, a media consultant, a public relations specialist and a massage therapist -- gathered 250 signatures on a petition and submitted it to village officials, asking them to protect a resident's right to work at home. Members of the Zoning Committee contend that high-use home offices -- specifically doctors' offices and some businesses -- disturb the tranquillity of neighborhoods, generate increased traffic and often require additional parking, which sometimes results in the paving of lawns. The high-use home offices, they add, threaten the value of neighboring houses and pose unfair competition to businesses in commercial locations.
Members of the other group argue that large homes gain value if they serve the dual purpose of a residence and a place of business.
"No one has cotillion parties anymore," Dr. Lee said. "Actually, a large home might lose value if its use were restricted to a residence only."
 
Reflecting 'an Elitism'
 Members of the Committee on Home Offices also say that the Zoning Committee's goals reflect "an elitism that no longer belongs in this village." In a letter to village officials, they contend that stricter zoning laws would set such tight restrictions that "to qualify for the privilege of being an Irvington resident, we need to be wealthy, one-income families, so secure in our financial base that we might never contemplate nor need a home-based income."
In addition to objecting to the economic burden that tighter zoning laws might impose on some families, opponents of the Zoning Committee say that group's proposals are an indirect attack on women, who make up the majority of people working at home.
"I don't have the luxury or inclination to stay home and not work," said Laurie Chock, a member of the Committee on Home Offices and the mother of two daughters, one 5 and the other 9.
"Many of us," she said, "have been smart enough and creative enough to find a way to be both a breadwinner and a nurturing parent, and I don't think anyone has the right to take that away." Ms. Chock is the co-owner of Chock & Goldberg, a communications presentation and media-skills training business, which she runs from both a Manhattan office and her home here.
Paul McGregor, a massage therapist and the father of two sons and a daughter, called the dispute "more than just a challenge to women working at home."
 
'Don't Stifle the Work Ethic'
 "Men today also want to be actively involved in parenting," he said. "The real point is that many women and many men don't want to leave the raising of their children to a stranger, and we therefore choose to find ways to work at home."
Mr. Pastucha took the argument a step further. "What about retired people who need to add to their incomes, and what about the Widow Mary who takes in mending to make ends meet?" the former Trustee asked.
"If people impose restrictions like three visits from clients a week," he said, "does that mean a seamstress can only hem three dresses? I say, 'Don't stifle the work ethic.' We can't afford to in this economic climate."
The village's current zoning laws allow nonprofessional home occupations so long as there is no display of signs or goods and the office use -- which may not take up more than 30 percent of the main floor of the house -- is incidental to the residence. Also, the laws allow professional offices or studios in residences if they do not occupy more than 50 percent of the ground floor and include not more than one nonresident assistant.
 
Laws in Neighboring Areas
 Those who are seeking stricter regulations cite as examples laws in neighboring Tarrytown, which prohibits the establishment of new home offices without a variance but allows "incidental home occupations," and in Bronxville, which prohibits any new medical offices. Scarsdale allows home offices but requires permits if the office is used for patients or customers.
Kevin J. Plunkett, Irvington Village Attorney, has drafted a zoning code amendment that would allow professional home offices by permit only. The proposal, Mr. Plunkett said, is designed "to protect villagers against abuses, establishments that would cause high traffic and threaten children on three-wheelers."
The Irvington Planning Board took no action on the proposal and instead passed it along to Mayor Robert D. Reisman and the Board of Trustees.
Stricter zoning regulations would primarily affect new businesses or professional offices in residential areas or people seeking to expand. Existing home offices would be grandfathered.
 
Divisions Growing Deeper
 Meanwhile, as the two groups debate the issues surrounding home offices, the divisions between them grow deeper and the feelings of neighbor turning against neighbor grow stronger.
Mayor Reisman, with petitions on his desk and both groups clamoring for a decision on Mr. Plunkett's proposal, said it was important to put the conflict in perspective.
"The world, the village will go on," he said. "In the whole scheme of things, this controversy is not earth shattering. You should have been here when there was the dispute over the dog-leash law. Now that really tore the town apart."

HEADLINE: BAGHDAD AGREES TO U.N. INSPECTION; LONG IMPASSE ENDS

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 26

 BODY:
Iraq agreed today to allow United Nations arms inspectors into a Government building in Baghdad, ending a 21-day standoff and removing the diplomatic thorn that in recent days prompted the United States and its allies to consider military action against Iraq.
The United Nations official in charge of disarming Iraq under the terms of the Persian Gulf war cease-fire, Rolf Ekeus, announced that he would join a new team of inspectors in Baghdad on Tuesday, and that they had been assured of full access to search for evidence of missile-building activity. 
 "I am greatly relieved," Mr. Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, said after the end of several days of intense negotiations with Iraq's delegate to the United Nations, Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
 
'The Crisis Is Over'
 Mr. Anbari added, "We are satisfied that the crisis is over."
In Washington, President Bush described the agreement as a "cave-in" by President Saddam Hussein. [Page A6.] But the result appears to leave the situation about where it was three weeks ago when the standoff began. Despite threats of military action by the United States and its allies, the Iraqi leader appears to have emerged unscathed. Reports from Baghdad suggest that most Iraqis have been convinced of their Government's version of events and blame the United Nations and not their own leadership for inconveniences caused by the continuing embargo on Iraq.
Even though President Bush claimed a victory, the Iraqi leader was asserting with equal fervor that he had once again stood up to the West.
In Baghdad, where demonstrations against the United Nations continued, Mr. Hussein told supporters hours before the agreement was announced that "the mother of all battles is not yet over." [Page A6.]
 
German to Lead Team
 The agreement on the Agriculture Ministry was achieved, Mr. Ekeus said, after Iraq finally lifted its resistance to the composition of the new six-member inspection team that is now expected to enter the ministry. The building is believed by inspectors to have contained weapons-building materials and documents, but the delay in reaching the agreement clearly made it possible that nothing would now be found.
Mr. Ekeus said he felt strongly that his commission alone should select members of the inspection team, but he added that he had taken "certain sensibilities" into account when he picked new members last week. The team, originally headed by an American, will now be headed by a German specialist, Hachim Biermann, and include a Finn, a Russian, a Swede, a Swiss and a second German.
The final sticking point this weekend was Iraq's opposition to a single inspector, whom Mr. Ekeus would not identify. But the Iraqis eventually gave in, he said. A Western diplomat here said the inspector was Mr. Biermann, apparently because of his specific weapons expertise.
"There was no change," Mr. Ekeus said. "All of those nominated will enter the building and carry out the operation."
Mr. Anbari, apparently trying to put the best face on the resolution of the issue, pointed out that the team now includes no member from any country that took part in the Persian Gulf war. Two American inspectors are among three additional members who will take part in the mission without actually entering the building.
"Our basic objective has been to insure the foreign respect of Iraqi sovereignty and Iraqi national security, and Mr. Ekeus was more than happy to meet this requirement," Mr. Anbari said.
The threat of military action, Mr. Ekeus indicated, had helped nudge Iraq toward an agreement, adding "an element of reality into our discussions.
In some detail, Mr. Ekeus also described what he said was the sharply limited nature of Iraq's military ability, brought about largely by United Nations inspectors who located and destroyed the majority of Iraq's weapons since the end of the war. Despite the intensive allied bombing, few of Iraq's Scud missiles, chemical weapons plants, research complexes or fixed missile-launchers were destroyed during the war, he said.
Mr. Ekeus said he had spoken repeatedly with the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and consulted leading members of the Security Council, which is not expected to take any formal action on the agreement. The Council, scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss sanctions against Iraq, may make a statement on it.
After the agreement was announced, the United States delegate here, Edward J. Perkins, warned that it did not represent any basic change in the Iraqi leader's attitude.
"The real test of Saddam Hussein's behavior will be in future inspections," Mr. Perkins said in a statement.
Mr. Ekeus reiterated his concern that since inspectors first tried to enter the Agriculture Ministry on July 5, the Iraqi authorities might have removed or destroyed what the inspectors are seeking. But he added that it would be difficult to transport or remove all traces of some of the materials involved. He said the inspection team might also search elsewhere.
Another snag in the talks centered on whether the inspection team would enter the office of Iraq's Minister of Agriculture, but it was apparently agreed that the issue would be left vague. Asked if the inspectors would enter the minister's office, Mr. Anbari said, "Definitely not." But he added quickly that Mr. Ekeus himself would be welcome in any office and that since no one had asked to enter the office, the question would not be a problem.
 
Other Truce Terms at Issue
 But Mr. Ekeus said that United Nations resolutions specified that no site be off limits to the inspectors, and that he was concerned not to sacrifice his commission's legal right in any way. At the same time, he added that while he fully expected that he would be invited by the minister into his office, the team would carry out its inspection sensitively and responsibly.
Despite Mr. Ekeus's evident relief at today's agreement, he outlined possible problems that lie ahead, even if Iraq fully adheres to today's agreement. Iraq and United Nations officials are still divided over several aspects of enforcing the cease-fire, including a memorandum of understanding on the terms under which the inspectors work in Iraq, disputes over Iraq's border with Kuwait, how Iraq would be allowed to resume selling oil abroad, and its treatment of ethnic minorities.
Mr. Ekeus said he had also sent a letter to Baghdad today through Mr. Anbari to demand proper security for United Nations inspectors, who faced growing and apparently Government-organized harassment last week. An Iraqi's attempt to stab one inspector on Wednesday led inspectors to abandon their vigil outside the ministry and heightened the crisis. Direct harassment subsided over the weekend, Mr. Ekeus said, and demonstrators in Baghdad today did not single out inspectors as they had at some previous rallies.
In contrast to Mr. Anbari's assertion that the inspection team was a new one, Mr. Ekeus said it had simply been rotated to include five new members.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Still Unsatisfied With Iraq's Compliance

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
President Bush said today that Iraq's agreement to permit inspectors into a Government building did not resolve his concerns about Baghdad's violations of Security Council resolutions.
Although the Iraq's move seemed to end the immediate threat of military force, senior Administration officials said Mr. Bush would continue confronting Saddam Hussein and left open the possibility of military action in the future. 
 Clearly more restrained than in some of his other face-offs with Mr. Hussein, Mr. Bush still seemed eager to assert power over the Iraqi President this afternoon as he returned to the White House from Camp David after discussions there Saturday with national security advisers.
Mr. Bush called the Iraqi leader "the bully, the dictator, the brutal merchant of death." And he proclaimed that Mr. Hussein had "caved in after a lot of bluster," even though Mr. Hussein drove the original United Nations inspection team from Iraq.
"Behavior along the lines we've just witnessed will not be tolerated," Mr. Bush said, adding that there would be further confrontations over Iraq's response to United Nations' effort to uncover and destroy Mr. Hussein's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. The inspections were provided for under the cease-fire resolutions that ended the gulf war.
"The international community cannot tolerate continued Iraqi defiance of the U.N. and the rule of law," Mr. Bush said in a statement to reporters on the White House South Lawn.
In a coordinated series of public statements, Mr. Bush and his top aides listed violations of Security Council resolutions well beyond Baghdad's interference with the weapons program inspections: among them were the economic blockade of the Kurds in the north, attacks on the Shiites in the south and refusal to join negotiations on the Kuwait border.
Mr. Bush and his advisers seemed to deliberately hold open the possibility of military action to force compliance in these other areas. "The options that the United States and our partners have available to us are well known," Mr. Bush said.
Appearing today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, "We always have the option, if the President makes the decision, to once again use military force to enforce those U.N. resolutions. We did it before. We can do it again."
Mr. Cheney's statement was made before Iraq agreed to permit inspection of the Agriculture Ministry building, the standoff that started the latest round of hostilities, and was clearly intended to bolster support for a military attack had Iraq refused to go along.
But the comments of American officials were also aimed at laying groundwork for the kind of military response that American planners had in mind: a larger attack on a wider range of Iraqi targets than might seem justified by the issue of the agriculture building or any other single site.
Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said any attack would have to be more than "a little pinprick" and must show Mr. Hussein "that there's a serious price to pay" for defying the United Nations.
 
'Precautionary Deployments'
 Iraq's action today removed the immediate threat of war. But it was not known if Washington would reverse what Mr. Scowcroft called the "precautionary deployments" of recent days. Administration officials said these included dispatching a cruise-missile-equipped Aegis cruiser to the Red Sea and Patriot anti-missile batteries to Kuwait.
Iraq's compliance gave a reprieve not only to Mr. Hussein, but also to Mr. Bush.
The Iraqi leader may have concluded after a recent coup attempt that allied bombing might unleash uncontrollable forces of insurrection, especially if the bombs were aimed at the Republican Guard or Iraq's communications and power grid, as some American officials have advocated.
For his part, Mr. Bush still faces the formidable task of pulling together a consensus within the allied coalition, which officials say he now lacks, for broad military action. The President must also find new and credible ways to keep up the pressure on Mr. Hussein.
Domestically, Mr. Hussein's continued defiance has turned Mr. Bush's greatest victory into a heavy burden on his re-election campaign. While an inconclusive military action that ends with Mr. Hussein thumbing his nose at Washington would be a political disaster, it is not clear how a tug of war with Baghdad would play politically. Mr. Bush has already been criticized for stopping the war before Mr. Hussein was killed or driven from power.
Mr. Cheney said Mr. Hussein would be a "legitimate target" of military action. But he and other officials took pains to say that it is hard to target an individual with bombing attacks, an apparent attempt to forestall expectations that Mr. Hussein would be removed and prevent the tensions from turning into an even more personal confrontation than it already is.
After being forced to cancel a holiday at his home in Kennebunkport, Me., this weekend as tensions grew, Mr. Bush clearly wanted to avoid any further perception that he is a prisoner of Mr. Hussein's agenda.
But the political pressures were obvious. "I think we're in a position where Saddam Hussein is succeeding in eroding the authority of the U.N. resolutions, chipping away at the authority here, and I don't think we're handling it very well," Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said today on the CBS News program Face the Nation.
But there is disagreement among Mr. Bush's own advisers about whether to attack Mr. Hussein's forces again.
Mr. Scowcroft and the other officials suggested that there is justification for an attack. But with the flash point of the Agriculture Ministry building removed, American officials said they would need some clear confrontation, what a senior policy maker called "an acute point of conflict," before military action could be taken.
Mr. Scowcroft, who also appeared on "Face the Nation," said that, had Iraq refused to permit the inspections, Washington had support for military action from Britain and France, important members of the coalition.
But a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Bush did not have a mandate for a military operation intended to enforce general compliance with the United Nations sanctions, finally break Mr. Hussein's resistance or, indeed, remove him from power.
The coalition members, the official said, "are sympathetic, but the problem always is that unless you have something acute to point to, it's hard to rally people." He added, "The will is there, but the occasion is what one needs."

HEADLINE: City Dwellers Want U.S. Park Funds to Go East

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
At first glance, James Townsend looks like anything but a man who spends a lot of time in the forest. Tall and gangly, he wears a diamond stud in his left ear, keeps a Walkman tucked into his knapsack, and has a summer wardrobe that runs to mesh jerseys, Reeboks and a Lakers cap.
The 21-year-old Mr. Townsend has always lived in the Bronx. He wouldn't know a Winnebago from a Wurlitzer, and while he says he'd be glad to visit Yosemite some day, it is nowhere near the top of his wish list. 
 But as much as any camper in the country, Mr. Townsend typifies the future of American recreation. Economically pinched and unlikely to travel, he -- and millions like him -- often escape for a few brief hours to a nearby national park: Gateway National Recreation Area, which occupies part of New York City and New Jersey.
Even though Gateway ranks among the National Park Service's most popular recreation spots, the agency has never made such urban spaces a priority: Federal financing for parks and recreation is still distributed in disproportionate amounts to the far bigger, yet more remote, expanses in the West -- Glacier National Park, for example, or Yellowstone, or the Grand Canyon.
The tension over the Park Service's mission has intensified as America's demographics shift steadily away from rural areas and toward life in the city. To many people, it no longer seems right that the most frequent users of the traditional outdoor sanctuaries are families with incomes greater than $50,000 who live in small towns and villages.
Last year, there were seven million visitors to the beaches, bays and wildlife refuges of Gateway -- more than Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon combined. On average, they traveled less than eight miles to get there -- nothing like the average of 1,000 miles traveled and four or five days it can take to get from most places to a campfire in Yellowstone.
Many people argue that the national parks were never intended to serve as retail recreation to the greatest possible numbers. But some parks advocates insist that if priorities don't change, the few large urban spaces -- like Gateway, Golden Gate in San Francisco and Cuyahoga Valley near Cleveland -- that do exist will soon be overrun. Increasingly, they question the essential fairness of spending far more on a spectacular dream most people will never see than on a patch of green they could use every day.
 
Rob Glacier for Gateway?
 "The Park Service is in real danger of losing complete touch with the people it serves," said Paul C. Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation Association. "They persist in selling romantic, ethereal views of far-off forests when they don't help people feel comfortable in their own backyards. Any park system that can't address the new realities of American life can't move forward."
For decades Federal parks funds have followed acres, not people -- a policy that in the past few have found objectionable. Even today, it is difficult to imagine a successful way to rob Glacier to pay for Gateway. Yet, while most of the nation's Federal park acreage is in the West, the need for parks has moved steadily away from it -- to America's most crowded cities, back East.
Gateway will cram its 7 million visitors this year onto 26,000 acres, and it will receive $12 million from the Federal Government to do it. Yosemite, by comparison, had 3.5 million visitors last year and a budget of $16.1 million for its 748,000 acres.
The most heavily visited traditional National Park, Great Smoky Mountains, in Tennessee and North Carolina, is in the East. So is Acadia National Park, in Maine, which draws about the same number of visitors to its 35,000 acres each year as Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, which is 10 times the size. But Acadia's $2.1 million budget is about a third of Rocky Mountain's.
Even though many of the national parks are often deserted -- more than a quarter of Alaska is managed by the Park Service, for example -- it takes a large percentage of the agency's $1.3 billion annual budget to maintain and protect those lands. Few critics would argue that Yellowstone should be closed to acquire space near cities. But agency leaders acknowledge that if parks are not made relevant to a new generation of immigrants and children, they may have little political support in the future.
 
Difficult Balancing Act
 For the Park Service, it is a balancing act that has never been more difficult.
"Obviously the budgetary pressures and competition for money is acute," said Duncan Morrow, a spokesman for the Park Service. "The parks out West are huge and they cost a lot to maintain, with or without visitors. Many people say it's not a fair way to spend money and others would fight to the death if budgets were cut.
"Some say we should be spending far more energy on creating and managing urban recreation areas, like Gateway and Golden Gate, because that's where the people are. And others say this agency has absolutely no business managing parks in urban areas -- that it ought to be done by states and cities."
With urban life and two-career families having supplanted an idea of America filled with Moms and Dads in the family station wagon, critics say that the agency is mired in nostalgia over the nation's Western wilderness at the expense of ordinary people. They warn that if it doesn't start paying attention, Americans will turn away from some of the country's most important natural resources.
 
Fewer Visitors From Cities
 "What does this agency do for us?" asks Tom Fox, executive director of New York's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition. "When we need a break from the city, the Everglades doesn't do much to supply it."
In many ways the division is simple to understand, and seemingly insoluble. More than 80 percent of Americans will live near cities by the end of this decade. Even in a recession, land surrounding cities -- like the Sterling Forest north of New York -- usually costs too much for most states to put away for posterity. But one trend is clear: Fewer and fewer urban residents are making the trek to Western parks. Nearly three quarters of the Americans who live in cities of a million or more, and at least 85 percent of all blacks in the United States, have never even visited a national park, according to Park Service statistics.
For such people time is as scarce as money. Few of Gateway's vistors, for example, will ever lay eyes on a redwood forest or a giant Sequoia. Most come from New York and New Jersey, where part of the dilapidated and heavily burdened park is located.
Mr. Townsend, for example, has come to spend the day in the Jamaica Bay unit in Brooklyn. A wildlife preserve with a distant view of the World Trade Center, the fields and bay there are only one part of a varied leisure spot that includes the sand dunes and sea winds of Sandy Hook in New Jersey, the rich marine life of Breezy Point, and the rolling prairie lands of Staten Island.
 
3 Hours in Gateway
 "I'd like to visit them all some day," said Mr. Townsend. "But I don't know when I'll get the time."
Like his, most visits to Gateway are tailored to hectic and complicated lives. On average, Gateway's vistors spend less than three hours at the park, and these people rarely spend the night.
"I get frustrated every day," said Kevin Buckley, Gateway's superintendent. "We want to serve more people. We want to fix what we have here. And we are trying everything we can think of to find the money to do it." Mr. Buckley can't quite bring himself to envy the other parks, though.
"They have enormous management problems as well," he said. "And enormous needs. And as crowded as we are, this country needs to preserve its physical heritage out West, too."
The debate over the future of parks has been made far more complicated by the hard times facing most state governments. Awash in red ink, most governors have had to cut essential services like schools, police and welfare programs. Buying parkland is a very tough job.
 
Doing Much With Little
 "We can assist states and local governments in many ways," said Steven Golden, chief of conservation assistance for the North Atlantic region of the Park Service. "But we don't have a lot of money and most other agencies have less. Eight million dollars out of a budget of more than $1 billion doesn't go that far."
Nonetheless, Mr. Golden's department has created more than 100 miles of trails over the last three years and helped rescue at least that much river space from the ravages of pollution. In addition, the agency makes small grants to local environmental groups trying to buy land.

HEADLINE: O.K. on the Self-Realization; What About the Economy?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
As Sally Jessy Raphael sat in her New York apartment watching the final night of the Democratic convention, she had a shock of recognition.
All that talk about addiction, trauma, dysfunctional relationships, marital troubles, self-help and recovery sounded like the talk-show host's diet. And there was Bill Clinton on the podium saying, "I love you," to his wife, and Roger Clinton saying, "I love you," to his brother and kissing his Alcoholics Anonymous good-behavior chip. 
 "These people belong on talk shows," Ms. Raphael told her husband, Carl. "They're the stuff we're made of."
She appreciated the performance so much that she is trying to book Governor Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, for her show. But as a voter, she says she would rather have heard more about issues and less about shattering emotional barriers and making organic connections.
"They were pushing all the same buttons that we push on talk shows," she said. "It's all very well for me to do shows on life style or for people to watch soap operas, but for politicians to enter this gray area where it is neither news nor entertainment is a step backward."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have both acknowledged participating in family counseling, the Arkansas Governor in connection with his brother's cocaine addiction and his stepfather's alcoholism and the Tennessee Senator with his wife to overcome the trauma of their son's being struck by a car three years ago. Moreover, they are enthusiastic about what the counseling has done for them. Mr. Clinton said at the convention, "I wish I had known more about human psychology as a child," and Tipper Gore has said their therapy sessions helped her and her husband learn about marital teamwork.
George Bush refuses to "get on the couch" or explore his psyche. The baby-boomer Democrats do so with alacrity. So the fall offers a fascinating contest between John Wayne Republicans, never crying or even blinking, and Iron John Democrats, seeking the inner man and the missing father.
It is a far cry from 1988, when the mere unfounded rumor that Michael S. Dukakis sought psychiatric treatment after the death of his brother, Stelian, caused him to drop 8 points in the polls in a few days. And even further from 1972, when Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri was dropped as the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate after disclosures that he had undergone shock therapy for depression.
 
The Fall of Dukakis
 Certainly, the country has had its share of political wives and children who have declared themselves addicted or emotionally damaged. But until Lawton Chiles was elected Governor of Florida in 1990 after acknowledging use of an anti-depressant, male politicians were always supposed to be stoic. Ronald Reagan, the son of an alcoholic, rarely talked about it and never used it to fashion his persona.
Perhaps it was inevitable, once the challengers took the campaign into the arena of "Donahue" and "Arsenio Hall," that the political dialogue would grow more intimate and confessional. Still, the Republicans seem stunned to see their rivals happily dwelling in what one calls "Oprahland."
"Real men don't get on the couch," said Torie Clarke, the President's campaign spokeswoman. "Clinton reminds you of Woody Allen, sitting there giving you 14 different explanations of why he did something and what caused him to do something and how that affects what he's doing today. And then there's Gore, who's having Shirley MacLaine-style, out-of-body experiences."
 
On the Macho Ticket?
 Roger Stone, the Republican consultant, agreed. "The next thing you know, Al Gore will be showing up in a tie-dyed shirt wearing crystals," he said.
William Kristol, the Vice President's chief of staff, suggested that the Democrats were not fishing for those critical blue-collar, white male votes in the right manly fashion: "Bush and Quayle will run as macho individualists. Clinton and Gore will run on a New Age Covenant of psychobabble."
James Pinkerton, a Bush campaign official, observed with amusement that the choice of convention cities underscored the difference between the tickets, calling the Democrats' New York a city of people "on couches talking about childhood urges" and the Republicans' Houston a community of men "digging in their backyards for oil."
The President is so averse to introspection that he dubbed an interview about his cultural tastes "psychoanalysis" and once instructed a reporter who specialized in personality pieces to stop staring at him. In 1988, his speech writer Peggy Noonan tried to cast her boss as a quiet, lanky Gary Cooper type, and Mr. Bush doled out only enough information about family troubles to warm up his image.
 
The Family Tapestry
 Basking in their surge, Democratic strategists contend that the Madison Square Garden presentation cleverly minimized Mr. Clinton's admission of "marital problems" by weaving it into the tapestry of a troubled family that struggled with addictions and overcame them -- a triumphant pattern of sin and redemption (and sometimes sin again) familiar from tabloid talk shows and People magazine covers, and from the thriving business of support groups and self-help books.
At the convention, Mr. Gore told of his 6-year-old son's being struck by a car in 1989, and he has continued to give interviews about moments of self-examination that allowed him to accept "emotionally the genuineness with which people want to communicate with each other."
Stan Greenberg, the Clinton poll taker, said the campaign's polls showed that the "sense of revelation," the language of connecting and self-realization that is reflected in the political vocabulary, has reduced the impression of the ticket's being "too slick and too political."
Mr. Greenberg thinks Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have gone a long way toward rebutting criticism that they were a matched set of wooden yuppies who cared only about power. For golden boys who were grooming themselves for the Presidency for decades, this is a New Age vision of the log cabin story.
Many Democrats who winced at first at all the "I'm O.K., you're O.K." jargon now believe that the party's nominees have used their traumas to convey the idea that they have been tested by fire -- much as politicians from the so-called "G.I. Generation," like Mr. Bush and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, used their heroic war exploits.
Since Republicans usually win most of the evangelical Christian vote, and since Democrats worry that they are seen as too secular, some Democrats also hope that the dialogue of sin and redemption, trauma and recovery, and ecological oneness, may give the ticket an aura of spirituality.
 
Like Kissing a Baby
 While saying that Democrats will have to be "very, very careful" in how often they display their new openness, Phil Donahue said he thinks it could be effective. "This is the rhetorical equivalent of kissing a baby," he said.
Mr. Donahue suggested that the Democrats had taken this route in a calculated attempt to distance themselves from the unemotional mien of Mr. Dukakis, who did not notice that his wife was addicted to diet pills for two decades and who gave a stiff and legalistic answer when asked in a debate what he would do if she were raped.
Ms. Noonan, the former Bush speech writer, is dubious about the new political psychodrama, asserting, "The real pain in a person's life is interior; the anguish unveiled in these speeches seems a surrogate for genuine pain, and the device seems not revelatory but deceptive."
 
A 12-Year-Old's Privacy
 In a separate interview, Ms. Noonan said it smacked of exploitation when Mr. Clinton, in his biographical film, talked about watching his interview about marital problems on "60 Minutes" with his 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea, after which she told her parents they were "great."
"He violated his daughter's privacy zone," Ms. Noonan said.
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's director of communications, disagreed, saying the Republicans were willing to showcase their families in commercials and other controlled settings while criticizing Mr. Clinton for "having an honest discussion" about his family. "They want family and family values to be issues," he said, "but only on their terms."
On the one hand, candidates need to reveal enough about their families to give a sense of who they are; on the other, they need to protect their family's privacy. The distinction is tricky.
 
The Anguish of Quayle
 Just how tricky was illustrated last week, when Vice President Dan Quayle got in political hot water by talking about how he would respond if his daughter, Corinne, who is now 13, became pregnant. Although Mr. Clinton sympathized with the Vice President, saying it showed his concern as a father, he also said Mr. Quayle should not have been talking with the news media about such a personal matter.
Yet Mr. Clinton himself had just invoked his own daughter at the convention as a way to show that his family had conquered its problems and was now close. And on the other side, Mr. Bush's most successful commercial in 1988 showed his little blond granddaughter running into his arms. And when he was heckled by families of missing American servicemen the other day, he desperately tried to show them he understood "sacrifice" because he had lost his 3-year-old daughter to leukemia in 1953.
Ms. Noonan acknowledged that Mr. Bush's psyche was sometimes very close to the surface. "His id jumps out of the box at inappropriate moments," she said. "But what a beat-up President blurts out as a way of saying, 'Hey, I've lost someone, too,' is a lot different than the baby-boomer Democrats' taking their focus-group information and ringing the childhood chimes in a prepared speech."
 
A Timely Wave?
 Wendy Kaminer, a Radcliffe College public policy fellow who wrote "I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional," a skeptical account of the self-help and recovery movement, says the Democrats may be riding a timely wave.
"One of the remarkable things about the 'Oprah' phenomenon is that people go on TV talk shows and confess to what might otherwise be thought of as reprehensible actions, and somehow the confession cleanses them and makes us like them," Ms. Kaminer said.
But Ms. Kaminer, like Mr. Donahue, argues that Mr. Clinton must proceed with extreme caution: "He can't look like he's making excuses. And he can't belabor the point. After all, nobody wants a dysfunctional President."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Baker as Campaign Director: Nothing to Gain but His Job

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 26

 BODY:
James A. Baker 3d headed home today, ending what is probably his last overseas trip as Secretary of State in this Administration.
It has been a melancholy journey. Mr. Baker and some of his closest aides seem as excited about moving from the State Department to the White House as a group of tourists being asked to transfer from the QE2 to a leaky barge. 
 It is not that they are convinced that George Bush is going to lose in November; it is that they fear that if Mr. Baker resigns to take the reins of his best friend's re-election campaign, much of what he has built up during his three and a half years as Secretary of State could be lost.
 
An Opportunity Abandoned
 As reports of the job switch gained credibility last week, Mr. Baker's aides came to realize that they could be hit from several directions at once, a possibility that has many of them in a funk.
On the diplomatic front, Mr. Baker is going to be accused of pulling out of diplomacy for politics at the precise moment when the Arab-Israeli peace process he did so much to nurture has ripened to a point where some real deals seem possible -- particularly between Israelis and Palestinians.
By having put together the peace talks, which began in Madrid in October, Mr. Baker has built a lot of authority and credibility that would take time for any successor to cultivate. Moreover, the only officials fully aware of Mr. Baker's private conversations and assurances in the Middle East and elsewhere are his spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, and his policy planning chief, Dennis Ross, both of whom may go with him to the White House.
The peace process existed before Mr. Baker and it will exist after him. But in the view of many in the Middle East, he was the right man in the right place at the right time, and whether a replacement will come along soon, and whether this moment in the Middle East will last long enough, is very much an open question.
Some Baker aides are also convinced that if they move over to the campaign, the long knives will be out for them among the White House officials who would be shunted aside. One official said he expected a competition to see which newspaper would be the first to write the headline: "Baker Fails to Turn Around White House, Senior Officials Say."
Mr. Baker served as White House chief of staff for five years during the Reagan Administration, and knows exactly what a snake pit it can be. When it comes to manipulating the press and defending himself he will give as good as he gets. But it is not the sort of fight to which either he or his staff is looking forward, after the relatively white-glove life of diplomacy. There will be blood on the floor by November, and Mr. Baker knows that some will be his.
 
Politics Can Be Ugly
 Mr. Baker seemed to enjoy being above the political fray as Secretary of State. He will not have that luxury back at the White House.
So much is now known about how the Reagan Administration and the Bush campaign manipulated the press and the networks (though Mr. Baker disassociated himself from the dirtiest parts of the 1988 campaign), that no one is going to let him off the hook this time.
If this campaign turns ugly, as many expect it to, Mr. Baker would be tainted. If Mr. Bush wins and Mr. Baker returns as Secretary of State, some of the authority and credibility that he has established would certainly be dented by a bruising campaign. If Mr. Bush loses, Mr. Baker would be seen not as a successful Secretary of State but as a failed political adviser.
 
Both Good and Lucky
 Of course, if Mr. Bush wins, Mr. Baker will no doubt get much of the credit, and this would certainly enhance his stature. But Mr. Baker is not a miracle worker. His success as a Secretary of State derived from the fact that he was both good and lucky.
He was lucky that his stewardship coincided with the end of the cold war, which opened up all sorts of diplomatic possibilities.
He was good in that he both recognized the opportunities and responded to them with skill, creativity and energy. He could focus on a problem and prepare a coherent strategy to deal with it. What he focused on, he usually did well, except for the Administration's disastrous coddling of Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait.
When the disintegration of the Soviet Union and its withdrawal from Eastern Europe made German reunification a possibility, Mr. Baker pounced on it by setting up a framework to manage the process.
When Moscow became desperate for Western economic help, Mr. Baker exploited that weakness to close some unprecedented arms-control deals.
When the collapse of the Soviet Union left Syria a geopolitical orphan, Mr. Baker used that opening to put together the first direct talks ever between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
 
But Once Upon a Time . . .
 But it is worth recalling that before the political conditions changed in the Middle East, Mr. Baker spent his first 18 months spinning his wheels trying to get the Arabs and Israelis together.
The same is true in politics.
When Mr. Baker ran Mr. Bush's election campaign in 1988, he had many things going for him -- a weak Democratic candidate, a decent economy, the after-glow of the Reagan Administration and a candidate who could be defined by his political handlers.
This time, the Democrats have put forward a strong candidate, the economy is floundering, the Reagan era is a distant memory and Mr. Bush has to run not on an image but on the reality of the last four years.
This is certainly not the sort of raw material that Mr. Baker would prefer to work with.
 
Reading His Lips
 While he has worn a poker face throughout this eight-day journey through the Middle East and Asia, at times Mr. Baker has seemed testy and uncharacteristically unfocused, as if he simply has too much on his mind. He mixed up dates during one news conference and in another he mixed up the names of two longtime members of the traveling press.
If his staff is any barometer, Mr. Baker is simply not at peace with the pending job switch. He knows he is caught between walking away from the Department of State at the pinnacle of his authority and in the face of real opportunities, or walking away from his friend of 35 years, who clearly needs him to get both himself and Mr. Baker another four years on the job.
"He's angry," remarked one aide. "He's just angry at the whole situation."

HEADLINE: Company Invests in Human Assets: Disabled Employees in Regular Jobs

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WICHITA, Kan., July 25

 BODY:
With his one eye, Bert Smith cannot detect anything clearer than large dark forms against bright light. He listens with his fingers, placing a hand over the hands of people who speak in sign language. His voice is strong and emphatic, but his speech is severely slurred.
Yet Mr. Smith plays his workbench with the deftness of a concert pianist. He is part of a crew that makes photographic film-processing machines, as big as dishwashers, and his current task is assembling ventilation sections that fit on the backs of the machines. His fingers dance along a four-foot-long aluminum rack, inspecting notches and holes where he will insert bolts, secure fans and attach the wiring. 
 His employer, Kreonite Inc., pays Mr. Smith $5.86 an hour plus bonuses, and Brent Stull, the plant manager, said no worker does the job faster. Freed from welfare by the job, Mr. Smith got married two years ago.
 
A Jump on the Law
 Half a million employers must now start to give people with physical or mental impairments the same opportunities as other workers, as the workplace provisions of the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act go into effect. Many executives are concerned about what kind of trouble or cost this might cause them, but a handful of companies, like Kreonite, have been hiring a lot of workers with disabilities for many years and have lessons to offer about how they can be integrated into a work force, helping them to live self-sufficiently and meeting the company's goals.
The law, which applies to any company with 25 or more workers, says that an employer must consider only whether a job applicant has the competence to do a particular job. If the worker is qualified but has disabilities that get in the way, the employer must help -- providing special tools, installing ramps for wheelchair users, teaching sign language to supervisors, adjusting work hours so people can catch a bus or see a therapist -- so long as the adjustments are not so costly or disruptive that they cause "undue hardship" to the business.
Kreonite, a manufacturer of darkroom equipment with $30 million a year in sales, hired its first disabled workers 20 years ago, and two of that first group are still there. Today people with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, mental illness and sensory impairments make up 15 percent of the company's work force of 240.
 
'Quite the Exception'
 In bringing these workers into the company, Kreonite's biggest mistake was "underestimating what these people could do," said Larry Burd, the senior vice president for manufacturing. A decade ago, he said, Kreonite was losing most of its disabled workers because it patronized and segregated them. He said the company had also fired a few who in retrospect could have been managed better.
Many disabled Americans work in sheltered workshops, where discrimination is rare. But the pay in such workshops is usually well below the $4.25 hourly minimum wage, and there are few opportunities for promotion or for mixing with people who are not disabled. Among money-making, real-world businesses, said David Colucci, an officer of Wichita Industries and Services for the Blind, "Kreonite is quite the exception."
Officials of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which will enforce the law's workplace provisions, cited only Kreonite among companies nationwide that come close to meeting the law's objectives.
The company says it is motivated by its needs, not by altruism, to hire disabled workers. Wichita has low unemployment, around 4 percent, and it has several big aircraft makers that can pay skilled workers more than Kreonite does, so workers are hard to find.
Disabled workers tend to stay. Mr. Stull said the company was losing one in every three production workers a year in the mid-1980's. Partly as a result of hiring more disabled workers and accommodating them better, he said, the annual rate of turnover is down to 1 in 10, a big savings for the company, which calculates that turnover costs about $1,000 per employee.
William Oetting, the president and chief executive, said the company has been doing better than ever in the past two years. To keep up production, Kreonite brought in a team of 12 retarded or mentally ill workers from a local sheltered workshop, the Kansas Elks Training Center for the Handicapped, known as Ketch.
 
Special Management Skills
 A visitor to the Kreonite plant here sees nothing especially novel except unobstructed aisles for the benefit of people with impaired vision and groups of workers using sign language.
In the final assembly shop where Bert Smith works, one supervisor, Julie Blackmeyer, rushes to workers who call her, taking their arms, conferring in sign language. Mr. Burd says Ms. Blackmeyer, the company's employee disability coordinator and head coach, is adept at accommodating disabled workers. Among other things, she fashions jigs to help disabled workers do their jobs.
One day this week, she devised some jigs for Karen Neeley and Michael Hannon, who sat at a worktable making rolls of soft brown paper to be used in packing a film-processing machine for shipment. Mr. Hannon, whose left side was paralyzed by a stroke, is early in his rehabilitation training and still attached to Ketch. Kreonite brings him in part-time and might eventually offer him a regular job.
Ms. Neeley, a four-foot package of muscle and furious energy, was a rubella baby, evidently born deaf, and she cannot speak a word. Her eyes can focus on things two to four inches away, but beyond that she can only distinguish light and shapes. Mr. Burd said state vocational rehabilitation officials evaluated her as incapable of competitive employment. But Mr. Stull said, "Everything I train her for, she grabs it like that."
At the worktable, Mr. Hannon has a stack of the paper that has been folded, napkin-like. With his right hand, he rolls up one piece and places it part way into a hole in the side of a cardboard box, half the size of a shoe box, that holds it for him. The box is a jig Ms. Blackmeyer devised, a substitute for Mr. Hannon's left hand.
Ms. Neeley sits beside him, her head pressed close to her work. She measures off six-inch lengths of tape against another piece of tape stuck to the table. She snips them with scissors and sticks them to the edge of the worktable. Mr. Hannon takes a length of tape, wraps it around the rolled paper in his jig, removes it and rolls another.
 
'Whatever My Boss Wants'
 John Miller operates a big injection molding machine that stamps out plastic forms. As a child, "I had some kind of brain tumor, he recalled in slightly slurred words. "I had a lot of people help me out to get my brain working." Now 42 years old, he lives with his parents and never had a real job until five years ago.
"I do whatever my boss wants me to do," Mr. Miller said. "I just do it. I like to work every day. There's nothing hard if you know what you're doing."
Having a regular job has opened doors for him. "I'm able to do anything now," he said. "Build models, take pictures with a camera, empty trash when my dad wants me to. Now I got a car. You have to pass a test to do it." Last weekend he drove the car, a new white Geo, to a town 12 miles from Wichita to indulge in a favorite pasttime: watching railroad trains pass by.
Some businesses might object to the expense of employing a salaried, full-time supervisor like Ms. Blackmeyer to help people with disabilities. But Mr. Burd said that workers, disabled or not, need supervisors. Kreonite just employs a supervisor who is skilled in dealing with disabilities.
People, like machines, are assets, he added. "When you buy a new injection molding machine, you have to hire a maintenance man for it.We're just investing in the maintenance of our human assets. The whole idea is to enhance employees' ability to do the job better."
Furthermore, he says, most of the accommodations Kreonite makes, like Ms. Blackmeyer's jigs, cost nothing.
Stopping discrimination here begins in Karen Williams's personnel office. When Kreonite needs workers, Ms. Williams sends notices to the state employment service and to Wichita's active network of advocacy groups for the disabled. She has purged the application form of questions that invite discrimination. To avoid age bias, it does not request a birth date. It does not ask for a driver's license number, which could raise suspicions of a disability. It asks nothing about an applicant's health.
 
'Crazies in My Department'
 Once hired, workers' starting pay and benefits are the same for similar jobs. Some employer associations warned during the debate over the law that their members' health insurance costs would soar if they hired people with disabilities, but Mr. Oetting said his have not. The new law, in fact, leaves employers and their health insurers free, as they always have been, to devise plans that exclude chronic, "pre-existing" medical conditions.
In the plant, discomfort with the disabled workers seems not to show, but some lies close to the surface. Mr. Burd recalled: "A supervisor came into my office one day and said, 'There's no way I'm going to have crazies in my department.' I said, 'I'll bet you that if you give that guy 30 days and give him the wherewithal to accomplish the task, you'll change your mind.' " Mr. Burd said he won the bet and that this week the same supervisor asked Mr. Burd to let him hire a woman from Ketch who is trying out at the plant.
Still, problems arise, especially with workers with mental illnesses. Mr. Burd said the company once assigned a woman to a sensitive production job, not knowing that she was mentally ill. "The pressure was too much for her," he said. "She'd run screaming through the plant into the administration building. Others were afraid of her. We had to let her go."
For the most part, though, mentallyill employees work out, too. George Landwehr, 27 year old, is a valued, multi-skilled worker with five years at the plant, where he does a variety of assembly tasks.
"I was born with a little bit of brain damage," he said. "I had a mental problem somewhat. When I was young I was hyperactive. I've mellowed out since then." He said he takes medicine three times a day for schizophrenia.
The plant manager, Mr. Stull, said he was not even aware Mr. Landwehr needed medication. "He's an excellent employee," he said. "Perfect attendance. Excellent attitude toward the job. His attention is always on the job."

HEADLINE: Heiress to L.L. Bean Champions Conservatism in Race for Congress

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me., July 24

 BODY:
The name is Bean, L. L. Bean. But Linda Lorraine Bean, the granddaughter and an heir of the founder of the outdoor clothing company that is practically synonymous with Maine, is not selling boots or down-filled jackets.
Instead, Ms. Bean is promoting her conservative philosophy, which she hopes will enable her to triumph over Representative Thomas H. Andrews, a liberal Democrat, in the Congressional race this fall for the district here that includes President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport. 
 In a state where party labels are not usually important and voters are seldom swayed by ideology, the contest between the 51-year-old Ms. Bean and the 41-year-old Mr. Andrews is already considered the most contentious in memory.
"Tom Andrews is an extreme leftist," said Ms. Bean, who has been feuding for years with Maine's Republican leaders, including Senator William S. Cohen, whom she has denounced as being too moderate.
In a year in which women have won several prominent primary contests nationwide, propelled by discontent over neglect of women's issues, the election here also seems to run counter to the national political currents. In California, for example, two women, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, are running for two United States Senate seats, both as liberal Democrats.
Ms. Bean is an outspoken conservative. She is opposed to abortion rights, gay rights legislation and gun control, and she believes in Ronald Reagan's program that tax cuts will spur economic growth and lower the deficit.
Last spring Ms. Bean referred to military spending as a "native Maine industry" that deserved the same protection as farming and fishing.
By contrast, Mr. Andrews, a first-term Congressman, supports abortion rights and is a sponsor of gay rights legislation.
"Linda Bean comes into this race with her inherited wealth, and she is willing to spend it to get elected," Mr. Andrews said.
In Yankee Maine, conspicuous consumption is frowned on, and a wealthy politician could be damaged by an appearance of buying an election.
Ms. Bean had assets of more than $7.6 million in 1991, according to documents on file with the Federal Election Commission. As of June 30, she had lent her campaign $450,000 of her own money, the records show. In 1988, when she ran and lost in the Republican primary for the same First Congressional District seat, she spent more than $500,000 of her own fortune.
Ms. Bean's route to conservative crusader was circuitous. She was originally a Kennedy Democrat, she acknowledged in an interview. But in the late 1970's she was influenced by her second husband, Verne Jones, a farmer almost four decades older than she, who resented what he saw as the growing power of the local town planning board over his land.
Most political specialists here expect that Mr. Andrews will win in November. "Tom Andrews seems much more liberal than the district, but he is a shrewd political animal who has put together a very strong grass-roots organization with a devoted following," said Sandy Maisel, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville. Mr. Andrews draws his support from women's groups, low-income residents and organizations that work for the handicapped, Professor Maisel said.
 
'Alienates a Lot of People'
 By contrast, Professor Maisel said, Ms. Bean often "alienates a lot of people with personal attacks."
In addition, she may get only lukewarm support from the state Republican Party, which until recently she had been suing over control of her local county party organization.
The district itself, covering southeastern coastal Maine, is about evenly divided politically, with a third of the voters registered as Democrats, one-third as Republicans and a third as independents.
How much Ms. Bean's open use of her connection to L. L. Bean will help her is uncertain. In her 1988 race, she ran under her married name at the time, Linda Bean Jones. But this year, though her husband has since died and she has remarried, she is using her maiden name.
One of her television advertisements shows her walking through the stitching room where workers make the popular L. L. Bean boot, while she extols the family company for giving workers a 15 percent bonus.
"I'm proud of my name, it means integrity and reliability," Ms. Bean said in an interview in her campaign headquarters here.
 
Rating the L. L. Bean Factor
 L. L. Bean is one of the largest employers in Maine and has an excellent public reputation, contributing to environmental causes. Leon Gorman, president of L. L. Bean and a cousin of Ms. Bean, has said he was upset that the advertisement looked like a company endorsement of her candidacy, though he has defended her right to use the company's factory since she is an owner.
But Nancy Kelleher, a district resident, said Ms. Bean had "misrepresented her role" in the company and was simply using the connection to try to win votes. "For me, it's hard to take her seriously," Ms. Kelleher said. "She has never pointed to any record of accomplishment."
One issue where Mr. Andrews may be vulnerable is military spending, since about 1 out of 6 jobs in the district is related to the military. Mr. Andrews voted to close Loring Air Force Base in northern Maine as part of the large base closing plan proposed by the Pentagon, and this spring he voted against paying for five B-2 bombers.
But Wendy Libby, the chief financial officer of Westbrook College in Portland, said Mr. Andrews's votes made him more appealing. "He showed a tremendous amount of courage," Ms. Libby said. "Closing Loring wasn't good for Maine, but it was essential if we are going to start rebuilding the country."

HEADLINE: A Taste of Urban Violence Sours A Quiet Town's Sense of Security

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., July 24

 BODY:
It was the type of crime that should have happened somewhere else. For years now, Burlington, with its attractive mix of small-town atmosphere and big-city amenities, has drawn newcomers expressly because it did not seem infected by the ills of urban America.
But for many of the city's 39,000 residents, that cherished perception of safety vanished over one violent weekend in May. Left behind in the wake of drug arrests and a killing was proof that urban America had arrived. 
 "It's been a loss of innocence for the community," Mayor Peter Clavelle said in a recent interview. "Burlington has had violent crimes in the past and it has had drug arrests in the past, but the linking of the two seemed to provoke the outrage."
As the city continues to come to terms with the problem of drugs and violence, Federal drug indictments are expected to be returned by a grand jury in early August. In the meantime, the city has decided to put a police substation in its most vulnerable neighborhood, Mr. Clavelle said today.
The trouble began in the early morning hours of May 22, when Federal, state and local law-enforcement officers raided two apartments in the city's Old North End, a grimy working-class neighborhood. They seized several hundred dollars in cash as well as cocaine, marijuana and guns, including a semiautomatic pistol, according to the Office of the United States Attorney for Vermont.
 
A Different Kind of Violence
 The police also arrested three men, among them 22-year-old Jacob Washington. According to the police, two days later Mr. Washington's younger brother, Jerome, shot to death 16-year-old Melissa Wells. The police said the shooting had apparently been an act of revenge against Miss Wells's boyfriend, Chance Marden. Mr. Washington mistakenly believed him to be a police informer, the authorities said.
Mr. Marden was injured in the shooting, as was his roommate, Matthew Petry. Both have since been released from the hospital. Jerome Washington is being held without bail on charges of murder, attempted murder and aggravated assault.
"This is qualitatively different from most things we see up here," said Scott Kline, a deputy prosecutor in Chittenden County, the state's most populous county. "Most homicides up here are not drug- and gun-related; they are love triangles, heat-of-passion things."
Fears that urban drug traders had finally taken notice of Vermont were heightened when local police reported that all of the suspects -- a fifth man had been arrested after the shooting -- had come to Vermont from New York City. Those fears were confirmed in early June, when Federal officers arrested two men in New York City and charged them with supplying most of the cocaine that was ending up in Burlington.
Residents of Old North End are demanding that city officials provide some answers -- and remedies.
The residents held a heated meeting in late May with Mayor Clavelle; the police Chief, Kevin Scully, and the Chittenden County State's Attorney, William Sorrell. Several residents called for more police and more economic assistance for the rundown neighborhood, which is home to 57 percent of Burlington's welfare families and 42 percent of its unemployed.
 
Looking for Solutions
 "We don't want the problems of the inner city in this city," Joyce Keeler, a resident of Old North End, told the crowd. "We want to nip this in the bud."
In an effort to do just that, the Mayor and the Chief have continued to meet with community groups. Among the topics of discussion is the police substation, which would also provide social services to the Old North End.
"The residents need to be reassured that the city government is paying attention," Mayor Clavelle said. He made a walking tour of Old North End last week to identify problems.
The ugly undercurrent of this issue is race, tactfully avoided by local reporters but often discussed on the streets.
The Washington brothers are black, as are the other suspects linked to the May 22 raid. Vermont's population is 98 percent white, according to the 1990 United States Census.
Moreover, this case follows closely a drug-related killing in neighboring Essex in which two black men were convicted of murder.
The Mayor has urged residents not to "paint the black community in Burlington with the brush of this incident." He added, "It is wrong to say that because one black person is accused of a crime or found guilty of a crime that all black people are to blame."
But among Burlington's 400 black residents, who make up about 1 percent of the city's population, many say that is just what has happened.
"There are people out there who look at me and think I could have committed a crime like that just because I'm of African descent," said the Rev. Rodney Patterson, pastor of the New Alpha Baptist Church in Burlington for the past four years. "As a result of what has happened, people look at me differently now."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Environmental Politics;
Book by Gore Could Become a Campaign Issue, for Both Sides

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
Senator Al Gore published a best-selling book seven months ago that is the most graphic analysis of the world's environmental condition and the most advanced plan for economic solutions that has ever been written by an American politician.
Reviews at the time were favorable, commending the book's "thoughtfulness" and "style." 
 But in the days since the Tennessee Democrat was nominated to be Gov. Bill Clinton's running mate, the book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin), has come under a new wave of scrutiny, not least from the Bush-Quayle campaign.
Its call for new taxes, new government environmental programs and a new philosophy for how humanity regards the environment and the economy could make the book one of the political classics of its time. It could also become a valuable weapon for the Republicans.
 
May Stir Wide Debate
 At the very least, the book seems likely to prompt the first full-throated debate at the Presidential level on whether trade-offs are necessary to balance the health of the economy and the environment. Enviromnentalists and many scientists are embracing the book as a breakthrough in fresh thinking; some economists and other scientists are attacking it as scientifically specious, economically dangerous and directly contradictory to the Democratic platform extolling jobs and economic growth.
Torie Clarke, the spokeswoman for the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, said today that the campaign saw the book's pointed recommendations for new taxes on coal and oil, more foreign aid and more governmental action to curb global environmental deterioration as weapons.
"For starters," she said, "Gore should have spent less of the taxpayers' time and money on his own book and a little bit more time on legislation. We have taken a look at his legislative record as a Senator. We found two pieces of his legislation that have been approved. One is an Earth Day proclamation, and the other is a resolution of encouragement to Antarctic treaty negotiatiors."
 
Fat Cats and Smokestacks
 Mr. Gore fired back today in a telephone interview. "They are in a state of extraordinary political panic," he said. "The American people are fed up with the Bush-Quayle approach of responding to only the wealthy privileged few, and that is especially true of the environment. They couldn't care less about the people who live downwind of pollution. They only care about the fat cat who owns the smokestack."
In the coming weeks, the debate will be no less contentious, but it could become more substantive. The reason is that in "Earth in the Balance" the author describes being a "witness to humankind's assault on the earth" and offers solutions that are much more specific and trenchant than is usual in books from political leaders.
The thesis of Mr. Gore's book is that a "global ecological crisis" spells a catastrophe for civilization unless prompt action is taken. He proposes three paths: new market incentives, new government programs and a new philosophy to define mankind's relationship with nature.
First, Mr. Gore proposes new taxes on oil, coal, minerals, wood and other "virgin materials" to curtail global warming, deforestation and misuse of land by mining. He proposes to offset the tax increases, and thus the probable rise in the price of energy and materials, by lowering income taxes.
 
New Network of Incentives
 The result would be a new system of economic incentives. Taxes would be increased for environmentally destructive activities and reduced for economically constructive activities like work and saving.
Where incentives did not work, government action would, he says. Mr. Gore calls for new global environmental regulations to protect resources, programs to stabilize population, new environmental treaties, new means for assessing technologies on the basis of their risk to health and the environment, phasing out internal-combustion engines within 25 years and a host of other government actions.
The third path he proposes involves changing attitudes. The current view, that the environment is a marginal issue with economic needs taking precedence, must be radically altered, the book says. Instead, Mr. Gore says, the ecosystem must be seen as the foundation on which the economy will flourish or perish in the 21st century.
Such a notion turns traditional Western thinking on its head. For centuries, man's dominion over earth, and the exploitation of resources to develop ever more powerful and efficient technologies, has been seen as the engine that drives civilization. Mr. Gore urges the world to become "sufficiently aroused by a shared sense of urgent danger" to reverse this "logic of world civilization."
"As long as civilization as a whole, with its vast technological power, continues to follow a pattern of thinking that encourages the domination and exploitation of the natural world for short-term gains, this juggernaut will continue to devastate the earth no matter what any of us does," he writes. "I have come to believe that we must take bold and unequivocal action: we must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization."
 
Praise and Counterattack
 Mr. Gore's views are "beyond anything we are hearing now in political dialogue," said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an environmental group in Washington, whose books on philosophy and nature have influenced Mr. Gore. "If we are to take this analysis and blueprint seriously, it portends a revolutionary change in political outlook in the 21st century. It's one I think the younger generation will flock to."
But some scientists, economists and conservative political groups have begun a counterattack intended to prevent the book from moving from the edges of national politics to its center.
Dr. S. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist who is a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia, said Mr. Gore had "exaggerated" the threat from global climate change, and that "many" in the scientific community simply do not agree with his thesis that the earth is on the edge of calamity.
"It's wrong on many counts, and he should know better because we have told him so," said Dr. Singer, who is one of the leaders of a group of American scientists who discount the threat from global climate change. "On global warming, as far as we can tell from surveys we have done, the scientific community is not in agreement with him. The majority feels that this is a problem that needs to be watched, but there is no immediate danger."
 
Survey Shows Divisions
 A survey of climate scientists earlier this year by Greenpeace, the international environmental group, found those who responded about evenly divided. When asked whether current policies "run a serious risk of instigating a runaway greenhouse effect," 47 percent of 113 scientists answering said "probably not." Forty-five percent replied "probably" or "possibly."
The survey did not reflect the considerable causes for concern outlined by a succession of international and national scientific panels over the last few years. In 1990, an international panel of scientists convened by the United Nations reported that the earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century as levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by 25 percent.
The panel said if carbon dioxide, methane and other "greenhouse gases" were not controlled, average global temperatures could increase 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century, causing flooding from the melting of polar ice, food production failures and other environmental havoc.
The National Academy of Sciences in 1991 urged the Bush Administration to act promptly to reduce the threat of global warming, including raising automobile fuel efficiency standards and improving energy requirements for buildings and appliances.
"Among the people I work with, we all think global warming is a threat," said Dr. Edward Dlugokencky, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. "Those who think it is not represent a minority view in the scientific community."
Conservative public policy groups have also attacked Senator Gore's book. Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market policy group in Washington, said the book held a basic contradiction with the Clinton-Gore campaign message of new jobs, new technologies and change. "This book says that before we let new technology happen, we need to look at the risk," said Mr. Smith. "Doesn't that mean slower introductions of technology, slower job growth and economic stagnation?"
 
Reaction From Gore
 Mr. Gore disagreed with this interpretation today. "I'm advocating the assessment of any technologies developed with public funds, but in no way am I calling for any government gatekeeper role for the private sector," he said.
Jonathan Adler, a staff member of the institute, added that Mr. Gore "thinks that every environmental problem needs a program." Mr. Adler criticized the nation's record of management for big public environmental programs, especially the one most closely associated with Mr. Gore, the Superfund program for cleaning up worst toxic waste sites.
Mr. Gore responded that he did not advocate "large centralized government programs that were the hallmark of government in the past." He added, "These initiatives are precise, carefully targeted and designed to stimulate a shift in approach an to provide new incentives."
Mr. Gore said current policies "are costing the United State millions of jobs by pretending that our strategy should be to protect the old polluting, inefficient ways of the past."
"This is coming at a time when Japan and now Germany are openly saying that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for new technologies and processes that foster economic progress without environmental destruction," Mr. Gore said, terming the Administration's view "a real head-in-the-sand approach."

HEADLINE: Barcelona Games Start, And Atlanta Is Staring

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 25

 BODY:
As millions watch the Olympics in Barcelona for the sheer pleasure of seeing great athletes in action, some Atlanta officials are looking beyond the drama of the Games for tips on everything from security to traffic flow.
The Summer Games will be in Atlanta four years from now. And officials here are using the Spanish city as a guide not only to the nuts and bolts of running such an extravaganza but also on how to translate the euphoria of being an Olympic site into a chance to make long-needed city improvements -- improvements that one official said will be the "lasting legacy" of having the Games here. 
 To these ends, more than 100 local elected officials and leaders of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, which will stage the 1996 Games and raise the $1.4 billion needed for them, traveled to Barcelona this week for a closer look.
Barcelona, an ancient Mediterranean port, has used the occasion of the 1992 Games for a publicly financed $9 billion facelift that included a new airport, a new highway ringing the city and new bathing beaches. Atlanta, a considerably newer city, neither needs nor envisions such a make-over. But the scope of the city's redevelopment remains unclear, and, in fact, has been much disputed over the last few months.
"We can't spend the kind of money that Barcelona spent," said Lewis Holland, president of Central Atlanta Progress, an organization of civic and business groups concerned with the city's downtown, in a telephone interview from Barcelona. "And the truth is that we don't need to spend that kind of money. It is so very important, though, to come together and make sure there is a legacy left so we won't wake up after the games saying what a wonderful party and what a hangover, but have nothing else to show for it."
 
Urging Broader Planning
 Atlanta is already working on many of the projects necessary for the Olympics. But many residents, from Mr. Holland, representing the concerns of downtown business interests, to the Rev. W. L. Cottrell, whose Vine City Housing Ministry speaks for a small black neighborhood in the shadow of downtown, argue that the city needs broader planning that involves housing and streets, not just stadiums and athletes' dormitories.
"We were thinking that the coming of the Olympics to our city would certainly be an empowerment process for inner-city communities," said Mr. Cottrell as he stood near a modest frame house, the first of 20 that the ministry is building two blocks from the city's new domed Olympic stadium. The money for the houses comes from a trust fund connected with the stadium.
"There are so many players attempting to plan for us and around us, but we will not be planned for," he said. "That is why we have begun building housing so we get a toehold in."
Over the last few months, city officials and community groups have suggested numerous projects they think should be built in connection with the Olympics. If all the projects on that wish list were built, the estimated cost to the state and city would be $2.5 billion. The list includes hundreds of units of affordable housing, new parks and new stores downtown as well as the renovation of city housing projects, rapid transit, Amtrak and freight rail connections and cultural centers.
 
Stadiums and Dorms
 But at this point they are all proposals. The completed projects are more directly linked to the Games. They include a 70,500-seat, $214 million domed stadium, a project begun before the Olympics were awarded to Atlanta and which figured prominently in the city's proposal to bring the Games here. The Georgia Dome, where Olympic basketball and gymnastics events will be held, will be the home stadium of the Atlanta Falcons starting this year and the site of the 1994 Super Bowl.
Just last month, city officials, Olympic organizers and the Atlanta Braves agreed on construction of an 85,000-seat, $207 million Olympic stadium. The stadium will be built with private money, then turned over to the city and leased to the baseball team.
And the Atlanta Housing Authority has agreed to turn over four acres on the grounds of the 56-year-old Techwood Homes, the nation's first public housing project, for Olympic athletes' dormitories. Techwood Homes is next to the Georgia Institute of Technology, which will be the heart of the Olympic Village for the athletes. In exchange for the land, the housing authority will receive $7 million from the Atlanta Olympic committee to aid in a planned $127 million renovation of Techwood and the nearby Clark Howell Homes.
After the Games, the athletes' housing, financed by a combination of money from the Olympic committee and from the state's university system, will be turned over to Georgia Tech.
The planning has not all gone smoothly.
Joseph G. Martin Jr., president of the city's board of education and a developer who drew praise for completing the Underground Atlanta project three years ago, quit as head of the corporation that was to renovate public housing projects after a dispute with tenant groups and the Atlanta Housing Authority, which will now do the renovations. Mr. Martin, who did not return calls seeking comment on the dispute, had proposed turning Techwood Homes into a mixed-income projects, displacing many of its low-income tenants.
Mr. Cottrell this week criticized a proposal to use $1 million in Federal Community Development Block Grant money to build a park near the new Georgia Dome.
"They want to use money earmarked for poor people for things like this when it seems that they ought to be willing to use A.C.O.G. money for this," Mr. Cottrell said. "We still need promised street-widening and new sewers in our area."
And just two weeks ago Mr. Holland himself criticized what he characterized as the "disjointed fashion" in which the city was planning projects, and proposed a public-private entity to oversee planning and construction. He has since retreated from that suggestion, saying that since his complaints city and Olympic officials have rectified the situation by meeting more frequently.
But all the discussion about a redevelopment and a long-term legacy from the 1996 Games could become moot without money.
The Atlanta Olympic organizers have so far lined up only two sponsors -- Nationsbank and Sara Lee -- and experts said there has been corporate resistance to the high price tag of sponsorships, which, along with television rights, provide the money for putting on the Games.
John Bevilaqua, president of Bevilaqua International, an Atlanta sports marketing firm, said the Atlanta planners were following the example of Los Angeles, the host of the 1984 Games. Los Angeles limited the number to corporate sponsors of the Games to 35, a sharp reduction from the 357 sponsors of the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid, N.Y. By eliminating some of the commercial clutter and raising the price of sponsorships to $4 million, Los Angeles came out of the Games with a surplus.
"Atlanta has taken this less-is-more strategy a step further and shrinking the number of sponsors even more and raising the price of sponsorships that much more," Mr. Bevilaqua said. Atlanta is seeking 12 sponsors at $40 million each.
Like Atlanta officials, prospective sponsors are waiting to see how the Games in Barcelona play out, Mr. Bevilaqua said. "If the television ratings for the Barcelona games are high, if the American ranks produce a lot of heroes to promote products in the future and if this year's corporate sponsors have a good time wining and dining their clients and closing deals, Atlanta will have an easier time getting sponsors for the 1996 Games."

HEADLINE: After Bandwagon Runs Off Road

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Many of the marooned followers of Ross Perot are moving through the customary stages of grief: denial, anger and acceptance.
And some appear stuck in denial, denying that they were ever so keen on the Texas billionaire. 
 "I have to tell you, if you had said to me, 'Leonard Lauder, your guarantee of support will guarantee Perot's election,' I would have said, 'No, thank you,' " said Leonard A. Lauder, the president and chief executive of Estee Lauder.
Mr. Lauder's interest may well have been tentative, but it was also well publicized. He attended a lunch for 300 advisers and supporters in Dallas on July 7, nine days before Mr. Perot pulled out of the Presidential race. The campaign had made much of the gathering -- which included Paul A. Nitze, a former arms negotiator, and Andrew H. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of Lorillard Inc. -- to underscore the seriousness of Mr. Perot's candidacy. Discussing the candidate last week, Mr. Lauder said: "I never thought he was ready to govern. I really just saw him as an agent for change."
 
50,000 Supporters in New York
 Shortly before Mr. Perot abandoned his efforts, volunteers had identified 50,000 supporters in New York State. Some, like Thomas D. Barr, a senior partner at the white-shoe law firm, Cravath, Swain & Moore, were all-out supporters. Others now say they never inhaled.
John Scanlon, a public relations consultant, let it be widely known in June that his expertise was being sought by Edward J. Rollins, the Republican consultant who served as a top Perot campaign strategist. One friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, recalled that Mr. Scanlon "seemed very excited" about working for Mr. Perot. But a meeting with the candidate never materialized.
"Ed Rollins talked to me about it, but nothing ever happened," the suave Mr. Scanlon said. "I had a sort of sense things would fall apart."
Mortimer B. Zuckerman was an early and ardent defender of Mr. Perot. The real-estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report wrote an editorial in the magazine praising Mr. Perot's "wit, his leadership, and his political will." Two weeks later, U.S. News ran a cover article titled "Perot on Perot," several pages devoted to Mr. Perot talking about himself, unhampered by editors' questions or commentary.
"I was not a supporter in the sense of endorsing him," Mr. Zuckerman said last week. But he acknowledged that he had been impressed by Mr. Perot's unannounced candidacy. Mr. Zuckerman explained that as a self-made businessman, he had insight into Mr. Perot. "I think I do understand what he has done and what he is going through," he said.
But Mr. Zuckerman said he never expected Mr. Perot to leave the race. "I am still astonished that it happened," Mr. Zuckerman said. "He is not a quitter." Neither is Mr. Zuckerman. In what could look a little like a political version of phantom-limb syndrome, Mr. Zuckerman decided to devote four pages of the magazine to Mr. Perot's orphaned economic plan.
 
No Big Deal, Some Say
 Others, who did endorse Mr. Perot, say the collapse of their crusade was no big deal. Mr. Barr scoffed at the suggestion that he might feel pain and betrayal. "I never get upset with myself except when I do something dumb," he said. "And I haven't done anything dumb."
Martha Stewart, the author of books on genteel living, said: "I saw how disorganized he was when I went to Dallas. I think he got out at an opportune moment."
She added that she was not embarrassed for having championed Mr. Perot, whom she had known for 20 years. "Look at how Clinton has changed because of Perot," she said. "You always used to see him eating a hot dog. Now, I never see him eating a hot dog. He has become serious."
 
Flirtations, Not Endorsements
 Mr. Scanlon said that, unlike others, "I never really got involved; it was just a brief flirtation." He added, with a sly laugh, "but call Marilyn."
Marilyn Berger, a freelance writer who has contributed to The New York Times and other publications, was one of Mr. Perot's early supporters in New York. "I suppose now that it's over, fewer are going to be willing to say they supported him," she said.
Ms. Berger wrote an impassioned endorsement of the Texas billionaire on June 3 in The Washington Post that drew widespread attention in media circles for its partisan fervor. Thomas W. Luce 3d, the chairman of the Perot Petition Committee, used to boast that Ms. Berger was "the first member of the Eastern Liberal Establishment to come out of the closet." She went on to help mobilize the Hamptons on Mr. Perot's behalf.
She added that she was not devastated when Mr. Perot dropped out. "I wasn't as emotionally involved as a lot of other people," she said.
Several people who attended a black-tie function at the New York Public Library in May recalled that Ms. Berger's husband, Don Hewitt, executive producer of CBS News's "60 Minutes," seemed smitten with the idea of a Perot candidacy.
"I have also spoken favorably about Bob Dole, Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards," Mr. Hewitt said and added sternly, "I have never endorsed a candidate in 70 years, and I did not endorse Perot."
 
'Intellectual Disappointment'
 Felix G. Rohatyn never endorsed Mr. Perot, either. But Mr. Rohatyn, an investment banker and adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, alarmed a few fellow Democrats when he spoke admiringly of Mr. Perot.
"I don't feel betrayed because I never supported him politically," said Mr. Rohatyn, who served on the board of Mr. Perot's computer services company, Electronic Data Systems, in the early 1980's. He said he had praised Mr. Perot, "for what his candidacy could contribute to the public dialogue."
Mr. Rohatyn also spoke highly of Mr. Perot's economic plan, which contains some of his ideas, like paying for public works projects by selling bonds, particularly to pension funds. "Since I was not committed, I cannot say I was disappointed," Mr. Rohatyn said, "but one can say there is intellectual disappointment."
Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was one of the few who admitted to feeling "duped." Mr. Hoving described Mr. Perot as "a tiny, spin-merchant Wizard of Oz." He then amended those words as "too good" for the former candidate. "At least," he said, "the Wizard of Oz admits he was a fraud."

HEADLINE: Third Party Celebrates Its Second Year

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALLINGFORD, Conn., July 25

 BODY:
A youthful political animal ventured out into the world of convention politics as the independent party founded by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. -- A Connecticut Party -- gathered here tonight to endorse candidates, celebrate and see what it had created.
The two-year-old party -- an amalgam of former Republicans and Democrats, Weicker devotees and a healthy contingent of people simply fed up with two-party politics -- is positioning itself as more than just a personal political vehicle for the Governor, but rather as a permanent third party with its own agenda and hopes for a full slate of candidates. 
 "This is our first, but certainly not our last convention," said Diane Blick, the party chairwoman, as she welcomed delegates to an open-air convention that was more like a picnic in the hills of central Connecticut than a typical political gathering.
Yvonne Inniss, a former Democrat and secretary of the party's Hartford branch, said: "Politics has seemed stuck for years, and there are no visionaries in the two parties. The A.C.P. offers an opportunity for grass-roots change."
Indeed, many delegates expressed high hopes for the party as a means to break the political stalemate gripping Connecticut, which has been deeply divided in the last two years over the state's year-old income tax and budget cuts. Many of the 350 delegates -- a cross-section of ages and races -- also saw themselves as continuing in Connecticut what Ross Perot had attempted.
William Hayes, a delegate from New London and a former Republican, said, "Weicker shows what Perot could have done, because he is able to mediate between and attract Democrats and Republicans."
 
'A Free Market of Ideas'
 The Governor himself opened his address by saying, "It's very simple: it's A Connecticut Party today and an American party tomorrow.
"This permanently changes the face of politics in Connecticut from a monopoly to a free market of ideas," he added, standing in front of the party's flag, a blue tree on a field of white. "This state and nation have been dried up politically because of the self-serving machinations of the politically active few, the apathy of many and the monopoly of the two-party system."
After Mr. Weicker's speech, the party endorsed more than 100 candidates for the General Assembly, most of whom the party's executive committee had recommended on Thursday. The list included about 80 Democrats, 16 of the party's own candidates and a handful of Republicans, some of whom declined almost as soon as the recommendations were made public. Most of the $250,000 the party has raised this year will go to supporting its own candidates, Ms. Blick, said. The incumbents whom the party endorsed were largely ones who had supported the income tax.
Many of the party's candidates are political novices like Anita Mielert, an English teacher and mother of three from Simsbury, who said that A Connecticut Party's goals were "to refocus Connecticut voters on issues like fiscal responsibility, education and health care."
Although Ms. Mielert, a candidate for the General Assembly, and others acknowledged that the party had some trouble recruiting candidates to run in the state, she discounted the poor record of American third parties, saying: "Everyone assumes the Democrats and Republicans are immortal. But movements begin, and we're not going to die in two years."
However, at least a few saw the party as having a lifespan defined by the mission it has set for itself: remedying the state's economic problems.
The convention was held just hours after Connecticut's Democrats had convened in Hartford, where they renominated Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who is running for his third term. A Connecticut Party also endorsed Mr. Dodd, thus giving him two lines on the ballot.
Mr. Dodd, who appeared briefly at the convention here, tepidly welcomed the endorsement.
"I only sought one endorsement, but I represent Democrats, independents, Republicans and people who don't vote," he said. "I don't know what the impact of the A.C.P. endorsement will be. It certainly doesn't hurt, and it probably helps to have independent voices heard."
Although some expressed concern that the independent line on the ballot might lead voters not to vote for other Democratic candidates, most Democrats at their convention said they did not expect the new party to make much difference.
But Nancy DeMarinis, a Democrat running for a legislative seat in Groton, was among a fair number of Democrats who said she met A Connecticut Party's standards and was eager for an endorsement if the party makes more.
"They asked me if I supported the income tax, am pro-choice and am for gay and lesbian rights, which I am," she said. "So I'm hoping to be endorsed."
Among Republicans, whose state leadership has made no secret of its displeasure with those accepting A Connecticut Party's endorsement, the reaction was mostly to decline the endorsements.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Jump 31.1%

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools jumped 31.1 percent last month from May's level, in another sign of economic growth in the United States, according to a report from an industry trade group.
The trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, based in McLean, Va., calculated June's orders at $208.6 million, 20.6 percent above the June 1991 figures. 
 "It's another sign that capital spending is starting its recovery," said F. John Mirek, an industry analyst with Kemper Securities in Milwaukee.
The jump follows a durable-goods report on Friday pointing to a 2.3 percent gain in June. "We're starting to gain a little steam," Mr. Mirek added.
So far this year, machine-tool orders have totaled $1.26 billion, an 8 percent increase over the comparable period last year.
Of the $208.6 million in total June orders, $35.1 million were sold for export and $173.5 million were placed by American companies.
"Domestic machine-tool demand is unusually strong, given the economy is really not in a full-blown recovery," said Albert W. Moore, the industry association's president.
June's rise in orders followed two months of consecutive declines. In May, orders dropped 27.5 percent from the previous month, and in April they declined 9.4 percent from March.
The association's statistics combine figures for two kinds of machinery: metal-cutting and metal-forming machines used to produce a significant number of manufactured goods, from refrigerators and cookware to automobiles and aircraft. Their sales are regarded by economists as one of many indicators of the nation's economic condition.
Mr. Mirek of Kemper Securities said that orders in July and August might be less robust because of a trade show in Chicago in September. Many people may hold off purchases until they view the industry's newest offerings.
"You'll get a little bit of a lull in the summer months before the show," he said.
While the statistics highlight healthier levels of ordering from American companies, they also note a sharp decline in exports. The $35.1 million in export orders in June represents a 41.7 percent drop from June 1991. It also mirrors a pattern so far this year that shows such export figures are down 42.8 percent from the first six months of 1991.
The association noted that the figure reflected the trade pattern in other manufactured goods and the economic downturn in countries that buy from the United States. In mid-July, the Commerce Department said a 2.5 percent decline in overall exports in May contributed to a 4.5 percent jump in the monthly trade deficit.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Asset Managers Track The Elusive High Yield

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
As yields on fixed-income securities of all stripes fall ever closer to those being offered on Treasury notes and bonds, portfolio managers are finding it increasingly difficult to pick up incremental yield.
Not surprisingly, the search for higher yield is forcing many of these professionals to plumb markets they had no need to consider even a year ago, when interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds, for example, were much higher than they are today. Indeed, some have given up looking and are investing bigger and bigger amounts of their portfolios in government bonds. 
 "We are looking everywhere" for higher yields, said Barbara Kenworthy, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation who manages more than $2 billion of fixed-income assets. But the search is not an easy one, she said, and, as a consequence, "We have become oriented toward special situations."
 
'Mispriced Issues'
 Occasionally, Ms. Kenworthy said that "we see outstanding corporate bonds that have gotten very cheap."
"And sometimes," she added, "mispriced issues that have been on dealers' shelves for some time will go at a pretty good discount."
A $300 million offering of five-year notes by the Kellogg Company last week is a good example of how aggressive investment bankers have become in pricing top-graded corporate securities relative to Treasury issues.
Kellogg, a AAA-rated company that has not sold any debt in at least five years, offered the securities last week at 99.785 to yield 5.95 percent, a mere 13 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over five-year Treasury notes.
"It has been very difficult to find much value in corporate land," said James Kochan, fixed-income strategist at R. W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
 
Mortgage-Backed Pros and Cons
 As a result, Mr. Kochan said, he has been looking for opportunities in the markets for mortgage-backed securities and Treasury zero-coupon bond markets, areas where prices have fallen a bit and yields have risen.
Prices of mortgage-backed securities were hit fairly hard last week after a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that mortgage applications have risen sharply since the Federal Reserve Board cut the discount rate and overnight Federal funds rate earlier this month.
While yields on high- and medium-coupon mortgage-backed securities have gone up, so, too, has the risk that these mortgages will be prepaid, analysts said, noting that within two months a sharp rise in mortgage applications is usually translated into prepayments.
Still, "traders tell us that high- and medium-coupon mortgages have become very cheap- to low-coupon mortgages," which carry a lower prepayment risk, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
 
Not Quite Zero Excitement
 Mr. Kochan said the decline in interest rates had created opportunities in zero-coupon bonds, instruments issued without a coupon at deep discounts and redeemed at par when held to maturity.
"Investors used to be very excited about buying zeros with 9 percent yields that matured in 10 to 12 years," he said. "You can't get yields like that anywhere now."
Because of reduced demand from individual investors and the Japanese, who used to be big purchasers of zero-coupon bonds, yield spreads between those securities and Treasury securities traded in the cash market have been widening.
"Earlier this year, you could pick up about 30 basis points in yield by going into zeroes," relative to Treasury bonds of comparable maturity, Mr. Kochan said. "Now you can pick up about 50 basis points."
Ms. Kenworthy at Dreyfus agreed that there is value in zero-coupon bonds outstanding, but she added that because those issues are less liquid, there is a risk of big price swings.
The bid-offered spreads on those bonds are "very wide," she said.
Some fund managers are forsaking the search for increased yield and are funneling an ever-increasing share of their money into Treasuries. Steven S. Smith, who manages some $50 million for Brandywine Asset Management, told Bloomberg Business News that since March he has raised the size of his stake in Treasuries to 50 percent from zero, selling corporate bonds along the way.
The move into Treasury securities is not reflected in yields on long-term notes and bonds but is stunningly visible in the performance of intermediate-term issues.
"A lot of players in the United States are forbidden to make investments with maturities of more than five years," one government securities trader said. "To them, that is the long bond."
Yields on five-year Treasury notes have fallen steeply relative to 30-year bonds since March, when the current rally began.
"Back then the spread between fives and bonds was about 95 basis points," the trader said. "As of Friday it was 194 basis points."
The new five-year notes that are scheduled to be auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis late Friday at a price to yield 5.69 percent.
 
Uneasy Projections
 Aside from note auctions tomorrow and Wednesday, activity in the credit markets this week will be highlighted by the release Thursday of the Commerce Department's first estimate of second-quarter economic growth.
In advance of the report, analysts are anticipating the numbers to show much more sluggish growth than the 2.7 percent rise recorded in the first three months of the year. Most forecasters are projecting the economy grew somewhere between 1.5 percent and 2 percent in the second quarter.
At the moment, economists are uneasy about projecting what the slowdown means for the third quarter.
"As this month began, we are seeing a pattern develop of economic statistics that are similar to what happened in January," said Paul Mastroddi, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. "The fact that mortgage applications are up and chain-store sales are doing a bit better is telling me that lower interest rates are helping out a bit."
The economy has received a similar interest-rate-related stimulus twice in the last year, only to see the momentum stall when market rates rose in response to an uptick in activity.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Music's Over, and a Magazine Begins

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
David A. Krebs, who spent most of the last 20 years managing hard-living rock bands like Aerosmith and AC/DC, is explaining his vision for his serious new monthly magazine, The National Times.
"My joke line is that I've gone from heavy metal to heavy mental," said Mr. Krebs in his chaotic Manhattan office, where the walls are studded with platinum records signifying million-sellers from the days when he would go a year without wearing a suit. These days, his uniform comes from Brooks Brothers. 
 The National Times, which has not yet begun regularly publication, intends to be a monthly review of news and comment from leading newspapers and magazines. The magazine would fill a niche between The Reader's Digest and The Utne Reader, a bimonthy digest of articles from the alternative press.
 
Irresistible Optimism
 In a sense, Mr. Krebs embodies the combination of passion and irresistible optimism that continues to give birth to new magazine titles, despite what might appear to be overwhelming odds, especially for someone with no publishing experience.
Mr. Krebs, who is 52 years old, said he had so far spent about $350,000 of his royalty money from the sale of songs like Aerosmith's "Dream On" to refine the concept and format of The National Times. He added that he planned to start regular publication in the fall, probably in October, and would distribute 50,000 copies of the first issue, mainly in Manhattan.
He estimates that starting the magazine will cost about $3 million.
In the last two years, a depressed advertising climate has killed publications ranging from national magazines like Fame and Connoisseur to local ventures intended for an elite audience, like 7 Days, a weekly aimed at Manhattan's higher-income ZIP codes.
 
Support for Krebs
 "Whether he can pull if off in a tough advertising market with tight capital is hard for me to say; but if anyone can do it, David can," said Herbert I. London, a dean at New York University and the 1990 Conservative Party candidate for governor of New York.
Mr. London, who has known Mr. Krebs for 30 years, is one of the handful of friends that has been asked to critique the various prototypes of The National Times, beginning with a broadsheet newspaper version in 1988 that was to sell for $2.
The format first evolved to a tabloid newspaper and then to a slightly oversized magazine with a slick cover and a $4 cover price.
The most recent version of the magazine, the July issue, includes articles like Sidney Blumenthal's analysis of Ross Perot from The New Republic, The Economist's view of the Los Angeles riots and articles from The Los Angeles Times, Mother Jones, Aviation Week and Space Technology, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Institutional Investor. About 15,000 copies of the July issue were printed.
Mr. Krebs said five editors peruse more than 200 newspapers and magazines and select about 100 articles for possible reprinting. He and his editor, James Goode, make the final selection of roughly 40 articles to run in the 84-page publication and acquire the reprint rights from the publications in which they first appeared.
Although Mr. Krebs considers himself to be moderately liberal, the articles will span a wide range of political viewpoints.
The array of possible sources for articles includes a dozen broadcast news organizations and publications of about 20 public-interest groups, like Common Cause. For instance, the July issue included a transcript of a report by the ABC program "20/20" dealing with the Continental Can Company's dismissal of employees just before they would receive their pensions.
Mr. Krebs, who grew up in Brooklyn, has degrees in business and the law from Columbia University.
But rather than practice law, he joined the William Morris Agency and was soon working with rock-and-roll bands. In 1972, he left William Morris to became a founder of a music management business.
Mr. Krebs also essentially stopped reading.
Then in the mid-1980's, burned out on the music business, Mr. Krebs took a year's sabbatical and read.
Not long after, the idea came to him for a publication that would offer a smorgasbord of the best in journalistic analysis and opinion, and he started creating prototypes.
Mr. Krebs acknowledges that there are many questions about his venture that must be answered the hard way in the marketplace.
Will readers view The National Times as a time-saving publication or just another part of the deluge of information that the magazine is intended to simplify?
And even if people like the concept, will they pay $36 for a year's subscription? While the publication is expected to carry advertising, most of its revenues are expected to come from circulation.
Mr. Krebs is confident that the instincts that helped him recognize potential rock-and-roll stars will guide him with his new venture.

Barkley's Elbow Fouls a U.S. Rout

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BADALONA, Spain, July 26

 BODY:
Not surprisingly, Charles Barkley got into the Olympic spirit this afternoon by smashing an intentional elbow into the chest of the skinniest member of the Angolan team.
Leave it to the 250-pound Barkley to pick on a 174-pound economics student from a third-world, war-torn nation who has spent many a Wednesday night back home in Luanda searching the television dial in search of his favorite forward from the National Basketball Association. 
 That's right, the one, the only, and the occasionally ugly: Sir Charles.
The United States Olympic basketball team, which will face its first real test Monday night against Croatia, was predictably awesome in its Olympic debut today. But it was quite another impression that Barkley made on 24-year-old Herlander Coimbra, the opening day crowd here at the Palau d'Esports and his United States teammates. Coimbra was shocked that Barkley would "make violence" with him, the fans who cheered everyone else booed Barkley and some of the other Dream Team players decided to join in.
"If he keeps this up, they're going to throw him out of the Olympics," Michael Jordan said of Barkley after the United States highlighted a 116-48 rout of the African champion with a 46-1 first-half run. "We've already created some ill feelings here, and that didn't help."
David Robinson said, "We're trying to tell Charles that he can't get too much out of control."
In an effort to restore some semblance of Barkley's diplomatic credibility, if that's possible, it should be noted that he did agree to make reparation following the game. As the teams approached their dressing rooms, the forgiving Coimbra motioned to Barkley and asked if they could pose in a picture together -- a picture that would certainly be worth at least a 1,000 words with family and friends back home.
Barkley said Coimbra had hit him in the head as he barreled in for a fast-break dunk that gave the United States its 30th and 31st successive points and a 38-7 lead. Coimbra said he was merely attempting to block Barkley's shot. After the dunk, and Barkley's trademark hanging on to the rim, Coimbra turned to head upcourt when Barkley moved alongside his left shoulder and thrust his right elbow into the upper portion of the Angolan's chest.
Barkley was hit with an intentional foul. Coimbra hit the free throw that interrupted what would have been a 46-0 run.
"If somebody make violence with me, it is important that I not react to the violence," said Coimbra. "Sport is not violent. It is supposed to be friends forever."
 
'Eye for an Eye'
 Not according to Barkley, who led the United States with 24 points and described the Coimbra episode as kind of a religious experience. "Eye for an eye," said Barkley. "It's a ghetto thing."
Apart from the fact that it was the Dream Team's first game on this world stage, that it was already hopelessly out of the Angolans' reach, Barkley's pointed elbow failed to take into account the difference between a ghetto and an actual war zone. Angola happens to be a true representation of the old-fashioned, if no longer relevant in this age of commercialization, Olympic ideal. Its presence at the games is a stunning triumph in itself.
The Angolans, who won the African qualifying tournament last February, have no players taller than the 6-foot-6-inch Coimbra. Victorino Cuhna has been coach of the national team since 1974, when Angola claimed its independence from Portugal. He is prideful of his knowledge of the game and, in the 1990 world championships, his teams lost games to Canada by 2 points, Puerto Rico by 3 and to formerly powerful Yugoslavia by 13.
Six of his players play professionally in Portugal, although Cuhna described the quality of play there as "nothing." All of them are from Luanda or live there, to keep as far away from the civil war, most of which is being fought in the south.
"The war, my friends, has destroyed everything," said Cuhna, who has flown his team over bombed-out cities and bridges, and kept it a presence internationally through corporate sponsorship in the United States.
Cuhna had been quoted earlier in the week as believing his team had a chance to come within 35 points of the United States, if his players kept their heads. His reasoning was a belief that N.B.A. all stars don't play defense, which Coach Chuck Daly was happy to use in his pre-game and motivational speech, as if he needed one.
 
Offensive About Defense
 By the end of the game, despite the Dream Team's utter domination after being played to a 7-7 standoff, Cuhna remained unconvinced. As he was being interviewed by members of the American news media, a voice said in passing, "So we don't play defense?" The voice belonged to Scottie Pippen.
"I'm sorry, you don't, you only run fast breaks," Cuhna answered, and adding that his players lost their poise when confronted by the size of the United States centers, Robinson and Patrick Ewing. But not by Barkley and his angry elbows.
"Oh, we don't get upset because Charles Barkley does the same thing in N.B.A. games," Cuhna said, proving he did know something about the league after all.

The Television Time Bomb

BYLINE: By DAVID C. ANDERSON

 BODY:
For the toddlers, it's gangs of cartoon mice dynamiting a menacing cat. Elementary schoolers sit rapt while superheroes wield special powers to dispatch evil. And by the time they're in junior high, American kids regularly witness barroom fistfights, knifepoint rapes, drug-deal shootouts and terrorist attacks.
All on television, of course. But for years parents have worried about the effects of such violence, fanciful as it may be, on developing minds. Now a Seattle psychiatrist, Brandon Centerwall, offers a theory that, if corroborated by other researchers, suggests good reason for worry. 
 In a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Centerwall describes how he sought to measure the relationship between television and violence by comparing the United States with South Africa, where an affluent Westernized white population remained without TV programming until 1975.
In the U.S., Dr. Centerwall writes, the homicide rate among white Americans nearly doubled between the introduction of television in the 1950's and 1975. The biggest surge in American homicides occurred after 1965, just as the first generation of children to grow up with television reached adolescence.
The psychiatrist asserts that he considered the effects of age distribution, urbanization, economic conditions, alcohol consumption, capital punishment, civil unrest and the availability of firearms. Yet "none provided a viable alternative explanation for the observed homicide trends."
Thinking that the American civil rights movement or the Vietnam War might have had some effect, he looked at similar figures for Canada. It introduced television at the same time the U.S. did but never had a big civil rights problem and didn't send troops to Vietnam. The Canadian homicide and TV use statistics rose in striking parallel with those for the U.S. The homicide figures for white South Africans, meanwhile, remained flat between 1950 and 1975.
But by 1987, as South Africa's first television generation came of age, the homicide rate had more than doubled. In the U.S. and Canada, meanwhile, homicide rates among whites between 1974 and 1987 remained relatively stable.
Dr. Centerwall concludes that long-term childhood exposure to television is a causal factor behind half of the homicides committed in the United States, or about 10,000 homicides annually.
That's a sobering conclusion, yet Dr. Centerwall suggests possible responses that wouldn't raise any censorship issues: educating pediatricians and parents about the problem, rating TV shows for violence and requiring that all new TV sets be equipped with time-channel locks that would let parents block reception of violent shows in advance. The problem also argues for more day care and after-school programs, which would allow working parents to make less use of TV as a baby sitter.
Those are useful ideas in any case. However much television violence may serve the needs of the entertainment industry, it fully warrants treatment as an issue for public health and social policy, and a special challenge for parents.

HEADLINE: Solving Europe's Refugee Crisis

 BODY:
The conflict in Bosnia is taking a staggering human toll -- not only in lives lost, but in lives wrenched from their moorings. United Nations officials are already assisting more than two million people who have fled their homes for safer areas. A million more refugees could leave their devastated towns and villages by winter. It is Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.
To deal with the refugees' plight, United Nations officials have called an urgent meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva this week. The mass exodus cries out for a compassionate, comprehensive response from Bosnia's European neighbors -- and from the United States. 
 The murderous struggle among the battered republics of the former Yugoslavia has already claimed more than 20,000 lives. The survivors, meanwhile, must contend with sectarian hatreds and daily danger. Whole towns and villages are being purged of Muslims and Croats as the result of "ethnic cleansing" operations by one side or another. As more and more people seek protection, there are fewer and fewer safe places for them to go within the borders of the former Yugoslavia.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that more than 2.5 million people have been driven from their homes. About 1.8 million have found precarious protection within countries of the former federation.
The crisis is straining the limits of sympathetic response. Croatia, now overwhelmed by more than 600,000 refugees, is shutting its doors. It is unclear how many more refugees the rest of the former federation, including Bosnia, can absorb.
Most of Europe has been content to sit on the sidelines. The most notable exception is Germany, which has taken in about 200,000 refugees. Hungary, Austria and Sweden combined are sheltering about 150,000.
Though many European nations are tightening their borders against economic migrants in search of better jobs, the refugees fleeing the former Yugoslavia are political refugees. They are the classic victims of persecution that refugee conventions are designed to protect.
Their tragedy demands a humanitarian response, but one where the burden is shared fairly. Those unable to find safety in the former Yugoslavia are entitled to temporary safe haven in other lands. The more prosperous nations also need to contribute money to help the refugees. An international appeal for $142 million for the U.N. refugee effort has brought in about $107 million thus far.
While the heaviest burden falls on Europe, other nations can help. The U.S. Department of Justice, for example, ought to extend temporary safe haven, as allowed under the 1990 Immigration Act, to an estimated 20,000 students and other war-torn area visitors now in this country.
Europe and the U.S. are understandably fearful that those granted temporary refuge will find some way to stay permanently. But Western powers can't have it both ways. They can't let the communal bloodshed in the Balkans conflict escalate out of control, as they largely have, and then turn their backs on the desperate and dispossessed.

HEADLINE: Can the Poor No Longer Get a Good Education?;
Blow to Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 7 article on the City University of New York describes the debate about how CUNY can best meet the city's needs. CUNY plays a major role in educating the city's health work force. With degrees in 38 health disciplines and about 2,000 graduates each year, CUNY educates more health professionals for the city than any other institution. 
 Yet a report issued by our center in April 1991 documents that budget cuts are damaging CUNY's ability to meet this need. Last year, hundreds of CUNY students were forced to delay admission into health professional programs; others had to postpone graduation because needed courses were not available. While city hospitals traveled to other countries to recruit nurses to meet shortages, Hunter, New York City Technical, Bronx Community and other colleges eliminated nursing faculty positions.
The New York State Department of Health estimates that by 1994, 15,000 health-care professionals will be needed simply to care for people with H.I.V. infection. The city's increasing drug abuse and tuberculosis problems require hundreds of new treatment specialists. New York's growing population of older people and poor children also have unmet health-care needs.
Research suggests that health professional students from disadvantaged communities are more likely to practice in their own communities than others. Yet it is precisely these who will be excluded as CUNY tuition rises and academic requirements are raised without substantial new investments in the city's high schools.
Reducing the size of CUNY and admitting fewer students may help balance the state's budget, but it is a shortsighted strategy that in the long run will damage the city's young people, its health care system, its economy and the future well-being of its citizens.

HEADLINE: Sharpton Brings Surprises to 4-Way Senate Race;
As a Candidate, He's Restyled and Determined About His Political Goals and Impact

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
For Patricia Irvin, one of the handful of black partners who practice law on Wall Street, it was a revelation, hearing the Rev. Al Sharpton talk about his run for the United States Senate a few weeks ago at a forum for members of her old-line firm, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
In place of the negative picture gleaned from years of news accounts of his protests, Ms. Irvin said, she heard someone who was "clearly very smart, and very concerned about the black community, but also concerned about a lot of broader issues that affect our society, and he talked about them in a very articulate way." 
 So Ms. Irvin invited Mr. Sharpton and about 45 friends -- black professionals like herself -- to her Manhattan apartment for three hours of discussion. "Most of them came in very skeptical and left very interested in him as a leader in the black community," she said.
Mr. Sharpton has surprised a lot of people in this unpredictable political year. The protean preacher who began his career as a boy evangelist, who went on to mingle with organized-crime figures in the entertainment world and later became a government informant, has restyled himself yet again to run a serious, if quixotic, campaign for membership in one of the world's most exclusive clubs.
"I haven't changed," Mr. Sharpton insisted recently. "I think what has changed is the mainstream of America has come to understand people like Al Sharpton more, because after Rodney King and L.A., after such blatant acts, people say, 'Well, maybe Sharpton is not crazy -- maybe there is something wrong in the justice system.' "
Yet there is something different about Mr. Sharpton, if only because he has chosen to show more of himself to more people. Yes, he still has marcelled hair, which flows to his shoulders in undulant brown streams. Yes, he still wears his heavy Martin Luther King Jr. medallion around his neck, though it now usually covers a tie and not a jogging suit. And no, he doesn't really believe he can win, having so far failed to break out of single digits in the polls.
But the 37-year-old Mr. Sharpton is determined to build a beachhead for the future in a state in which no black candidate has ever won statewide office. "I'm getting us set now so we can demand easy pickings two years from now," he said at a fund-raiser held in his honor last month by the film maker Spike Lee. "It's about now and forever. Not Al Sharpton, but all of us."
Since Mr. Sharpton entered the race on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, his oratory has been milder, and his quick lip has made sure he more than holds his own in debates with his rivals for the Democratic nomination, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
Just what impact he will have on the race is another question. Several polls have shown Ms. Ferraro in the lead in the upper 30 percent range, with Mr. Abrams somewhat behind and Ms. Holtzman in the teens in percentage and rising. A number of prominent black officials, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, have endorsed Mr. Abrams, while others have backed Ms. Holtzman, who had long enjoyed strong black support.
Most politicians believe Mr. Sharpton has probably drawn some black voters who would have gone to Ms. Holtzman, but they say it is also possible that he is attracting blacks who otherwise would not have voted.
Mr. Sharpton's strategy has relied heavily on appearances on black-oriented radio stations and in black churches in New York City, but he has also made forays upstate and onto Long Island.
 
'Almost Easier Audiences'
 Urging crowds of New York youths to stay calm in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, he said over and over, as if to remind himself as well as them, "I'm angry, but I'm not mad."
Or as he put it in a recent interview: "I think people are so surprised that I know how to say more than, 'No justice, no peace!' that they become almost easier audiences for me. When I talk about the environment or criminal justice or other issues, they're surprised."
He has won the endorsement not only of celebrities like Mr. Lee and the soul legend James Brown but also of more mainstream black groups of the sort once thought to disdain him, including the Grand Council of Guardians, which represents black police officers in the city, and the African Methodist Episcopal Alliance of New York and Vicinity, a major umbrella group of black clergy.
Perhaps most powerfully, in a year when voters around the country are crying for change, Mr. Sharpton has positioned himself as the ultimate outsider, the poor-person's Ross Perot, hammering away at the economic and social inequities of American life.
"He is trying to put out a populist message," said the chief political adviser to Mr. Dinkins, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who, with his boss, has had an up and down relationship with Mr. Sharpton over the years. "His message before was much narrower. I think there is a positive aspect to Al's running. His candidacy shows people who have never been involved in politics that there is a viable alternative, and that allows people to move into the democratic mainstream."
Democratic Party leaders have been impressed, too. The state Democratic chairman, John A. Marino, at first dismissed Mr. Sharpton as a fringe candidate and questioned his ties to the New Alliance Party, a political splinter group whose critics contend it operates like a cult.
With the backing of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Marino later reversed himself and said party leaders should vote to assure Mr. Sharpton a place on the primary ballot without making him circulate nominating petitions. He did so in part to avoid any messy scenes at the state party convention in May, but was more than repaid when Mr. Sharpton made a thoughtful speech that won an ovation from the delegates.
"People came up to me afterward and said, 'We thought you were doing the wrong thing, but you were right,' " Mr. Marino recalled. "It was a turning point for him. He's arrived with people, and I think that's very important. I've come to respect him in his effort to appeal to a different group in the community, and in some senses obviously reach deeper into that community than even Jesse Jackson has been able to reach."
Mr. Sharpton says he is taking no money from the New Alliance Party for his campaign, but its affiliates have booked speaking engagements for him around the country that provided much of his personal income, and New Alliance lawyers have given him legal services. He and his aides often work out of a Manhattan suite on West 57th Street filled with New Alliance affiliates.
Certainly, he has raised little money -- just $31,930, according to his official filings, compared with about $1.5 million each for Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Abrams and close to a million for Ms. Holtzman -- and he had $2,606 in the bank at last report.
"I don't need the money my opponents do," Mr. Sharpton said. "They're not known. They've got to buy TV time."
Mr. Sharpton, who is well known throughout the region, lives in Englewood, N.J., with his wife, Cathy, and two daughters, but also shares a Crown Heights apartment with an aide in Brooklyn. A candidate is only required to be a New York resident when elected.
Mr. Sharpton's skill on the stump lets him elide the most controversial parts of his past. When he talks about his role as an adviser to Tawana Brawley -- the black teen-ager who, Mr. Abrams's inquiry concluded, fabricated her account of rape and abduction by whites -- he hardly offers the ringing defense he once made of her. "Even if Tawana lied," he says, "there were enough technical errors" in the initial handling of the case to arouse legitimate suspicions.
Answering a question from a member of a gay and lesbian Democratic club at a debate in Greenwich Village, he brushed aside his repeated use of the word "faggot" in all-black rallies in Brooklyn, saying he had never meant to deride homosexuals, only "someone who was less than a man or a woman in our community."
 
A Political Lapse
 And he explains away his 1986 support for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican he now says must be defeated, as a lapse born of desperation with the Democrats, like the late Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr.'s endorsement of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.
Mr. Sharpton's three opponents do not seem to know what to make of him. If they tend to ignore him, they carefully do not attack him either. At one debate in Brooklyn, after Ms. Holtzman repeatedly exhorted Ms. Ferraro to release all her personal and corporate income-tax returns, Mr. Sharpton, who is under an indictment obtained by Mr. Abrams's office for failing to file state income tax returns for several years, finally said: "As far as releasing tax returns, Mr. Abrams has most of mine and he can release them when he gets ready."
At that, Mr. Abrams smiled and said, "Ah, there's only one Al Sharpton."
"And you're glad of that!" Mr. Sharpton shot back.
Ms. Irvin, the Wall Street lawyer, said her get-together "was not about the Senate race, but I think a number of people contributed to his campaign." She said she thought it was quite possible that Mr. Sharpton, like other onetime street protesters from Dr. King to Mr. Jackson, was practicing "the kind of activism that matured into leadership."
Whatever happens in the primary, Mr. Sharpton said, the winner of the Democratic nomination for the Senate will need the votes of the candidate's supporters and many more to defeat Mr. D'Amato in a tough race.
"I'm the margin of difference," he said. "That means they've got to sit down on Fulton Street in Brooklyn and eat chicken and talk, and that's something they've never had to do before in a statewide race."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Rev. Al Sharpton's Senate campaign referred incompletely to the amounts raised by his Democratic rivals. Robert Abrams and Geraldine A. Ferraro have each raised about $3.5 million since their campaigns began; Elizabeth Holtzman has raised $1.7 million. Of those totals, Mr. Abrams and Ms. Ferraro have each raised about $1.5 million in this year alone, and Ms. Holtzman $700,000.

Sheehan Turns to Peace in Vietnam

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

After the War Was Over
Hanoi and Saigon
By Neil Sheehan
Illustrated. 131 pages. Random House. $17. 
 You don't know quite what to expect at the opening of Neil Sheehan's enlightening report, "After the War Was Over: Hanoi and Saigon," when he describes landing at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi in 1989.
In his previous writings, Mr. Sheehan has described himself as an avid supporter of United States policy in Vietnam when he first went there in 1962 as a 25-year-old reporter for United Press International. But in time he grew disillusioned with what he came to see as the major tragedy of his generation, so much so that in 1971, when he was working for The New York Times, he obtained the official secret archive of the war known as the Pentagon Papers.
Between 1971 and 1989 he wrote "A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam," an award-winning account of the war as seen through the eyes of the battle commander whom Mr. Sheehan regarded as the personification of the American venture in Vietnam. After "A Bright Shining Lie" was published, Mr. Sheehan felt at peace with himself and was eager to return to Vietnam with his wife, the journalist Susan Sheehan, and see the country that had so long been the object of his obsessions, now that it was also at peace.
Yet one's curiosity over what his return will be like is resolved with dramatic suddenness. Almost the first person he and his wife got to see was Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, and the very occurrence of their meeting with the 79-year-old victor of Dien Bien Phu as well as the content of their conversation with him sets the tone for what is to come in Mr. Sheehan's mesmerizing report.
First, there is the surprising fact of General Giap's accessibility. This indicated the willingness of the Vietnamese to show the Sheehans whatever they wished to see, whether it was a battle site, a factory or an individual and whether what they saw reflected positively or negatively on the Vietnamese struggle to consolidate their victory in the war.
Then there is the combination of pride and humility displayed by this living icon of Vietnamese history. In 1982, General Giap was forced out of the Politburo, the executive body of the Vietnamese Communist Party, after clashing with Le Duan, the Brezhnev-like general secretary of the party who has been blamed for the economic mistakes and political dogmatism of the first decade after American troops left. Yet even though General Giap suffered the humiliation of being forced to stand behind the editor of the party newspaper on formal occasions when protocol ruled, "there was a limit to how much such slights could hurt this man," Mr. Sheehan writes. "He knew who he was and what he had done, and no one could take that away from him."
Similarly, many of the people whom the Sheehans interviewed seem indifferent to matters of pride or humiliation. Among the most interesting of these is Nguyen Van Linh, the present general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, who survived 12 years of French prisons, 30 years of war and manhunts in the South, and a decade of internecine political struggle after the Communist victory in 1975 before he eventually took over the leadership of his country in 1985 and started it down a new path toward partial capitalism after his predecessor, Le Duan, had failed to build the ideal Communist society. There is also Ly Tong Ba, a general in command of a South Vietnamese infantry division when the Government of President Le Duc Thieu finally fell in 1975, who fully expected to be executed by the Communists but who survived 12 years of prison and "re-education."
But what impresses the reader most about General Giap's demeanor is his lack of bitterness or animosity, particularly toward Americans. This too was reflected everywhere the Sheehans went in Vietnam. People even looked ahead to a time when the American economic boycott would end and diplomatic relations would resume. Mr. Sheehan writes that the Vietnamese "see an American diplomatic and business presence as a political counterpoise to China and an economic counterpoise to Japan."
The Communists did not impose the much-feared blood bath on their defeated opponents. In fact, the people who suffered the most, many of them expelled from the country and perishing at sea as boat people, were the Chinese minority in Vietnam, who were feared as a potential fifth column for Beijing. And this can be seen as the final paradox of America's involvement in the war, considering that its policy was based on an assumption that if South Vietnam was defeated by the North, it would be the first of a series of dominoes toppling over in the path of a monolithic Communist juggernaut led by China.
Mr. Sheehan's book, portions of which originally appeared in different form in The New Yorker, finally adds up to a view of the struggle with the United States from the enemy's perspective. Mr. Sheehan reports that back in 1963, Ho Chi Minh predicted that Americans would behave differently from the French. "Neither you nor I knows the Americans well," Ho told a visiting Polish diplomat, "but what we do know of them, what we have read and heard about them, suggests that they are more practical and clearsighted than other capitalist nations. They will not pour their resources into Vietnam endlessly. One day they will take pencil in hand and begin figuring. Once they really begin to analyze our ideas seriously, they will come to the conclusion that it is possible and even worthwhile to live in peace with us."
But Ho turned out to be wrong. As Mr. Sheehan writes, the Americans proved different from the French only in the degree of arrogance "in the hubris of our moment in the sun." So the Vietnamese rolled up their sleeves and fought the American forces until they left. It was, as Mr. Sheehan's report makes luminously clear, simply another task in their centuries-old struggle for independence.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 1992, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A book review yesterday about "After the War Was Over: Hanoi and Saigon," by Neil Sheehan, referred incorrectly in some editions to the presidency of South Vietnam. The President in office when the country fell to the Communists was Gen. Duong Van Minh. His predecessor, who resigned nine days earlier, was Nguyen Van Thieu, not Le Duc Thieu.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Leads Charge Against Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
In the Democrats' first major Presidential campaign attack against the North American Free Trade Agreement that the Bush Administration is negotiating with Mexico and Canada, the House majority leader said today that the pact did not include adequate safeguards for workers, the environment and public health.
While the majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, stopped short today of saying that he would vote against the agreement in its current form, his criticisms foreshadowed what will probably be a bitter debate on the campaign trail and raised questions about the agreement's prospects when lawmakers vote on it early next year. 
 Last year, Mr. Gephardt gave the Administration critical support when he backed the opening of trade negotiations with Mexico and Canada. The House then narrowly approved an Administration request to be allowed to submit the trade agreement to Congress for expedited consideration with no amendments allowed.
But today Mr. Gephardt, who has access to confidential texts from the negotiations, criticized the agreement in a speech here to members of the Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research group. "As the agreement moves toward completion, it is becoming increasingly clear that environmental controls, worker adjustment policies, protections for American and Mexican workers and the incentives for American manufacturers to remain in the United States are being omitted from the draft," he said.
 
Approval From Clinton
 Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, has been a more enthusiastic supporter of the negotiations than Mr. Gephardt, but said in a statement today that he approved of Mr. Gephardt's efforts to press the Administration. "We must sign a pro-growth, pro-jobs treaty with Mexico that does not sell out our workers or our environment," he said.
While Mr. Gephardt said that he supported the idea of a free-trade agreement, he added that he did not like the way the Administration was going about it. In so doing, he essentially laid out a way for Mr. Clinton and other Democrats to criticize the agreement while still supporting free-trade principles. This strategy could allow Democrats to woo blue-collar workers without drawing too much criticism from free-traders, including many prominent business executives.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said late this afternoon that it was premature to judge how the agreement would affect workers and the environment because many details remain unsettled. She also said that it "seems unlikely" that an agreement will be signed before the November elections.
By law, the trade agreement cannot be signed until 90 days after Congress has received copies of a final draft agreement and reports on it from 40 private sector advisory groups, which could take several weeks.
But the actual signing of the agreement will be a formality. What counts politically, Democrats and Republicans agree, is having a final draft agreement to praise or criticize in the campaign. Some officials in President Bush's campaign, in fact, hope that a draft agreement can be reached before the Republican National Convention begins Aug. 17 in Houston. Texas has many Mexican-American voters and is considered by many economists to be the state that could benefit most from the prosperity that a free-trade agreement could give to Mexico.
But Mrs. Hills declined again today to say when an agreement would be struck, saying that this would depend on when the remaining disputes can be worked out. Officials close to the negotiations said today, however, that considerable progress in recent days, most notably on agricultural issues.
 
Calls for a Better Agreement
 Echoing Mr. Gephardt's comments, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the trade law-writing Finance Committee, and Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade, separately called on the Administration today to seek a better agreement. But Mr. Bentsen urged that a good agreement be reached as soon as possible.
Mr. Gephardt called today for a border tax on trade with Mexico to pay for retraining of United States workers who lose their jobs and for greater environmental protection measures and the development of drinking water and sewage systems in both countries.
Unions and some environmental groups have made similar points. Mr. Gephardt, who ran for President in 1988 on a platform that emphasized a more confrontational trade policy, antagonized many of his backers in organized labor last year when he suddenly supported the opening of negotiations. His comments today appeared to be aimed at winning back more of their support.
People involved in the negotiations said the idea of a border tax on trade had been discussed casually but had never been seriously considered. Mrs. Hills dismissed the idea today as "simply a tax on trade and it doesn't make any sense."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Candidates' Records;
Four Years of Bush's Drug War: New Funds but an Old Strategy

SERIES: The Bush Record -- Eighth article of a series.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
No American President has come to office with more experience in trying to hold back the tide of drugs than George Bush.
As Director of Central Intelligence under President Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Bush monitored the drug threat worldwide. As Ronald Reagan's Vice President, he led the Administration's anti-drug campaign, often climbing aboard powerful chase boats and helicopters as agents patrolled the Florida coast in the first concerted Federal effort to halt the surging tide of cocaine. 
 Yet when he designed his own anti-drug strategy, his critics say, Mr. Bush seems to have ignored much of what he learned. Since taking office, Mr. Bush has poured more and more money into tactics that over the last 20 years have repeatedly failed to change the course of the campaign against drugs: trying to stop drugs at the borders, cajoling and threatening drug-producing nations and jailing thousands of Americans for ever longer terms.
 
Opting for the Visible
 Mr. Bush has often spoken of the value of education, treatment and prevention programs to staunch the desire for drugs. But disregarding the near-unanimous advice of independent experts as well as some on the White House staff who say these are the most effective weapons, Mr. Bush has consistently subordinated health and education to law enforcement. These tactics have sometimes produced quick, visible and politically useful results -- most spectacularly, the seizure of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in the 1989 invasion of Panama and bringing him to the United States to stand trial on drug charges -- but the benefits have usually been ephemeral at best.
"Reducing the demand for drugs through treatment and education is the most efficient and effective way to address the drug problem," argues Eric E. Sterling, a drug expert who heads the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington, offering the common wisdom in the field. "This is where the most progress has been made so far. Enforcement has had little effect on the supply or the use of drugs."
Since Mr. Bush took office with a pledge, as he put it in his Inaugural Address, to end "this scourge," the Federal anti-drug budget, including the money spent on education and treatment, has doubled, to almost $12 billion this fiscal year. Still, more than two-thirds of that has been dedicated to enforcement, a ratio little changed from the Reagan years, when most experts argued that America was losing the battle.
"We're recommending dollars for each area of activity in which we will be able to achieve a net gain," Bob Martinez, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and President Bush's top aide on drugs, said in a recent interview. The Federal Government, he added, is in the best position to combat drugs overseas and at the borders, while much of the cost for treatment and education should be borne by cities and states.
Mr. Martinez said the decline in drug use among young people and the middle class proves that the Administration's approach is working.
In fact, during Mr. Bush's first two years in office, the casual use of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs did continue a decline among teen-agers and the middle class, a trend that began in the late 1980's. But in the last half of his term the downturn in middle-class use appears to have stalled.
At the same time, drug use appears to be rising in the gritty inner-city neighborhoods where addiction problems are most severe and where much of the drug-driven crime originates, menacing all of society.
Evidence of that was clear on a recent afternoon in the impoverished north side of St. Louis, one battlefield in what President Bush calls the war on drugs.
 
Like Predatory Birds
 On this hot, moist day, hardly anyone was moving on the streets. But like gaunt, predatory birds, little groups of cocaine and heroin dealers lounged on the shady stoops of burned-out buildings, hoping for a breeze and for their first customers of the day.
In the front yard of one broken-down crack house, a 32-year-old dealer stepped away from a sizzling picnic grill. The crack dealer, who identified himself as John C., is one of the prime targets in the drug war. But he doesn't see himself as an enemy of the President -- more a witness, observing and being swept along by powerful forces he does not control. Twice he's been arrested, and each time he has returned to selling crack. The authorities have their job, he says; he has his. At best, it's a stalemate.
"They're not winning the drug war," he argued. "There's never a shortage of cocaine in this city. They could lock up a thousand brothers, even 10,000 brothers. There's always going to be someone new out here selling."
One big reason, he explained, is that "there's nothing else to do: No type of recreation, no work, nothing."
The crack dealer could have been talking about New York or Detroit or almost any big city. Here in St. Louis, as in many other cities, growing numbers of people have been staggering into emergency rooms suffering from adverse reactions to cocaine.
This is a sharp reversal of the downward trend in drug-related health emergencies that started nine months after Mr. Bush took office. Across the nation, emergency room statistics, often regarded as a barometer of drug use, are worse now than when the President launched the most expensive anti-drug crusade in American history almost four years ago, grabbing the issue when public opinion surveys showed an extraordinary level of national concern.
 
New Drugs, New Problems
 There are other discouraging signs, as well. At the pale brick St. Louis Regional Medical Center, the local hospital with the highest percentage of patients on welfare, the births of premature and brain-damaged infants to mothers who are using cocaine -- often referred to as "crack babies" -- have more than quadrupled in the last year, to between 20 and 30 a month.
And, as in several other cities, researchers in St. Louis say a new generation is being hooked on a potent blend of heroin that is inhaled like powdered cocaine.
"You find a lot of the crack dealers and other young guys, 16 and 17 years old, hanging out on the streets, snorting heroin today," said Dietrich Smith, a researcher in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri campus in St. Louis.
 
Philosophy
Bush Helps Spur Attitude Change
 While President Bush doubled anti-drug spending as financing for some other domestic programs lagged, perhaps his greatest contribution, critics and supporters say, has been to help change the attitude that cocaine and some other drugs were an exquisite part of the Good Life -- exciting, sexy, stylish and probably not all that harmful, an idea that flourished in the 1970's and well into the 80's.
As Vice President, during the '88 campaign and early in his Presidency, Mr. Bush hammered away at the evils of drugs. Almost immediately after taking office, President Bush appointed William J. Bennett, a former Secretary of Education and a combative orator, as the head of the newly created Office of National Drug Control Policy. As the President's chief spokesman on drugs, Mr. Bennett seemed to be in the newspapers and on television almost every day preaching the gospel. On Sept. 5, 1989, after eight months in office, Mr. Bush devoted his first prime-time television address to the drug problem, declaring, as he held a package of crack before the cameras, that it was "the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades."
By then, though, Federal surveys showed that middle-class sentiment had already begun to shift. One bellwether event had been the cocaine death of the University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias in 1986.
In 1985 Federal surveys showed that 12.2 million people were using cocaine at least occasionally. By 1988 the number had dropped to 8.2 million as the anti-drug message and personal experiences demonstrating the drug's fragile balance between euphoria and destruction had begun mounting. In this sense, cocaine was following a long sociological pattern: when seemingly benign drugs come to be seen as monstrosities, attraction begins turning to revulsion. And so cocaine began to lose its following.
But as the cocaine epidemic began to abate, and events including the recession and the Persian Gulf war captured the public's interest, the President turned his attention to other issues.
Now, present and former Administration officials say, the evidence of failure in the cities and the continued use of cocaine at relatively high levels even among the middle class have begun to make the issue look like a liability.
 
'Down in the Trenches'
 Mr. Martinez, a former Florida governor and friend of the Bush family, says the President is "personally committed, down in the trenches on this one." The proof of that, said John P. Walters, a deputy to Mr. Martinez, is that "he's put his money behind this."
Indeed, no President has even come close to Mr. Bush's anti-drug spending. But critics in Congress argue that much of the money has been wasted. For example, $2.2 billion is being spent this year to stop the flood of cocaine and heroin into this country. Another three-quarters of a billion is for operations to stop drug production and trafficking in foreign countries -- an idea that Administration strategists decided had not received adequate emphasis.
Still, each year farmers in Latin America and Asia have been producing ever larger crops of coca and opium, and smugglers daily dart through the ever-more elaborate American mazes of patrol boats, planes and electronic barriers.
[And in perhaps the most frustrating setback for law enforcement, Pablo Escobar, thought to be of the world's most powerful drug traffickers, escaped last week from the resort-like Colombian prison where he had been held for a year. Having sought unsuccessfully to extradite him for trial in the United States, the Administration had been counting, at the least, on Mr. Escobar's serving a long prison term in Colombia.]
Mr. Walters attributes a recent rise in the wholesale price of cocaine to the efforts offshore and at the borders. But he acknowledges that the drug remains in abundant supply throughout the United States.
 
Priorities
Enforcement Put Before Treatment
 The Bush strategy divides spending into three categories: offshore law enforcement, domestic law enforcement and the reduction of domestic demand through education and treatment. But most drug experts say that formula actually amounts to a two-way split -- with education and treatment getting the short end.
When Mr. Bush doubled his anti-drug budget, spending for treatment nearly doubled with it, to $1.9 billion this year. But that left the nation with programs to treat less than a third of the estimated six million heavy drug users. Mr. Martinez argues that the gap is not so great as it seems because, by his estimate, a quarter of the addicts would not accept treatment, and another quarter would be able to get off drugs on their own. But private drug experts say no one can predict how many people would accept treatment until it is available to anyone who wants it.
For now, even police chiefs think more money ought to go into treatment and education. In St. Louis, as in many cities, about half those arrested for all manner of felonies have been using drugs. And Police Chief Clarence Harmon says he is fighting a holding action.
"Part of the problem," he said, "is that we don't have many treatment facilities. I'm told by people on the corrections side that a number of people want to be treated, but there aren't enough facilities. With more treatment and job training and other alternatives we could see a dramatic lowering of the crime rates."
Representative John Conyers, the Detroit Democrat who heads the House Committee on Government Operations which monitors the drug policy office, charges that the President has opted for "the political rather than the scientific approach."But Mr. Conyers said the President was not the only victim of political pressure.
"Drug education and treatment have gained a name as a wimp activity," he said. "If you favor these things, you're a softy."
As deputy director of the National Drug Policy Office until he left last fall, Dr. Herbert D. Kleber lobbied to have financing for treatment and education increased by nearly $1 billion. He failed and blames the President and Congress alike.
"Treatment is a bipartisan failure," said Dr. Kleber, who is now in charge of substance abuse programs at the Columbia University Medical School. "Clearly, if the President would stake his reputation and say, 'I'm determined to spend 'X' million on treatment,' it would make it much harder for Congress to turn him down. Conversely, if Congress said, 'We're going to embarrass the President, we're going to spend $500 million on treatment,' it would be hard for him not to go along."
 
Statistics
Some Changes, Some Constants
 In 1990, a Federal survey of American households showed that 6.2 million Americans had used cocaine at least once that year, down from 8.2 million in 1988 and 12 million at its peak a few years earlier. The same survey indicated that 662,000 Americans had used cocaine at least once a week, down from 862,000 in 1988.
The most recent survey, published in late 1991, showed 6.4 million Americans using cocaine at least once during the year and 654,000 using it at least weekly. Given the survey's margin of error, Federal statisticians said, the 1991 results reflected no change in middle-class cocaine use.
The survey estimates that at least occasional crack use has been steady at one million Americans since data on the drug were first collected in 1988. At the same time, emergency room incidents attributable to cocaine rose 25 percent in the first three quarters of 1991, the latest period for which data are available. The number of heroin incidents increased by 7 percent.
Here in St. Louis, Dr. Corinne Walentik, chief of the neonatology department at the regional medical center, said she is is seeing many mothers in their 20's who are newcomers to cocaine. They've given birth to one or two children, free of drugs.
"But they come back for another delivery," she added, "and the kids test positive for cocaine." With too few treatment facilities or other alternatives, "they're an easy victim for the local pusher."
 
Realities
Dealer and User: Life on the Edge
 While the north side St. Louis crack dealer was talking about his life, reggae music and soft rock drifted from a backyard gathering down the block -- a wake for the victims of a gang killing. Outside the house, four boys were shooting baskets.
"Two of those guys are dealers," the dealer said. He lifted his chin toward a handful of teen-agers in the next yard and said, "They're in the business, too."
In many ways, this dealer epitomizes the heavy cocaine user who is becoming the dominant figure in the nation's drug problem. He lives on the edge. He is not quite homeless; he sleeps in the crack house. But crack keeps him frantic.
He said he clears $800 or $900 a week from his drug sales. But he smokes most of it up. He has no savings and no clear idea what he'll be doing tomorrow, except looking for crack. "I could stop," he said. "But I just don't feel like it. I like the feeling I get. I feel spaced out, like a zombie. It's that way for a lot of people. This war on drugs, they might as well forget about that. It a lot worse than they think."
 
The Series So Far
 This series began June 25 with an interview with President Bush and an article assessing his record as leader. Other articles evaluated the President's record on issues including foreign affairs, the economy, education, judicial appointments and American policy toward Iraq. The most recent article, on his environmental record, appeared July 4.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
CLINTON ATTACKED ON FOREIGN POLICY

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEENAH, Wis., July 27

 BODY:
President Bush and his advisers today confronted Gov. Bill Clinton head on for the first time on foreign policy, opening the new front by calling his ideas on the crisis in Bosnia reckless and painting Mr. Bush as the candidate who can be trusted with the nation's security.
Campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan, Mr. Bush hurled threats at President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and talked in hushed tones of receiving late-night phone calls from the White House crisis center to underscore his own foreign policy credentials, which his strategists view as his best card in the 1992 elections. 
 "The American people need to know that the man who answers that phone has the experience, the seasoning, the guts to do the right thing," Mr. Bush said, speaking to workers and Republican supporters in a cookie factory in Wyoming, Mich., from a platform festooned with boxes of sugar wafers, low-fat granola and Rice Krispie bars.
 
Attacking Clinton Statement
 Behind the scenes, Bush aides quickly pounced on a little-noticed policy statement on the former Yugoslavian republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued by Mr. Clinton's office in Little Rock, Ark., to make a direct assault on the Democratic Presidential nominee. The statement called on Mr. Bush to seek United Nations authorization of selective bombing of Serbian targets in Bosnia.
Calling Mr. Clinton's ideas "reckless," Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said they showed that Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, were "a long way from being qualified to lead the country."
Raising doubts about Mr. Clinton's ability to manage foreign policy, a tactic that Mr. Bush used successfully against Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988, has been a latent theme of the Bush campaign for some time. It was an expected part of the more overt attack on Mr. Clinton that began to unfold when Ross Perot dropped out of the race.
But it was not until today that it emerged so strongly into the fore, propelled in part by the opening given to Mr. Bush's staff by Mr. Clinton's statement on Bosnia.
 
Call for 'Real Leadership'
 In the statement that Mr. Clinton issued on Sunday, he called on Mr. Bush to show "real leadership" in the Balkans.
"We should make clear that the economic blockade against Serbia will be tightened, not only on weapons but also on oil and other supplies that sustain the renegade regime of Slobodan Milosevic," he said. "European and U.S. naval forces in the Adriatic should be given authority by the U.N. to stop and search ships that might be carrying contraband headed for Serbia and her ally, Montenegro."
Mr. Clinton called for international action to charge President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and others "with crimes against humanity under international law -- as we should have done long ago in the case of Iraq."
"The continuing attacks by Serbian elements in Bosnia threaten the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian aid, jeopardize the safety of U.N. personnel and put at risk the lives of thousands of citizens," the Democratic nominee said. "The United States should take the lead in seeking U.N. Security Council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort. The United States should be prepared to lend appropriate military support to that operation. Air and naval forces adequate to carry out these operations should be visibly in position."
Commenting on the statement, Mr. Fitzwater said: "It sounds like the kind of reckless approach that indicates he better do some more homework on foreign policy. It's clear he's unaware of the political complications in Yugoslavia."
In response to a reporter's question in San Francisco, Mr. Clinton said he was confused about the Administration's response. "I just don't know what to make of that. I mean, I talked to Senator Gore about it; we are perplexed by it."
In all of his statements about Bosnia, he said, "I tried to be aggressive and forthright.
"Maybe they are on the defensive, but certainly it was not an irresponsible statement. It was a very responsible statement, very well thought out."
Mr. Gore, campaigning in Atlanta, was more critical. "Bush and Quayle have nothing to offer except more of the same," he said. "They're in extreme political panic and so they're reaching for anything they can."
The Clinton statement on Bosnia and Herzegovina was sent to the offices of news organizations on Sunday from the nominee's headquarters in Little Rock, but it was not circulated to the reporters who travel with Mr. Clinton because of a series of miscues, campaign aides said.
Mr. Bush himself did not mention the Clinton statement and Mr. Fitzwater's initial remarks came in response to a question from a reporter. It remains to be seen how long the Bush team plans to keep up the assault, since it is acutely aware that economics, not foreign policy, is the centerpiece of this campaign. But at least for today, Mr. Fitzwater eagerly seized on Mr. Clinton's comments and repeated his condemnation at every opportunity.
At each of Mr. Bush's two stops, campaign surrogates pressed the attack on Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness. In Wyoming, Mich., near Grand Rapids, Gov. John Engler called Mr. Clinton too "untried and untested" to be President. And here in Neenah, about 40 miles south of Green Bay, at a factory that makes baseball cards, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson shouted, "If someone asks you to take a trip around the world, why would you put your faith in someone who has never left the South?"
Speaking in Cincinnati today, Vice President Dan Quayle, also emphasized the Bush Administration's record in foreign affairs. He told the National Conference of State Legislatures that Mr. Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, deserved the credit for the breakup of the Soviet Union, the fall of Communism and the end of the nuclear arms race. "Where should much of the credit go for the peace we now take as a given?" Mr. Quayle said. "To the man at the top."
It also was a day for Mr. Bush to finally sign onto the new populism of the 1992 campaign. Speaking at the Holland American Wafer Company plant in Michigan and the Outlook Graphics plant here, Mr. Bush unveiled a new slogan -- "Trust the People" -- to go along with his argument that the people should trust him.
"I believe the time has come to put the trust in the people," Mr. Bush declared. Borrowing the slogan of the Democratic National Convention, he said, "They say they want to put people first, but if you look real close at what they're proposing, the people they put first are all on the government payroll."
 
The Issue of 'Trust'
 In Neenah, Mr. Bush added, "And I stand with the flag-waving, yes, and the God-fearing, yes, and the tax-paying people of America."
But even in this, he returned to "trust," a word he used 20 times in a 20-minute speech. "To lead a great nation, you must first trust the people you lead," Mr. Bush said.
He added: "Many times in the White House late at night, the phone rings and usually it's some young aide double-checking on the next day's schedule. But occasionally it's another voice, more serious, more solemn, carrying news of a coup in a powerful country, or asking how we should stand up to the Baghdad bully halfway around the world."

HEADLINE: Dime Savings Loses Ruling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Dime Savings Bank, one of the largest landlords in Massachusetts as a result of recently defaulted mortgage loans, was told yesterday by a Massachusetts court that eviction of tenants would require a more time-consuming procedure than it had been using.
The ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said "summary process" proceedings through the Land Court system were the appropriate way to evict tenants because they gave tenants and owners a fair hearing. Dime and some other banks in the state had favored a "trespass action" technique, under which a tenant could be evicted after an order was obtained from the state's Superior Court.
 
 Dime stopped using the "trespass action" approach in March, after the practice was challenged by the state's Attorney General, Scott Harshbarger. David Totaro, a spokesman for Dime, said the ruling yesterday would not be appealed.
About $55 million, or 23 percent, of Dime's $235 million of mortgage loans in Massachusetts are in default, resulting in heavy losses. Dime has been trying to evict tenants from houses and apartment buildings for which loans are in default, because it is easier to sell the buildings empty.
Dime contended that it had not made any families homeless and that it was offering to pay tenants up to $5,000 as well as moving expenses.

Dime Posts a Profit
By Bloomberg Business News -- The Dime Savings Bank reported a second-quarter profit yesterday of $8.6 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with a loss of $37.1 million a year earlier. It cited higher net interest income, cost reductions, sales of assets and more income from fees.
Net interest income rose more than 14 percent, to $72.9 million from $63.9 million. Interest rate margins were 3.26 percent, up from 2.52 percent. The company's provision for possible loan losses was $20.6 million, down from $55 million.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Budget;
Tsongas and Rudman Lead Drive to Confront the Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Senator Warren B. Rudman, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas and former Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson are forming a bipartisan coalition that they hope will force this year's Presidential candidates and other politicians to address the Federal budget deficit head on.
In interviews, they said they planned to raise at least $1 million and form chapters around the country that would bring public pressure to bear on politicians to make the difficult tax and spending decisions necessary to get the deficit under control. 
 Mr. Peterson, who was Commerce Secretary in the Nixon Administration and is now an investment banker in New York, said the coalition would offer its prescription in September for cutting spending, raising taxes and revamping the budget to place greater emphasis on long-term investment.
The coalition's founders hope this will be a milepost against which the economic plans of President Bush and the Democratic Presidential nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton, can be measured.
 
Presidential Rivals' Stands
 So far, Mr. Bush has suggested that the deficit can be brought under control without tax increases and largely through a vaguely defined ceiling on what he calls "mandatory spending" for programs like Medicare. Mr. Clinton has proposed reductions in military spending and tax increases on the wealthy but has suggested little that would require sacrifice from most Americans.
"If you think of Congress and the President as a weather vane," said Mr. Tsongas, who ran an unsuccessful take-the-bitter-medicine campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination this year, "then the function of our organization is to change the direction of the wind."
Mr. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, decided not to seek re-election to the Senate this year, saying he was frustrated over the inability of politics to resolve the country's biggest problems.
The formation of the coalition was first reported Sunday in a syndicated column by David S. Broder of The Washington Post.
Mr. Tsongas said today that his group was talking about many of the same deep spending cuts and steep tax increases that Ross Perot is advocating, as outlined in an article in the current issue of U.S. News & World Report. While the coalition will not seek money or support from Mr. Perot, Mr. Tsongas said, many former Perot supporters are joining the coalition's cause.
Mr. Peterson said he envisioned a "political counterforce" to persuade politicians that voters would be willing to sacrifice for the common good if the sacrifice was spread equitably.
Over the years, Mr. Rudman, Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Peterson have often addressed the deficit from different perspectives. Whether they can reconcile their views remains to be seen.
Mr. Rudman, a chief sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law, has stressed rigid spending limits without tax increases. Mr. Tsongas in his campaign favored a much higher gasoline tax but opposed income tax increases on the middle class and said little about controlling spending on such popular programs as Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Peterson has advocated reducing allocations for the elderly and a national sales tax.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Resists Being Labeled a Liberal

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, July 27

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton told members of the National Urban League today that Republican efforts to characterize the Democratic Presidential ticket as liberal were a "load of bull we've been paralyzed with for too long."
Mr. Clinton, who spent the weekend traveling in California and Washington state in search of support from voters who backed President Bush in 1988 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984, preached a message of self-sufficiency and fiscal conservatism that he said should appeal to traditional Democratic constituencies as well. 
 Sensing that California may be a prize within reach this year, Mr. Clinton has pounded home a message of change that he said today cut across lines of race, class and party.
In his Western swing, Mr. Clinton has not been going out of his way to challenge his audiences with messages that they might find in conflict with their view. Rather, he is trying to persuade diverse groups that his new brand of Democratic politics can be palatable to them all.
"I don't find I have to tailor the message," he said this morning as he returned from an early beachfront jog. "I think most people want the same things."
 
Battle of Ideas
 At the Urban League, he told members of the largely black audience that their goal of increasing spending in urban areas could be accomplished through the economic plan he had proposed.
"Your plan and my plan -- let us be clear -- do not involve liberal versus conservative, left versus right, big government versus little government," he said. "That's a load of bull we've been paralyzed with for too long. Your plan and my plan are about big ideas versus old ideas."
Asserting that both efforts could transcend traditional labels, he inserted the word "change" repeatedly in the speech, which lasted nearly an hour.
"You know, sometimes you've got to change just to survive," he said, as the crowd murmured in assent. "Change is the law of life. Change is necessary to preserve our basic values. Change today is the order not just for people who think of themselves as liberal -- that is, open and reaching out and inclusive -- but for people who think of themselves as conservatives.
"How can you conserve the basic values, how can you conserve the fabric of your life if you do not have the courage to change when what you're doing is tearing the heart out of your country?"
 
Sharper Attacks on Bush
 Mr. Clinton was warmly received today, as he has been on stops throughout the West that have attracted tens of thousands of newly curious voters to rallies at riverfront parks and city squares. In a reformulated version of his convention speech, he has expanded his comments to talk about the concerns of the environment, American Indians and AIDS sufferers.
As he has traveled, his attacks on President Bush have also become more harsh. Today, he derided the President's "little surrogates," members of the Administration who have been denouncing Mr. Clinton as "the failed Governor of a small state."
"People try to put on yesterday's broken record that sticks in the same old place in the song," he said at the Urban League. "Tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend.
"And then they have their handlers push the arm a little further," he added. "It sticks again and goes, 'Liberal, liberal, liberal.'
"This fellow is amazing," Mr. Clinton said. "He wants to blame me for everything that happened to Arkansas and doesn't want to take responsibility for anything that happened in the United States of America."
 
New Look at Clinton
 Mr. Clinton is clearly getting a second look from many of those in the crowds who wait hours to see him. And the candidate seems to realize that for the first time. At a televised "town meeting" today at a computer firm in the high-technology region southeast of San Francisco, Mr. Clinton said he was trying to persuade voters to reject "the failed categories" of politics.
"You can feel it for the first time in 12 years," said Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle, when 10,000 people appeared for a downtown rally earlier this week. "There's excitement in the air. People who have given up on politics are coming back."
Some of this optimism can be attributed to the slightly giddy excitement of Democratic elected officials who have been buoyed by recent public opinion polls. But among the people who come to hear Mr. Clinton, there seems to be a more concentrated effort to listen to what the Democrat is saying.
At question-and-answer sessions, he is asked about everything from the health of the timber industry to police brutality. Aside from questions from reporters, he is seldom asked about foreign policy.
"I was a Tsongas person," said Susan Nelson, a ninth-grade teacher who is a Democratic precinct chairwoman from Seattle. "I agreed more with his positions on his economic plan. Clinton, I certainly would vote for him. He's certainly better than Bush."
Mr. Clinton appeals to these voters by offering, again and again, a message of compromise on the environment, economic growth, labor interests and abortion rights.
"My belief is -- this may sound naive but it grows out of my own experience -- that if you let people who are genuinely affected by decisions sit down in groups where all their interests are represented and try to hammer out solutions, you can almost always get a compromise that most people agree is the right thing," Mr. Clinton told a television audience in Seattle and Portland, Ore. "I don't believe there are very many people who want to squander the environment of this country. I don't think there are that many people who want to shut the economy down."
At the core of Mr. Clinton's platform of compromise is the certainty that he can persuade American voters that he represents everything they want in government. For independent-thinking Westerners especially, this has been presented as a candidacy that would guarantee new freedom from government intervention.
"People don't want to have their chain pulled by somebody else," Mr. Clinton said in Spokane. "They want to tote their own load."
In his speech to the Urban League, Mr. Clinton recalled his own roots as someone who was reared in the segregated South, in part by grandparents who taught him that racial separation was wrong.
"The first thing we'll have to do is to stop denying our problems and dividing our people," Mr. Clinton said. "Deep in their hearts, people long to believe but hearts have been broken before."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Jesse Jackson;
Mississippi Trip Offers Jackson Campaign Role

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWOOD, Miss., July 26

 BODY:
Artie Armstrong was 14 years old when he tagged along with his father in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1983 voter registration "crusade" in the South, an effort that led to the civil rights leader's first run for the Democratic Presidential nomination a year later.
"I'm a product of that 1983 crusade," said Mr. Armstrong, now 23 and running in the Democratic primary on Aug. 4 to represent a newly drawn state legislative district in a mostly black area of Jackson, Miss. "It got me interested in politics, and now he has come back to help us again." 
 Such views were echoed throughout Mr. Jackson's two-day, six-city Mississippi swing as he urged people to register and vote in what could be a crucial primary for blacks and Democrats in this state. At stake, said black leaders here, is a chance to win as many as half the seats in the State House of Representatives and State Senate in the aftermath of the redistricting that followed the 1990 census.
Speaking in places like the steamy gymnasium at Mary Holmes Community College in West Point this morning, or the crowded sanctuary of the New Zion Baptist Church here this afternoon, Mr. Jackson peppered his calls for a large turnout with jabs at the Bush Administration and support for the top of the Democratic ticket, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee.
 
Core of Democratic Support
 Frequently, Mr. Jackson's tack was to link the Democratic Presidential and Vice-Presidential nominees, both New South politicians who have flourished since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the civil rights movement that has bolstered black political activity in the region.
The effect was twofold. It stressed the bond between the national Democratic ticket and Mr. Jackson's largely black audiences, and it pointedly reminded Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore that those black voters had been part of the core of their support in their home states over the years.
The message, a hint of how Mr. Jackson may campaign for the Democratic ticket this year, was a measured and modified one, he said, largely because he has yet to meet with the Clinton-Gore campaign to discuss strategy. But Mr. Jackson added that with this year providing the best opportunity in the last three elections to put a Democrat in the White House, he saw no need to wait for such a meeting before starting to drum up support in his own way.
Many of his listeners said the message of support, although a bit muted and not the main thrust of Mr. Jackson's comments, could help the Democratic ticket.
 
Jackson as Political Energizer
 "It's early in the campaign, and Jackson is an experienced leader and politician, and I wouldn't expect him to speak prematurely," said Bennie Turner, a West Point lawyer who is running for a State Senate seat in a newly drawn, mostly black district in northeastern Mississippi.
"There is a coolness to politics and politicians generally, and we need someone with the ability and credibility to energize people to get involved," Mr. Turner added. "I don't know anyone who can do that better than Jesse Jackson, and that's got to end up helping Bill Clinton, who is the candidate for change."
When Mr. Jackson spoke of the Democratic ticket he lauded its support for $50 billion a year in urban investment, statehood for the District of Columbia, strong support of public education, welfare reform and cuts in military spending, among other things.
But in interviews, he reserved the right to push the party and the nominees further on many of these issues. Over time, he said, it will be necessary for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore to take stronger stands if they hope to enlist the trust and support of union members and black voters, who are the core of the party.
 
Support for Clinton Plan
 "The ticket has the responsibility and the burden of inspiring people" to support it at the polls, Mr. Jackson said. "Surrogates can aid but the primary burden is on the ticket, and the thing that will attract black and white voters alike is an economic plan." He termed the Clinton plan "a step in the right direction."
Traveling by private plane from town to town on a trip financed by his Rainbow Coalition and local Mississippi groups, Mr. Jackson beamed at the welcoming crowds, warmed instantly to the rostrum-pounding and the chanting style of oratory that he favors, and looked to be a man happily doing what he has been doing for the last 10 years.
At one point he noted that there was no other national figure who made it his business to go out and register voters in out-of-the-way rural areas and embrace the efforts of local candidates.
"People wonder what job I'm going to do this fall," he said. "Well, I have a job -- and this is it."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 3.51 In Mixed Day For Stocks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street closed mixed yesterday, with a lack of conviction erasing early gains by blue-chip stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 3.51 points at 3,282.20. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 164.7 million shares, little changed from 163.9 million on Friday. 
 In the broad market, gaining shares outnumbered losers, 928 to 804.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks dipped 0.06, to 411.54; the American Stock Exchange index was down 0.47 point, to 382.06; the New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.02, to 226.50, and the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues fell 0.88, to 564.73.
 
Declines Overseas
 Analysts noted that the American market gave a surprisingly decent performance yesterday in view of declines overseas, including a 29.2-point slump in London and a 124.45-point loss in Tokyo.
"In view of the pessimism and disappointments in the economy and market, we seem to be able to stay above 3,250, which is an important technical support for the market," said Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, referring to the Dow average.
Analysts said drug stocks provided one of the few areas of investor interest yesterday.
"People are looking around to find those companies with little exposure to the economy," said Marshall Acuff, a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.
 
Disparity With Bonds
 Bond prices surged, pushing long-term interest rates down toward 7.5 percent. The disparity between the direction of stock and bond prices raised some speculation earlier in the session that some asset-allocation changes were being made, but analysts said they heard of no specific actions.
"All in all, it's a case of selective buying on a quiet day," said Alice Sadlo, a first vice president at McDonald & Company. "No one's really in a hurry."
The market started the day on a firm note, with the Dow reaching a high of 3,299 before fading in the afternoon.
Wellcome P.L.C, the British maker of the AIDS drug AZT, topped the Big Board most-active list, ending unchanged at 15 1/4 on about 14 million shares traded. Twenty-five percent of a global offering of 270 million new shares of the company were issued in the United States.
Warner-Lambert rose 1 3/8, to 67 7/8, and Schering-Plough added 1 3/8, to 59 3/8. Salomon Brothers initiated coverage of the drug companies with buy ratings.
 
Outlook for Boeing
 Boeing lost 1/2, to 39 1/4. The aircraft maker said second-half sales and earnings would be lower than the first half because of lower sales.
Royal Appliance, which fell sharply Friday after a disappointing earnings report, rebounded 1 1/8, to 9 7/8.
Horizon Industries rallied 4 7/8, to 13 3/4, after saying it had agreed to be aquired by Mohawk Industries for about $86.5 million in cash and stock. Mohawk rose 1/2, to 14 3/4.
Novell slumped 2, to 52. Traders said Dean Witter cut its rating on the software company to hold from buy.

HEADLINE: Libya Efforts Cause Fines

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Two banks and the Anheuser-Busch Companies paid penalties for violating the United States economic embargo of Libya, the Treasury Department said today.
The department's Office of Foreign Asset Control said the St. Louis brewer paid $25,000 for three attempts to export beer through Malta to offshore Libyan-owned oil rigs. The Bank of New York Company paid a civil penalty of $225,000 to settle 174 violations, including fund transfers to Libya. The New York office of the French bank Credit Lyonnais paid $92,400. 
 In a statement, the office said Bank of New York had paid a reduced penalty "because of the high level of cooperation it demonstrated in voluntarily disclosing the extent of the violations, and in taking steps to insure compliance in the future."
Libya has been under United States economic sanctions since 1986.

HEADLINE: Iraq Is Said to Execute Merchants In a Campaign Against Profiteers

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 27

 BODY:
Faced with growing public discontent over soaring food prices, President Saddam Hussein was reported today to have started executing merchants as part of a stepped-up drive against speculators and profiteers.
Foreign diplomats here say normally reliable Iraqis have reported that seven merchants were hanged in the capital on Sunday after about 600 had been arrested. Those executed were said to have included a member of the Hamra family, one of Baghdad's most prominent merchant families. 
 Some of the arrested merchants were reported to have been displayed in public in various parts of the city on Sunday while passersby were invited to spit at and insult them. No official confirmation of these reports was available in this most secretive of countries.
But Mr. Hussein appeared to allude to the executions on Sunday in a public address denouncing profiteering merchants when he said "the law takes action over the necks of those who do not deserve to live."
 
Relief on U.N. Accord
 Accounts of the new drive against food speculators came as the country heaved a collective sigh of relief in the belief that the danger of a new allied attack had receded after Iraq's agreement in New York on Sunday to allow United Nations inspectors from countries that did not take part in the gulf war to search its Agriculture Ministry.
"I'm relieved because I have two sons in the army," an employee of a foreign embassy said. An Egyptian waiter at a big hotel said: "I really thought the war would start again. I have my bags packed for Cairo."
The dining room of the Alwiyah Club, the smartest gathering spot in Baghdad, was filled with a lively crowd at lunchtime today, although a member said the club had been almost deserted in recent days as rumors of a new attack circulated in the capital.
But hopes that the easing of the confrontation would lead to a sharp fall in food prices, which have jumped in recent days as a result of hoarding brought on by fears of war, were not fulfilled in the market today.
Some prices did move decisively lower. A can of tomato paste that cost the equivalent of about 75 cents on Sunday was selling for 55 cents tonight. But rice, sugar and other staples appeared in very short supply at Baghdad's central market, with merchants apparently preferring not to sell at the prices the authorities want to see.
 
Food Ration 'Is Not Enough'
 "This is what always happens," an Iraqi said. "The Government frightens the shopkeepers, so they do not sell. But that just makes the people more dependent on their Government food ration, which is not enough."
All Iraqis receive a monthly ration of food at very low prices, but many say it is only enough for a couple of weeks at best.
Mr. Hussein blamed Iraqi merchants for the spiraling cost of food in his speech on Sunday during a ceremony in which he presented his top aides with medals for bravery in the "mother of battles," as the Persian Gulf war is called here.

HEADLINE: Chinese Exports Growing At Rapid Rate, C.I.A. Says

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
China is sustaining rapid growth in its industrial output and exports, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's annual report on the country's economy.
China's gross national product increased 7 percent and its industrial output rose 14 percent in 1991 while exports grew 16 percent to nearly $72 billion, the report said. It said preliminary data indicated that the growth rates increased in the first five months of 1992. 
 The C.I.A. said that production had expanded most in local enterprises outside of central control and in private companies and companies with foreign investment. But state-owned enterprises, which dominate key sectors and still produce almost 55 percent of China's industrial goods and services, remain weak, the report said.
One third of these Government-owned enterprises are losing money, contributing heavily to a budget deficit of $12 billion.
The C.I.A. analysis interprets China's latest economic campaign, initiated in January by Deng Xiaoping, as "a license to experiment" that the aged leader hopes to sustain in the face of strong opposition at the 14th Chinese Communist Party congress, scheduled for this fall.
In a presentation today to a subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress, Martin Petersen, deputy director of the C.I.A.'s East Asia analysis office, said the congress "may be the last opportunity for China's elderly leaders to put their imprint on China's future."
Mr. Petersen added that "political factors rather than economic factors are behind Deng's determination to accelerate reform."
He said that efforts to eliminate or modify elements of what had once been a highly centralized command system had varied from region to region. As a result, the analysis suggests, China may develop still sharper disparities from province to province.
The report, based mainly on Chinese statistics, says the high growth rates fostered by market-oriented policies could boost inflation and broaden China's trade imbalance with key partners, including the United States.

HEADLINE: States' Strained Finances Reveal Recession's Toll

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
States are in worse fiscal condition than they were after any of the five previous national recessions, and, in a broad new survey by state legislatures, they report that the 1993 fiscal year looks bleak.
While the states' troubles with rising obligations and dwindling incomes have been closely tracked by fiscal experts in the recession who say the study suggests that further strains were placed on budgets in the last year by legislators torn between making tough budget choices and pleasing disgusted voters. 
 The experts say legislators, who in most states are up for re-election, cut deeply into spending programs for the 1993 fiscal year to try to avoid raising taxes in the midst of their campaigns. And when they were not able to reduce budget deficits in other ways, officials used an extraordinary number of accounting techniques, like delaying payments or scaling back estimates of what programs will cost, to mask the depth of their problems.
"I heard some legislative leaders say that their budgets were put together with chewing gum and baling wire, and that applies to most state budgets this year," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "I'm sure, we won't hear much about emerging imbalances until after the elections in November, and then it appears that newly elected governors and legislators are going to face serious budget troubles."
 
A Grim Overall Picture
 The study, released this weekend by the National Conference of State Legislatures, found that California and Northeastern states were in the worst fiscal condition. It also said that the Southeast was showing some sign of recovery and that the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions appeared to have the strongest economies.
The survey, which gave a preliminary view of the fiscal picture of 47 states, painted a grim overall picture of their finances. When the survey was compiled, in June, not all 50 states had completed their budgets.
The survey found that most states made cuts in virtually all areas except for Medicaid and welfare programs. At the same time that lawmakers were cutting expenses and expecting negligible growth in revenue, they included in their budgets overly optimistic assumptions about the cost of welfare and health programs, setting the stage for serious fiscal problems later in the year.
"States are once again betting on a slow increase in the costs of Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, but states have a record of consistently, year in and year out, understating how much these costs will grow," said Ronald K. Snell, the fiscal program director of the national conference who is an author of the survey.
 
Local Spending Is Cut
 David H. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago and an expert on state and local government finances, said, "The magnitude of this recession has hit the states hard."
Mr. Hale said that state and city spending, a barometer of fiscal health, grew by only 0.7 percent last year, or far less than the 2.7 percent average growth in spending in the first year after each of the five previous national recessions since 1960.
Over the first three years of the decade, when the recession put increasing pressure on the states, he said, spending fell and taxes rose as state and local governments tried to deal with operating deficits. Those amounted to $38 billion in 1990, $35 billion in 1991 and $12 billion in 1992. Deficits of $11 billion are projected for 1993.
 
Draining Money
 Coping with these deficits deepened, by a very small degree, the national recession by draining about $100 billion out of the nation's $5 trillion-a-year economy, Mr. Hale said.
One surprise in the study of 1993 budgets was the finding that despite announcements of lay-offs of state and municipal employees in recent years and reductions in state and municipal spending in the recession, statistics showed moderate, but sustained growth in these areas. State and municipal employment reached record highs in June, and state and municipal spending reached record highs in the first quarter of 1992.
"States and cities are moving ahead like turtles, and are not falling like rocks, which is the impression most people have," said Mr. Gold at the Rockefeller Institute.
Tax increases will amount to $5.4 billion in the coming fiscal year, or about one-third of last year's increase, which was the largest in about 15 years. Most of these new taxes are temporary surcharges or taxes on companies and individuals that supply health care, which do not directly affect individual taxpayers.
 
No Tax Increases
 Even California, mired in a fiscal crisis, facing an estimated $11 billion deficit in a $47 billion budget and running four weeks late in enacting a budget, is not considering a tax increase. Part of the reason is politics, and part of the reason is that California -- and other states, to a much lesser extent -- have apparently reached the point of diminishing returns with sales and income taxes. Last year California raised taxes by an estimated $6.6 billion, but the economy has sagged so much that in May the state Department of Finance reducted the estimate of what those taxes would yield by about 2o percent, to $5.3 billion.
"Budget officials in California describe their economy as in a free fall," said Marcia A. Howard, research director for the National Association of State Budget Officers. "So it's not just that their taxes are failing to capture economic growth, it's that there is not much economic growth to capture."
In addition, Ms. Howard said, many other states had found their tax structures are outmoded for a service economy. Many, she said, still impose taxes on goods, not services. And most state income taxes fail to capture a sufficiently greater share of high incomes.
The Bank of America in San Francisco on Friday increased pressure on California to resolve its crisis by announcing that after Aug. 5 the bank would join others that no longer honor the state's I.O.U.'s, which were issued to pay employees and creditors.
An analyst with California's Office of Legislative Analysis, Daniel P. Rabovsky, said legislators were hoping to cover part of the deficit with one-time accounting changes, like one adopted last year that reaped $1 billion on paper by simply changing the way sales tax collections were reported. Fiscal monitors, including Wall Street credit rating agencies, object to these techniques because they only postpone difficult decisions about financing programs.
New York, which is chronically late with its budget, prepared it on time in this election year. There were also fewer partisan battles, even though legislators had to deal with a $4.5 billion cash shortage for its new fiscal year, which began April 1. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature dealt with the gap , in part, by delaying a $1 billion reduction in income taxes, increasing tuitions and fees at public universities by $500 million, increasing taxes on health care providers by $1 billion, raising fees for many services and eliminating thousands of state jobs.
The New York State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, a Republican, said in May that the $30.8 billion budget also relied on $1.18 billion in accounting techniques. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, put the figure at $450 million. One technique was to shift the state's weekly Medicaid payments from Wednesdays to Thursdays in a change that pushed a $110 million obligation into the next year.
Connecticut, facing a cash shortage of $1.1 billion this year, balanced its $8.2 billion budget by reducing aid to primary and secondary education programs by $171 million, delaying opening of new prisons or additions, reduced grants to people on state welfare programs, and eliminated 1,800 jobs in state agencies. Connecticut also engaged in some creative accounting, including postponing $60 million in payments to employee pension funds from one fiscal year to the next and by reducing estimates of the cost of Medicaid programs by $130 million this year, according to the state Legislative Office of Fiscal Analysis.
In New Jersey, another state with major fiscal problems, legislators managed to reduce taxes while ultimately balancing the state's $14.6 billion budget. Republicans, who took control of the Legislature last year, rescinded a 1 percent sales tax increase that Gov. Jim Florio had signed into law two years ago. "The key question people are asking is, 'Is the penny savings worth the pain?' " Mr. Florio hassaid..
The Governor said the $608 million loss of revenue, expected to result from reducing the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent, would force lay-offs of 2,000 to 4,000 state employees, eliminate half of the state's property tax rebates, close some state parks and reduce a number of health programs.
New Jersey's budget was balanced, in part, with a reduction of $566 million in payments to state employee pension funds. New Jersey, like many other states that adopted similar methods this year, based its action on a re-valuation of stocks and bonds held by the pension funds. Unions of teachers, police officers, firefighters and other workers challenged the move last week in state court.
The cuts by New Jersey, like those in other states, are having human costs. One person affected is Karen Foster, a 33-year-old homemaker in Edison who lost her health insurance when her husband, Thomas, changed jobs and his new insurer refused to provide coverage for her. As a result of the state budget cuts, Ms. Foster, who suffers from diabetes, kidney failure and heart ailments, said she cannot participate in a prescription plan that would have subsidized her medication and she faces the loss of state financing for her at-home dialysis machine. "That would be devastating," she said. "The hospital is doing fund raisers, or whatever, to help us for now."
Some governors tried to raise taxes this year, but failed to get the idea past legislators. Among them was Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois, a Republican elected in 1990 who had proposed raising $350 million in excise taxes on liquor and tobacco and other fees, but few Democrats and no Republican legislators supported the package.
"This is the third round of cuts, and it's just getting tougher to find areas you can cut without having a major impact on necessary services," he said. Without raising taxes, the new budget eliminates all benefits for 60,000 people on general assistance, a state welfare program, which was reduced last year. The state will also close an unspecified number of state parks and historic sites and eliminate 3,000 jobs, including those of 750 social workers in welfare agencies that serve the emergency needs of families and children.
Even with those severe cuts, the $14 billion budget was not balanced. So Mr. Edgar and the Legislature took some actions like postponing payments on $765 million in fiscal 1993 bills until fiscal 1994, increasing revenue estimates by $90 million and using $20 million in unclaimed lottery winnings, said Dawn Clark Netsch, the State Controller who is a Democrat.
"We're not facing reality," Ms. Netsch said.

Net Off at Mobil and Chevron; 2 Others Post Gains

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 27

 BODY:
Four big oil companies reported mixed earnings results today. The Mobil Corporation said its net income plunged 42.7 percent. The Chevron Corporation reported a decline of 8.9 percent. ARCO said its net income rose 25.6 percent. And the Phillips Petroleum Company reported a sixfold increase.
Like most oil companies that last week announced results for the quarter ended June 30, the four companies posted higher profits in exploration and production activities, with crude oil and natural gas prices modestly higher than in the 1991 quarter. 
 ARCO and Chevron, the two leading gasoline retailers on the West Coast, said earnings in their refining operations were much stronger than a year earlier, when steep price cuts squeezed profit margins. The Exxon Corporation said in May that it would sell its gasoline stations in the Los Angeles area. Exxon said last week that its profits had fallen 15.1 percent.
Mobil said that its refining and marketing unit lost money in the United States, and that profits fell in its worldwide refining unit.
"Slow economic growth around the world has depressed demand, and higher crude oil prices have squeezed margins for petroleum and chemical products," said Allen E. Murray, chairman and chief executive of Mobil. "The worldwide economic slowdown has been more severe and of a longer duration than anticipated."
Following are details of the companies' results for the second quarter:
 
Mobil
 Net income for the the nation's second-largest oil company, after Exxon, plunged to $255 million, or 60 cents a share, from $445 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenues for Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., fell 5 percent, to $14.4 billion from $15.2 billion.
Virtually all of the earnings decline came in worldwide refining and marketing operations, where income fell to $25 million, from $279 million a year ago. Refining operations in the United States lost $45 million, in part because of lengthy programs to alter equipment at three big refineries. In contrast, these operations had a profit of $65 million in the 1991 quarter.
Mr. Murray said Mobil slashed its capital spending this year to $4 billion, from $5.4 billion in 1991. He also said Mobil planned asset sales exceeding the $600 million recorded in asset sales last year.
Income for the domestic exploration and production unit rose to $98 million, from $34 million a year earlier, and the international exploration unit, climbed to $223 million from $172 million. Lower drilling expenses and higher crude oil prices were big factors in the improvements.
Mobil's shares fell 75 cents, to $63.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Most oil-company stocks lost ground today after tensions in the Middle East eased when Iraq agreed to demands by the United Nations for military inspections.
 
Chevron
 Net income for the nation's third-largest oil company declined to $350 million, or $1.03 a share, compared with $384 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 9 percent, to $10.6 billion from $9.7 billion.
Excluding one-time gains and losses in both quarters, income from operations for the San Francisco-based company rose 47 percent. Higher prices for natural gas, crude oil, gasoline and other refined products, as well as lower costs, were factors in the higher operating profits.
Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive, said that Chevron had made "good progress" toward its goal of paring costs by 50 cents a barrel, but that special one-time charges related to job cutbacks overshadowed the operating improvements in the quarter.
The San-Francisco based company recorded a charge of $92 million in the quarter, including $36 million for early-retirement incentives accepted by 4,400 workers, and $56 million for severance and relocation expenses that so far include 2,000 job cutbacks.
"We may need to make additional provisions, but we believe the majority of the work-force reduction costs are behind us," Mr. Derr said. The write-offs in the quarter were partly offset by a $64 million gain from foreign exchange transactions.
Income from exploration and production in the United States rose to $128 million, from $70 million a year earlier. Crude prices averaged $17.17 a barrel, up from $16.80 a year ago. Earnings from foreign exploration fell to $172 million, from $213 million a year earlier, when property sales and favorable tax rulings added $80 million to income.
Profits rose to $95 million in domestic refining and marketing, in contrast to a loss of $16 million in the 1991 quarter, but they fell to $55 million abroad in refining and marketing, from $66 million a year earlier.
Chevron's shares fell 12.5 cents, to $68.25, on the Big Board.
 
ARCO
 Net income for the Los Angeles-based company rose to $309 million, or $1.91 a share, from $246 million, or $1.51 a share, in the 1991 quarter. Revenues rose 6 percent, to $4.52 billion from $4.26 billion.
Much of the earnings increase came from a one-time gain of $65 million when the Lyondell Petrochemical Company paid off borrowings that ARCO guaranteed when it sold 50.1 percent of the chemical company in 1989.
Income at ARCO's worldwide exploration and production unit fell slightly, to $143 million in the quarter, from $163 million a year earlier, despite moderately higher oil and natural gas prices. Higher drilling costs and lower output of crude and natural gas pinched profits.
Profits in refining and marketing rose to $103 million, from $85 million a year earlier, which included a $37-million gain from a favorable tax ruling. Bernard J. Picchi, an oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said profit margins for West Coast refiners improved in the quarter, partly because output fell when several refiners conducted lengthy maintenance overhauls.
ARCO's shares fell $1.75, to $109.125, on the Big Board.
 
Phillips Petroleum
 Net income for the company, based in Bartlesville, Okla., rose to $104 million, or 40 cents a share, from $16 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $3.09 billion from $3.25 billion.
C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive, said lower interest expenses and operating costs after 1,350 jobs were pared earlier this year contributed to the sharp profit gains, as did higher crude and natural gas prices.
He added profit margins in refining were "under pressure," suggesting lower profits from that unit in the current quarter.
Profits in worldwide exploration and production rose to $90 million, from $54 million. For gasoline and other refined products, profits soared to $46 million, from $14 million. Profits in natural gas and natural-gas liquids rose to $19 million, from $6 million, but chemical profits fell to $19 million, from $44 million.
Phillips's shares fell 37.5 cents, to $26.625, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall St.'s Doubts on Boeing Grow With Airline Turmoil

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
It dominates its industry worldwide. Its management is highly regarded, its costs are under control and its balance sheet is extremely strong. So why is Wall Street so down on the Boeing Company?
Boeing's shares, after hitting a 52-week peak of $54 in late January, have been sliding steadily. The stock closed yesterday at $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 50 cents, after the company reported flat earnings for the second quarter. Boeing said it earned $453 million, or $1.33 a share, compared with $454 million, or $1.32 a share, in last year's second quarter, when there were more shares outstanding. Revenues rose very slightly, to $7.82 billion from $7.81 billion. 
 At its current stock price, Boeing is trading at its worst price-earnings ratio relative to the overall market in 20 years.
The reason: The sorry state of the airline industry, and the ensuing weakness in orders for new planes, can only mean bad news for Boeing, the premier builder of commercial jetliners.
Although the Seattle-based company's current $100 billion backlog of orders is enough to keep its production lines busy for years, deliveries of new aircraft in the second half of this year are expected to be lower than in the first half -- 27 of its 747's in the second half versus 34 in the first half, for example. As a result, the company said, it expects lower sales and earnings in the second half of the year.
"The stock has become captive to the travails of the airlines," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.
Despite Boeing's dominant market share -- around 55 percent -- the market also clearly has worries about the increasing competition facing the company. Boeing's stock price took a hit earlier this month after United Airlines chose Airbus Industrie to supply it with as many as 100 new medium-range jetliners, breaking Boeing's long lock on United as a customer.
Airbus, which receives financial support from four European Governments, has taken considerable business away from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation over the last decade, and more recently it has set its sights on Boeing.
Most analysts do not think Airbus's victory portends big erosion in Boeing's dominance. Airbus, they said, had extra A320 jets to sell after order cancellations from other airlines and was offering rock-bottom prices to get rid of them.
But they said the United deal suggests how cutthroat pricing can become, as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus chase a level of orders that is probably sufficient to keep only two of them profitable in the long run.
"I do think it's a negative for Boeing and indicative of some very tough times that are going to continue for a while until demand picks up, or the aerospace industry downsizes," Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York, said.
Mr. Cantwell said he downgraded his rating on Boeing from a buy to a neutral on June 30, a week before the United order was announced, because of the weak outlook for new orders from airlines.
"The springtime fare wars insure that the summer travel season is going to be a money-loser for the U.S. airlines, which virtually assures that they will lose money for all of 1992," Mr. Cantwell said. "The economic recovery in Europe is very weak, and that's showing up in very lackluster growth in European air travel, so I see European carriers cutting back. Even the Asia-Pacific market is showing some chinks in the armor because air travel is weakening a little on trans-Pacific routes.
"When you put that all together, there is no relief in sight for the weak order picture," Mr. Cantwell said.
Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities in New York, said investors were focused on the condition of Boeing's customers rather than on the company's ability to ride out a weak market.
"It's hard to envision an environment in the near term in which you would get the kind of order pickup from airlines that would lift the stock," Mr. Demisch said.
"Still, the stock is extraordinarily cheap, particularly given the company's excellent balance sheet, strong management, very good focus and pre-eminent market position," he said. "There aren't many places in U.S. industry that combine those characteristics."
Mr. Nisbet of Prudential Securities, in fact, recently recommended that investors buy Boeing shares aggressively. He noted that every time in the last 20 years that Boeing's stock had become as cheap as it is now -- at its current price-earnings multiple it is trading at a 60 percent discount to the overall market -- it rebounded sharply. Airline earnings are poised for a recovery, Mr. Nisbet said, and the carriers will again begin ordering new planes once they get their balance sheets repaired.
In the meantime, he said, Boeing's spending on research and development, which has been driven up by the company's work on the new 777 jetliner, will peak later this year and decline next year by as much as $400 million, or more than 20 percent, helping future earnings.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Bush's Trampoline Act: Less Bounce This Time

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Four years ago George Bush went to a Republican convention in a hot, steamy city on the Gulf Coast and turned his political fortunes around with a well-written speech that included a memorable phrase -- something about reading his lips.
Next month many of his aides are suggesting, as they read poll after poll showing him trailing Bill Clinton by 2-to-1 margins, that he will repeat his electoral escape act. But the Republicans are meeting in Houston this year, not New Orleans, and the political context is different. The economy is far weaker, the Democrats are far more united, Mr. Bush's approval ratings are far lower than Ronald Reagan's were in 1988. 
 "He's in big trouble and we're all very disturbed, but a great speech at the convention just won't do the trick for him," said Senator John McCain of Arizona, a conservative Republican who faces a tough re-election fight of his own this fall.
"He had a blank slate in 1988, but now that blackboard has writing all over it, and you don't erase that in the minds of the American people with one big speech or one convention. He has to defend his record, emphasize his accomplishments and lay out a fresh program of positive action."
Mr. Bush has done some of that, albeit episodically and often in a half-hearted fashion. Almost plaintively, he has said that Americans should give him at least some of the credit for the end of the cold war, and he has spoken with pride of pushing through legislation to help the disabled, to improve education and to help protect the environment.
But there has been no boldness about the man, none of the spirit of Harry Truman in 1948, daring the opposition to take their best shot, and none of the spirit of Ronald Reagan in 1984, calling on the electorate to continue with him on the road to a nation reborn. Mr. Bush has seemed more like Gerald R. Ford in 1976, weighed down by the Nixon pardon, or like Jimmy Carter in 1980, burdened by the hostages in Teheran.
For President Bush, the albatross is the economy. Its poor performance, combined with the President's espousal of higher taxes despite his promise not to, combined with people's conclusion that the country is on the wrong track, has rendered him highly vulnerable. And like Mr. Ford and Mr. Carter, Mr. Bush has found it hard to get past the subject on which he is weakest.
A man of remarkable physical vigor, he has seemed intellectually and politically listless, somehow passive in the face of great danger.
Sometimes he seems unwilling to take responsibility for his own acts and those of his Administration. If you want an outsider, choose me, he has improbably told the nation. Invoking the buzzword of the year, he casts himself as a spokesman for change, as if Michael S. Dukakis had been President the last four years.
Unable to do very much to change the course of the economy in the three months left before the election, Mr. Bush has concentrated on influencing how people see its present state. He acknowledged a week ago that "a tremendous percentage, 60 percent, think the economy is getting worse," but insisted they were wrong because "the overall national economy is growing." He even tried to sugar-coat the figures showing that unemployment was up again by saying that that always happens in the early stages of a recovery.
The President has had little success as a spin doctor. According to several polls, only a quarter to a third of the electorate believes the economy will get better in the year ahead. Inconveniently for Mr. Bush, the pessimism is strongest on the West Coast and in the Northeast, two regions with weak economies and large numbers of electoral votes.
Some Republicans think the answer lies in changing the No. 2 man on the ticket to send an unmistakable message that thigs are going to change, but Vice President Dan Quayle insists that has been ruled out. Some think that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will make things hum as soon as he makes his expected switch from diplomacy to politics next month.
Some, finally, think that the answer lies in unrelenting attacks on Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore. But Mr. Bush's two most successful attack coordinators, Roger Ailes and the late Lee Atwater, are absent from this year's campaign, and negative politics may not work so well in a year when voters seem to be more interested in substantive answers than in mud-wrestling.
"We cannot, in my view, go to the American people and simply attack Democrats as big 'L' liberals and big spenders and big taxers without making our case that we would do things differently," Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp warned over the weekend.
No one expects Mr. Clinton's lead to hold up until Nov. 3. But even the Republicans, who only a few months ago were talking about their lock on the Electoral College, now consider Mr. Bush the underdog. And it seems possible, if by no means yet probable, that 1992 may prove to be one of those pivotal years in American politics, like 1912, when Woodrow Wilson won a three-way race, and 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won the first of four terms, and 1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower won the first of two.
Each time, a long partisan reign came to an end in a landslide.

HEADLINE: George L. Mehren Is Dead at 79; Ex-Official in Agriculture Dept.

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Dr. George L. Mehren, an internationally renowned agricultural economist who served as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died Saturday night at Santa Rose North Hospital in San Antonio. He was 79 years old and lived in San Antonio.
His family said he died of a bone-marrow disease. 
 Dr. Mehren was professor emeritus and former chairman of the department of agricultural economics at the University of California, where he received his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees. He was also chairman of the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics at the university.
He lectured widely at universities abroad and served as a consultant to many foreign governments and the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, a United Nations agency.
A native of Sacramento, Calif., he served as a Navy lieutenant in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he became a director of the Office of Price Stabilization.
 
Work in Food- Stamp Program
 President John F. Kennedy called him to Washington in August 1963 to become Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in charge of marketing and consumer affairs. The Secretary at the time, Orville L. Freeman, believed that the department -- considered the farmer's friend -- should have the consumer in mind, too.
Dr. Mehren worked closely with Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in developing the Food for Peace program and legislation to establish the country's food-stamp program. He also worked on prenatal nutrition and school-breakfast programs to improve the diets of children.
In addition, he was a director of the Commodity Exchange Commission and sat on an advisory panel of the Atomic Energy Commission.
He left the Agriculture Department in 1968 to become executive director of the Agribusiness Council in New York, a group formed to coordinate private and public efforts to address the international food problems. Later, from January 1972 to the end of 1974, he was general manager of Associated Milk Producers in San Antonio, a large dairy-farmers cooperative.
Dr. Mehren is survived by his second wife, the former Ingeborg Gretz Hitchcock of San Antonio and Wiesbaden, Germany, where the family also has a home; two sons, Peter W. of Toronto, and George L. Jr. of Wiesbaden; a daughter, Elizabeth Mehren of Hingham, Mass.; a brother, John of Sacramento; a sister, Garland White of Santa Clara, Calif., and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: Honda to Reduce Output At Auto Plants in Ohio

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 27

 BODY:
Rather than offer cash rebates to entice buyers, Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. will adjust to slower sales by trimming production at its two assembly plants in Ohio.
Honda said today that it would maintain its no-layoff policy. The auto maker will lower production by reducing the speed of assembly lines at plants in Marysville and East Liberty, Ohio, and by using several half-days to train workers rather than build cars. 
 Moreover, Honda said it was not planning to lose the distinction of producing the nation's best-selling car, the Accord. In a closely watched contest, the Ford Taurus is strongly challenging the Accord for the 1992 sales title.
 
 
Taurus Closes the Gap
 "Momentum is building for second-half sales," said Jeff Leestma, a Honda spokesman in Detroit. Through June, Honda had sold 191,684 Accords in this calendar year while Ford had sold 181,189 Tauruses, leading some in the industry to predict that the Taurus might pass the Accord. Last year, the Accord was ahead of the Taurus by 57,000 through the first half and won by 100,000.
Honda's Accord, the nation's best-selling model since 1989, has suffered slower sales this year, as have most cars. But on a relative basis, the Taurus has been gaining. In an automotive market that has been generally sluggish, the Accord and Taurus have encountered stiffer competition from other midsize models, including the new Camry from the Toyota Motor Corporation.
The 6.2 percent cutback in production of Accords and the smaller Civic model reflects, in part, stronger competition from the Detroit-based auto makers. For instance, the General Motors Corporation's Saturn models, which compete with the Civic, have received favorable coverage for their quality and their high ratings in customer satisfaction surveys.
Moreover, some dealers contend that consumers have been saying they would like to be able to buy models from the Big Three as a way of helping the economy, rather than purchase imported cars.
 
 
Emphasizing American Ties
 To counter "Buy American" sentiment, Honda has taken pains to position itself as a United States manufacturer employing American workers. Roger Lambert, a Honda spokesman in Marysville, said that none of Honda's 7,300 assembly-line workers would be laid off as a result of the reduction, which amounts to 27,800 cars over six months and starts in October. Instead, workers will receive additional training during four separate four-hour sessions. Honda also trimmed production earlier this year and during during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Under the new production schedule, Honda will cease building Accords at its East Liberty plant, confining that plant to production of the subcompact Civic.
Since Honda builds roughly 2,000 cars a day, production cuts could be accomplished by simply closing the plant for a few weeks. But under Honda's production philosophy, which is similar to that of other Japanese manufacturers, production is gradually adjusted to meet market conditions in an effort to maintain quality by not breaking the rhythm of the factory operations.
Honda's intention to cut back production was first reported today in Automotive News, an industry trade publication, after an unidentified supplier disclosed that Honda had notified it of the slowdown.
Acknowledging that lower production would have a ripple effect on employment at the auto maker's 250 American supply companies, Mr. Lambert said, "This is a good time for suppliers to become more involved in quality and to work on new-model development at an earlier stage."
 Clearly, Honda has decided for the time being to maintain its policy of forgoing discount sales to daily-rental companies and forgoing factory-sponsored cash rebates. Either fleet sales or rebates might stimulate Accord sales enough to avoid a production slowdown, but those methods would almost certainly depress the model's relatively high resale value. To stimulate sales, Honda has offered incentives to dealers, who may then pass them on to customers.
If Honda lost the prestige of the Accord's best-selling status, it would sting the company, while making Ford very happy. Auto makers have occasionally sold vehicles at small profit margins -- or even at a loss -- to maintain leadership of a market segment, reasoning that the distinction eventually outweighs the cost.
Honda has always maintained that it will not play that game, but it has played up the Accord's best-seller status in its advertising.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Show Price Gains

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of most Treasury securities moved higher, and long-term interest rates fell yesterday in trading that was described as uncharacteristically heavy for a summer Monday.
The move to buy notes and bonds began overnight in Tokyo, as dealers began to buy securities after the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate by half a point. 
 Prices moved even higher after trading shifted to the United States.
 
Flight From Mortgage Securities
 American dealers said holders of mortgage-backed securities, fearful of prepayment risk, were selling those securities and buying intermediate and long-term notes and bonds. In addition, some accounts sold short-term notes and bought bonds in preparation for auctions today and tommorrow of new two-year and five-year Treasury notes.
"The yield curve has been flattening over the last couple of weeks, and now it extends all the way out to 10-year notes," one government securities trader said. "I guess that is what the Fed and others are actually hopeful will happen."
William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said, "Accounts are extending out the yield curve with a greater level of confidence" than previously.
"People are more confident that the recovery is not going to be robust," he said, "and as a consequence are willing to take advantage of the extremely steep yield curve" by buying long-term notes and bonds.
 
Weak Demand for Bills
 With short-term interest rates at such low levels, Treasury bills are not wildly popular at the moment.
As a result, it is not surprising that demand for new three-month and six-month bills auctioned yesterday was not especially strong.
The new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.18 percent, little changed from the 3.16 percent average rate at last week's auction.
Bids for the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 3.27 percent, compared with a 3.24 percent average rate a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 105 23/32, up 22/32, to yield 7.51 percent, down from 7.56 percent late Friday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 105 30/32, up half a point, to yield 6.66 percent, their lowest level of the year. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 103 1/8, down 1/32, to yield 4.66 percent.
In the when-issued market, the two-year Treasury notes to be auctioned today were offered late yesterday at a price to yield 4.30 percent, up from 4.27 percent late Friday. And the new five-year notes to be auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 5.66 percent, compared with 5.69 percent on Friday.
 
An Issue by Salomon
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Salomon Brothers Inc. offered $250 million worth of seven-year noncallable notes.
The 7 1/8 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, 95 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Charleston County, S.C., priced just under $102 million worth of hospital-facilities and revenue-refunding bonds in a negotiated underwriting led by Paine Webber.
Yields on serial bonds ranged from 2.85 percent on those maturing in 1993 to a maximum of 5.40 percent in 2002. Term bonds carried yields of 6 percent on those maturing in 2009 to 6.022 percent for maturity in 2022.
The issue is insured by MBIA Inc., and is rated triple-A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted bonds rose about 1/4 point in generally listless trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Gold Shows Mixed Results

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower yesterday on world currency markets in typically light summer dealings.
Gold prices were mixed, with gains abroad but declines in the United States. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $357.90 an ounce, down $1.40 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.70, to a late bid of $357.80. 
 Currency trading was quiet, but dealers were disappointed that the dollar could not continue to climb after posting gains late last week. There was little to lend direction to the market. The next batch of statistics on the United States economy is not scheduled for release until later in the week.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm I.D.E.A., said fear of intervention by central banks prevented the dollar from falling very far. Monetary authorities stepped in last week to prop up the dollar.
The Japanese yen was under pressure for most of the session after the Bank of Japan's move overnight to trim the discount rate half a percentage point, to 3.25 percent.
Mr. Chandler said many market participants, who fear the move will not be sufficient to stimulate the Japanese economy, anticipate still lower interest rates, which would be favorable for the dollar. When rates decline overseas, yields on domestic fixed-income investments become more attractive to investors.
In New York, the dollar settled at 127.50 yen, down from 128.10 yen on Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 128.17 yen, up 1.27 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar dropped to 127.70 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.9190 in New York from Friday's $1.8945. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.9155 from $1.8980.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4808 German marks, down from 1.5035; 1.3105 Swiss francs, down from 1.3325; 5.0025 French francs, down from 5.0770; 1,121.25 Italian lire, down from 1,140.00, and 1.1881 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1913.

HEADLINE: Olivetti's Chief Sees a Vendetta

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
Italy is a land of plots and counterplots, of unsolved crimes and unresolved mysteries. But even by these standards, the case of Carlo de Benedetti, chairman of the computer maker Ing. C. Olivetti, is unusual.
Mr. de Benedetti, who is widely viewed in the United States as one of Europe's most perceptive businessmen, was sentenced by a Milan court this spring to six years and four months in jail. But he insinuates that a political vendetta was behind the verdict -- and many in Italy and America share that view. 
 "I've always been seen as against the Italian political class, as a sort of strange political animal, and I've paid a very high price, culminating with this groundless conviction," Mr. de Benedetti said in an interview. He is free pending an appeal.
The conviction stemmed from charges of fraud in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in 1982 beneath $1.3 billion in bad loans. For 65 days, between November 1981 and January 1982, Mr. de Benedetti was deputy chairman of what was then Italy's largest private bank. He left after a falling-out with the chairman, Roberto Calvi, who was found hanged, in still murky circumstances, under Blackfriars Bridge in London shortly before the bank shut.
 
Deals -- and Comeuppance?
 Some believe the verdict is Mr. de Benedetti's comeuppance for countless deals, some of them very successful but some apparently poorly judged, that critics say displayed a combination of greed, vanity and impatience. His interests include the influential Italian newspaper La Repubblica, a hotel group in Spain and the big French auto-component company Valeo.
"He's the most complete businessman in Italy," said Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat S.p.A. "But you can't put yourself with rogues like Calvi and come out looking good."
But another view is that Mr. de Benedetti has paid for being a bristling outsider, a Jew in an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country, who challenged the long-dominant Christian Democratic and Socialist parties and the country's risible stock exchange and heavy regulation of the economy, which he contends have conspired to keep most businesses small.
"There is a large element of political conspiracy in the conviction," said Carlo Scognamilio, rector of the respected Luiss business school. "Mr. de Benedetti has many enemies in this country because he has confronted the regime."
And Mr. de Benedetti said, "This is the land of the bonsai. If you stay small in business, nobody troubles you. But if you want to grow, they start calling you a Communist and a troublemaker."
Olivetti's chairman has already received a vote of confidence from corporate America. On June 26, the Digital Equipment Corporation agreed to invest about $365 million to acquire almost 10 percent of Olivetti, which lost $383 million in 1991 as it suffered from the shakeout in the European computer industry. A spokesman for Digital said, "We did not regard the conviction as a big deal."
Still, as Mr. de Benedetti battles to clear his name with his court appeal, which will probably not be heard until 1994, questions remain.
Is his jail sentence a frame-up -- a squalid example of the political and moral crisis now sweeping Italy as politician after politician is implicated in corruption scandals and anti-Mafia judges are killed by bombs? Or did the man once regarded as the golden boy of Italian business really break the law? And has the verdict compromised Mr. de Benedetti's ability to lead Olivetti to profitability?
He is an unusual figure in Italy. While successful small and medium-sized businesses abound, the self-made man who builds an industrial group and takes it public is rare. The country's dominant Christian Democratic Party has long been content to portray the stock exchange as little more than a den of speculators in order to insure that private savings go mainly to shore up the chronic indebtedness of a spendthrift state.
Meanwhile, establishment figures in the private sector, like Mr. Agnelli, or Leopoldo Pirelli of the Pirelli tire group, have sought stability through cross-stockholdings in each other's companies, often coordinated by the country's leading merchant bank, Mediobanca, and its octogenarian mastermind, Enrico Cuccia.
It is this system that Mr. de Benedetti says he wants to break. "In the last 15 years," he said, "I have systematically wanted to change things, to modernize, to end the ossification, to go beyond the capitalism of the family, to make this a more genuinely capitalist country. I was saying, let's have hostile takeovers. I was saying, let's produce plenty of Agnellis, and if possible better ones."
 
Newspaper Criticizes Leaders
 His newspaper, La Repubblica, has fired repeated broadsides at the governing parties, and particularly at the Socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, whom it regularly portrays in cartoons as a jackbooted latter-day Mussolini.
He has criticized the business establishment, especially as symbolized by Mr. Agnelli, of whom he said, "Agnelli is a king, and I have rarely seen a progressive monarch."
At the same time, for many years, Mr. de Benedetti was well known as the entrepreneur closest to the opposition Communist Party, now named the Party of Social Democracy.
Mr. de Benedetti also made politicians uncomfortable simply by growing very fast. In Italy, he and Luciano Benetton of the clothing group stand virtually alone in having developed from scratch big businesses quoted on the stock exchange.
Buoyed by the 1980's stock market boom, Mr. de Benedetti's holding companies were vehicles for an extraordinary expansion aimed at establishing what he described as a pan-European business empire.
Just about anything seemed to be a target for his appetites: Yves Saint Laurent and the Valeo auto-component company in France; the Pearson Group, owners of The Financial Times, in Britain; hotels and real estate in Spain, and the huge Belgian holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, which he claimed to have successfully raided in 1988 before being foiled by Compagnie de Suez of France.
In Italy, two of his bids, for the influential Mondadori publishing group and the state-owned SME food group, met virulent and ultimately successful opposition from politicians concerned at the growth of his power.
"It is a straight line from SME to the Ambrosiano verdict," Mr. de Benedetti contended, without specifying how he thought the Milan magistrates involved in his case were politically swayed.
Still, he clearly became overstretched. Many of his holdings have been sold as his group retrenches. His French company, Cerus, has lost more than $600 million in the last two years and has been shedding much of what it acquired in the 1980's.
"He allowed himself to be carried away by the times in the 1980's, and I think he knows it," said Michel Cicurel, who was brought in recently as managing director of Cerus to clean up the mess.
 
Depressed Stock Prices
 Like other companies in the group, Cerus is now trading at a fraction of what it did a few years ago. Olivetti, having traded as high as 20,000 lire, or $18.10, a share in 1986, now trades at 3,200 lire, or $2.90.
In 1978, when he took over Olivetti, the once illustrious typewriter manufacturer was on the brink of bankruptcy. Within five years, the company was transformed into a leading European computer maker, with profits reaching $365 million by 1987.
But last year it plunged into the red. At best, Mr. Benedetti said, Olivetti might break even this year, after shedding 16,000, or 25 percent, of its workers over the last two years.
Its problems are essentially those of the entire European computer industry: tough competition in a fragmented market and plunging prices. Personal computer prices fell 40 percent last year.
Olivetti is banking on its integrated systems, its flexibility and the muscle and technology of its new alliance with Digital to survive. From Digital the company will gain access to the Alpha RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, technology, which has earned widespread praise.
Mr. de Benedetti vowed to fight to the last for Olivetti's independence. "I am sentimentally tied to this company, and it is my duty to give it all I can," he said.
There is no question that Mr. de Benedetti is a fighter. Born into a middle-class Jewish family in Turin, he fled Italy at age 8 because of the Fascist racial laws in force during World War II. He managed to get to Switzerland, although several of his cousins died in Nazi death camps.
The experience marked him deeply, apparently contributing to his passionate sense of mission. This determination is certain to characterize his effort to clear his name in the Ambrosiano case.
But he will be up against an Italian justice system whose notorious lethargy and unpredictability are underlined by the fact that the full reasons for Mr. de Benedetti's conviction will be disclosed only next year and by the extraordinary division between the magistrates most centrally involved in the case.
Interviews showed that while Renato Bricchetti, the magistrate who led the initial investigation, is convinced of Mr. de Benedetti's innocence, the public prosecutor, Piero Dell'Osso, defended the verdict. Both denied being subjected to political pressure.
 
Banco Ambrosiano Affair
 What they do agree on is that Mr. de Benedetti joined Banco Ambrosiano as vice chairman in November 1981, invited by the shadowy Mr. Calvi, who said he was looking to groom a successor. Mr. de Benedetti invested 52 billion lire, or $43.3 million, to become the largest single holder in a bank that was already awash in bad loans made by Mr. Calvi to several Latin American shell companies owned by the Institute for Religious Works, the Vatican Bank.
It was a typically bold, and seemingly rash, decision by Mr. de Benedetti. But he soon began challenging Mr. Calvi at board meetings to explain what was going on in the bank's porous overseas operations.
"The reaction from Mr. Calvi was extremely violent," Mr. Bricchetti said.
Mr. Calvi began maneuvering to have Mr. de Benedetti removed, and the magistrates agree that nothing the Olivetti chairmandid as a director of the bank was reproachable.
Where the two magistrates disagree is over the terms under which Mr. de Benedetti left the bank. At that time, he received 54.3 billion lire, or $45.2 million, which Mr. de Benedetti says represented his investment plus interest and costs.
Mr. Dell'Osso argued that the payment was excessive and contributed to the "fraudulent bankruptcy" of Banco Ambrosiano.
Mr. Bricchetti found nothing unlawful about this payment. In effect, Mr. de Benedetti, he argued, was being sentenced to prison for the collapse of a bank with $1.3 billion in bad loans because he made a profit of $1.9 million on his two-month investment.
Mr. Dell'Osso declined to discuss his reasoning in the case. But he said: "The only pressures on me were the technical ones from the complexity of the affair. I was able to fulfill my duty as a magistrate should, without any political pressure."
But Mr. Dell'Osso's unusual persistence kept the case alive. He first argued that Mr. de Benedetti had been guilty of extortion, and when this case floundered in 1989, he switched to the fraudulent-bankruptcy argument.
Whether Mr. de Benedetti's appeal is upheld or not, he seems resolute and serene. He believes Italy, struck by twin economic and political crises, is at last about to change in the way he has long urged. And he appears to have realized the pitfalls of his considerable hubris.
"I am willing to concentrate on fewer subjects now," he said. "Ten years ago I was not. But I am 57, and I have realized that every season of your life has its own attractions and flavor. I am a grandfather now, and that makes me totally happy. Ten years ago it would have made me desperate."

Trial Focusing on Damages

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, July 27

 BODY:
After meeting for nearly seven hours over two days last week and failing to reach a settlement, both sides in the Freeman McNeil v. the National Football League trial over free agency returned to the courtroom today, with the players' attorneys seeking to establish parameters for possible damages.
Michael Glassman, president of Glassman-Oliver Economic Consultants based in Washington, said that after extensive research he had concluded that the eight players filing the suit deserved damages that total nearly $4 million. 
 Glassman's estimates for the plaintiffs ranged from a high of $1.36 million in damages for Green Bay Packers quarterback Dan Majkowski to $97,000 for former New York Giants fullback Lee Rouson. McNeil, the New York Jets' running back and the lead player in the suit, should be awarded about $400,000, Glassman said.
Glassman will be cross-examined by the N.F.L.'s lead attorney, Frank Rothman, on Tuesday, when the players' case will conclude. The N.F.L. will likely begin presenting its case Wednesday with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue being called as its first witness. The case is in its fifth week after a two-week break that gave the sides a chance to settle out of court.

HEADLINE: BARCELONA;
Hard Times for Somalians

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 27

 BODY:
Hours before the opening ceremonies of the Barcelona Olympics last Saturday, the doctor examining Abdi Bile's right leg found a stress fracture and prepared to place the leg in a cast. Bile objected.
"I have to walk in opening ceremonies," he said. "If I cannot run, I must walk." 
 Reluctantly, the doctor agreed to wrap the leg tightly in a bandage so Bile, once the world's leading 1,500-meter runner, could march proudly behind the flag of Somalia in the parade of nations at the Barcelona Olympics.
In a real sense, however, the tiny group of men who waved to the crowd when Somalia was introduced were representing a memory more than a country. After years of economic decay, drought, starvation, revolution and tribal warfare, Somalia barely exists in any formal sense. Since the regime of President Siad Barre was overthrown 18 months ago, roving bands of warriors come as close as anything to a ruling faction.
 
6-Person Delegation
 That so few as six Somalians -- three athletes and three officials -- have managed to participate in something as nonessential to that nation as the Olympics reflects the courageous but desperate sadness of the situation, and also the degree to which a once functioning nation has disintegrated.
"It is more than terrible; it is a disaster," said Ahmed Abdi Dahir, a member of the national Olympic committee. "There is no government, no system, no security. All the normal facilities you would see in a country no more exist. Everything you could name is shut down. Our Olympic committee, it exists only as persons. It does not exist as an office. We have no post office box, no telephones. It was all destroyed."
A dog-legged country of 8 million people at the shoulder of East Africa, Somalia has been at war with itself or others for the last 15 years. Barre's leftist rule managed to provide a small degree of order. But once he was chased from the capital of Mogadishu, no organized group has been able to assume control.
Dahir, who left Somalia for Los Angeles more than 20 years ago, was once a government official in the ministry for sports and labor. He returns to his native country every year, and a month ago, he came back to Los Angeles after seven months in Somalia.
He was stunned by the degeneration of life there, finding a semblance of order only through the most powerful of about 40 armed tribal groups. Otherwise, he said, looting and violence dictate the daily life style. Some tribal groups, he said, have ammunition left over from vast supplies of weapons supplied by the Soviet Union through 1980, then the United States.
Dahir likened the unrest in Somalia to the riots that rocked South-Central Los Angeles.
"First, it had been directed at the president," said Dahir of the violence. "Then, the target was diverted to businesses, shops and residences. They will come to your house and tell you at gun point what they want. Everybody is looking for something to eat, dress or loot. The main reason for all this is economic. These are 100 percent economic freedom fighters. They will shoot you for your watch."
It is from this environment that Somalia's lone healthy athlete and the other two officials attending the Barcelona Games had come.
The officials -- Mohamed Salah Ahmed Charles, the secretary general of the Olympic committee, and Said Ali, the chief of the delegation -- took more than a month to arrive. They traveled by light aircraft to Djibouti, a tiny country northwest of Somalia, then by boat across the Gulf of Aden into Yemen, where they stayed another two weeks to make arrangements for the Olympics.
Officers of the national Olympic committee of Yemen invited them to use the kind of facilities they no longer had, including an office with telephones and a fax machine. The Somalians had missed the July 10 deadline for entering athletes in the Games but explained the situation to the Barcelona organizers, who assured them a team would be welcome. That settled, they left Sanaa and arrived in Barcelona by air on July 24, the day before opening ceremonies.
They are still awaiting their only healthy athlete, Shidane Omar, a 22-year-old 400-meter runner from Belet Weyne, a town on the western border with Ethiopia. His route of travel was the same, but without the extended time in Sanaa.
"He is on his way," Charles said. "Maybe he arrives tomorrow. Maybe in two days."
As an athlete, Omar is probably more dedicated than talented, training as he can, unafraid of the ravages around him, for a simple reason.
"These guys looting," Dahir said, "if you have nothing of value, they leave you alone. I used to jog in the street all the time."
At least Omar can compete. Bile, 29, a world champion five years ago, had been recovering from an injury to his left leg, when he began developing problems with his right. He thought little of it and came to Barcelona after training eight months in San Diego. But running increased the pain, forcing him to see a doctor, who took X-rays and discovered the stress fracture.
His season ended, he was consulting with airlines today to find a flight back to Washington. He lives in the Virginia suburbs.
Ibrahim Okash, a 27-year-old 800-meter runner who lives in Los Angeles, was training as usual until he injured a hamstring muscle, making him a doubtful starter when track and field begins on Friday.
Charles said he had expected to round up at least a dozen more Somalians for the Games, mostly marathon and long-distance runners. But they were not to be found.
"The situation is so hard in the country," he said. "They had all run away, and some were good runners."
Sadly, he knew where one was. Mohiddin Moh Kulmiye had run in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic marathons and had been looking forward to another chance. Six months ago, he was killed by gunfire.

HEADLINE: An Urban Aid Bill in Name Only

 BODY:
Ross Perot aroused voters by tapping their frustration with Washington politics. He accused Congress of rarely managing to link workable solutions to specific problems. Were Mr. Perot still an unannounced Presidential candidate, he would no doubt point to tomorrow's vote in the Senate Finance Committee on an urban aid bill as an ugly case in point.
The bill was originally intended to be a serious response to the Los Angeles riots, providing desperately needed aid to urban ghettos. What's emerged is a miserly handout to cities and a large grab-bag of unrelated tax breaks and gimmicks. 
 The committee has time to turn the bill around. By pruning the excess and concentrating on cities, the Senate could make good on its promise, and take a modest step toward pacifying disdainful voters.
The Senate bill isn't all bad. It improves on the House-passed version of enterprise zones, blighted areas that would qualify employers for special tax breaks. The Senate version would have greater impact because it would concentrate the same amount of money in half as many zones.
It also drops a wasteful provision in the House bill to cut the tax on capital gains for investors in enterprise zones. And it provides money for drug treatment, welfare reform and other assistance to needy families.
But the amount of urban aid is paltry, amounting to only a fourth of the bill's total cost of more than $20 billion -- in part because money is squandered in unnecessary tax breaks to other constituencies. The bill would lower corporate taxes, reinstate an unnecessary tax shelter for real estate investors and repeal taxes on luxury items like expensive boats. Helping well-off taxpayers is apparently more important than helping cities.
Even these missteps pale next to provisions on individual retirement accounts, committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen's hobbyhorse. Mr. Bentsen would reinstate the right of upper-income families to deposit money into I.R.A.'s free of tax until funds are withdrawn after retirement. He also proposes to create a "backloaded" I.R.A.; the original deposit would not be tax-deductible, but all earnings would be forever tax-exempt, even after withdrawal.
Both ideas might result in a modest boost in savings. But to prevent a rise in the deficit, which would cancel the savings benefit, Mr. Bentsen would have to raise other taxes.
Instead, he tarnishes his plan by engaging in accounting gimmicks. The bill would allow holders of existing I.R.A.'s to convert them into the new backloaded accounts. That would produce a short burst in revenues but a long-run hemorrhage. Because the budget law only requires Congress to look five years down the road, Mr. Bentsen can pretend his plan is inexpensive.
If the committee were to strip the bill of the unnecessary tax giveaways, it could provide real relief for beleaguered cities. For starters, it could permanently extend the low-income housing tax credit -- a lifeline for community groups rebuilding urban ghettos. The bill now provides for only 18 months' extension. Eliminating the I.R.A. provisions would by itself pay for food assistance and other programs targeted at needy children.
The committee has two choices. It can, as promised, help cities. Or it can reward well-off constituents.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Saddam and Gore

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The two largest New York tabloids carry triumphant front-page headlines: Saddam backs down.
Why not? It's not often papers get to shout out such good news. And the editors of Newsday and The Daily News have the proof right there in their hands -- the statement from the President of the United States announcing that Saddam Hussein had "caved in." What more do they need, right? 
 Americans have the choice of immediate reactions to this White House and press pap: laugh, cry, throw up or get good and mad for being taken for idiots.
Then they can start paying more attention to the occasional politician who tells them the truth about what is going on in Iraq:
Saddam Hussein is making fools of the U.N. and the U.S. That is neither new nor unexpected. But in the process he is digging himself deeper into power, slaughtering his enemies, preparing for more Unholy War in the Mideast. And as usual the man takes understandable pride and pleasure in not pretending otherwise.
Senator Al Gore -- he has been telling the truth about Saddam Hussein. Long before he became a Vice-Presidential candidate he said in a series of clear-sighted speeches that unless Saddam is replaced, not with his killer cronies but a decent government of the opposition, the danger from Baghdad to the world and to the Iraqi people will continue.
Democratic reality and American self-interest -- usually the same -- will not be met with a bomb or bullet with Saddam's name on it. As Mr. Gore has said in the past and said again after the latest Saddam game, support is needed for the Iraqi Kurdish opposition in northern Iraq and the anti-Saddam Arab groups fighting for their existence in the south.
No, Saddam did not "cave in." He won. First, with contempt, he forced the U.N. into three weeks of negotiation to persuade him, in his grace, to allow its inspectors into a building that housed military information and material. They should have been permitted to enter with a knock on the door, or U.N. punishment immediately meted out.
Of course he had all the time in the world to strip the building. But that is a trifle. His real victory is that the U.S. and the U.N. gave him virtual veto over the makeup of inspection teams, degrading their value.
They replaced the American head of the team, whom Saddam found too professionally pushy, with a German, sent the American home, named inspectors whose nationalities did not offend Saddam. An American will be allowed to hang around -- outside the building, not in.
Saddam won -- and every blessed soul in the Middle East will know it.
Anyway, it is monumentally hypocritical of both sides to make inspection the only issue. Both know that every day Saddam spits on the U.N. resolution about respecting the Iraqi minorities. He still kills, blockades and starves them.
The Bush Administration, having surrendered political victory to Saddam after the gulf war, has been making things worse ever since. Proof: he is stronger militarily, politically and economically than the day he was supposed to have been so thoroughly thrashed.
The opposition to Saddam grows, but is fractured. The Kurds of the north, his great enemy, sometimes feud among themselves. In the south, Arab opposition groups are under pressure from Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, which want opposition to Saddam to be dependent on them.
But if there is any ember in the ethical ashes of the gulf war, it is to try to help Iraqis who have suffered so bitterly in the fight against the man the U.S. did not destroy.
Leaders of opposition groups are in Washington. They are scheduled to meet with Secretary Baker, for the first time. But the Administration's problem remains. It did not not grasp the importance of freedom movements in the Baltics, in the Soviet Union, in China, nor does it in Iraq.
Governor Clinton and Senator Gore are on the same track about Iraq. They have time before the election to work out a policy that would lead to what has to be done -- the international criminal indictment of Saddam Hussein, the recognition of a coalition government, and decent support to it.
And if they do, the Governor and the Senator will have done a service to their party and country, before a vote is cast.

Magic Circle Opera Repertory Ensemble
St. Peter's Lutheran Church
Lexington Avenue at 54th Street
Mid-Manhattan
Through Sunday
Ray Evans Harrell started the Magic Circle Opera Repertory Ensemble in 1990 with the idea of giving young singers not only stage experience, but also administrative experience. The ensemble's steady roster of 18 -- including singers, dancers, a stage director, a choreographer and a composer -- doubles as an executive committee responsible for raising money and doing the other mundane tasks that keep the company afloat.
One thing the ensemble has learned is a sense of economy. The productions are spare but evocative, and the company takes an additive approach to its repertory. The three one-act contemporary operas it presented last summer have been revived, with casts intact, and the troupe has worked up three more short operas for the new season. The group is presenting these six works as companion pieces to installments in a serialized version of "Carmen." 
 Called "A Gypsy Carmen," this adaptation by Mr. Harrell retains the opera's familiar text and is sung in French. Its novelty is an English narrative that presents the work from the gypsies' view, in which Don Jose is a tool of the state in its repression of the gypsies and other minorities. The work is presented over five evenings.
The Sunday evening installment was the second-act finale, and beyond the spoken introduction, it was a fairly straightforward rendering. Madeline Tsingopoulos sang Carmen's music appealingly, and Ross Solomon was a reasonable Don Jose, although he had to shift into his head voice to reach the role's top notes.
The other new addition on Sunday's program was "A Childhood Miracle," a 1956 work by Ned Rorem and Elliot Stein. Based on Hawthorne's "Snow Image," the piece is about two little girls who build a snowman and bring him to life. Their father finds the older sister embracing the snowman; he orders the snowman into the house, where it melts. The girls run away and are reunited with the snowman when they freeze to death. Mr. Rorem's music is appealingly New Englandish, Ivesian without the fear of charm.
Darcy Dunn was alluring both vocally and dramatically as Violet, the older sister. Carol Flamm gave a playful if slightly less steady account of Peony. Gerard Powers sang sturdily as the snowman.
The bill also included two works carried over from last year, Barber's "Hand of Bridge," with Ms. Tsingopoulos, Peter Castaldi, Mary Rose Cidoni, Mark Singer and Iris Savernik, and Holst's "Wandering Scholar," which benefited from fine performances by Michelle Couture and Mr. Solomon. Kenneth Newbern was the supportive accompanist.

HEADLINE: Crisis in Italy Grows As Mob Kills 3d Foe Despite Troop Moves

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, July 28

 BODY:
Openly scorning the Government's deployment of 7,000 soldiers to fight the Mafia in Sicily, mobsters have gunned down a third foe of organized crime on the island.
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, facing a sea of troubles after only a month in office, said today that the Government's credibility had been lost.
"We are going through a phase when everything seems to be stacked against us: the economy, finances, the foreign exchange market, the Mafia, the crisis of our political parties," Mr. Amato said in a television interview. 
 His unusually blunt and pessimistic assessment came hours after assassins pumped eight bullets into Giovanni Lizzio, head of anti-extortion investigations in Catania, Sicily's second city, as he drove home Monday night. He was the first senior police officer to be killed in a city that has long resisted the mob.
The 47-year-old investigator died even as authorities in the city were discussing how to use the troops sent there after the Mafia killings of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in Palermo earlier this summer.
Mr. Amato's reference to economic problems coincided with a drive by his fragile coalition to push an emergency budget through Parliament before its summer recess next week.
The Government also decided today to call a vote of confidence on its proposal to cut Italy's huge budget deficit, which is Europe's biggest (at $130 billion this year) and 50 percent higher per capita than the United States deficit.
The Government proposal calls for reducing the deficit by $27 billion through tax increases and spending cuts. Under Italian parliamentary procedures, opposition parties may not demand changes in proposed legislation before a vote of confidence, but the Government must resign if it loses.
 
A New Terrorism
 Mr. Amato's Government has only a slender majority in the traditionally volatile Parliament, and is apparently calculating that none of its adversaries want to risk another political crisis at a time of such economic turmoil and such brazen challenges from organized crime. The loss of international confidence in Italy has also been weakening the lira steadily for weeks.
"It is essential that the budget package be approved by both houses before the summer break," said Finance Minister Giovanni Goria. "We don't have much time because there is a need to give a signal to the markets."
If Italy does not heal its economy, it faces exclusion from some key decisions as the European Community begins integration next year. But Mr. Amato's effort to make the economy the first priority has been sabotaged by the Mafia's campaign of killings and the resulting political pressure to curb organized crime.
Such is the mood of desperation that Mr. Amato called today for other countries and Italy's own secret service to join battle against the Mafia.
"Terrorism, for years the enemy of our intelligence services, no longer exists," he said in the broadcast interview. "What is the purpose of our intelligence services now unless they start infiltrating organized crime? We know why it's called Cosa Nostra, but it's not something only Italian." "Cosa nostra" means "our thing" and has been used by organized crime figures to emphasize a mob's exclusivity.
 
Pervasiveness of Mob
 While Mr. Lizzio, the latest victim of mob violence, did not enjoy the same national status as Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino, who were killed in car-bomb attacks, his death nonetheless showed how the mob, known in Italy as the Octopus, had spread its tentacles.
Until recent years Catania had withstood Mafia infiltration, but, according to store owners there, up to half of them pay extortion money to the mob, more than in Palermo, which is regarded as the Mafia's fief. Mr. Lizzio was in charge of investigating protection rackets.
The police, moreover, say a clan war is raging over control of the narcotics trade.
It remains unclear whether the Catania killing was ordered by the Mafia clans that killed Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino. Mafia specialists had assumed that the assassination of the two judges was a collective decision by the Mafia's highest bosses, those in the cupola, or dome.
Some specialists said the Catania killing may have been decided at a lower level. But, coming two days after troops in full battle-gear began arriving in Sicily to help the police hunt mobsters, it showed the same disregard for the authorities.

HEADLINE: Legislators Begin Approving Bills as a Rare Special Session Begins in Albany

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 28

 BODY:
State lawmakers returned here for a rare special meeting today and began passing bills in a bid to redeem themselves for the hostile, unproductive finale to their regular legislative session earlier this month.
Virtually all of the measures agreed to by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders last week appeared certain of formal passage, including fiscal rescue packages for Nassau and Suffolk Counties that were in danger of derailment in recent days because of a variety of local squabbles.
 
Bond Act for Jobs
 A dispute in Suffolk, for instance, over how long the county should be given to repay the money it hopes to borrow in the coming year lingered through the evening tonight. But officials both in Albany and in Suffolk County said they did not believe it would unhinge the overall fiscal package, which Suffolk has vigorously sought to help close its deficit. 
 Approval from the County Legislature of the wording of parts of the bill is needed before it can be acted on by the Legislature.
Also on the calendar were several economic-development measures, including an $800 million bond act intended to create jobs and expanded powers for the State Thruway Authority to start projects in the vicinity of its 570-mile road system.
Both the Assembly and the State Senate approved the Thruway bill tonight by wide margins. The Assembly also passed the bond act before recessing around 9 P.M., while the Senate, which met until 10 P.M., is expected to pass it on Wednesday.
At the same time, though, top lawmakers appeared reluctant to extend their reach to any of the other major bills that failed in the Legislature this year and eluded any agreement during last week's negotiations. In almost every case, the Republican-controlled State Senate balked at measures sought by the Democratic Governor and the Assembly Democrats.
Thus, bills that were languishing included measures to create a trust fund for environmental projects, to strengthen wilderness protections in the Adirondacks and to extend health benefits to uninsured children.
There was vigorous lobbying tonight over a bill that would restrict adolescents' access to tobacco by banning smoking in schools and prohibiting vending machines in businesses where minors are present. A similar push for the bill in the final night of the session in early July was fought back by tobacco lobbyists, but advocates of the measure said they hoped to prevail on Wednesday.
 
'Very Good' Mood
 Regardless of how some of the outstanding bills were resolved, it was clear that lawmakers would leave town in a more collegial mood than after the final all-night meeting in early July. The session broke down then in a shouting match between the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican, and the Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin, a Democrat.
"The general mood is very good," Mr. Weprin said in an interview today, adding that he and Mr. Marino had put aside their past differences. "He indicated to me that some of the things he said back then were in the middle of the night -- he didn't really mean them," Mr. Weprin said of the earlier session's angry close.
In Suffolk County, County Executive Robert J. Gaffney and county legislators hashed out an agreement late tonight enabling the Suffolk Legislature to require that any borrowing undertaken in the coming year be paid back within one year rather than the five- to-six-year period originally sought by Mr. Gaffney.
The move represents something of a rebuke to Mr. Gaffney, who had been insisting that he needed the broader borrowing authority. He also has been forced to whittle down his estimates of just how much the county's budget was out of balance this year, from a high of around $90 million to the present estimate of around $40 million.

HEADLINE: Groupe Bull Has Big Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PARIS, July 28

 BODY:
The troubled computer maker Groupe Bull S.A., which has significant operations in the United States, said today that it lost the equivalent of $338 million in the first half of 1992, down from a loss of $388 million in the corresponding period last year.
Revenue at the company, which is owned by the French Government, fell 9.2 percent, to $2.76 billion, compared with $3.04 billion in last year's first half. 
 The company attributed the revenue decline to competitive cost pressures and a persistently unfavorable economic climate.
Bull said its operating losses came to $171 million, improving from an operating deficit of $258 million in the first half of 1991.
In the United States, Bull owns Zenith Data Systems, a personal computer maker, and Honeywell's former computer operations.
The results follow the appointment last month of Bernard Pache as Bull's chairman, replacing Francis Lorentz.
Mr. Lorentz was quoted in The Wall Street Journal last month as saying that he expected Bull to show an operating profit this year, but to post a net loss because of interest payments and the weak computer market. He said Bull aimed to return to a net profit in 1993.
Some analysts have questioned whether Mr. Lorentz's departure might slow the links Bull is developing with the International Business Machines Corporation, but Mr. Pache has pledged to stress continuity.

HEADLINE: Markets Jump as Consumer Confidence Drops

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In another setback for the struggling economic recovery and President Bush's re-election campaign, consumer confidence dropped sharply in July, the Conference Board reported yesterday. The business group's widely followed confidence index fell 16 percent, erasing nearly half of its gain since February.
Investors reacted to the gloom of consumers with something like glee, in the belief that the Federal Reserve will keep lowering interest rates to keep the recovery from faltering. Investors also seem convinced that inflation will remain low. 
 In its biggest one-day gain since January, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.87, to 3,334.07, as 218.1 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 164.7 million on Monday. The rally was widespread, with advancing issues outnumbering those that fell by more than 3 to 1. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 5.98, to 417.52, nearing its record of 420.77 set in January. [Page D8.]
 
 
Big Rally for Bonds
 The bond market rallied explosively. The price of the long-term 8 percent bonds of 2021 rose a full point, sending the bond's yield to 7.43 percent, down from 7.51 percent on Monday. Besides citing the sharp drop in consumer confidence, traders and analysts said investors seem to have reached the conclusion that compared with other fixed-income securities, yields on Treasury bonds represent good value. [Page D14.]
 "People don't think things are getting much worse, but they absolutely see no signs that they are getting better," said David Kelly, consumer expert at DRI/McGraw Hill. "Unfortunately what's happening now is very much like last fall."
The Conference Board index plunged to 61.0, from 72.6 in June, a drop almost as large as the decline last September when dozens of companies were announcing large layoffs and growth in the economy nearly ground to a standstill. The economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate last winter, but economists say the growth rate has slowed since.
The current poll "underscores how little fundamental confidence Americans have in this economy," Mr. Kelly said. "The improvement between February and June turns out to have been very, very tentative."
While other gauges of consumer sentiment, namely polls by the University of Michigan and by ABC/ Money magazine, had already registered marked declines earlier in the month, the size of the decline in the Conference Board index caught analysts by surprise.
Economic forecasters said consumers' deepening gloom was less likely now to lead them to cut their spending because they were already keeping a fairly tight grip on their wallets.
In addition to becoming gloomier about the present, consumers became less sanguine that the economy would improve in the next six months.
 Analysts said that the renewed wave of pessismism largely reflected the jump in the official unemployment figure to 7.8 percent, from 7.2 percent, in the last two months.
Only 14 percent of those questioned in the Conference Board poll said they thought jobs would become more abundant six months from now, the lowest level since February. The figure was 20 percent a couple of months ago.
"People are obviously concerned about the job market," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
The sag in spirits is one of clearest signals to date that Americans care much more about bad employment news than about victories against inflation.
"In our forecasting model," Mr. Kelly said, "a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is 10 times as important for spending as a one percentage point decline in inflation."
 
 
Report on Inflation
 This attitude connot be comforting to the Bush Administration, which has been more successful at lowering inflation than at cutting the jobless rate. A report released today by the Department of Labor said inflation was now on a long-term downward trend well below 4 percent.
Analysts said that the darker consumer mood may also be a result of the election-year spotlight on America's economic ills. "People hear from every politician what's wrong with the country," said Mitchell Fromstein, president of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest supplier of temporary help. "Suddenly everybody thinks the world is coming to an end."
Despite the gloom among consumers, their rate of spending is likely to keep inching up this summer, at an expected anemic pace of 2 percent or so. This is because they had spent so little during the recession that they must continue to restock basic necessities. Spending had surged at a 5 percent rate this winter but then virtually leveled off in the spring.
"People are only buying what they have to," Mr. Kelly said. "Need, not enthusiasm, is what is driving spending."
 
 
Monthly Mail Survey
 The Conference Board poll is based on a monthly mail survey of a sample of 5,000 households. It showed that fewer consumers said they planned to buy houses or major appliances: 2.7 percent on houses, down from 3.6 percent, and 19 percent on appliances, down from 27.6.
More people did say that now was a good time to buy a new car: 7.4 percent in July, compared with 6.7 percent in June.
This month, domestic auto sales have been running at an annual rate of around 6.5 million. Though better than in midwinter, the pace remains so-so.
"We don't treat confidence as a leading indicator," said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers' Association, based in McLean, Va. "But the concern is that we won't see any further improvement."
 
 
Will Businesses Cut Back?
 One economic risk raised by the drop in confidence is that corporate executives will rein in any plans they may have to increase production, restock inventories and hire more workers.
"The real question is what this will do to production plans," Mr. Kelly said. "If business hunkers down for a cold, dark winter, it further postpones a meaningful recovery."
But not everyone thinks such a pullback by business is likely. Mr. Fromstein of Manpower said, "Hiring is in general driven by what is actually happening, not what people think is happening." And the temporary-help business, he said, is robust.
Ira Silver, planning manager of the J. C. Penney Company, said, "The biggest surge in spending in years last January and February followed a sharp decline in confidence last fall."
"A lot of buying for the fourth quarter has already been done," he added. "Our sales remain strong."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Pay Increases Modestly
 WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) -- Pay and benefits for American workers rose a modest eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, the Labor Department said today. The department also reported that union contracts settled during the quarter gave workers average raises of 3 percent a year over the life of the contract, the second consecutive quarter in which settlements were lower than agreements they replaced.
The rise of eight-tenths of a percent in overall pay and benefits was down from a gain of nine-tenths of a percent in the first quarter and a 1.3 percent rise in the second quarter last year, the Labor Department said.
In the 12 months that ended on June 30, salaries and benefits of civilian workers rose 3.6 percent, compared with 4.6 percent in the previous 12-month period, according to the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Shifts to a New Turf;
Clinton Challenges Bush on His Strong Suit, Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
For Gov. Bill Clinton, this week's tussle with President Bush and the White House over the crisis in the former Yugoslavian republics represents a major test of his capacity to frame and articulate foreign policy.
Widely unpopular with the American electorate, unable to regain the offensive on economic policy, Mr. Bush retains, because of his lengthy foreign-affairs experience and the American victory in the Persian Gulf war, among other things, a good deal of credibility on security matters and on foreign policy questions in general. 
 His strategists see that as his trump card in the 1992 elections, a way to distinguish himself sharply from a Democratic nominee who has spent his entire public career in Little Rock, Ark.
After Mr. Clinton issued a statement criticizing Mr. Bush for failing to provide adequate leadership on the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and urging the United States to seek United Nations authorization for selective bombing of Serbian targets in Bosnia, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, called the proposal "reckless" and said Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, "are a long way from being qualified to lead the country."
Today, that brought return fire from Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore and others that made it clear the Democrats had no intention of ceding foreign-policy primacy to the Republicans. The question is, can Mr. Clinton fight Mr. Bush at least to a standstill on ground where the President made his reputation? Will the voters believe him when he proposes alternative policies abroad?
Still divided along hawk-and-dove fault lines that first emerged in the Vietnam War, fearful of seeming soft on Communism and other foes of the United States, reluctant to revive memories of the American hostages taken in Iran in the Carter Administration, Mr. Clinton's party has for the most part refrained from challenging Ronald Reagan's and Mr. Bush's foreign policies too boldly in recent elections.
"Experience isn't judgment, and we intend to question the President's judgment when it is appropriate," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "No matter how hard the White House tries, this election is going to be about the economy, because that is what most people care most about. But Bill Clinton will cede no ground on foreign policy."
As if to symbolize the Democrats' determination not to let Mr. Bush do to Mr. Clinton what he did to former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts four years ago, former President Jimmy Carter joined Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in a carefully coordinated counterattack. The campaign also gave wide distribution to a compendium of quotations purporting to show that leading Republicans, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, as well as European leaders, had called for actions similar to those Mr. Clinton had advocated.
The Clinton statement, issued Sunday night, was approved by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore after a telephone conversation over the weekend, campaign officials said. Nancy Soderberg, the foreign policy director at the campaign's Little Rock headquarters, said she and three other specialists drafted it -- Anthony Lake and Samuel R. Berger, the two senior foreign policy advisers, and Leon Fuerth, Mr. Gore's top foreign policy aide on Capitol Hill.
 
Team Behind Position
 Ms. Soderberg, who worked on foreign policy for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and in the 1984 and 1988 Democratic Presidential campaigns before joining Mr. Clinton last month, is the top paid, full-time foreign-affairs official. Mr. Lake, who teaches at Mount Holyoke College and raises cattle on a farm in western Massachusetts, and Mr. Berger, a lawyer in the Washington firm of Hogan and Hartson, worked together on the State Department policy planning staff in the Carter administration. They are volunteers.
The general-election campaign is only just beginning, but in Washington political and policy circles, Mr. Lake is often described as a likely national security adviser in a Clinton White House. Another candidate for that job, it is said, is Michael Mandelbaum, who teaches at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and has known Mr. Clinton since both were studying in England, he at Cambridge and Mr. Clinton at Oxford.
Mr. Clinton spoke out on Bosnia several times before issuing the statement that drew the fire of the Bush camp, often taking a more aggressive posture than the President. In an interview with The New York Times on June 25, for example, he said he would be willing to take part in a multilateral military force that would "shoot its way into" the Sarajevo airport, if necessary, to make it safe enough for a steady airlift of relief supplies.
Mr. Mandelbaum, an expert on Eastern Europe and the Middle East, said in an interview that the situation in Bosnia was worth taking a strong stand on because "it is is an archetype for the rest of the world, an example of the kinds of very difficult problems that we are going to face more often as the old empires break up and nationalism and ethnicity come to the fore."
According to several members of the the Governor's advisory team, he is prepared to agree with Mr. Bush, as he did on the Gulf war and on Iraq last weekend, when he thinks the President is on the right track. But the aides predicted continuing attacks from Mr. Clinton on some of Mr. Bush's other policies, including the military budget, which he considers too big, especially with regard to troop levels in Europe and "Star Wars," or the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, who is one of the people on Capitol Hill whom Mr. Clinton regularly consults, conceded that "every time Clinton makes a foreign-policy statement, they are going to try to knock him down, which will have the effect of making foreign policy a much larger part of the campaign."
"But it is not going to be as easy as they think," Mr. Hamilton said. "Clinton has no experience in foreign policy, but Bush has his vulnerabilities, too -- some real successes, but some failures as well, like his inept handling of Saddam Hussen before the war, his failed trips to Tokyo on trade and Rio on the environment. There's no need whatever for Bill Clinton to hang back."
The end of the cold war has made it easier for Mr. Clinton to take strong stands without offending one faction or another in his party. Mr. Lake remarked that "there is a lot more common ground than there used to be, in the days of the ideological wars in the party."
Mr. Lake added: "In the 1970's and the 1980's, we refought the Vietnam War within the party every four years, and every position a candidate took was a victory for either the conservative wing or the liberal wing. No more."
In 1972, Mr. Berger worked for George McGovern, a liberal, and Mr. Lake for Edmund S. Muskie, a centrist. Other top advisers come from the Progressive Policy Institute, the research arm of the Democratic Leadership Council, which has inherited the hawkish tradition of the late Senator Henry M. Jackson.
However heterogenous they may be in ideological terms, the Clinton foreign-policy advisers share several characteristics: they are mostly young, mostly male, mostly white, mostly educated at Ivy League universities and almost entirely from outside Mr. Clinton's home state.
Mr. Lake, considered by many to be the dominant figure, cut his diplomatic teeth as a career officer in Vietnam, where he was part of an elite group that also included Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

HEADLINE: A Tentative Japan Is Giving Trust-Busting a Try

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 28

 BODY:
In the first criminal prosecution under its antitrust laws since 1974, the Japanese Government has put eight Japanese manufacturers of plastic food wrap on trial, charged with conspiring to raise prices. Other than the defendants, the party with perhaps the most riding on the case is the United States Government, which sees the trial as a sign that its latest trade strategy is working.
It is a strategy that has many doubters, but Washington remains optimistic that it can use antitrust laws, both its own and Japan's, to help open Japan's markets for American goods. American officials reason that better antitrust enforcement will reduce collusive relationships among Japanese companies that tend to exclude foreigners, allowing all companies to compete on their merits. That could provide a more general approach to opening Japan's market, rather than hammering away at restrictions industry by industry.
 
Threat of Prosecution
 To that end, the Justice Department said in the spring that it would consider prosecuting foreign companies for practices that hurt American exporters. While the Justice Department insisted it was not aiming at any particular country, the announcement sent a wave of fear through Japanese businesses. 
 The United States is also pressing the Japanese Government to strengthen its own antitrust regulations and to energize its Fair Trade Commission, the historically weak agency that is charged with enforcing laws on business competition.
At the request of the United States, for instance, the commission is surveying the practices of four industries that Washington thinks should be more open to foreign imports -- paper, glass, automobiles and auto parts.
The effort to get Japan to change its own regulations on competition is part of the Structural Impediments Initiative, a continuing process in which Japan and the United States are telling each other how to reform their economies. Negotiators for the two nations are meeting in Tokyo this week to review the progress of the program.
In some ways, the antitrust issue is an illustration of the difficulties the program might have in bringing about fundamental change in Japan. Many experts, both here and in the United States, say Washington expects too much from its antitrust strategy. For one thing, they say the Fair Trade Commission will never turn from a lamb into a lion that is able to challenge established business practices.
In addition, they say some of the practices that American companies complain about -- like the interlocking relationships between Japanese manufacturers and their suppliers, known as keiretsu -- are probably legal anyway. If a company like Toyota wants to buy parts from a trusted supplier, even if it means forsaking a less expensive foreign supplier, that is Toyota's prerogative.
"Most of the difficulties that foreign companies are encountering in Japan are not really a violation of anti-monopoly law," said Mitsuo Matsushita, a professor of law at the University of Tokyo.
 
Doubts on Strategy
 Some experts go even further and say the strategy could backfire and make life harder for American companies here.
"If you strengthen Japanese antitrust enforcement, theoretically at least, you're making the market even more competitive," said John O. Haley, professor of law and East Asian studies at the University of Washington.
In industries like automobiles and electronics, he said, the problem for American companies is not monopolistic practices but the intense competition among Japanese companies, which makes those companies extremely efficient. Clamping down on price-fixing, as in the case of the food-wrap manufacturers, will only lead to lower prices, making it harder for foreign companies to enter the market, he said.
American officials acknowledge that no American company is likely to benefit directly from successful prosecution of the food-wrap case. But they hope the trial will send a signal to companies engaged in other collusive practices.
Executives complain, for instance, that manufacturers often put pressure on their distributors not to carry products made by other manufacturers, which makes it hard for foreign companies to break into the market.
 
A Glass Maker's Complaint
 "We cannot just go to a glass distributor in Japan and say, 'We can offer you a high-quality product at a lower price,' " said Peter Young, director of international business for Guardian Industries, a glass manufacturer in Northville, Mich. "They won't even talk to us."
Depending on the situation, such tactics by manufacturers could be antitrust violations. Bid-rigging on public-works projects, which many American executives say is common in Japan, is another potential violation.
As an example of what they hope to see, American officials point to an action taken by the Fair Trade Commission in the early 1980's to break up a Japanese cartel that controlled the imports of soda ash, which is used in making glass. Since then, the American share of Japan's soda ash market has risen to more than 20 percent from 2 percent.
Forged during the American occupation after World War II, Japan's basic anti-monopoly law is similar in principle to American antitrust law. But a tradition of strong antitrust enforcement has been lacking.
 
Lawsuits Rarely Succeed
 Only once, for instance, has a private lawsuit succeeded under the anti-monopoly law, and even that decision is being appealed, Professor Matsushita of Tokyo University said.
There are also numerous exemptions to the basic law: more than 200 cartels are legal, and the businessses in them, like beauty salons and barbershops, can agree among themselves on minimum prices. Retailers are prohibited from discounting books, compact disks and some drugs and cosmetics. And, severe restrictions have been placed on the ability of companies to offer discount coupons, contests and prizes.
Even when there are no legal exceptions, enforcement and fines have been weak and collusion quietly accepted. The maximum penalty for a criminal antitrust violation is about $40,000 here, compared with $10 million in the United States.
In the food-wrap case, for instance, the eight defendants do not deny that they collaborated to raise prices. Rather, some of the companies are complaining that they have been unfairly singled out for prosecution as a gesture to the United States.
"The companies involved can't help but think, 'Why only us?'," an attorney for one of the defendants said in an interview. He reeled off several industries -- cement, construction, printing ink -- in which violations appeared to be more serious but which were settled through administrative penalties, without criminal charges.
 
A Special Industry
 Some Americans agree that the food-wrap manufacturers were an easy target compared with the construction industry, which is a major contributor to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. "Anytime the Fair Trade Commission treads on someone powerful, they get trampled on and beaten back," said a former American trade negotiator.
That was shown recently in the case of 66 construction companies in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, which met in what was called the Saturday Club to apportion bids among themselves. The trade commission said it would have been too difficult under Japanese law to file criminal charges. Instead, the companies were forbidden to bid on projects for a month and were required to have all their employees -- more than 100,000 people in all -- sign pledges that they would not violate the law in the future.
Makoto Kurita, a Fair Trade Commission official, said the agency had taken significant steps since the United States began asking three years ago for such measures as part of the Structural Impediments Initiative.
The number of enforcement actions has risen to 30 in 1991 from 7 in 1989, administrative penalties for participating in cartels have been raised and rules have been issued concerning the relationships between manufacturers and distributors. Further steps are planned to raise criminal penalties and to phase out the legal cartels.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS BLAMED FOR ECONOMIC LAG

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Testifying before an angered House Budget Committee, the White House budget director said today that the Democratic-controlled Congress was responsible for the sluggish economy. He steadfastly declined to accept any part of the blame on behalf of President Bush.
The budget director, Richard G. Darman, said four factors had contributed to the annual economic growth of only eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first 13 quarters of the Bush Administration: a credit shortage, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Federal Reserve Board policies that produced slow growth of the money supply, and Congress's refusal to approve Mr. Bush's tax and spending-control proposals. 
 "Each of the first three causes has now been responsibly addressed to a significant extent," Mr. Darman told the committee. "It is the fourth -- legislative enactment of an agenda for spending control and economic growth -- that is left obviously outstanding."
Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the committee, demanded of Mr. Darman, "Does the President accept any responsibility whatsoever for the situation in the economy?"
Mr. Darman replied, "I can't speak for the President."
Mr. Panetta then asked, "Is he totally blameless?"
Only if Mr. Bush had sole authority to write legislation could he be blamed, Mr. Darman said.
At that, Mr. Panetta asserted: "It is disingenuous at best to say after four years in office that everybody else is to blame -- the Federal Reserve, Saddam Hussein, the Congress, the press. My God, he's President of the United States. Does he not have any power? Is it just P.R. events from day to day?"
Mr. Darman was appearing before the committee for a midyear review of the Federal budget. The projected deficit for the current fiscal year has been cut $66 billion, to $333 billion, mainly because Congress has been slow to appropriate more money to bail out the nation's savings and loan industry.
Mr. Darman said Mr. Bush was considering vetoing some appropriations bills if they exceed his recommendations for total spending authority. While he has vetoed some appropriations bills in the past, he has always done so for other reasons -- their stand on abortion, for instance.

HEADLINE: Serious Crimes Down 6.7% for New York City

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
Continuing a decline that began last year, reports of serious crime in New York City dropped by 6.7 percent over the first four months of 1992, compared with the same period last year, the city's Police Department announced yesterday.
The new data were embraced by a department and a City Hall eager to document the benefits that they assert have been gained by recent investments in the Police Department -- namely the huge increase in police officers and the emphasis on community policing. And officials hope that these numbers will push the memory of 1990, when reported serious crimes hit an all-time high in New York City, into the distant past. 
 Most notably, murders dropped by 10.9 percent from last year, including a 22.9 percent drop in April. In all, five of the seven most serious crime categories showed declines. Robbery fell by 7.1 percent; burglary, 7.8 percent, and automobile theft, 11.7 percent.
But while the city's five boroughs each showed a decline, the trend throughout the city was uneven. For instance, while murders were down significantly in Manhattan, they rose in Queens. In addition, rape throughout the city went up 2.3 percent and aggravated assault rose 2.6 percent.
 
Mayor Walks a Beat
 Still, Mayor David N. Dinkins concentrated on the rosy news. He announced the new figures at a news conference at the 120th Precinct station house on Staten Island, which had the biggest overall crime drop of the boroughs, 10.6 percent. And later as the Mayor walked a Staten Island beat with officers, he did not mention that murders, rapes and robberies were up sharply in that borough.
"This decline in crime is very reassuring," the Mayor said. "But we cannot be satisifed. There is still far too much."
Thomas A. Reppetto, head of the Citizens Crime Commission, a nonprofit organization, said it appeared that the city was continuing to buck the national figures, which showed an increase in reported crimes in 1991. He said that while it was difficult to determine why the crime figures were going down, the best theory lay with the steady increase in police officers through the city's "Safe Streets, Safe City" program.
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown credited community policing specifically, but Mr. Reppetto said this was probably not the case because community policing would not go into full effect until 1993 and 1994. "It doesn't seem the drug culture is improving, and the economic problems are still there," Mr. Reppetto said, "so the only explanation I can make is that the numbers are the result of the overall policing of the city."
 
More Officers Deployed
 Much of the improvement in the most violent crimes was seen in midtown Manhattan, where the department has deployed many more officers. In murders, the Midtown North Precinct showed a 24.8 percent decrease while Midtown South had a 29 percent decline.
Throughout the city, the figures for the first four months of this year, compared with the first four months of last year, showed murders were down by 10.9 percent, from 707, to 630; forcible rapes, up by 2.3 percent, from 918, to 939, and robberies, down by 7.1 percent, from 31,496, to 29,260.
Aggravated assaults rose by 2.6 percent, from 19,523, to 20,034; burglary declined by 7.8 percent, from 36,741, to 33,885; larceny theft went down by 5.4 percent, from 78,287, to 74,060, and motor-vehicle thefts fell by 11.7 percent, from 45,912, to 40,537.
Over all, there were 199,345 reported serious crimes in the first four months, compared with 213,584 a year earlier.

Bonds Advance in Explosive Rally

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The bond market rallied explosively and long-term interest rates fell below 7.5 percent yesterday, furthering an advance that began on Monday.
A number of factors were behind the big move, traders and analysts said, including a sharp drop in a survey of consumer confidence. But foremost seems to be a nascent notion among investors that compared with other fixed-income securities, yields on Treasury bonds represent good value. 
 "One of our traders described this as a yield panic," said Bill Michaelcheck, a senior managing director in charge of the fixed-income department at Bear, Stearns & Company. "I don't know if this could further feed on itself, but as people see their opportunities to lock in comparatively high yields diminish, it causes them to make some decisions."
As Mr. Michaelcheck suggested, the decline in rates experienced since the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate and the overnight Federal funds rate earlier this month has had the effect of lowering yields on securities that are priced off Treasury securities, including coporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
 
Mortgage Traders' Fears
 Moreover, the decline in rates has touched off fears in the mortgage-backed market that securities will be called and prepaid. As a consequence, for the last few days mortgage-backed traders said accounts had been selling mortgages and buying intermediate- and long-term Treasury issues.
"There is a lot of prepayment concern," one mortgage trader said.
Up to now fears about inflation and a sudden rebound in the economy have made investors leery about taking positions in long-term Treasury securities. Indeed, despite their sharp drop yesterday, bond yields are still above the lows set in January, despite months of data showing that inflationary pressures are virtually nonexistent and that economic conditions remain sluggish.
Further evidence of that sluggishness was provided yesterday when the Conference Board's monthly survey of consumer confidence showed that attitudes about the present and the future soured sharply in July.
"The drop in confidence was rather stunning," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
 
'Economy Is Decelerating'
 Gail Fosler, the Conference Board's chief economist, was even more direct. "These numbers signal that the economy is decelerating," she said.
Noting that the survey was undertaken after July 2, the day the Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 3 percent, Ms. Fosler said: "It may be that these rate cuts will have an effect, but in the absence of job growth it is difficult for people to see real progress. And between now and the end of the year it is hard to see where job growth is going to come from."
The strong rally in the secondary market for Treasury securities provided a positive tone to an auction of $15 billion worth of new two-year notes. Before the sale traders had been worried that the auction would go badly, largely because short-term rates are so low.
But demand for the new securities was good, and bids at the auction produced an average yield of 4.29 percent, well below the 5.11 percent average yield at the last two-year note auction on June 23.
Despite the low yield, the new two-year notes performed well after the auction results were announced, and by late yesterday the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 4.26 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 106 3/4, up a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.43 percent, compared with 7.51 percent late Monday.
"Every time we get to levels like these, the market has faltered, even though the fundamentals suggested that long rates should be well below where they are," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "The question now is whether bond yields will go up again or continue to drop. I think the big test will come on Aug. 7, when the July employment numbers are released. If those figures show the economy is on a weakening trend, then I think you have a pretty good chance of punching through 7 percent."
Treasury note issues outstanding also did well yesterday, although not so spectacularly as bonds.
By late in the day, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes were offered at 106 11/32, up 13/32, to yield 6.60 percent. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 103 6/32, up 2/32, to yield 4.64 percent.
In the when-issued Treasury securities market, the new five-year notes to be auctioned today were offered at a price to yield 5.63 percent, compared with 5.66 percent late Monday.
The rally in the Treasury market had a salutary impact in the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets. Corporations priced more than $1.4 billion in new debt securities yesterday.
New-issue activity in the tax-exempt municipal market was also brisk. And traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said that prices of most widely quoted securities rose by about 5/8 point.

HEADLINE: Bank Rates Drift Lower In Week

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Interest rates on bank accounts drifted lower in the last week, as banks continued to adjust to the sudden drop in short-term interest rates announced by the Federal Reserve on July 2.
"Normally, it takes six to eight weeks for bank rates to fall after a Fed rate cut," said Robert Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication in North Palm Beach, Fla. But at a time when loan demands and the economy are weak, Mr. Heady said, banks have been adjusting their rates downward more quickly than normal. 
 Average rates on bank certificates of deposit have fallen more than 30- hundredths of a percentage point since July 1, and Mr. Heady estimated that declines of another tenth of a percentage point were likely unless the Fed pushed rates still lower.
 
Era of Single Digits
 Steady declines in interest rates have made double-digit yields a distant memory and cut rates on many bank deposits to less than half the level of a year ago. Interest rates of less than 4 percent, which raised eyebrows when they were introduced earlier this year, are being replaced at many banks by rates of less than 3 percent.
Mr. Heady noted that one of every five large banks across the country is now offering an interest rate of less than 3 percent for money market accounts.
The average rate for such accounts is now 2.97 percent, down from 3.02 percent a week ago and 3.23 percent on July 1. For six-month deposits, the average yield among large banks outside New York is 3.22 percent, down from 3.25 percent a week ago and 3.58 percent on July 1.
In the New York City area, banks paid an average of 2.86 percent for money market accounts, down from 2.90 percent, and 2.91 percent for three-month deposits, down from 2.97 percent.
As usual, savings institutions paid higher rates than banks, with an average of 3.29 percent for money market accounts, down from 3.33 percent, and 3.36 percent for three-month deposits, down from 3.39 percent.

Tenneco Has Strong Profit For Quarter

BYLINE: THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 28

 BODY:
Recording a turnaround in its long-troubled machinery unit and higher earnings at its five other businesses, Tenneco Inc. today posted a steep rise in profits in contrast to a loss in the second quarter last year.
Analysts said the profit surge validated the heavy layoffs, other cost-cutting moves and management changes that were taken by a new executive team led by Michael H. Walsh, who took command of the diversified Houston-based industrial company last September. 
 The company said net income rose to $178 million, or $1.23 a share, in contrast to a deficit of $14 million in the 1991 second quarter. The profit included $73 million from continuing operations, and $52 million recorded from asset sales.
Tenneco's share price rose $2.25, to $39.25, today in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sales were flat, at $3.4 billion in the quarter. Eli S. Lustgarten, a machinery analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said Tenneco's profit surge came exclusively from cost-cutting and improvements in business operations.
Mr. Walsh said in an interview that he did not expect sales and orders to rise measurably for the remainder of the year and added that the domestic economy appeared to be growing slowly, at a pace of about 2 percent for the year.
"I certainly don't see any widespread indication of strength" in the United States economy, he said. "Equally, I don't see us falling off the cliff."
The company's biggest improvement came in the Case Corporation unit, which makes agricultural and construction equipment and which faces tough competition in the United States and abroad. The unit, based in Racine, Wis., made money for the first quarter since the end of 1990, when it erred by stepping up production and forcing machinery into weak markets. It was later forced to slash prices and suffered huge losses.
 
Job Cuts and Cost Reductions
 The unit earned $11 million in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $123 million in the second quarter last year. It lost nearly $1 billion in 1991.
In remarks to reporters during a telephone conference after the earnings were announced yesterday morning, Mr. Walsh estimated that 40 percent of the $134 million improvement in operating income at Case compared with the second quarter last year came from job cuts and other cost reductions. Another 40 percent resulted from higher prices and the rest from "miscellaneous" things, such as reduced inventories, he said.
Case still faces difficulties and Mr. Walsh did not rule out the possibility of auctioning Case. He said sales were "terrible," and have plummeted beyond expectations in North America.
Charles S. Harris, an industry analyst and senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Company, said demand for large tractors plunged 31 percent in the first half of the year compared with the first half of 1991, and orders for four-wheel-drive tractors and combines were off by 38 percent, and 49 percent, respectively.
Case lost $66 million in the first half this year, and Mr. Walsh said it would lose money for the year over all. Factory output would be pared by an additional 9 percent in the current quarter he said. "We were not able to cut production as fast as the market was dropping" in the first half of the year, he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Weak Report; Gold Prices Rise Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday in global currency trading after the release of disappointing data on the United States economy.
Gold prices rose worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $358.90 an ounce, up $1 from Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York said gold rose $1.45 an ounce to a late bid price of $359.25. 
 Analysts said the dollar was lower in overseas markets and continued to decline in choppy trading after the release of a report that showed consumer confidence in the United States economy plunged in July.
The data, outlined in a report issued by the Conference Board, aroused new speculation that the Federal Reserve would be forced to ease United States interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
Trading was hectic in early domestic dealings and then tapered off, which is typical of summer activity. Dealers are awaiting further Government reports on the state of the economy, which will come tomorrow with the release of data on second-quarter gross domestic product, weekly jobless claims and new-home sales.
In New York, the dollar settled at 127.45 yen, down from 127.50 yen on Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 127.35 yen, down 0.82 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.70 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.9305 in New York from Monday's $1.9190. In earlier London trading, the pound rose to $1.9285 from $1.9155.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4725 German marks, down from 1.4808; 1.3035 Swiss francs, down from 1.3105; 4.9730 French francs, down from 5.0025; 1,114.50 Italian lire, down from 1,121.25, and 1.1871 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1881.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, included: 1.4735 German marks, down from 1.4835; 1.3040 Swiss francs, down from 1.3135; 4.9790 French francs, down from 5.0085; 1.6625 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6725.

Swaps Markets: How Much Risk?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
JUST how risky are currency and interest rate swaps? A new study, done at the request of swap dealers, indicates that losses in the growing industry have been rare, but that they still amount to more than $358 million.
The losses represent a tiny part of the trillions of dollars of swaps that have been written, and most of them came from one well-publicized problem: a decision by British authorities that allowed local governments to back out of interest-rate swap arrangements. 
 In the simplest form of interest-rate swap, one party agrees to pay the other's fixed interest rate obligations on a loan of, say, $200 million, while the other agrees to pay floating rates on a similar loan. In the minimal reporting of swap dealers, that swap would be reported as having a "notional principal amount" of $200 million, although the most either party could lose, in case of default, is a small fraction of that amount.
The study, to be released at a swaps conference in New York today, is intended to counter fears expressed by many regulators and others that swaps -- a huge market about which only a little is disclosed to the public -- represent some sort of ticking bomb for the financial system.
"Swaps are a bright spot in the financial system," said Mark Brickell, a managing director of J. P. Morgan and a director of the International Swap Dealers Association, which sponsored the study. "Involvement in swap transactions has improved the average credit quality and diversity of credit risks to which banks and securities firms are exposed."
The fear of problems in the swaps market has been seized upon by futures exchanges in a continuing battle in Washington to try to scale the market back. The exchanges fear that that effort is eating into their own growth and are resisting legislation that would make it clear that the swaps markets -- as opposed to the individual participants in it -- are exempt from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
William F. O'Connor, the president of the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest futures exchange, referred in a speech last month to the possibility of a "major meltdown" and complained that the swaps markets "have a leg up on the exchange-traded markets because there is no self-regulation, and there is no oversight authority." He added, "Basically, anything goes."
Both swaps and futures represent a way to transfer various types of risks. But whereas futures contracts are regulated by the C.F.T.C., with volume limits, margin rules and disclosure of trading prices, swaps are negotiated over the counter, with only the most minimal disclosure.
The swaps markets grew rapidly in the 1980's, but have slowed a bit. The notional principal amount of outstanding interest rate swaps contracts at the end of last year was $3.1 trillion, while the volume of currency swaps was $807 billion, according to new figures. In the simplest form of currency swap, one party agrees to pay a fixed amount of dollars while the other agrees to pay a fixed amount of another currency, like German marks.
During the final six months of 1991, volume of new interest-rate swaps was $860 billion, 13 percent more than in the prior period, while volume of new currency swaps was $167 billion, an increase of just 4 percent.
Recently, market participants say, the rapid growth in the swaps market has been in the areas of commodity and equity swaps. But the swap dealers association has never released figures on those.
In the new study of losses, Arthur Andersen & Company surveyed firms representing about 70 percent of the swaps market, or a total notional principal amount of $3.1 trillion. The losses in all the swaps in the study was $358 million, or about one-hundredth of 1 percent of the notional principal amount.
In fact, that percentage grossly understates the losses as a percentage of the amount risked. One way to measure that is to add up the gross mark-to-market value of outstanding swaps, or what it would cost to liquidate them. That figure is $77.5 billion, so losses came to less than one-half of 1 percent. The swap dealers association contends that compares favorably with the experience of banks in making loans, and argues that there is no need for additional regulation of the swaps market.
Whether the experience of dealers not surveyed, or in swap deals done in the future, will be the same is not possible to ascertain from the study.
The study showed $178 million in losses from swaps with the British local authorities, which were allowed by a House of Lords decision to walk away from losses on the ground that the local governments lacked the power to enter into deals.
An additional $95 million of losses came in dealings with nonfinancial corporations, while there were $20 million in losses from deals with savings and loan associations and $63 million involving other financial institutions. And about $3 million came in losses from swaps with other types of governmental authorities.

HEADLINE: Toward Solving the Mystery Of the American 'Stroke Belt'

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
In medieval times, apoplexy was a death that reflected the character of great and angry men, like Shakespeare's Henry IV. In modern times, strokes are more likely to reflect ancestry and way of life. Salty diets, high fat intake, smoking and genetic predisposition, especially in the case of blacks, all increase the risk of hypertension and stroke.
But even with all that is known, a stubborn geographical puzzle is etched in the statistics of a disease that is the third leading killer in the United States, after heart disease and cancer. More than any leading cause of death, strokes have had a place to call home: the American South. 
 For more than three decades, a chain of states from tidewater Virginia to Oklahoma has been known to researchers as the "Stroke Belt." Known, but not entirely understood.
 
Missing Puzzle Pieces
 There are many explanations why the brain's blood vessels constrict, leak, burst or otherwise deny the brain vital oxygen more often in the South than elsewhere. Diet and heredity are the two most frequently cited, However, "When you look at the death rates, the factors involved only explain a certain proportion of what's going on," said Dr. Diane Wagner, a researcher for the National Center for Health Statistics who has studied racial, geographic and economic differences in stroke mortality.
Yes, there are far higher concentrations of blacks in the populations of the affected states, and blacks are almost twice as likely to die of strokes as whites.
But 1988 data for stroke mortality among nonwhites, a group that is more than 80 percent black, indicate that minorities in the South die of strokes 50 percent more often than members of minority groups in the West and Northeast, and 30 percent more often than minorities in the Midwest. These data are adjusted to compensate for age differences among various populations.
Yes, the states involved include some of the poorest regions in the country, with the least educated populations, and both poverty and low educational attainment increase the risk of stroke.
But Edward J. Rocella of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, says doctors in the Southeast generally give their patients standard treatments for hypertension, with apparently diminished results.
And yes, the words "Southern fried" tell you all you need to know about the fat content of the regional cuisine.
 
Doctor's Detective Work
 That is where matters stood when Curtis Hames, a doctor in rural Georgia, got interested in the problem.
Dr. Hames who recently retired as a general practitioner along Georgia's rural coastline, started looking at the state's mortality figures in the late 1950's. "I noticed marked differences," he said. "The stroke death rate in south Georgia was double that in north Georgia."
Around the same time, some neighbors near his home in Claxton started a chicken farm with 50,000 birds. About 30,000 chicks soon died. Dr. Hames wondered if the two phenomena might share the same cause.
Inquiries at the University of Georgia's agriculture department revealed that coastal areas were deficient in the trace element selenium.
Selenium, like iodine, is found in minute quantities in much of the earth's soil. But in several areas this trace element is almost absent: northern China, southern Finland, New Zealand and the southeastern United States. In both China and Finland, the deficiency is a prime suspect in high levels of heart disease.
Dr. Hames, working with the United States Geological Survey, found that selenium and other trace elements had been stripped from the soil in those sections of the country that collided with the African continent about 200 million years ago and were later washed by shallow seas.
 
Role of Selenium
 Putting that evidence together with new details about selenium's role in digestion, he investigated whether selenium deficiency could be a contributing factor in the high rates of hypertension. As the body's metabolism breaks down foods into their molecular components, selenium helps prevent damage to blood vessel walls by harnessing incompletely metabolized molecules.
Studies in Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina are still going on to find the link between incomplete metabolic processes and hypertension. Dr. Hames said some multiple vitamin manufactures now add selenium to their products. Herbert Langford, a professor of medicine at the University of Mississippi, was also a leader in investigating the role of trace elements, including selenium, cadmium and calcium, and their role in controlling hypertension. Dr. Langford died of a stroke last year.
"We don't really know the answer," Dr. Hames said. "We're still in the formative stage of trying to develop new concepts to adequately explain these differences. The results are not in. The stroke rates are coming down around the country, but the ratios are still the same between Georgia, the South and the rest of the country."

HEADLINE: Stirring the Pot With: Ella Brennan;
In a Restaurant Family, Big Mama's the Boss

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
ELLA BRENNAN was enraged. Despite everything her family, the restaurant dynasty, could muster, a casino may be built in New Orleans. A law allowing gambling was passed in spite of the family's lobbying, in spite of the community resistance they organized, in spite of every favor the Brennan family called in. Miss Ella was enraged.
It was early June. The state legislature had just approved the motion. The telephone at the family's flagship restaurant was ringing as usual. But the tape-recorded message that sometimes greets callers -- a praline-sweet "Hello! You've reached Commander's Palace! I'm busy right now, but if you just hold on I'll be right with you!" -- was playing more than usual. Miss Ella had her two grown children and a passel of nieces and nephews studying the legislative record. No one was free to answer the telephone. 
 "I want to know how every one of them voted!" said the 66-year-old doyenne of New Orleans dining. She sounded like Big Mama in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." Her black silk tunic and trousers flapped furiously. A red rage was beginning to burn through the pale pancake makeup that usually keeps her looking cool.
"I'm going to pour salt in their soup!" she said. "What're they trying to do to this town!" Then she lowered her voice.
"I was hellin' and damnin' after the vote and then my nephew Ralph told me that I have to be a lady: stop cussing and get enraged," she said. "So I'm enraged. We are enraged. We're ladies and gentlemen. We're the Brennan family. But we are enraged about what they are trying to do to this town. Get it, y'all?"
Visible wrath from Miss Ella, as everybody calls her, is about as frequent as an Arctic breeze in the logy, jasmine-scented air in New Orleans. Since 1942, when her oldest brother, Owen, bought a bar in the French Quarter, Miss Ella has been the matrix of a family that embodies a certain New Orleans, a city that's swamp-flat, thick-aired and hard-drinking, where morality is a blend of Catholicism and voodoo and where slow, gracious courtesy is more important than anything except maybe your mama, eating and jazz.
Since its beginning 50 years ago, the Brennan business has endured failures in restaurants it opened in Atlanta and Dallas. The family survived deaths and a rift that left the children of the late Owen about as disposed toward their aunts and uncles -- Adelaide, John, Ella, Dick and Dottie -- and their 11 children as the Hatfields were disposed toward the McCoys. Since 1974, when the feud split the business, Owen's children -- Pip, Jimmy and Ted -- have run the family's original restaurant, Brennan's, on Royal Street.
At the same time, Ella, Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John took over Commander's Palace in the Garden District and built it into one of the 10 top grossing restaurants in the United States. Adelaide, who did not have children, died in 1983. Ella, Dick, Dottie and John continued to run Commander's and built five other restaurants -- Mr. B's, Palace Cafe and Ristorante Bacco in New Orleans, Brennan's and Third Coast in Houston.
When Miss Ella was a teen-ager working at her brother's bar, the eating and drinking business in New Orleans generated less than a million dollars a year. Today, it is a $1.2 billion industry. And most credit the Brennans.
The family packaged the Creole mystique and pushed it into the American mainstream. "Bananas Foster" was invented during Miss Ella's reign at Brennan's; so was "Breakfast at Brennan's," the prototypical American brunch. Paul Prudhomme got his start at Commander's Palace. The Brennans preserved a bastion of civility, where good eating is de rigueur, as much as telling long, vivid stories.
"They made New Orleans an eating destination," said Jim Funk, executive vice president of the Louisiana Restaurant Association.
In the process, they developed social, financial and political bonds far beyond New Orleans. The Brennans are the Kennedys of the Big Easy. Miss Ella is not just the matriarch. She is also the grande dame of New Orleans, full of raucous, Southern tales and self-deprecating humor.
Late at night, after entertaining the usual crowd of writers, actors, politicians and local gentry at Commander's, after leading them through the restaurant's backyard into the Victorian mansion she shares with her sister, Dottie, Miss Ella picked up the telephone. Several guests had begun to yawn over their aged bourbon.
"This is Miss Ella," she said into the phone. "Can you send over a couple cabs, darlin'?" No last name. No address. No wait. The taxis arrived before Miss Ella finished telling about her most memorable moment of motherhood.
"It was Saturday and the kids were little and I thought it was about time I drove them to their horseback-riding lessons," she said.
"I pile my two kids, John's three, Dick's two and Dottie's three into the back of the big black Cadillac and drive them over the river. They have their riding lessons and they all want cherry ices and candy and I buy them all that garbage, put them back in the car and start home. Well, out of nowhere comes this truck and I slam into it and -- this is before seatbelts, y'all -- the kids and the ices and the candy go flying.
"I jump out of the car and yank open the back door and all I see is red everywhere, a big pile of cherry-red kids. Of course, I think they're bleeding to death, they have M & M's and Sugar Daddies plastered all over them like guts, and I think, 'Great, Ella, you killed all the kids.' "
Only the car was totaled. The children were fine. Today, two of John's children, Ralph and Cindy Davis, run Mr. B's and Bacco, and his daughter Lally Brennan is Ella's deputy. John's son Tommy is a stockbroker.
Ella's son, Alex Brennan-Martin, runs the family restaurants in Houston, and her daughter, Ti Martin (short for "petite Adelaide"), works at Palace Cafe, along with Dick's daughter, Lauren Brower, his son Dickie and Dottie's son Bradford Bridgeman.
Daly Bridgeman, Dottie's oldest son, is a bicycle messenger. "We call him our free spirit," Cindy said. Dottie's daughter, Brennie Baumer, runs Brennan Travel. "We travel a lot for the business," Lally said.
John Messervey, a senior consultant with the National Family Business Association, a consulting company in Lake Forest, Ill., said, "I've never seen such a disciplined, tightly bonded family, and there is no doubt that Miss Ella has created and fosters that."
Miss Ella was the daughter of Nellie Brennan and Owen Edward Brennan Sr., who worked in the New Orleans shipyards. She grew up in the Irish Channel section of New Orleans when there was still a streetcar named "Desire," and little girls grew up to be debutantes and ladies always wore white gloves.
"Most girls went to finishing school," Miss Ella said. "I went to Cafe Lafitte." Most girls also got married, and Miss Ella did too, briefly, to Paul Martin, whom she divorced 25 years ago. But few belles hung out in cafes or worked. Most buried themselves in their children, which wasn't exactly Miss Ella's style.
"The mothering instinct used to strike Ella about as much as the urge to exercise," said her daughter, Ti. "She says when she gets the urge to exercise, she just sits down and waits until it passes. I'm not saying she wasn't a good mother. She was a great mother. She hired great help, and when she was there, she was there 200 percent. But she wasn't exactly the typical New Orleans mother of her time."
By her mid-30's, when she had her children, Miss Ella's world had already expanded. At Cafe Lafitte she had met Leon Uris, Charlton Heston, Lillian Hellman, Tennessee Williams, Lucius Beebe, the famous bon vivant, and Max Kriendler, who owned the "21" Club in New York.
"Before the jet plane, there was no jet set, darlin' -- there was Cafe Lafitte," she said. "Everybody was there. "And there I was, this little girl off a bayou, big eyes, big ears and a big mouth in the making."
She was in high school when Owen and their father opened Brennan's on Royal Street. "There we were, this bunch of upstart Irishmen, up to our tails in the restaurant business, knowing nothing," Miss Ella said.
She never went to college. She never dreamed of being the Queen of Mardi Gras. "I wasn't pretty," she said. "Even before I got fat and old, Omar the tent maker made all my clothes." But she may have dreamed of doyennedom. She was groomed by the kindness of strangers. Thanks to Mr. Beebe, the Irish immigrant's daughter acquired worldly airs. Mr. Kriendler taught her how to coddle customers and to give family and employees alike "the look," the icy blue-eyed gaze with which Miss Ella still greets any misstep in serving customers.
"We did everything wrong we could possibly do wrong and we made a lot of friends along the way," is how she explains the family's success. In 1960, Mr. Beebe attributed their success to "an absolute, all-out and overwhelming dedication to perfectionism." The family had carved a niche alongside New Orleans institutions like Antoine's and Galatoire's.
Today that world is changing. Miss Ella pushed her brother Dick to computerize the business. When the national diet began to change, she pushed her chef, Emeril Lagasse, to lighten Creole dishes.
"Every day, Ella was pushing, making you laugh, making you better, more responsive to the world, less a prisoner of yourself," said Mr. Lagasse, who has since left Commander's and opened his own restaurant, Emeril's.
Meeting the challenges of technology and the changing diet, creating restaurants that can thrive in a tight economy, herding her family through a change of guard -- these are the sort of things Miss Ella calls "hannalable," as in, "y'all can hannal that, can't ya?"
But gambling is something else. Gambling endangers her New Orleans.
"They're calling me a crusader," she told a group of dinner guests. "For 50 years I've said it's not the restaurateur's place to make a stand and risk alienating customers. But I love this business and this town too damned much to watch it go down the drain."
The guests, including a politician, a fund-raiser and a journalist, had been eating and drinking and talking for hours. They'd talked about business and politics and movies and Ellen Gilchrist, the local writer. They'd savored crayfish, debated the merits of California wines and discussed the latest creations of Omar the tent maker. By midnight, they were bound by a rosey, intimate glow. Ties had been loosened, high-heeled shoes had been kicked off.
And suddenly, it was very clear what scares Miss Ella. She's spent half a century buffing the image of a certain New Orleans. A place where Sazeracs and shoefly pie and file gumbo are accessories to the main event: good talk.
"They're still going to eat if they come here to gamble," she said. "They're still going to drink. But what does a man at a slot machine need another person for? Nothing.
"He's relating to the slot machine. Nobody's lingering. Nobody's savoring. It's the absolute end of society as we know it. Aisles and aisles of people talking to slot machines. Get it, y'all?"

HEADLINE: A Serious Effort To Present Mexico's Regional Cuisines

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
TWO and a half years ago, when restaurants were responding to a weakening economy by grafting informal bistros onto fancier places, Rick and Deann Bayless did the reverse. The owners of Frontera Grill, a bare-table Mexican restaurant in the River North section of Chicago, opened Topolobampo, possibly the most elegant and serious Mexican restaurant in the country.
At a time when much of the Mexican food served north of the Rio Grande still consists of combination platters glued together with melted cheese and refried beans, the Baylesses make it a point of challenging the palate with the likes of pheasant almendrado, in a typical Oaxacan sauce of almonds, tomatoes, sweet spices, raisins, olives and pickled jalapenos, served with braised quelites, Mexican greens. It is typical of the restaurant's robust, colorful and unusual food. 
 In July, they have gone further out on a limb with a Yucatan menu based on dishes seasoned with ground pumpkin seeds, achiote (annatto seeds) and habanero peppers that they sampled on a trip to the Yucatan with 18 members of their staff.
Exotic Yucatan specialties have been added to the repertory. "It's a cuisine based on Mayan, not Aztec, tradition, and the spicing tends to be less fiery," Mr. Bayless said. A soft-spoken man with a degree in anthropology and linguistics from the University of Michigan, he is the executive chef of both Topolobampo and Frontera Grill. Mrs. Bayless runs the dining rooms.
On the menu are a giant tamale of fresh masa filled with greens, pumpkin seeds and egg, grilled breast of capon in a thick Mayan herb and spice sauce and a jicama salad, called xec (pronounced shek).
When it comes to Mexican dining, Topolobampo is not about the obvious. The name of the restaurant itself does not exactly trip off the tongue. Topolo what? "It's a small fishing village on the west coast of Mexico," Mr. Bayless said. And for those who have not explored every corner of Mexico the way the Baylesses have, he added, "Topolobampo is also the end of the line for the famous railway that travels the copper canyon, and it's the port for ferries coming from Baja California."
The restaurant, whose walls are hung with the work of Mexican artists, not pinatas and sombreros, shares its entrance with the Frontera Grill. It is softly lit by hand-wrought black iron chandeliers, and its tables are covered in linen and set with handsome pottery dishes placed on large, hammered-copper chargers.
In a business fueled by trends, the Baylesses have succeeded largely by ignoring them. "I have resisted the temptation to serve any pasta or any popular contemporary creations like Mexican pesto made with coriander instead of basil, Mexican pizza baked on a giant sopapilla or other touches that are more Southwestern than truly Mexican," he said.
Flying in the face of nutritional correctness, he uses lard, custom-rendered by a local butcher at high heat to give it more intense flavor.
"Each region has fabulous dishes, but most are not really suited to restaurant cooking, especially in a fairly formal place in a city," he said. "There are cooking traditions in Mexico that go back hundreds, even thousands of years and are still maintained. On this trip to the Yucatan we spent an entire day watching the preparation of the traditional cochinita pibil, seasoned pork wrapped in banana leaves and cooked slowly for hours in a pit lined with rocks. It was a revelation. And the meat, with its smoky taste, was far more delicious than anything you could do by adapting the technique to a regular oven."
His wish list now includes digging a pit for cochinita in the back of the restaurant and holding a Yucatan fiesta.
Despite the presence of large Mexican populations in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, there is still a decided lack of restaurants serving serious regional cooking in a gracious setting. It's a little like the state of Italian-American food with spaghetti and meatballs some 30 years ago. And it's a gap that Topolobampo is filling with great style.
"I started with Frontera Grill because I could cook renditions of food that people already understood, like enchiladas, tacos and quesadillas," Mr. Bayless said. "But I always wanted to be able to do the more traditional slow-cooked regional dishes."
The Baylesses appear to have found an audience more than willing to fill the 45 comfortable seats in their restaurant. As for any competition, "I'm still waiting," Mr. Bayless said.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
THE long arm of America's preoccupation with nutrition has reached across the Atlantic to Hungary, a country with the dubious distinction of having the highest heart-attack rate in the world.
The Soros Foundation, created in the early 1980's to support dissidents in Central Europe, is turning its attention to health education in that part of the world. Its efforts are being directed toward nutrition, smoking, alcohol and drugs, sex and AIDS. 
 Attempts to change people's eating habits in Hungary coincide with Hungarians' inability to buy as much meat as they had bought during the Communist regime. The conversion to a free-market economy has sent prices soaring. And pork, which is very fatty in Hungary and is a staple of the diet, has become too expensive for most Hungarians.
"We are eating less pork and less beef and more chicken," Ferenc Muller said while shopping in an open-air market in Budapest in May. "Now it is 50 percent chicken instead of 80 percent pork. There are things in the market I am going to forget, like asparagus, despite the fact that I am a university professor."
But Dr. Muller was not totally discouraged. "On the other hand," he said, "cooking has become more interesting. We had never eaten Chinese before; now we do."
In April, the Soros Foundation sponsored a workshop in Budapest on nutrition and health education. The initial response from those with whom the foundation would work was skeptical. "You can't do that here," they had told Elizabeth Lorant, the executive director of the foundation in Hungary. "We don't have enough food."
It's not so much a lack of food as it is high prices. Unlike some Eastern European countries, Hungary has a rich agricultural tradition, and vegetables and fruits in season are much more reasonably priced than meat.
"We eat less and less meat and chicken," said Lajosne Hegyi, a shopper at the market. "Earlier, we had it twice a week; now, once a week or less. I used to buy meat by the kilo; now I buy it in slices. Instead, I use cottage cheese and eggplant and sour cream, and I use more eggs."
In Hungary, even those who cannot afford meat get plenty of fat. "Very poor people spread lard on bread," Ms. Lorant said in an interview in New York. "In Hungary, well-being consists of eating as much meat as possible. It's a sign of affluence."
It used to be that way in the United States, too.
Much to the surprise of the nay-sayers, the foundation's nutrition-education program found a receptive audience. "It was an explosive success," Ms. Laurent said, "due to the methods used to teach: the interaction, the demonstrations. Modern teaching methods had not been used over there before. The feedback has been tremendous."
So great that Hungary's National Institute of Public Health asked the foundation to arrange a follow-up workshop for 500 teachers in August. The institute plans to introduce the nutrition curriculum to 500 schools this fall.
One of the most successful components of the program was the cooking demonstration, which translated the theory into something edible.
Ms. Lorant sent along two recipes for dishes that have been reworked: one for lecso, or peppers and tomatoes; the other for gulyas soup.
The traditional lecso recipe calls for lard instead of oil and is often served with sausage. In this version, which is similar to one in "The Cuisine of Hungary" by George Lang (Atheneum, 1971), the lard has been replaced by olive oil, and chicken breasts, cooked in apple juice, have been substituted for sausage.
In the gulyas, which is a soup in Hungary instead of a stew, a very lean cut of beef has taken the place of chuck, additional vegetables have been added, and once again lard has been replaced, this time by corn oil.
Since American nutritional practices are more advanced than Hungarian ones, the amount of chicken suggested in the lecso recipe could be reduced from 6 to 8 ounces a serving to 4 to 6 ounces; the amount of vegetables in both recipes could be increased. And a nonstick pan, which might be difficult to find in Hungary, would mean less oil in both recipes.
 
Chicken With Lecso
 
Total time: 30 to 35 minutes

 2 tablespoons olive oil
 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
 1 pound Italian frying peppers, thinly sliced
 3 large ripe tomatoes, diced

Reagan Redux

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
It's difficult to chart those moments when the unthinkable becomes the possible, and the possible becomes the certain.
And so it's hard to pick one event that turned George Bush into the underdog of his own incumbency. 
 It wasn't just Bill Clinton's acceptance speech or the Magical Mystery Tour he took cross-country with Hillary, who appeared possessed by the spirit of Nancy Reagan as she watched Bill with that isn't-he-grand gaze. It wasn't the questions about ditching the still-unqualified Dan Quayle or Mr. Bush's ill-conceived pop-off "Shut up and sit down" when he was heckled by the families of soldiers lost in Southeast Asia.
"A journey of a thousand miles," Lao-tze said, inadvertently describing a Presidential election, "must begin with a single step." One interesting step was a relatively quiet one, the announcement at the end of the Democratic Convention by Republican powermeisters that an opening night speech would be given by Ronald Reagan, and speculation that his theme would be America's place in the world community.
In theory it made perfect sense. The party is sent off on its mission by one of the most popular Presidents of the 20th century speaking on its strong suit, foreign policy, and on its nominee, his onetime Vice President. But theory would also hold that having Bill Clinton choose a Siamese twin running mate and then jump on a bus with him to sit on hay bales across America was about as dumb and hokey as a strategy could be. Theory only holds until practice proves that it is just plain wrong.
In theory, having people see Ronald Reagan as an icon of the party sounds obvious. Republicans look at the familiar face and feel the warmth of better days, surer victories.
But some Americans may see the beginning of the long, slow slide into the economic abyss that dominates this election. Even if they still see the Reagan glow, Mr. Bush will surely seem wan in its remembered luster.
Republicans may look at Mr. Reagan and see the aura of a get-tough foreign policy cast over both him and Mr. Bush. Few will care to recall Mr. Reagan's deposition in the Iran-contra affair, when he seemed to know less about his own policies than the attorneys did.
But it has become a truism that Americans don't care much about foreign policy when their freezers and wallets are half-empty. Perhaps there will even be a sense that Mr. Bush's much-vaunted foreign policy record is a chimera. Americans are not stupid; an attempt by the Republicans to claim the end of the cold war as their achievement will strain credulity, particularly for those who remember how uncertain Mr. Bush seemed in the first days of the Soviet coup last summer.
The gulf war will surely be invoked. There remain those who think it was a mistake from the beginning, and those who think the hostilities stopped too soon. Mr. Bush began going head-to-head with Saddam Hussein again this week, and contrasted "the experience, the seasoning, the guts" he has acquired in world affairs with that of his opponent.
But if he plans a Desert Storm II in the next 100 days, he had better make sure we understand why, and why now. This week at a truck stop in northeastern Pennsylvania, one driver said, "If something gets started, it'll just be for the election."
And a woman wrote to the local paper, "President Bush is now telling all the people who were backing Ross Perot that he hears us. Was his hearing aid turned off for the last four years?"
What's an incumbent to do if running on his record is a bust? One reason the questions about Mr. Quayle refuse to go away, other than the fact that he was a dreadful choice to begin with, is that the President looks used up these days, a man tired by the treadmill of the last four years. Problem is, some of the electorate are tired of that treadmill too.
The rumors about his health are constant, and so are the suggestions for cure-alls -- bring back Baker, fire Brady, go for the jugular. In theory some of these sound fine, but we already know that some of the old theories don't work. In practice, I'm doubtful of the benefits of Ronald Reagan, the ghost of conventions and policies past, the Grand Old Man who introduced us to hard times introducing us to George Bush this second time around.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Latest Bump on Campaign Trail: Republicans Berate a Bush Aide

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
After weeks of bad news, President Bush's campaign manager went to Capitol Hill today to assure House Republicans that everything would be fine soon and received a round of harsh criticism for for painting what the lawmakers saw as an unbelievably rosy picture of the campaign.
By the account of participants, the meeting changed from a cheerleading session led by Vice President Dan Quayle and the campaign manager, Frederic V. Malek, to the latest in a string of political bumps for the White House. This came on a day when the Bush team had planned to use a barrage of press releases and a revised campaign schedule to give the appearance of a reinvigorated campaign. 
 Mr. Bush today cut back a long Maine vacation that his advisers considered a political land mine. The White House announced that Mr. Bush, who will leave next Thursday for a campaign trip to California would spend the extra time on the trail instead.
 
Move to Counter Polls
 The schedule change was offered by aides as evidence of a toughening Presidential resolve in the face of Republican nervousness and continued gains in the polls by the Democratic nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
A new poll from California showed Mr. Clinton ahead by 34 points in the state with the most electoral votes.
As the President groped to regain control of his campaign, Mr. Clinton cut to what he said was the heart of Mr. Bush's shortcomings, the failure to accept responsibility for his actions.
"Beyond the trust issue, beyond the broken promises, beyond the bad economic policy, there is underneath all that an even more fundamental issue, and that is the failure of the President to assume responsibility for the future of this country," Mr. Clinton said in New Orleans. [Page A20.]
For his part, Mr. Bush avoided direct comment today on his intensified schedule and shortened vacation. But like other Presidents in political trouble, he embraced the story of Harry S. Truman's comeback in 1948.
"There was this battle against a do-nothing Congress," Mr. Bush told a White House reception on Tuesday evening. He added: "And the wonderful come-from-behind victory. Nothing like a story with a happy ending."
In another stinging if not totally unexpected development, George Will, the conservative commentator who has long tormented Mr. Bush, today published a column giving public voice to private suggestions among some radical conservatives that Mr. Bush should not seek re-election.
And reports that Mr. Bush was prepared to abandon his proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax to get other economic measures through Congress drew quick return fire from Capitol Hill. "That would be self-destructive to the point of absurdity," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip, who has long been at odds with Mr. Bush over taxes.
But it was mainly the acrimonious meeting on Capitol Hill and the new California poll that drew attention away from the campaign's latest effort to get moving again. The Bush headquarters put out a five-page list of fee and tax increases in Arkansas under Governor Clinton and accused him of attacking Mr. Bush while complaining himself about negative campaigning.
 
New Advertising Push
 Calling Mr. Clinton "the Pinocchio of this political season," Mary Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director, said, "In the bonfire of negative campaigning, Bill Clinton is an arsonist posing as a firefighter."
The Bush campaign also ran a full-page advertisement in newspapers across the country appealing for the votes of Ross Perot supporters, prepared commercials that will begin on Sunday, and sent Mr. Quayle to Capitol Hill to preach conservative fire to the House Republican Conference.
The Field Poll of California, taken among 679 registered voters from Wednesday through Monday, showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush by 62 percent to 28 percent. Most alarming for Bush strategists, it indicated that former Perot supporters were backing Clinton 4 to 1. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
With that sort of poll coming across the transom virtually every day, Republican strategists said the Bush campaign's burst of energy was fueled by what one called "an awakening hunger, driven by fear and by a sort of anger at what's happening."
Mr. Quayle appeared before the House Republicans just after the Republicans heard Mr. Malek, the campaign manager, urging them to be patient until the Republican National Convention in August, when he promised Mr. Bush would "make the speech of a lifetime" and the campaign would really get moving.
 
Not Fighting Yet
 Mr. Malek said Mr. Bush was simply following a strategy of appearing Presidential and was not ready to "take the gloves off yet," participants said.
Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who heads the conference, said both Mr. Malek and Mr. Quayle argued that President Jimmy Carter had peaked too early in his re-election campaign and that Mr. Bush planned to time his campaign to peak at the end of October, an approach that to many Republican strategists was disturbingly reminiscent of the way Michael S. Dukakis waited in vain in 1988 for his "October surge."
Mr. Quayle was warmly received, participants said, but Mr. Malek drew a blast of criticism.
The Republicans warned that Mr. Bush must push his campaign into full gear quickly.
"We may have a Catch-22 here, where the advisers are not asking the President to lead any charges and the President's not ordering them to create any battle plans and we just sit there on a mountaintop and watch the Clinton forces occupy village after village that we're going to have to retake once the combat starts," said Representative Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California.
 
Suggestions From Lawmakers
 Three members of the California delegation took the microphone and "Malek was the recipient of the flak that is the result of the bombs going off in all of our districts," Mr. Lewis said.
Mr. Malek did not dispute that the tone of the meeting was contentious, but he sought to put a good face on his experience. "The members had a constructive set of suggestions," he said, "and the three things I got out of it are we should take a tougher line on the Democratic Congress, we should really take a hard line on vetoing excessive spending bills and they would like to see economic growth and job creation the centerpiece of the campaign."
Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, said members of Congress, especially those in close Senate races, worry that if Mr. Bush hangs back, their chance will be diminished. "The Bush campaign is dead in the water," Mr. Green said.
Mr. Quayle's speech, Mr. Lewis and others said, was more of a "pep talk" in which he said Mr. Bush would run hard against the Democrats in Congress and drew a big laugh when he said Americans could be scared by the suggestion that Mr. Clinton would appoint Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Supreme Court because he was opposed to the death penalty.
Avis Lavelle, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, called the Republican accusations "old, old stuff that's been used against us by Republicans in Arkansas before and rejected by voters because they know it isn't true."
Conservative Republicans were giving Mr. Bush an even harder time than usual this week. Mr. Will wrote today that Mr. Bush should step down. "Clinton is soaring," he wrote, "because the Republican Party, as imperfectly exemplified by the Bush Administration and campaign, is tired and arrogant."
Burton Yale Pines, the chairman of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative organization, said many conservatives have been saying the same thing privately, although they do not expect it to happen.
He said many of them would end up voting for Mr. Bush, but he would be denied energetic conservative fund-raising and organizing efforts.

HEADLINE: Northeast Utilities Net Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BERLIN, Conn., July 29

 BODY:
Northeast Utilities, which provides electricity for much of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, has reported second-quarter profits increased 30 percent, largely because of a $15.8 million gain from its takeover of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire.
Second-quarter profits rose to $66.4 million, or 50 cents a share, from $50.9 million, or 46 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
 Revenue grew to $718.7 million from $637 million, the company reported Tuesday.
Without the gain from Public Service of New Hampshire, Northeast Utilities' net would have dropped to $43 million, or 33 cents a share. The gain included extra revenues collected from New Hampshire customers since January 1990.
Profits were hampered by the weak economy, cooler summer weather, and higher operating and maintenance costs, a spokesman said.
Compared with last year, retail electricity sales climbed in April and again in May, but dropped 6.5 percent in June in Connecticut and 7 percent in Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: Gain in Trade-Gap Talks With Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 29

 BODY:
Trade negotiators from the United States and Japan made some progress in efforts to reduce the trade imbalance between the nations, American officials said tonight. But in at least two key areas of concern to the Americans, the Japanese did not make any new commitments.
The talks, described as difficult by the American officials, were the second annual review of the Structural Impediments Initiative, a continuing process in which the two countries are telling each other how to reform their economies. 
 The idea is that making broad structural changes in both nations -- like opening up Japan's distribution system or improving American education -- will result in increased American exports to Japan without the need for separate trade agreements for each product or industry.
Although there were great hopes for the initiative when it was begun in 1990, Japan's trade surplus with the United States has grown since then and the initiative has seemed to lose some momentum. On his trip here in January, President Bush agreed with Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to try to reinvigorate the process.
At a briefing here tonight, senior officials said Japan had agreed to take some new steps, although they did not provide many details because the talks were not quite finished.
For instance, Japan has agreed to new measures to toughen enforcement of its antitrust law in an effort to fight bid-rigging and other collusive practices that tend to exclude foreign companies from the market. Japan also agreed to new measures to open its distribution system, like speeding up import procedures and weighing safety testing done abroad in considering whether to approve foreign products for sale in Japan.
American negotiators said they had failed to gain new commitments for additional public works spending, which the United States thinks would spur demand for imports. In addition, Japan did not agree to any new efforts to make land less expensive, which the United States believes would make it easier for American companies to set up factories and offices here and would also spur housing construction.
Japan, for its part, has become increasingly tough in its demands that the United States reduce the Federal deficit, improve education and manpower training, increase savings, promote exports, think long term, cut excessive executive compensation and reform the health-care system. Japanese officials believe, and some Americans business and Government officials agree, that Japan has done far more to carry out its commitments under the initiative than the United States has.
As part of this year's negotiations, for instance, Japan asked the United States to take action to eliminate the "Buy America" policies of some American companies and public agencies, calling such policies an unfair trade barrier.
"Instead of the Japanese attempting to mollify the U.S. with more promises and concessions, Japan is throwing the requests back into the teeth of the U.S. and adding a fillip of criticism," said John P. Stern, vice president of the American Electronics Association.
Japanese and American officials said the United States had agreed to press its efforts in many areas the Japanese have complained about.

HEADLINE: House Approves $1.73 Billion for Space Station

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The House voted today to keep $1.73 billion in the budget to develop the Freedom space station, rejecting arguments that the country cannot afford such high-priced scientific programs when the Federal deficit is out of control.
Proponents of the $30 billion space station argued that it would provide an indispensable stepping stone for exploring Mars and the outer heavens and would enhance biomedical research into the health complications of long-range space flight. 
 But the debate centered on the economic issues of competitiveness, jobs and budget priorities. Representative Bill Lowery, Republican of California, argued that Japan would take the lead in space research if Congress killed the space station, and that "in the year 2020 we will find ourselves tooling around in small space vehicles with names like Honda and Toyota."
In the end, the economic argument won as the House defeated, 237 to 181, a measure to strike the space station and appropriate $525 million to cover the costs of ending the program. The vote was on an amendment to an $86 billion appropriations bill, which was passed later in the evening on a vote of 314 to 92. It must now be considered by the Senate, which has yet to write its version of the bill.
Backing money for the space station were 110 Democrats and 127 Republicans. Opposing it were 142 Democrats, 38 Republicans and 1 independent.
The vote belied the rising concern in Congress over the budget deficit and indicated that many members were swayed by the promise of jobs.
As 7 percent of the nation's work force is employed in the aerospace industry, and that sector is one of the few that provides a trade surplus, a consensus is emerging that the space station can benefit the economy.
That argument could lead to a reversal of a vote last month to withdraw money for the superconducting supercollider, a huge particle accelerator under construction in Texas that is intended to answer questions about the basic building blocks of matter.
The Senate is leaning in favor of the collider, and it will probably support the space station as well when it considers it in the next few weeks.
But Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, called the space station an "orbiting tin can" that is forcing the country to "take out a $120 billion, 30-year mortgage on our nation's future."
She said the outlay came at a time "when we are already spending more on the interest on the national debt than the Federal Government spends on educating our children."
Several lawmakers said they wanted to vote for the space station but could not because of growing domestic needs and the Government's decreasing ability to meet them. Other opponents suggested that spending on the space station would absorb research money that would be better spent on less costly unmanned space flights.
 
75,000 Jobs Envisioned
 Countering such arguments were Republicans and Democrats from states with aerospace industries, who said the space station would create 75,000 high-tech jobs and promote advanced technologies producing new alloys. Proponents said investments in space had often produced advances in communications and medicine.
"We used to dominate the aerospace industry," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut. "We had 90 percent of the market. We now have 68 percent of the market with European competition. And the Russians, the Japanese and Taiwanese are poised to enter this critically important market."
When the space station was first proposed in 1984, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimated that it would cost $8 billion to assemble. Since then, the apparatus has been redesigned five times while delays and cost overruns have forced construction estimates to $30 billion or more. An additional $100 billion will be needed to operate the station over its lifetime.
Originally, the station was designed to be operated by a crew of eight, with a launching pad for exploring deeper into space. Now a crew of four and a laboratory are planned.

HEADLINE: Bayside's Popular Strip of Contention;
Bell Boulevard Is Known for Night Life -- and Trouble, Too, Queens Neighbors Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Around midnight, just as the crowd of revelers started to thicken, three young women emerged from a bar and swayed carefree along the tree-lined sidewalk, explaining in inebriated giggles that when it came to night life, nowhere, not even Manhattan, compared to Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens.
"You don't have the traffic, you don't have the drugs, you don't have the bums you have in Manhattan," one of them, Randy Schiffman, said. "It's a different class. You've got the suburbs coming here." 
 With two dozen bars lining the strip between Northern Boulevard and 35th Avenue -- from older Irish pubs like Donovan's and the Minstrel Boy to newer trendy bars like Forty O Five and the Palm Club -- Bell Boulevard has become the late-night strip for hordes of young people from the boroughs and suburbs.
To the young men and women in muscle shirts and primped hair who carouse the neighborhood, the boulevard is everything Manhattan is not -- a comparatively safe, friendly answer to the bar hopper's mantra, "No Cover, No Minimum."
"It's like a giant human pinball machine," said Robert Goodrich, the co-owner of T-Birds, one of the most popular bars. "You come here, you park your car, and you bounce from place to place to place."
But to many residents and shopkeepers, the killings of an off-duty police officer and another man after a barroom brawl on July 18 have confirmed their worst fears about the nightly transformation of Bayside's Main Street U.S.A. into something wild and surly.
While many of the strip's regulars say the killings were an isolated incident -- that Bell Boulevard remains the safest place in the city to party -- the residents maintain that the killings were the culmination of a steady increase in rowdiness, drugs and violence among the young bargoers.
"There isn't a lot of other things young people can do around here," said Helen Philbin, the district manager of Community Board 11, which represents Bayside. "There's only so many times you can go to the movies. Then you go to Bell."
In the two weeks since the killings, though, the crowds have thinned. Scores of police officers have swarmed the street, zealously issuing tickets and ordering those who linger on the sidewalk to move along. Stark WANTED posters hang in the shops and boutiques -- but not in the bars -- asking for information on the whereabouts of the suspect in the killings, a bouncer at the Palm Club.
The boulevard, lined with trees and quaint storefronts, has long been the social center of Bayside, a 300-year-old farming village that became a bedroom community -- and watering hole -- for movie stars and celebrities in the early decades of the century.
In recent years, however, the bars and restaurants have proliferated. The bar-hoppers, almost all of them young, working-class whites from as far away as Long Island and New Jersey, fill the strip almost every night, crowding the bars and noisily cruising the sidewalks.
"I come here every night Wednesday through Saturday, and occasionally on a Monday or Tuesday," Victoria Pantucci, who is 25 and lives in Bellerose, Queens, said as she sat in B. B. Jr.'s. "If I go out, I go to Bell."
 
Complaints From Residents
 As in other neighborhoods in the city, like Chelsea or the Upper East Side in Manhattan, where revelers' favorite late-night activity clashes with residents', the bars have irked those who live and work around Bell. They complain of congestion, incessant noise, litter and public urination. In recent years there have been increasing incidents of vandalism, assaults inside and outside bars and reports of drug dealing.
Jack N. Fried, who owns Benn's Hardware, the store his father, Benjamin, opened six decades ago, wistfully remembers when Bayside seemed pastoral -- a quiet, small town where farms abutted one side of Bell Boulevard.
As a young man in the 1950's, he hung out in a candy store that served egg creams. "Now, they come out of the bars, vomiting their guts up and saying, 'Boy, we had a good time,' " Mr. Fried said. "It's a different world."
Local officials have urged the police and the New York State Liquor Authority, which licenses the bars, to consider stricter controls on the nighttime revelry, though there is little they can do to keep bars from opening. Because Bell Boulevard is zoned for both commercial and residential use, owners can open bars or any other businesses. A bar owner needs only a liquor license.
The leaders of Community Board 11 have also urged the police to have a greater presence on the strip to create an atmosphere of intolerance toward any misbehavior.
Not everyone, however, agrees that the bars have caused the demise of Bayside. The bars, some say, have drawn a lot of business. While the rising rents on Bell Boulevard have forced small mom-and-pop stores out of business, the bars have quickly filled spaces that in other neighborhoods might remain vacant.
"There doesn't look like there's a recession on Thursday nights on Bell Boulevard," Sia Peters, the treasurer of the Bayside Chamber of Commerce, said. "We've gotten so many calls saying, 'No more bars! No more bars!' but it does not behoove us to knock down another business."
On the strip the other night, the regulars said that Bell Boulevard had gained its own momentum and that neither the killings nor any attempts to control it would keep the young people from coming.
At T-Birds, Mike Creco, the 32-year-old owner of a motorcycle shop who had driven from Port Washington, L.I., explained why he came.
"Look at this atmosphere," he said. "There's nothing like it in Long Island."
Across the street, outside the Palm Club, Kerry Bannon said she had driven from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, that night with three girlfriends. They often go to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn or, sometimes, to the Upper West Side, but none of that compares to Bayside's smorgasbord of night spots, she said.
"How could it get boring?" Ms. Bannon, 23, said. "There are different people in each bar."

HEADLINE: SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES TAX BILL

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee tonight approved a tax grab bag offering deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all workers, a new tax credit for some home buyers and a version of President Bush's plan to revitalize the nation's inner cities.
The bipartisan bill includes, in addition to the $2,500 home buyers' credit, several tax incentives for helping the economy that were in a measure Mr. Bush vetoed in March. The new legislation is missing the most disputed elements of that bill: a cut in taxes on capital gains, a middle-income tax cut and a tax increase on upper-income Americans. 
 The legislator was put together by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee. It was approved without opposition by the panel after less than three hours of debate.
Mr. Bentsen said the bill, worth about $30 billion over five years, took a series of positive steps "toward a goal we all share: long-term, sustained economic growth for workers and their families."
 
Money for 'Enterprise Zones'
 Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the panel, said the committee had "done a good job on this bill" even though the Administration would be far happier if it included a capital-gains reduction.
Many of the provisions have already been approved by the House as part of a $17 billion bill whose chief purpose was to offer tax incentives for businesses and investors to put their money into designated urban and rural "enterprise zones." Mr. Bush advanced that idea as part of the Government's response to the riots in Los Angeles.
The Senate bill would authorize 15 urban zones, eight rural and two Indian reservation zones. The Government would pay up to 40 percent of the wages of workers who live in a zone; businesses and investors would get preferred tax treatment on expenditures in a zone.
But the bill lacks what the Administration considers an essential element of enterprise zones, an exclusion from capital-gains taxes on profits from the sale of zone properties.
 
Provision on I.R.A.'s
 Other provisions in the Senate bill include these measures:
*Any worker regardless of income, would be allowed to set aside up to $2,000 a year in a tax-deferred Individual Retirement Account and deduct the contribution from taxable income.
*Luxury taxes on expensive yachts, furs, jewels and planes would be repealed; the 10 percent tax on luxury cars would be retained.
*A dozen special tax breaks that expired June 30 would be renewed, including a tax exclusion for up to $5,250 of employer-provided education assistance a year and a credit for investors in low-income rental housing.
*Savings bonds redeemed to pay expenses of higher education would be exempt from tax regardless of the owner's income.
*Businesses would be allowed additional accelerated depreciation for equipment bought this year; the alternative minimum tax on corporations would be eased, and real estate professionals would be permitted to use some losses from rental activities to shield wages and other income from taxation.
These and other parts of the bill would be paid for by raising taxes on securities dealers and by requiring upper-income individuals and corporations to accelerate payment of estimated taxes.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Accuses Bush of Dodging Responsibilities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 29

 BODY:
Weaving various threads of his attack on George Bush into a newly coherent and more deeply personal whole, the Democratic Presidential nominee, Bill Clinton, today accused Mr. Bush of the most basic of shortcomings, the failure to accept responsibility for his actions.
Mr. Clinton's speech here, although cast in carefully uninflammatory terms and delivered without histrionics, went subtly beyond the scope of most political oratory in attacking his opponent not for specifics of his Administration's actions but for his very nature. It indicates that the Democratic nominee understands that the contest between him and Mr. Bush will be an unusually personal one and is likely to pivot on the public's evaluation of the basic worth of each man. 
 "Beyond the trust issue, beyond the broken promises, beyond the bad economic policy, there is underneath all that an even more fundamental issue, and that is the failure of the President to assume responsibility for the future of this country," Mr. Clinton said.
"Four years ago, this President promised 15 million new jobs, no new taxes, and a kinder, gentler nation. But most of all he promised to be President, to accept responsibility. He said he saw life in terms of 'missions, missions defined and missions completed.' The mission for America was, and I quote, 'moving forward, always forward.' "
 
'Politics of Blame'
 As Mr. Bush's term is ending, Mr. Clinton said, "most Americans are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, unemployment now numbers 10 million Americans, 10 percent of the people are on food stamps." He added, "All Mr. Bush has to offer is the politics of blame and more of the same."
Mr. Clinton delivered his speech in a manner peculiarly understated, standing alone at a lectern set up in the middle of the vast empty floor of the Superdome here, surrounded by 70,000 empty seats, his flat, largely unemotional voice bouncing off the distant, dimly lighted ceiling.
But the venue, although breaking every rule of political space, was calculated to sharpen the edge of the Democrat's slashing message. It was here, at the Republican convention four years ago, that Mr. Bush delivered his most famous promise: "Read my lips. No new taxes."
Mr. Clinton referred several times to the "vast, cavernous" empty stadium, suggesting that he came on purpose to use the image of emptiness for what he called his opponent's empty promises.
Mr. Clinton built his attack on Mr. Bush on that, coming back to it several times. "When Mr. Bush stood here four years ago and said 'Read my lips, no new taxes,' what he meant to say was 'No new taxes for the rich,' " he said in one instance and expanded on that to draw a picture of the President as a chronic breaker of promises.
This sort of thing is not a new theme in Mr. Clinton's oratory, nor in Democratic speeches in general. Nor was it new for Mr. Clinton to denounce Mr. Bush for favoring the rich, ignoring the needs of the middle class or failing to take aggressive action to alleviate various ills of the nation.
What was new was Mr. Clinton's bringing the different points together to address the theme of personal responsibility, a theme that Mr. Clinton has often evoked in speaking of what Americans should do to address their problems.
 
'The Finger of Blame'
 Over and over, Mr. Clinton returned to this. He began by deriding Mr. Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, for saying, in Congressional testimony on Monday that the Administration bore no responsibility for the country's economic difficulties. "Mr. Darman," Mr. Clinton said, "pointed the finger of blame everywhere but at the Oval Office." He said Mr. Darman, Mr. Bush's top economic adviser, had blamed the Federal Reserve, the nation's lenders and Saddam Hussein.
Later in a speech at Lakefront Arena at the University of New Orleans, Mr. Clinton resumed the attack on the Administration as saying that none of the nation's economic problems are Mr. Bush's fault. "He refused to assume a shred of responsibility," Mr. Clinton said of his opponent. He added that Mr. Bush seemed to be saying, " 'What do you expect me to do, I'm the President of the United States?' "
In front of a wildly enthusiastic crowd of several thousand that prompted a livlier and more pointed attack on Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton compared his opponent's actions to those of other Presidents.
"Can you imagine F.D.R who said 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,' saying 'I can't get anything done because people won't let me.' Can you imagine Harry Truman with the sign on his desk, 'The buck stops somewhere else.' "
Recalling John F. Kennedy's embarrassing miscalculation in the Bay of Pigs invasion, he said: "J.F.K. didn't get up there and bellyache and whine. He got up there and said, 'It was my fault' and took responsibility for it. That's what Presidents do."
On a day so hot and steam-bath humid that Mr. Clinton soaked through his blue Oxford shirt five minutes into his first speech of the morning, he began a day of campaigning through Louisiana in an airplane hangar in Lake Charles, La., a heavily Democratic labor-union city deep in the southwestern section of the state's Cajun country.
Addressing more than 2,000 people who gathered to hear him there, Mr. Clinton developed the flip side of his message, that voting for him, and for the profound change a Clinton administration would represent after 12 years of Republican White Houses, was an acceptable risk.
The challenge for the Democratic nominee was evident in the reaction of Mark Judson, a 28-year-old judicial clerk who said he was not satisfied with Mr. Bush as President and came to hear Mr. Clinton today with the hope of hearing something that would move him to change party allegiance and vote for a Democrat.
But after the speech, as Mr. Judson assessed his reaction, he was not inclined to take the risk. "Clinton sounds really impressive," he said. "And I have to admit that the programs he proposes sound good. But I don't know if I have the guts to change. I'm just too afraid of the unknown. It's the image the Democrats have in my mind that they will try to get into my pocketbook and distribute my wealth, and I don't have any wealth to distribute."
"I think Clinton has done a lot in his campaign and in his public relations to appear in the mainstream," he added. "But I still think for me and for a lot of people when it comes to going into the voting booth, and pulling that lever, there will be a pretty small percentage of people willing to leap into the unknown. I know that that's what my voting decision has come down to."

Perot's Fiscal Medicine: Tastes Bad but Could Work

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The economic plan made public by Ross Perot after he decided not to run for President is a careful document that represents a consensus among economists on some policies to rejuvenate the nation's economy, while in the many areas where no consensus exists, it navigates a middle course between left and right.
In seeking to eliminate the budget deficit in five years, Mr. Perot seized upon the few policies where there is general agreement among liberal and conservative economists: reining in runaway spending on Medicare and Medicaid, slashing subsidies for large corporate farmers and making deeper cuts in the military budget. 
 To make American industry more competitive, Mr. Perot also made consensus recommendations, like extending the temporary tax credit for research and development and giving companies incentives to provide more training for the millions of youths who never go to college.
 
Fear of Slowing Economy
 But while most economists stressed the importance of cutting the deficit, some questioned the timing of Mr. Perot's proposals. These economists noted that with economic growth so anemic, cutting spending and raising taxes could further slow the economy.
"They admit that their proposals will depress the growth rate for a while," said Murray Weidenbaum, an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "That's frankly the last thing to do right now."
But because the divided economic community agrees on so few things, Mr. Perot's plan is full of proposals on which economists disagree. Some, like increasing income taxes and raising taxes on gasoline by 50 cents a gallon, anger the many conservatives who oppose tax increases. While other proposals, like cutting capital gains taxes, offend liberals who oppose what they see as tax breaks for the affluent.
"It's a middle-of-the-road plan," said Mr. Weidenbaum, a pragmatic conservative who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan. "It's an invitation for the candidates to make the tough choices that they don't want to make."
While many economists view the Perot plan as wise economics, they say it would hurt and anger so many Americans that it would be suicidal politics.
"I don't think anyone can accuse Perot of not bellying up to the bar on this," said Robert D. Reischauer, a Democrat who heads the Congressional Budget Office. "But it is easier to suggest these kinds of cuts when one isn't running for office."
But some economists say the Perot plan just might succeed politically because it offends left and right equally. They say it spreads the pain around in an equitable way, although the rich would be hit hardest.
The Texas billionaire calls for doubling tobacco taxes and restricting the deduction for mortgage interest to the first $250,000 of a mortgage. He also calls for increasing taxes on Social Security benefits to the richest recipients, a measure that would undoubtedly bring protests from the elderly.
"The idea," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard economics professor, "is not that any individual one of these elements attracts support across the board, but that if we combine all of them, then the whole package looks like a winner. If we go down the list and get something from everybody and it's roughly fair, then the hope is we're all willing to support it."
Mr. Perot's plan is receiving so much attention, analysts say, because it addresses a concern that more and more Americans seem willing to face up to: the rising budget deficit. Americans feel a growing anxiety that it is unwise and unfair to saddle future generations with the nation's $4 trillion debt, and they seem ready to hear what the Texan has to say on the subject.
To try to attack slow growth, Mr. Perot proposed $40 billion in new Federal investment in areas to make the nation more efficient, including highways, airports and telecommunications.
"The general thrust of the plan is to get the deficit to zero and to do so by having all participants share in achieving that goal," John P. White, the main author of the Perot plan, said in an interview. "We also want to encourage people through incentives to invest in America and create jobs, and if we do this we will have a much stronger future."
 
Saving $52.8 Billion
 For years, economists have stressed the importance of tackling Medicare and Medicaid costs, which are soaring by more than 10 percent a year. Recognizing this problem, the Perot plan proposes to save $52.8 billion in Medicare and Medicaid spending in the fiscal year 1998 through cost containment.
But the plan, like the Bush Administration's plan to cap spending on programs with automatic benefits for all those who qualify, fails to explain how it will rein in costs. Mr. White, who was a budget official in the Carter White House, said all segments of the health-care system would have to come together to work out a plan to end the cost explosion.
Echoing many economists, Mr. Perot's plan stated that many Government subsidies had little economic justification and existed mainly to provide benefits for particular groups. He proposed cutting subsidies to large corporate farmers and subsidies for rural electrification, which many economists say were needed in the 1930's but are no longer justified.
 
Areas of Sharp Dispute
 The Perot proposal generates far more heat when it strays into areas where there is little consensus -- like tax increases. Conservatives attack the plan, arguing that all new taxes are bad. Any plan to raise taxes will hardly reduce the deficit, they say, because Congress will use the tax increases as an excuse to increase spending.
Mr. Perot clearly came down on the side of centrists and liberals who argue that any serious plan to eliminate the deficit must contain tax increases. "The idea that there is a prayer of long-run success with the budget deficit solely on the spending side, that's an act of utter unrealism," said Robert Solow, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics who is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
While conservatives and centrists tended to praise Mr. Perot's proposed spending cuts, many liberals questioned their wisdom. Mr. Solow said, "I don't agree with his idea of cutting 10 percent across the board on many discretionary programs because that means all programs are equally deserving of cuts."

HEADLINE: Ford Posts $502 Million Net, But Stock Dips on Outlook

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 29

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company today posted a $502 million second-quarter profit, compared with a loss last year of $324 million, and its revenue rose 12.5 percent.
The results were Ford's best in two years, but company executives expressed caution, noting that the nation's economic recovery and those of key overseas markets remained fragile. And that caution was clear among investors, as Ford stock fell $1.50, to $44.25, in New York Stock Exchange trading, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 45 points. 
 The pretax earnings were higher than analysts had expected, and even after taxes they were within the range of forecasts. Initially, Ford shares rose. But a few hours later the stock was hit by a wave of selling.
Phil Fricke, an automotive analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, suggested that investors might have become nervous because Ford executives were not reassuring about earnings prospects for the third and fourth quarters.
Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, said in a statement, "It will continue to be difficult to achieve healthy results in today's environment." David McCammon, the vice president for finance, predicted in a news conference that third-quarter results, normally the weakest of the year, would be down from the second quarter.
Ford's results came one day after the Chrysler Corporation announced second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' forecasts. The General Motors Corporation, which is shut for a two-week summer vacation, is expected to announce financial results next week.
As the economy has strengthened, retail auto sales have improved, but they remain at a generally weak level. Still, demand has been strong enough to permit the Big Three to reduce their outlays for rebates. The auto makers have also been able to reduce sales to daily-rental fleets, which keep factories busy but usually yield little or no profit.
 
Benefit to Workers Seen
 The growing retail demand has been good news for auto workers. Mr. McCammon said Ford factories would be operating at 100 percent of straight-time capacity, not counting shutdowns for model changes. If Ford remains profitable for the entire year, he said, workers will receive a profit-sharing bonus early next year for the first time in three years.
Ford's profit equaled 93 cents a share of common stock and came on revenue of $26.84 billion, up from $23.85 billion in the comparable quarter a year ago.
Net income consisted of $213.1 million from worldwide automotive operations -- $148 million of which was profit from American auto operations -- and $289.3 million from financial services, principally the Associates and Ford Motor Credit.
Worldwide factory sales of vehicles in the second quarter rose 6.1 percent, to 1.7 million, compared with 1.5 million a year earlier. Factory sales in the United States rose 11.9 percent, to 942,000, while factory sales elsewhere fell less than 1 percent, to 698,000 from 703,000. Revenue and profit are based on factory sales to dealers.
Ford's share of the retail car market in the United States rose almost a full percentage point to 21 percent, primarily reflecting the strength of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable models. Ford's share of the American retail light-truck market also rose almost a full point to 29.7 percent, because of strong demand for the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle and other models.
But Ford said its European market share dropped slightly to 11.7 percent because of weak sales of the Sierra, which is due to be replaced by a new model. Ford's European light-truck share rose to 12 percent, up 1.5 percent.
Jim Alexandre, the automotive analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said Ford had told analysts at midday that automotive demand in Germany was weakening. He also speculated that Ford's tax rate, which was far higher than anticipated by Wall Street, could have negative effects on earnings next year. Mr. Alexandre said he was keeping his buy recommendation, however.
Mr. McCammon said Ford spent about $900 a vehicle in rebates and incentives in the quarter, compared with $1,000 in the first quarter and $950 a vehicle a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Running Mate;
Polished and Focused, Gore Is Settling Into His New Role

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 29

 BODY:
Four years ago, when Senator Al Gore first ran for national office, he was as leaden on the hustings as a wintry sky, droning on interminably at every stop. He was forced to quit the race long before the primaries ended.
But in Campaign '92, there is a new Al Gore -- crisper, animated, more to the point, leavened with a bit of impish humor. 
 Mr. Gore and his hastily assembled staff have already smoothed out most of the early logistical problems inherent in flying from rally to rally to rally, day after day after day, jumbled together in careening limousines, vans and a chartered red, white and blue Boeing 727.
 
Full of Zingers
 More to the point, Mr. Gore himself has pretty well worked out his standard stump speech, one that whacks the Bush Administration for domestic and foreign commissions and omissions, promises change -- the word is used at least a dozen times per appearance -- and is liberally sprinkled with crowd-teasing, trail-tested zingers.
A sampler:
"Bush and Quayle have given out a 1-'800' number, a hotline number, to the wealthy, privileged few in this country and they move heaven and earth to do whatever the callers want them to do. But when the average working family calls saying they need something too, they get a busy signal -- a disconnect -- a voice that says, 'This is not a working number -- for you.'
"The Bush-Quayle Administration is out of ideas, out of energy, out of proposals, out of vision, out of gas and, with your help, they'll soon be out of office."
The crowds roar with laughter and, as quiet returns, Mr. Gore, a beaming smile telegraphing another rhetorical punch, recycles his New York convention line in which he said it was long past time for President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle to go, to depart the White House and Washington.
"What time is it?" he cries out to his audiences.
"It's time for them to go!" the partisans roar back.
 
Focus on Foreign Policy
 The most substantive and most emphasized part of the Gore speech thus far has been an unremitting attack on Mr. Bush's handling of foreign issues rather than economic issues, the critical concern for voters throughout most of this year's campaign.
It was Mr. Gore, playing the role of campaign attack dog, who first went on the foreign affairs offensive, even before Gov. Bill Clinton struck. In his initial solo appearance on the campaign trail, the Tennessee Senator tore into Mr. Bush, asserting that he had "coddled" Saddam Hussein.
And Mr. Gore has continued the attack, lately adding ridicule to his arsenal.
"If George Bush is so smart about foreign affairs," his line now goes, "how come Saddam Hussein is toying with him?"
Make no mistake. This Tennessee Democrat whom Mr. Clinton chose for a running mate is still one earnest politician as he goes about the traditional No. 2 job of shoring up the base and being the ticket Rottweiler. Though now in his shirt sleeves, his cadences can still be stilted, his gestures wooden.
But out in the crowds, the eyes no longer glaze over the way they once did. At a noontime rally here today in Philadelphia's central business district, just about everybody stuck with Mr. Gore to the end, all 7,000 or so secretaries, construction workers, lawyers and bankers, even most of those who disagreed with the message.
 
Mirroring the Polls
 The Senator departed with loud, enthusiastic cheers bouncing and booming off the glassy facades of the surrounding cluster of skyscrapers. A whirling clutch of people surged forward in the midday heat to shake the hand of the candidate who arrives and leaves most of his rallies to the driving beat of Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al."
"Please! Oh, please!" a young woman holding a "We Love Al" sign implored as she jostled for position in today's crowd.
Thus it has gone for Mr. Gore for most of the past week, ever since he hit the trail on his own after leaving the bus that he and Mr. Clinton rode across Middle America. The crowds have been friendly and seemingly open to being persuaded. What is more, they have been growing ever larger, not unlike the Clinton-Gore edge in the July polls.
On Monday, there were a couple of hundred people at the airport in Atlanta. On Tuesday, there were 4,000 at the fairgrounds in Raleigh, N.C. Today's crowd of 7,000 in Philadelphia's John F. Kennedy Plaza was the largest yet.
Of course, all that Mr. Gore says substantively is either dictated from the Clinton headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., or at least cleared with Little Rock. The same goes for his campaign schedule. Such is the lot of Vice-Presidential nominees.
"But there's no subject I can't address and nowhere I can't go," the Senator said the other day, as if to underscore that in the 1988 campaign the Bush headquarters tightly reigned in Mr. Quayle in an effort to minimize verbal gaffes and embarrassing headlines.
It is early in Campaign '92 but Mr. Gore, thus far, has avoided any unflattering news reports, certainly none of the magnitude that bedeviled Mr. Quayle in 1988.
In time, the gaffes and miscues and headlines will come. They always do. The campaign inevitably will have its fits and starts and problems. Already there is talk that for all the time Mr. Gore spent the past week in the South, the number of black voters who showed up at his rallies could be counted in the low hundreds.
But for the moment, Mr. Gore is riding high in the political saddle.

HEADLINE: Board Urges Fiscal Shifts In New York

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
New York City will face budget gaps and service reductions for many years unless the Dinkins administration reorganizes city government, the state agency that monitors the city budget said in a report issued yesterday.
The agency, the State Financial Control Board, said Mayor David N. Dinkins had done more to recognize the city's long-term financial problems than any mayor in two decades. But the board also contended that Mr. Dinkins had failed to develop a plan to restructure the city's expenditures and tax revenues to achieve what fiscal experts call "structural balance" -- a stable relationship between the size of local government and the size of the local economy. 
 "The city has neither the economy nor the revenues to do everything its citizens have become accustomed to expect," the board said in its report.
 
'Midcourse Adjustments'
 The report is the second this month to warn of continued problems unless the city achieves a recurring structural balance in its finances. The Citizens Budget Commission, an independent fiscal watchdog group, said three weeks ago that neither the Mayor nor the City Council had delivered on many promises they made to overhaul city government.
But Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director, contended yesterday that the Dinkins administration had basically achieved structural balance by cutting costs, reducing the number of city workers and consolidating some agencies, among other things.
"We've narrowed the risks to the point where it's a manageable situation, albeit a difficult one," he said, adding that the fiscal experts were not being realistic in their long-term goals for the budget process.
"Our view is that we have structural balance," Mr. Michael said, "and inherent in that is that we do have to make midcourse adjustments, through good times and bad. There is no question that we are going to balance our budgets."
 
Rising Health Costs
 But the Financial Control Board argued in its report that even though the administration cut services sharply and raised taxes over the last two and half years to balance three budgets, it had not yet resolved critical matters that will make it difficult to balance budgets over the next four years.
Among those issues are large anticipated increases in the city's interest payments on debt for construction projects, rising health-care costs for municipal workers and growing social-service expenditures, the control board said.
A proposed state takeover of the city's costs for Medicaid would help pare New York's long-term expenses, the report said, but the takeover "is not sufficient to remove the structural imbalances that will create persistent budget gaps and service reductions."

Lufthansa, Japan Air Cut Some Routes

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Two leading foreign airlines have decided to retrench, after finding the skies over the United States as turbulent as American carriers have found them for several years.
Lufthansa German Airlines said yesterday that it would suspend service to Charlotte, N.C., and Philadelphia effective Oct. 25, while Japan Airlines said Tuesday that it plans to suspend service to Seattle on Nov. 1. Both carriers cited a sluggish United States economy for their lagging revenue in those markets. 
 Lufthansa, which has served Philadelphia since 1965, suffered losses exceeding $500 million in the five quarters covering all of 1991 and the first three months of this year. Earlier this year, it froze hiring and offered employees early retirement. It also postponed or delayed deliveries of some new planes.
 
High Costs, Weak Revenue
 Its service to Charlotte, which began last August, had high start-up costs and generated weaker-than-expected revenue, the carrier said. After Oct. 25, Lufthansa will continue to serve 18 other North American gateways, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Like Lufthansa, Japan Airlines has been struggling to cut costs and increase revenue. It lost $22.2 million for the year ended March 31. The carrier's directors have agreed to pay cuts of from 5 to 15 percent and will forgo their summer bonuses. Many department heads and regional managers will take 3 percent pay cuts.
A Japan Airlines spokesman said that Seattle, which the carrier first started serving in 1959 and has served continuously since 1983, "is not a profitable route." He added, however, that the carrier did not plan to cut back its flights to New York, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
 
Northwest Completes Revamping
 NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines, a domestic carrier that has been struggling to contain costs, said yesterday that it had completed an extensive restructuring of its domestic route system, adding more than 70 daily flights from its hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
As part of that restructuring, Northwest recently raised its daily flights between La Guardia Airport in New York and Detroit to 11 from nine, and on Sept. 15 it will begin flying for the first time to White Plains, with two daily nonstop flights to Minneapolis-St. Paul. On Saturday it will begin serving Richmond and Oakland, Calif., for the first time, and on Oct. 1 it will fly for the first time to Albuquerque, N.M.
At the same time, Northwest has cut its daily departures from Washington to 30 from 48, and on Sept. 15 it will cut its Milwaukee service to 18 daily departures from 28.

Even City Hall Has Moved to the Mall

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
In a fight to survive, suburban malls, those sterile shrines of consumption, are starting to reflect a broader spectrum of activity as they rent to clients who would have been unthinkable a few years ago. While some real estate and marketing experts say the new diversity has social value, the trend is altering mall economics and upsetting some traditional retail tenants in the process.
Faced with a glut of space and an arid retail climate, developers are taking in churches, libraries, medical clinics, police departments and even car dealerships, often at below-market rates. The day may soon be at hand when condom stores and adult-video-and-book dens move in, too. 
 "We have malls in this country that are ghost towns," said David Blanchard, vice president of corporate services for New American Network Inc., a real estate firm in Hightstown, N.J. "It's either change or die."
 
Realizing the Village Square Myth
 While few top-tier malls have had to resort to such an approach, dozens of older malls in areas that are no longer retailing hubs are retrofitting with nonretailers. To some people, this is not necessarily a negative shift. The diversity can make malls more useful to a broader swath of the population -- and more like the town squares they have long been billed as.
"The myth about the mall being the village square is becoming less of a myth," said George Rosenbaum, chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm in Chicago.
But the experiment could just as easily hasten the failure of these marginal malls as it could prolong their lives. Along with new tenants have come homeless and unemployed people who are neither ideal customers nor a welcome jolt of reality for some mall shoppers.
"We have people coming into the malls barefoot and in pajamas," acknowledged Dianne Magill of the Greater Kansas City chapter of the American Red Cross, which provides disaster victims with clothes and food and recently closed urban offices throughout Kansas City, Mo., to open centers at malls in the area.
Some retailers have extracted concessions from their landlords by complaining that their new neighbors have devalued their leases. For instance, after an auto showroom replaced a failed anchor in one mall recently, the General Nutrition Corporation, an 1,100-store chain of health food stores, situated mostly in malls, negotiated an undisclosed reduction in its rent there.
"If the character of the mall has changed substantially, I will do whatever I can to reduce my rent or terminate my lease," said Alvin I. Greenberg, vice president of real estate for General Nutrition. "I go directly to the landlord and complain that they are not bringing in retail. I can't stay and continue to pay the high rent if I'm not getting the traffic I anticipated."
Such widespread pressure on rates could be potentially fatal to malls teetering on the edge. The downward trend, Mr. Rosenbaum said, is already forcing developers to acknowledge that their projected return on investment was unrealistic.
 
A Mall Becomes a Church
 How many malls are vulnerable? Therese E. Byrne, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that only 10 to 15 percent of all shopping centers were good long-term investments. Another 10 to 15 percent are likely to go bankrupt, she said, while the remainder could go either way.
Retail vacancies reached historical levels in recent years as shopping-center square footage grew 52 percent between 1980 and 1990, according to Alex. Brown & Sons, the investment banking firm. The total retail vacancy rate throughout the nation was 12.43 percent last summer, according to New American Network, which has not yet compiled this year's figures.
In some cases, malls have avoided the wrecking ball by finding a higher calling. After residing for two years in the Beau Monde Shopping Center in Greenwood Village, a suburb of Denver, the 3,000-member, fundamentalist Happy Church bought the entire mall for $7.8 million in 1990. Poor access and high rents had plagued the mall, which had opened in 1985 at a cost of $34 million, but was never more than a third full.
Other developers have admitted shoe repair shops, tailors and other mom-and-pop retailers that were previously barred from malls by high rents and their prosaic focus.
"Now, if they can sign a lease, come up with the security deposit and fog a mirror, you have to put them in," said Peter Casey, head of the Peter Casey Management Company of Tucson, Ariz., a management firm that runs seven shopping centers in the Southwest, five of which are in trouble. "I don't have a shopping center that I've managed in the last three years where I have not had a major tenant go bankrupt."
In the Southwest, he said, troubled malls have even taken to leasing space to flea market operators.
Even the Hahn Company in San Diego, a big developer with 50 shopping centers in 18 states, relaxed its policies, leasing vacant space in the Ogden City Mall in Utah to a children's museum a year ago. "We wanted to at least get the lights on," said John Gilchrist, president and chief executive of the company.
Many see the gradual transformation as a positive step. "From a social value standpoint, what this does is make a mall more valuable and interesting," said Mr. Rosenbaum, the market researcher. "Malls will have a better connection and rooting to the way that people live."
Some shoppers would rather do all their errands in one place -- preferably outside downtown. "I never go downtown," said Valerie Spraggins, who took a break from shopping with her daughter at the Everett Mall, outside Seattle, to pay her utility bill at the satellite City Hall office there. "There is no parking there, and it is too far away."
The biggest beneficiary of the trend, however, are the municipal agencies and nonprofit groups whose traditional locations are more isolated than malls. Witness the climb in voter registration by the city of Everett, Wash., since it opened an office in the mall in June 1990. The mall registers up to 15 people a day, compared with four a day at City Hall downtown. "It's a new way of bringing government to the people," said Steve Breeden, a city official.
The people of Tucson were able to use the $1.3 million budgeted to build a new library to open two new locations inside malls instead.
But the new tenants do not always bring in customers desirable to retailers. "The library deal was kind of a desperation deal," said Mr. Casey, whose management firm runs the mall. "It's not the sort of quality of traffic malls are looking for."
Indeed, the manager for the Galleries of Syracuse, which houses a busy public library, said that research showed that the mind-set of library patrons was to borrow, not buy. Many regular library users are on a fixed income and use the library as an important source of entertainment.
"They don't have the money to spend on other things," said Steven E. Shulman, a project director for the American unit of Amlea Inc. of Toronto, the developer of the mall in Syracuse.
Not all retailers see the new tenants as problems. The manager of the Sears store in Kansas City, for instance, called the Red Cross "a good neighbor."
Still, the notion of malls as public spaces raises security issues for developers. Robert Gibbs, principal of Gibbs Planning Group Inc. in Birmingham, Mich., an urban planner, said he was working with a developer and a community in the Midwest on a plan to build a city park in a mall that the city felt was too exclusionary without one.
But the developer worries that the plan would reduce his control over security. As private property, malls are typically policed by security guards who can indiscriminately evict visitors for loitering or any other unacceptable behavior. Having a public park would limit such discretion.
"The mall developer is concerned about what happens if people that are intimidating to shoppers use the park," Mr. Gibbs said. "If a bunch of rowdies come in, how do you kick them out without getting sued for discrimination?"

Dollar Posts Broad Gains; Gold Declines in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most currencies, apparently on the coattails of rallies in the stock and bond markets.
Gold closed on New York's Commodity Exchange at $356.50 an ounce, off $2.40 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $356.40, down $2.85. 
 Meanwhile, the dollar closed in New York at 127.80 Japanese yen, up from Tuesday's late quote of 127.45, and it hit 1.4815 German marks, up from 1.4725 on Tuesday.
The dollar "seems to have pretty much moved in concert with the bond and equity markets," said Tom Hoge, a corporate trader at the New York branch of Credit Suisse.
This is a reversal of recent trading, where the dollar fell against leading currencies and the Federal Reserve and other central banks intervened to support the dollar.
"One of the concerns for the dollar over the past couple of weeks has been this crisis of confidence" that scared investors from dollar-backed stocks and bonds," Mr. Hoge said. Wednesday's stock and bond market trading has "taken the pressure off the dollar," he added.
However, Mr. Hoge added, there remains pessimism about the economy's recovery. "The whole thing is going to take time to resolve," Mr. Hoge said. "Right now, it's touch and go every day."
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.98 yen, up 0.63 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.92 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.9215 from $1.9305 late Tuesday in New York. In London, the pound fell to $1.9185 from $1.9285.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.3185 Swiss francs, up from 1.3035; 5.0030 French francs, up from 4.9730; 1,121.75 Italian lire, up from 1,114.50, and 1.18475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18705.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4830 German marks, up from 1.4735; 1.3195 Swiss francs, up from 1.3040; 5.0065 French francs, up from 4.9790; 1.6725 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6625; 1,121.50 Italian lire, up from 1,114.74, and 1.1870 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1880.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $357.20 a troy ounce, from $358.48 late Tuesday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $356.10 from $358.65. In Hong Kong, gold fell 73 cents to close at a bid $358.

Yields of Money Funds Dip As Pace of Declines Slows

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Money market fund yields dropped slightly in the latest week, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. But the steady erosion of rates that began with the Federal Reserve's most recent actions has about played itself out among taxable funds, said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue.
Yields on tax-exempt funds were flat to very slightly down. The seven-day simple yield was 2.18 percent in the latest week, unchanged, and the seven-day compounded yield was 2.20 percent, down a basis point. The 30-day simple yield declined 6 basis points, to 2.19 percent, while the 30-day compounded yield declined 8 basis points, to 2.21 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. 
 "These very small declines would indicate that the very sharp declines in tax-free money funds have come to an end," Mr. Frank said. "It would take another twist down in interest rates by the Fed -- a policy move -- for rates to go down further."
 
Moving Out of Short-Term Funds

 
 Assets of tax-free money funds declined $659 million, to $95.3 billion -- a continuation of the move by individual investors out of short-term funds and into longer-term, higher-yielding paper. The average number of days to maturity of tax-exempt securities in fund portfolios was 63 days, up a day.
Strong Municipal Money Market Fund was the latest week's top-yielding tax-free fund with assets over $100 million, posting a seven-day compounded yield of 3.01 percent. That was down 2 basis points from the previous week, when Strong Municipal was also the top-yielding fund in the category.
Among tax-exempts, the top-yielding New York fund was Boston Company New York Tax Free Money Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 2.62 percent. The top Connecticut fund was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a seven-day yield of 2.62 percent. Among New Jersey funds, the Vanguard New Jersey Tax-Free Money Market Fund ranked highest, with a 2.58 percent seven-day compounded yield.
Yields on taxable funds also dipped slightly, though assets in the category rose. The seven-day simple and compounded yields were each down 5 basis points, to 3.14 percent and 3.19 percent, respectively. Thirty-day simple yields declined by 6 basis points, to 3.25 percent; 30-day compounded yields fell 7 basis points, to 3.30 percent. The average number of days to maturity on taxable funds was unchanged from the previous week at 62 days.
 
Some Money Flows In
 Assets of taxable funds rose $2.1 billion, to $503.1 billion, Mr. Frank said. Institutional investors accounted for a $2.4 billion rise in the latest week, while the public took $300 million out of taxable funds. That is not uncommon in a declining rate environment, Mr. Frank said.
After the Federal Reserve acts to lower rates, money fund yields tend to remain artificially high, reflecting their lengthened maturities, he said. "So institutional investors who have to keep some cash move cash into money funds to get the higher yields" in the weeks after Fed rate cuts, he said. "That process goes on every time the Fed moves. But one of these weeks, the institutional assets will start flowing out when money fund yields fully reflect the Fed's move."
The top-yielding taxable money fund was the Standby Reserve Fund, with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.94 percent. Standby Reserve is distributed by Cowen & Company of New York.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Both Wheeling-Pittsburgh And Bethlehem Have Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation both reported yesterday that they had suffered second-quarter losses because of abnormally low steel prices. Bethlehem's red ink was more than twice as high as the company's loss in the second quarter of 1991. The company blamed unfair competition from foreign steelmakers that kept steel prices down. Wheeling-Pittsburgh said its quarterly loss was the first in one and a half years and said that it had begun a cost control program. 
 Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Bethlehem
Bethlehem said it lost $63.9 million, compared with a loss of $29.1 million a year earlier. Revenues were $1.01 billion, down from $1.12 billion.
Two weeks ago the company announced that it expected to record a loss for the quarter. In trading on the New York stock Exchange, Bethlehem Steel shares closed at $14.875, up $1.
Bethlehem said it set aside $25 million against its earnings during the quarter for potential losses in a suit over the title to coal at the Bethenergy Mines. The company has asked the Kentucky Supreme Court to reconsider its June decision against Bethlehem in the case.
Bethlehem's Basic Steel Operations lost $44 million in the second quarter, compared with a $14 million loss a year ago. The loss widened despite a production increase of about 2 percent.
The company in June joined 11 other steel producers in filing Government petitions charging dumping of cheap steal products on the United States market by 21 foreign countries.
Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem chairman, said he expects another loss for the third quarter, but added that as the economy improves there will be opportunities for improved results later in the year and 1993.
 
Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Wheeling-Pittsburgh lost $9.58 million, compared with a profit of $1.72 million, or 10 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year.
Revenues fell to $235 million, from $254 million last year.
Production increased by 2.6 percent, but revenues fell because of an 11.1 percent decline in shipments and a 4.1 percent decline in prices, the company said. Adding to the problems were higher employment and depreciation costs, the company said.
"Although sufficient orders continue to support full plant production levels, relief from unacceptably low steel prices is not anticipated in the third quarter," said Robin Chenery, chairman and chief executive officer.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh shares were unchanged at $4.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
More Concrete, More Growth?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
YOU did not read it here first: public capital spending is in.
Bill Clinton wants Uncle Sam to invest an extra $20 billion annually to "develop the world's best communication, transportation and environmental systems." Even the hard-line free marketeers left in the Bush Administration, the ones who reread Ayn Rand at bedtime, seem reconciled to sweetening private investment in toll roads and bridges with Federal matching funds. 
 What you may not have read anywhere else, though, is that economists are queazy about this near-consensus. Some -- notably Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution -- flatly dispute the received wisdom that there is not enough asphalt and steel in place to meet public needs. Many others who lean toward the conventional view concede that the route to cost-effective reinvestment in America is riddled with potholes.
The folks who pour concrete for a living or ride Amtrak for the fun of it have long been eager to explain why public investment is good for children and other living things. But only in 1989, with the publication of research by David Aschauer, did their message lose the taint of special pleading.
Mr. Aschauer, now a professor at Bates College, used econometric techniques to pin the blame for the post-1970's sag in productivity growth on stinginess in public investment. His simple yet elegant explanation, somehow neglected in the hunt for a cure to the productivity blues, proved as easy to sell to frustrated public policy professionals as genius grants from the MacArthur Foundation.
But in economics, no good idea goes unchallenged for long. Some criticism has been technical: Dale Jorgenson of Harvard, for example, redid the Aschauer calculations using equally respectable statistical methods and generated gibberish.
Some has been intuitive. Alan Blinder of Princeton fears the direction of causality assumed in much subsequent research supporting Mr. Aschauer's conclusions may be wrong. He notes that states with the most productive economies do have the highest levels of public investment. But that may be because richer states are prepared to pay for smoother roads and better schools.
And some boldly dismiss the Aschauer result as irrelevant. Mr. Winston argues that roads and airports are crowded because cost-based prices are not used to ration available capacity. If, for example, heavy trucks were charged for the damage they caused to highways, more freight would move by rail. Were airplanes charged according to the time of day they took off, more people would travel when there was room on the runways. The first order of business, Mr. Winston argues, is to get the prices right.
What is one to make of this spat among the academicians? Mr. Blinder acknowledges that the virtues of public investment have been somewhat oversold. But he believes "the politics of rational pricing is a loser" -- the truckers, rush-hour commuters and small-plane owners who do not currently pay their share of the transportation bill are not about to take a licking from the invisible hand.
He notes, moreover, that the benefits of added public investment could go far beyond the ones the Government measures. When better roads make it cheaper to move freight from Boston to Philadelphia, the savings show up as a productivity improvement. But when the same road project cuts Mr. Blinder's travel time to the beaches of Cape Cod, the number crunchers at the Department of Commerce treat the benefit as lagniappe.
And what goes for tangible gains, like less time stuck in traffic, goes double for intangible ones, like on-the-job training for highway engineers or induced technical change that lowers the cost of building the next highway.
In the end, argues Alicia Munnell, the research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the only good way to decide whether public investments make sense is the old-fashioned way -- one project at a time. Someone has to make a best-effort calculation of the likely economic benefits and compare them with the likely costs. If the return is high (and higher than the alternative uses for the capital), the investment is worth making.
But this utterly sensible prescription begs some practical questions. Is Washington capable of putting the money where it will do the most good? Or is it likely to end up paving the road to the committee chairman's favorite lobbyist's favorite client's favorite hunting lodge?
Then there is the issue of leading technologies -- the high-speed trains, short-haul aircraft and fiber-optic communications systems that figure prominently in Mr. Clinton's public investment plans. Can the best minds (aided, of course, by armies of lobbyists) be relied on to pick winners where neither the benefits nor the costs can be quantified at the outset?
"The tools of economics are just not designed for that," Mr. Blinder concedes.

HEADLINE: Telmex Plans 5-Year Outlay

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Telefonos de Mexico S.A. plans to invest $13 billion over five years to upgrade its equipment, add access lines and improve service, company officials said.
Telmex will finance the growth primarily through cash flow, the company's chief financial officer, Adolfo Cerezo, told a group of investors at a meeting in New York. "The need to issue additional capital to finance growth is not foreseen," he said. 
 The company expects to add a total of 800,000 access lines this year, he said. During the first half, Telmex added 326,000 access lines, an increase of 13.8 percent over the corresponding period a year earlier.
Telmex on Tuesday reported a 5.4 percent rise in first-half earnings to 3.64 trillion pesos. Sales in the first six months jumped 15.9 percent, to 9.78 trillion pesos.
Mr. Cerezo said first-half earnings had been affected by three new expenditures. The company spent $93 million toward pension contributions, part of a total of $260 million for 1992. In addition, it spent $9 million toward complying with a new Government-mandated employee retirement system and about $20 million in write-offs for obsolete equipment.
The company expects to have completed financing of pension liabilities and replacing the obsolete equipment by the end of the year. "Next year we should return to a more normal basis," Mr. Cerezo said.
He said margins could remain at current levels as long as Telmex kept costs down and the Mexican economy continued to grow. Operating margins for the second quarter were 43.9 percent, according to a Lehman Brothers report.

 BODY:
For 15 years, RICK MOONEN has spent most of his time at the stove, cooking at famous restaurants like La Cote Basque, Le Cirque and, for the last four years, the Water Club, where he is the executive chef.
But now he is fighting mad. So on Tuesday, he and 34 other chefs threw off their toques and went to Washington to announce a boycott of genetically engineered foods, as part of the Pure Food Campaign organized in May by the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, a nonprofit organization that monitors the biotechnology industry. 
 These foods of the future have altered genetic codes, so that now, for example, flounder genes are being spliced into tomatoes.
More than 1,000 chefs, including stars of the restaurant world like Wolfgang Puck of Spago in West Hollywood, Calif., Jimmy Schmidt of the Rattlesnake Club in Detroit, Mark Miller of Red Sage in Washington, Michael Lomonaco of the "21" Club and Paul Ingenito of the Russian Tea Room, both in New York, have signed on with the campaign, vowing not to serve genetically engineered products.
Mr. Moonen, who is leading the boycott, said yesterday that he had never heard of genetic engineering until Vice President Dan Quayle announced in May that the Government would neither regulate these foods nor require that they be specially labeled. When a radio reporter asked Mr. Moonen for his reaction, he began doing research and was angered by what he learned.
"If you wish to shellac these food products and put them in the window, that is O.K.," he said. "But if you want to cook with them, enjoy them and get nutritional value, leave them alone.
"I am appalled by this. As a chef, I am responsible for every plate of food in my restaurant, and I want to know what is on it. The consumers put their dietetic, religious and allergic confidences in my hands, and with no requirements for safety testing, I am not permitted to fulfill my obligation."
JEREMY RIFKIN, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said he was surprised at this outpouring of protest on the part of the chefs. "This is the first time they have ever organized politically, and I think their impact on the public will be profound," he said.
Next on the agenda will be an effort to reach neighborhood restaurants and fast-food outlets, supermarkets, grocery stores, suppliers and growers, Mr. Rifkin said.

HEADLINE: Samuel M. Brody, 65, Architect Of Housing Complexes, Is Dead

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Samuel M. Brody, a leading New York City architect who with his partner, Lewis Davis, designed some of the city's best-known housing complexes, died yesterday at the Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 65 years old and lived in Brooklyn Heights. 
 He died of melanoma, said his office, Davis, Brody & Associates of Manhattan.
Though Mr. Brody, who was a founding member of his firm, frowned upon the so-called signature architecture favored by other architects of his generation, he nonetheless left his own strong mark on some of the most important housing built in New York in recent decades. With their tall, notched towers, typically clad in warm brick, such projects as Waterside in the East 20's, built in 1974, and River Park Towers from 1975, in Morris Heights, the Bronx, were easily recognizable as Davis, Brody designs.
The Davis, Brody housing projects were very much the signs of an era, the peak years of subsidized housing in the 1970's. Mr. Brody's work was notable both for its strong social idealism and for a commitment to urban design.
"Housing is how you build a city," Mr. Brody once said. "It is where people live day and night. It generates neighborhoods and a sense of community and stores and support services and recreation spaces and hospitals and schools.
"It is really what the city is about."
 
A Long Partnership
 Mr. Brody was born on Aug. 9, 1926, in Plainfield, N.J., and grew up in Toledo, Ohio. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he graduated from Dartmouth College and Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, receiving his master's degree in architecture in 1950. In 1952, Mr. Brody began his partnership with Lewis Davis. The firm was originally known as Davis, Brody & Wisniewsky and became Davis, Brody & Associates in 1966.
The firm's work covered a wide range of commissions, from the United States Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, to the renovation of Astor Court, a project now under construction at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens. In 1967, the firm designed the first of the subsidized housing complexes for which it is best known: Riverbend, a 625-unit complex in Harlem, broke the mold for urban-renewal projects. Instead of lining up rows of identical towers in bleak urban settings, Riverbend's design retained a strong emphasis of the street wall along Fifth Avenue and took advantage of Harlem River views.
Waterside, a 1,470-unit complex designed in 1974 for middle-income residents, introduced the notched tower form that became a familiar feature in Davis, Brody's designs. Though distinctly modernist in their hard-edged geometry, these towers possessed a surprisingly lyrical dimension. To admirers, they recalled the medieval towers of Italian hill towns.
Unlike some modern architects, who were indifferent to urban context, Mr. Brody's designs reinforced the connections between his buildings and the city. At Riverbend, he and Mr. Davis campaigned successfully to have city bus service extended an extra 20 blocks to accommodate Riverbend's residents. River Park Towers, a housing complex in the Bronx, was designed to take advantage of existing commuter rail links.
When the end of Federal subsidies in the 1980's led to a decline in publicly assisted housing, Mr. Brody and Mr. Davis shifted their practice toward academic and institutional buildings and other kinds of housing. They designed such New York City luxury condominium projects as Zeckendorf Towers and Central Park Place, along with the Steinhardt Conservatory at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and buildings for the University of Pennsylvania.
In addition to his architectural practice, Mr. Brody was an adjunct professor of architecture at the Cooper Union School of Architecture for 25 years and had also taught and lectured at Yale, Harvard and other schools. A fellow of the American Institute of Architects since 1969, Mr. Brody received the institute's Firm of the Year Award in 1975. The same year, he received the Arnold Brunner Prize from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.
Mr. Brody is survived by his wife, the former Sally Rosenthal, a painter; a daughter, Elizabeth Brody of Santa Monica, Calif., and two sons, David and Daniel, both of New York City.

HEADLINE: BARCELONA;
Iraqi Athletes Are Struggling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 29

 BODY:
For an athlete, the Olympic village is the ultimate escape, a biosphere in which sports is the international language and goodwill is more than an experiment.
For some, it can be even more. As home for thousands of athletes and officials from the 172 nations in the Barcelona Games, the village becomes a respite from the turbulence at home and a chance to connect with the world beyond it. 
 So it was for Hassan Hassan, who found his stay in Barcelona all too brief. He arrived in time for the opening ceremonies Saturday, competed Sunday and was planning today for his return on Thursday to Baghdad, Iraq, to his wife and two children, a 5-year-old boy and 18-month-old girl.
Hassan is a shooter from Iraq, which might cast him as an ironic metaphor to some. But to others, as he found in five days of Olympic wanders, he was nothing more than an athlete.
 
'Normally, It Has Been O.K.'
 "Normally, it has been O.K.," Hassan, who is 30, said in an interview today. "I have even met some athletes from the American team, and we have exchanged pins in the village. Here, it is only sports. No politics. The Americans were very nice. They are nice people. Our problem is not with the American people. It is with the American regime. So there is no need to talk about politics. We came here for another reason."
Hassan, who failed to advance from the preliminary round of the men's free pistol competition, is one of nine athletes and the only shooter representing Iraq in these Olympics. Five weight lifters and three boxers complete the team, which is not expected to win even a bronze medal.
For most of them, merely competing is a triumph, and that was the point, Hassan said, that was misconstrued by some during the parade of athletes in the opening ceremonies. As the Iraqi delegation marched into the Olympic Stadium, most of them raised a hand with fingers flashing a "V," a gesture generating a certain amount of jeering from other athletes in the parade.
But it was not for arrogance.
 
A Victory Unto Itself
 "It was our victory to enter the Olympic Games," Hassan said. "It was understood the wrong way by some of them. What it meant was a victory that Iraq could enter."
If there had been any doubts of their participation, they were foisted upon the Iraqis by events other than those relating to the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has always offered at least a veneer of assurance that politics and sports do not mix, inviting nearly every country on earth, even those the United Nations has branded as aggressors for their various military incursions. That is how individual athletes from Yugoslavia got here.
But under the bombing by allied forces during the Persian Gulf war 18 months ago, Iraq's Olympic effort suffered along with so much else, like Hassan's house. One bomb destroyed one of the shooting ranges he used for practice. And he knew of other programs disrupted, to say nothing of spiritual losses.
"Each of us lost some friends," he said, so he understood why Furas Hashim, an Iraqi light-middleweight boxer, told an American reporter the other night how much he hates the United States. Hashim said three other boxers were wounded during the war, and parts of his neighborhood were destroyed by bombs.
The effects of the war linger in so many respects, held in place by the economic embargo and are unlikely to improve soon with tensions still high after recent developments that have moved the United States to consider military action again.
 
'So Many Problems'
 "We have so many problems," Hassan said. "For example, we need training suits. We cannot get them in Iraq. If we need them, we must go to Jordan. Also, we have no spare parts for the equipment we use, like the shooting range. For me, the most difficult thing is getting ammunition for training that I need new each year. What we have is seven years old. It is not good for competition. It has expired."
Nor have Iraqis been free to compete internationally. The embargo keeps them out of many countries, and airline connections to others can be impossible. Never mind the random difficulties that could happen to anyone. On his way to Barcelona, Hassan's best pistol was somehow loaded onto a plane bound for Rome and was not returned to him until the day before his competition, with a broken grip, no less.
"I waited five days," he said. "I had no chance to train."
Here, at least, amid the rows of flags and gaily colored uniforms of so many nations, he can be lost for a while, washed over by the conviviality and chance meetings of a neutral site. Odd enough, it might seem, for an Iraqi to share a casual conversation with an American. How about one with an athlete from Iran, a nation Iraq fought for nearly a decade?
"We were in a village restaurant," Hassan said. "I met a guy and asked where he was from. He was a cyclist from Iran. I told him I was from Iraq. We exchanged some pins and spent the afternoon together."

HEADLINE: Debate the Real European Issues

 BODY:
The bitter exchange between the Clinton and Bush camps over Bosnia this week marked one of the rare instances foreign policy has touched the Presidential campaign.
Yet even this was no real debate. The press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, tried to paint Mr. Clinton as a dangerous amateur for suggesting he would not rule out selective air strikes against Serbian targets. But the Democratic candidate actually hewed closely to the overcautious Administration line on the Yugoslav crisis. 
 In fact, there's been no serious discussion of the critical emerging issues in Europe. President Bush's outlook remains fixed in the cold war -- reliance on NATO and bilateral deals with Moscow; Mr. Clinton has not developed any identifiable foreign policy themes. Yet the next President is likely to face European challenges as momentous as those that tested Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman.
Surely the candidates have noticed that Europe is besieged by potentially staggering problems. Aggression rages unanswered in the Balkans while Europeans dither over what they are willing to do about making "collective security" more than hollow rhetoric.
Many of the newly free nations of Eastern Europe now face economic privation and political instability, threatening democracy and reform. The European Community's ambitious plans for closer unity have been sharply set back by the voters of Denmark. And historic fears of Germany along with other ancient rivalries have been spurred by German reunification and the Soviet collapse.
America cannot afford to be uninvolved. Last year, America's trade with Europe amounted to more than $220 billion, and showed a healthy surplus. Direct American investment in Europe now amounts to about $225 billion; European investment in the U.S. is more than $250 billion.
One major challenge for the next President will be adjusting to a reunited Germany. Berlin is still firmly anchored in the West but has an intense interest in the fate of its shaky Eastern neighbors. Active American engagement in European affairs is the best guarantee of the rough balance of power on which the Continent's peace depends.
Another issue is sharing the costs and future profits of economic transformation in the East. Without strong U.S. involvement, the potential for dangerous rivalries between France, Britain, Germany and Italy would be enormous.
Then there is the question of the future makeup of the European Community. Britain argues for a broader, looser union that could embrace Scandinavia, Austria and the more advanced East European states. France and Germany insist on proceeding as if Eastern Europe were still behind the wall. America has an interest in seeing that the old Iron Curtain is not replaced by an equally impenetrable economic barrier.
Europe's most urgent question won't even wait for the November election -- as this week's Bosnia flare-up makes clear. A new international force is desperately needed to police troubled zones of conflict in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union. America will initially have to help Europe defend itself from deadly nationalisms and aggression. But Washington also needs to encourage Europe to rely more on its own forces in resolving regional conflicts.
The end of the cold war didn't bring European history to an end; it accelerated it. The Presidential candidates need to catch up.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
An Embrace Spurned

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Bill Clinton spent considerable time in the last week trying to support George Bush's efforts on Iraq and Bosnia, the world's current flashpoints. The White House responded to these endorsements by calling the Democratic nominee "reckless" and unfit to manage America's security.
One trembles to contemplate the adjectives the White House will hurl at the Arkansas Governor when he actually takes issue with the President's foreign policy. 
 Senator Al Gore brought the elevating exchanges to their logical resting place. If Mr. Bush and Dan Quayle "are such whizzes," he said, "why is it that Saddam Hussein is thumbing his nose at the entire world?"
See, foreign policy can almost be fun.
If nothing else, the high jinks clarify how both sides will handle this subject in the campaign. The Clinton strategy is to go for the clinches, hold on, counterpunch hard and concentrate on domestic issues. The Bush strategy is to keep as much distance as possible, swing from the heels, showcase the President's foreign policy skills and prefigure their good use at home.
The Clinton team has decided that it has more to lose than to gain if foreign affairs looms large. So it has tried to neutralize Mr. Bush's advantages here by embracing his policies on many big, tough issues. Since last December Mr. Clinton has stressed his appreciation of anti-Soviet cold war policies, his backing of the Persian Gulf war and his willingness to use force to defend the nation's vital interests.
Mr. Clinton -- who seems to be a genuine foreign policy moderate -- acknowledges he is not about to let Republicans tag him with being "weak and soft-headed," as they did his luckless predecessors. In recent days he extended that thinking to Iraq and Bosnia.
He condemned Saddam every bit as roughly as did Mr. Bush. "If the United Nations decides to use force to insure Iraqi compliance with the cease-fire agreements," he said last week, "I will support American participation in such action." He added: "Even during an election campaign, Americans are united on this issue."
The Democratic contender pulled his punches on the questionable U.N. arrangement that defused the present crisis. He could easily have attacked Mr. Bush for agreeing to the deal that barred U.S. inspectors from entering a suspicious Iraqi building. And he could have (and probably should have) walloped Mr. Bush for doing little to challenge Saddam's past cease-fire violations. But Mr. Clinton wants to stay close to the President on Iraq.
He was rightly a bit more aggressive than Mr. Bush on Bosnia, but not much. "If the Serbs persist in violating the terms of the current cease-fire agreement," he said, "the United States should take the lead in seeking U.N. Security Council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort."
This is the statement that the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, first distorted and then termed "reckless." It is also, in essence, the policy just enunciated by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. "Our commitment does go to supporting with military force, specifically naval and air assets, the efforts in the international community to provide relief supplies to the people of Yugoslavia," he told the Senate this week.
Mr. Clinton's strategy will work -- as long as he also does what his aides promise. They say he will step back from Mr. Bush from time to time and develop his basic differences with the President on defense, the environment and foreign economic policy -- all tied to the theme that power abroad depends on strength at home.
But Mr. Bush's strategy is ill conceived. He looks peevish and partisan when he pushes Mr. Clinton away on Iraq or Bosnia. Rather, he should try to convince Americans that his foreign policies are so sound that even his challenger has to embrace them.
Mr. Bush will find enough grist to criticize his opponent. Americans, for example, wince every time Mr. Clinton feels it necessary to declare, as he did Tuesday about foreign crises, that "I'm the one who can be firm and tough." But because Mr. Bush seems determined to create plainly false fights over foreign policy in order to avoid the real battle over domestic policies, round one goes to Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: What Makes French Farmers So Angry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"France Blocks the Way" (editorial, July 9) betrays a lack of understanding of the human ramifications of sweeping international agreements. Farmers throughout France have risen in almost desperate protest against the transformation in Europe's agricultural policies that you don't think goes far enough. In the Gers, where this protest began, some 2,000 of 11,000 farmers have been forced to leave the land in the last eight years -- and this in only one out of the country's 96 departments. 
 French agriculture is nothing like American agriculture: regional distinctions are prized, farms are smaller, and farmers almost never have businesses on the side to supplement their income. Nor is American agriculture as unsubsidized as our Agriculture Department and trade representative would have the world believe. A recent issue of The Economist states that we spent $900 million last year in farm export subsidies.
With European Community agricultural reform, French farmers are faced with radically falling prices (29 percent over four years for grain), to be offset by direct assistance -- an arrangement that seems to mimic the American system a bit too closely. To the farmers, it is a menace to their existence, with its likely result the consolidation of agriculture in areas where the richest farmers dispose of the largest acreages. American agriculture in the last 25 years makes their concern look justified.
Yet over their frightened and angry opposition, France accepted this "reform." Has the United States done anything as concrete? To accuse France of "protecting a handful of politically powerful farmers" is a cheap shot.

HEADLINE: Mojave Journal;
Mirage? No, an Orphan Airline Fleet.

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOJAVE, Calif.

 BODY:
If airlines can be said to die, then this is their graveyard. At the airport in this small desert town, 70 miles north of Los Angeles, about 200 passenger aircraft sit idle, remnants of a boom that has long since busted, leaving behind a worldwide glut of airliners.
The planes, some brand new, rise incongruously out of this sun-scorched landscape, like a 20th-century Stonehenge. From little propeller-driven commuter planes to massive Boeing 747's, they wait in neat rows for better times to return. 
 The insignia on the planes read like a roll-call of once-proud carriers that have ceased to be: Eastern Airlines, Braniff International Airlines, Pan Am and Midway. There are also jets from companies like Continental and America West, which are in bankruptcy but continue to fly. But even healthier airlines like Air Canada, British Airways and KLM, finding themselves with too many planes and not enough passengers, have parked a few jets here.
Protective fabric has been taped across the windows, engines and other apertures of most craft, giving them the appearance of being bound and blindfolded. From the few uncovered jets can be heard the faint clacking of turbine blades, spinning in the wind that whistles out of the Tehachapi Mountains and across this plateau.
Two years ago Mojave Airport, a remote strip where enthusiasts fly home-built aircraft and lovingly recondition vintage planes, was home to just a handful of parked airliners. Then came the recession, a spate of airline failures and a severe slump among the survivors. Now, the airport and a tenant, Aerotest of Irvine, Calif., maintain a vast array of planes whose owners have no use for them. Some will be sold for scrap; others will be returned to service when business picks up.
"I came here in October of 1990, and I had responsibility for seven aircraft. By mid-1991, we had 130 aircraft," said Robert Chevalier, program manager for Aerotest, a company that primarily contracts with manufacturers for flight tests and finishing touches on new planes.
Another sign of the times came when Aerotest sought to hire people to maintain the planes here, attracting interest from the legions of workers laid off from aerospace jobs in Antelope Valley nearby. "We've seen a lot of people who are way overqualified for this work," Mr. Chevalier said.
Many airliners are owned not by the carriers but by companies like Guinness Peat Aviation Group P.L.C. of Ireland and GHTX Capital of San Francisco, which buy them in large numbers and lease them to airlines. The planes owned by leasing companies are often stripped of the markings of the carriers that used them.
At first, most of the airliners parked here were 10 to 20 years old. But as the industry shrank, airlines and leasing companies found they had no use for the new planes they had bought. In a few cases, jets have rolled off assembly lines, sometimes as long as three years after they were ordered, and been flown straight to Mojave and put in mothballs.
The arid climate, which inhibits corrosion, and the airport's long runway and cheap space, costing just $300 to $500 a month for storing a passenger jet, make Mojave ideal for keeping unused planes.
With occasional maintenance, an unused plane can stay in working order indefinitely, said Robert W. Moye, an Aerotest vice president. The surplus of stored aircraft has greatly depressed their prices, making them attractive buys, and occasionally they are sold and put back into use. But for more than two years now, they have flown into Mojave faster than they have flown out.
And some planes here will never fly at all, instead being sold for parts or scrap. "Airplanes that were being sold for several million dollars a few years ago are now selling to dismantlers for a half a million or less," Mr. Moye said. "That doesn't show a lot of confidence in the market."
The glut of planes and the accompanying collapse in prices could hurt aircraft manufacturers and companies like Aerotest that do business with them, far into the future.
"Even if the airlines get healthy again," Mr. Chevalier said, "they're not going to order new planes when they can come here and pick up a used one for a quarter the price, or less."

HEADLINE: THE B.C.C.I. SCANDAL;
Indictment Charges Clifford Took Bribes

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
New York State and Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges yesterday against Clark M. Clifford and his protege, Robert A. Altman, that included helping the Bank of Credit and Commercial International hide its illegal ownership of Washington's largest bank and taking bribes from B.C.C.I.
The charges against Mr. Clifford, the prominent Washington lawyer who served as campaign adviser to Harry S. Truman and as Secretary of Defense under Lyndon B. Johnson, and Mr. Altman were part of broader indictments that raised new accusations of B.C.C.I.'s illegal activities worldwide. 
 The Manhattan District Attorney's indictment charged that the renegade bank had paid huge bribes to bank regulators and central bankers in 10 developing nations, including Pakistan, Nigeria and Zambia.
 
Loans for Countries
 In some countries, the indictment says, the B.C.C.I. money was used to defraud international agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, masking a nation's financial straits with a quick cash injection that would enable the country to qualify for additional loans.
The indictments and the announcement that a former senior Saudi intelligence official, Sheik Kamal Adham, had quietly flown into New York City on Monday and pleaded guilty to fraud charges in the B.C.C.I. case raised the possibility that whole new avenues would soon be opened in the long-running investigation, prosecutors said.
Sheik Adham and an associate, Sayed Jawhary, agreed to cooperate fully with Manhattan District Attorney and the Justice Department in their continuing investigations of B.C.C.I. The two men also agreed to pay $105 million in fines.
Prosecutors say the plea and the pledge of cooperation by Sheik Adham and Mr. Jawhary were not crucial in the decision to seek indictments against Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, but may supply useful information for this case and further B.C.C.I. inquiries.
 
'I Plead Not Guilty'
 Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman were arraigned yesterday afternoon in a New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. As the charges were read, Mr. Clifford, a tall, patrician 85-year-old, stood calmly, holding his brown fedora. Asked how he pleaded, he replied in a firm, resolute voice, "I plead not guilty." At his side, Mr. Altman gave the same reply. The two men were released without bail.
In the New York indictments, the profits from loans, stock grants and legal fees collected by Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman in connection with their work for First American all appear to be considered bribes. The two are charged with receiving commercial bribes in the first degree. And in a related civil suit, the two men are being asked to forfeit "more than $40 million that they improperly obtained in the course of their crimes," said the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, whose office has led America's investigation of B.C.C.I., beginning in 1989.
The New York State indictment is more sweeping than the Federal. The defendants' lawyers have already asked for a speedy trial on the Federal charges to try to sidestep the state charges.
The next move is unclear, but most lawyers in the case believe the Federal indictment will be taken up first.
B.C.C.I. was run by Pakistani managers, chartered in the banking havens of Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and had offices in 70 countries. It was shut down in July 1991 in a worldwide swoop by banking regulators. Liquidators have been unable to find much of the shadowy bank's assets, which were reported at $20 billion shortly before the shutdown. Investigators have characterized the B.C.C.I. scandal as perhaps the largest financial fraud in history.
 
Some Possible Answers
 In previous indictments, B.C.C.I. has been charged with fraud, money laundering and bribing a couple of Peruvian officials. But there have been accusations that it was involved in influence-peddling on a global scale, buying off politicians, aiding the arms trade for cooperative nations and working closely with intelligence agencies. Prosecutors say the current indictments and cooperation from Sheik Adham could help answer questions about how deeply B.C.C.I. was engaged in such activities and who its partners were.
Sheik Adham and his associate, Mr. Jawhary, agreed to provide courtroom testimony if prosecutors deem it necessary.
"Today's indictment spells out that this massive fraud was not just a criminal fraud scheme, as we charged last year, but a sophisticated and corrupt criminal enterprise, organized from the top down to do just this -- accumulate money and gain the power and prestige that the money provided," Mr. Morgenthau said.
The grand jury in Washington charged Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman with conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board about B.C.C.I.'s illicit purchase in 1982 of First American Bankshares Inc., the largest bank in Washington, and concealing material facts from the Fed in its investigation of B.C.C.I.
But the two indictments returned by the New York grand jury charging six individuals, including Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, go further. They contend that the two men took bribes from B.C.C.I.'s top officials including its founder, Aga Hassan Abedi, and its former chief executive, Swaleh Naqvi, who were also named in the indictments. Others charged yesterday were Ghaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi businessman, and Faisal Saud al-Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman, who were accused of acting as front men for B.C.C.I. in its secret purchase of First American and two other American banks.
 
Long Grand Jury Meeting
 The case against Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman presented in the New York indictments -- the result of grand jury deliberations that lasted 16 months and generated 10,000 pages of minutes -- seems to be based on the weight of extensive circumstantial evidence. Among other things, the indictments document the frequent meetings between the two American lawyers and senior B.C.C.I. officers about First American's operations, ranging from hiring decisions to renting space for the bank's New York office. Some of these meetings have been documented previously by the Fed, but the indictments supply some added details.
Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman issued a joint statement yesterday, calling the indictments "a cruel and unjust abuse of prosecutorial power."
The statement added: "The prosecutors have no credible direct evidence of any wrongdoing by us. There are no smoking guns. We understand the prosecution's case is based entirely on circumstantial evidence."
Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have consistently maintained that while they served as senior executives of First American, legal counsel to B.C.C.I. and as legal counsel to Middle Eastern individuals who purchased First American, they did not know these so-called investors were actually front men for B.C.C.I. In sum, their defense has been that B.C.C.I. had fooled them for years, much as it did banking regulators throughout the world.
The 10 nations whose regulators or central bankers are accused of taking bribes from B.C.C.I. are Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Congo, Zambia, Argentina and Peru. Sometimes, the B.C.C.I. funds were used to mislead international lending agencies and buy the bank influence. For example, the indictment states that in 1979, B.C.C.I. issued an unreported loan of $1 million to the Pakistani Government, allowing it to meet I.M.F. requirements and qualify for further credit.
Lawyers for Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman plan to proceed quickly to address the lesser, Federal charges. If they win that case, they figure, the New York charges could be dropped.
If convicted on the New York charges, Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman would serve no more than eight years in prison, because of sentencing restrictions, although the maximum sentences on the individual counts add up to more. On the Federal charges, the maximum term the two men face is five years on the each of three counts.
For Mr. Morgenthau, the indictments today had a certain personal edge. He comes from a prominent Democratic family. His father, Henry Morgenthau Jr., was Treasury Secretary under Franklin Delano Roosevelt and served briefly in the Truman Administration. Mr. Morgenthau has known Mr. Clifford for decades.

Three counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, four years for each count. Three counts of filiing false documents, four years for each count.
 
The Case Against Them
 In Washington: The Federal charges against Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman are linked to their role as a directors, counsel and top officers of holding companies that controlled First American Bankshares Inc., Washington's largest bank. The indictments charge that Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman knew B.C.C.I. had secretly bought First American in 1982 through Middle East front men. The pair are charged with helping to hide B.C.C.I.'s illegal ownership from Federal regulators.
 In New York: The Manhattan District Attorney;s office charged Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman with taking bribes from the leaders of B.C.C.I. in the form of sham loans and stock deals for themselves and money listed as fees for their law firm, and, in return, with helping the leaders of B.C.C.I. influence the affairs of the First American group.
 In a civil suit, the District Attorney's office is also trying to force Mr. Clifford nad Mr. Altman to forfeit $40 million that authorities say they improperly obtained in the course of crimes.
 
The Defense
 Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman acted as counsel for B.C.C.I. and advisers for the Middle Eastern group that acquired control of First American. But they insist that they did not know that they were front men acting on behalf of B.C.C.I. (pg. D10)

HEADLINE: Urban Aid Plan at Core Of Competing Tax Bills

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
The Senate will be debating competing visions of how to stimulate depressed cities and towns when it considers, perhaps as early as next week, the tax bill approved by the Finance Committee on Wednesday night.
The bill would also provide certain individual tax benefits by restoring deductible I.R.A.'s for all taxpayers and giving tax credits to first-time home buyers. At the same time, limitations on deductions for upper-income taxpayers would be made permanent. 
 On the "enterprise zone" issue, the committee limited the number of places that could qualify. The zones are tax havens meant to attract investment in impoverished areas. But some senators are planning to expand the notion of enterprise zones into a broad entitlement program for any sorely distressed community.
Although the enterprise zones have featured prominently in urban aid proposals since the rioting in Los Angeles earlier this year, the Finance Committee endorsed their use only in 25 places, including 15 cities, still to be selected. The House of Representatives has already voted to finance 25 urban enterprise zones and 25 rural ones; under both bills, $2.5 billion would be spent on the zones.
 
Promises of Expansion
 The Senate committee's ranking Republican, Bob Packwood of Oregon, promised a day before the committee voted that he would support Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, and Senator Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican, in pressing for an expansion of the urban aid bill when it comes to the Senate floor.
They were joined in their call for wider use of enterprise zones by Jack Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Kemp said that if only 25 zones were established, areas like Harlem in New York City and Liberty City in Miami would not necessarily qualify.
But the committee's chairman, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, disagrees. "Let's not try to spread good intentions from sea to shining sea," the Texas Democrat urged as the committee worked out its version of the bill. Senator Bentsen contends it would be best to concentrate spending in a few areas to increase the chances of success.
 
Sweeteners Included
 With Republicans withholding enthusiastic support for the Finance Committee's $31 billion tax bill, Senator Bentsen moved this week to sweeten it by including several provisions that have been sought by the Bush Administration all year.
Two of the most notable provisions would reward many taxpayers who commit themselves before the end of this year to buying a first home or investing in capital equipment for business purposes.
For example, the bill approved by the committee would provide a temporary tax credit of up to $2,500 to people buying their first homes, as long as a contract was signed before the end of the year and the deal was closed within 90 days of signing the contract. The Bush Administration had sought a $5,000 credit.
The Senate committee's bill would also allow a 15 percent increase in the first year's depreciation for property purchased by businesses during the remainder of this year and put into use before July of next year.
The House did not include these or any of the Administration's stimulative devices in its version of the tax bill.
Mr. Bentsen also insisted that the bill include a reinstatement of tax-deductible individual retirement accounts for all taxpayers, regardless of income. The use of I.R.A.'s had been restricted for several years. The expansion of I.R.A.'s, which includes new variations on how the savings are protected from taxes and eliminates penalties for early withdrawal from the accounts in some circumstances, would cost an estimated $7.8 billion over five years.
The bill would also renew a dozen tax provisions that expired on June 30; repeal luxury taxes on expensive furs, jewels and yachts, and provide a new bill of rights for taxpayers having problems with the Internal Revenue Service.
In another difference with Senator Bentsen's approach, the Republican senators had wanted the bill to include a reduction in capital gains taxes for businesses that invest in depressed areas over a period of years. Such a provision was included in the House bill, winning it the Bush Administration's support before it passed by an overwhelming margin.
 
Tax Credits Favored
 But the bill as approved by the Senate Finance Committee would give most of its benefits to enterprises in the form of tax credits for paying wages to people who live in depressed areas, or in other tax benefits that would provide immediate paybacks instead of delayed ones, as capital gains tax cuts would.
For example, a business could get up to $8,000 in tax credits for an employee paid up to $20,000 a year. It could also write off immediately investments of up to $75,000 in plant and equipment each year, rather than depreciating the investments over time; the current limit on immediate expense deductions for this kind of equipment is $10,000.
Some of the offsetting tax increases included in the Bentsen bill are already drawing fire. Brad Johnson, a senior Washington adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, said the Governor was not happy with the Finance Committee's decision to make permanent the temporary limits on itemized deductions that can be taken by wealthier taxpayers. Mr. Johnson said the limits made it harder for state and local governments to raise their own taxes.

Open Treasury Auctions: Years Away

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A significant change in the workings of the bond market that is being considered by the Bush Administration in response to the Salomon Brothers scandal that came to light a year ago will not even be tested for years.
The recommended change -- to an open auction for Treasury securities along the lines of an art auction -- would not occur for "a significant period of time," Jerome H. Powell, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance and the man who oversees Treasury auctions, said yesterday. He added, "That is a program people will be working on for several years." 
 This comes as good news to some traders who think that the open auction system, advocated in a Government report in January as a measure to counter market manipulations, may not be as flawless as the report suggested.
 
Would Discourage Bidders
 William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities and a member of the policy-making board at the Public Securities Association, an industry group, breathed a sigh of relief. The open auction, also called an ascending-price auction, would discourage bidders because of the time it would take and thus would make Government borrowing more expensive, he said.
"The system we have is probably the best in the world," he said. "When 1 basis point means so much to the Treasury, the onus would be on those who want to change a very efficient system."
During an open auction, bids would be shown on screens and the bidding would continue through several rounds until the total of the bills, notes or bonds being auctioned were sold at the lowest yield, and thus at the lowest cost for the Treasury.
The Public Securities Association has not endorsed the proposal, which was one of the most controversial recommendations made by the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission in January. Their report focused on ways to improve the Treasury auction process and make it more difficult to manipulate the market; Salomon Brothers admitted last August that it had made a series of illegal bids in Treasury auctions.
 
Other Priorities
 Mr. Powell said he expected the Treasury auction system eventually to be changed to this open bidding system. But he said the Treasury had other priorities to deal with first. These include the automation or computerization of the Treasury auction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Bids are now submitted by hand, on paper, to the Federal Reserve.
Next is testing a single-price sealed-bid auction. Under the current system, the Treasury securities are auctioned in a sealed-bid process. The bids are assembled and the securities are awarded starting with the lowest interest-rate bid and moving up until the amount to be auctioned is sold. This means that one firm can bid more and end up paying more for securities than another firm that bids more aggressively. This is called the winner's curse.
In a single-price auction, all the securities would be awarded at the highest yield of all the accepted bids. This means that every dealer pays the same price. Therefore, there is no winner's curse. But the Treasury acknowledges that this approach might actually cost it less.
"Our view is that automation is the single most important change, and next is the single price to see if that is beneficial for the government," Mr. Powell said. He said the Treasury would announce within two months when it would test the single-price auction. One consideration is whether to do the test before the bidding system is automated.
 He acknowledged that both opposition to the ascending-price open auction and the difficulties of designing it mean that it is at least several years off. For example, he said it would take a year just to design the computer software for the open bidding.
"The practicalities have pushed it down the road a bit," he said. "And it is fair to say that the industry has reacted negatively to it."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
In the Market
 In the bond market, a series of mixed economic reports, profit taking on the recent rally and general nervousness before the August auctions of 3- and 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds led to a turbulent day for bonds and notes.
The buyers of the 5.5 percent five-year Treasury notes that were auctioned yesterday were hit especially hard. The price of that note dropped about five-eighths of a point, which meant heavy losses for some traders. "You really got hurt in a decline like this," said Mr. Brachfeld of Daiwa Securities.
The yield on the new five-year note ended yesterday at 5.71, up sharply from the 5.56 percent average rate the notes were awarded on Wednesday. The 5.56 percent yield was the lowest since five-year notes were first auctioned in 1977.
Traders said that the auction on Wednesday came at the current high of the market and that it now appeared the bidding for the five-year note was too aggressive -- that is, too much was paid for it.
The selloff today began with a flood of economic data, including reports that the gross domestic product increased only 1.4 percent in the second quarter, that home sales increased nearly 8 percent in June, and that initial claims for unemployment benefits declined 21,000 in the week that ended on July 18. The data combined to give the market an array of mixed signals.
 
'Got a Little Confused'
 "There was such a slew of data that the market got a little confused," said Stephen Slifer, a financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. The 30-year bond was down, came back, fell again and then ended higher for the day. By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 106 25/32, up 1/8 point to yield 7.42 percent, compared with 7.43 percent on Wednesday.
Mr. Slifer said profit taking after the strong rally in the market this month also contributed to the sharp declines early in the day. And he said that some investors might be thinking that the recent drop in mortgage rates would soon lead to an upturn in the housing sector.
Mr. Brachfeld was wondering whether the stall in the rally, which began on Wednesday, was just temporary or a sign of a turn in the market. But he did note that the long bond managed yesterday to bounce back when its yield neared the 7.5 percent level.

United and Continental Post 2d-Quarter Losses

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Two more airlines reported quarterly losses yesterday, while another leading airline said it would raise its fares in September.
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, said it lost $95.1 million in the second quarter and Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. reported a $99.2 million loss. The figures demonstrated anew that the weak economy has been an equal opportunity disaster for airlines. 
 Earlier this month, American, Delta, Northwest and USAir all reported big or record second-quarter losses. Even Alaska Airlines, a regional carrier, lost $17.8 million in the second quarter.
While some airline executives and analysts have blamed low air fares for contributing to the industry's woes, Continental yesterday announced new fares as low as $99 on one-way flights throughout the 48 mainland states, except between the Northeast and Florida. Tickets must be purchased no later than Tuesday and travel completed by Sept. 13.
 
Cuts by Delta
 And Delta Air Lines announced a 5 percent fare increase for domestic flights within the 48 states, beginning Sept. 1. It also announced a 30 percent reduction on 14-day advance purchase tickets for travel most days between Sept. 14 and Dec. 14. Tickets must be purchased by Aug. 31.
Delta thus reduced its New York to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 14-day roundtrip fare of $320 to $220. At the end of the sale, the fare will climb to $340. New York to Los Angeles, which cost $480 yesterday, is now $340 and will increase to $500.
The loss at Continental, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was an improvement over the $109.1 million loss in last year's second quarter. Revenue was flat, at $1.37 billion.
But United's second-quarter loss contrasted with net earnings in the second quarter a year earlier of $52.7 million, or $2.23 a share. Operating revenues in the most recent quarter rose 6.4 percent, to $3.14 billion, from $2.95 billion a year earlier, but operating expenses rose to $3.21 billion, from $2.89 billion last year.
"Our clearly unsatisfactory second-quarter results reflect the severe impact of revenue-dilutive pricing activity in the U.S., as well as the effects of the recessionary environment throughout much of the world," said Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive. "We expect these same factors to have a negative effect on our results for at least the balance of 1992. Unless this situation is reversed, alternative actions to reduce our expenses will have to be considered."
A United spokesman said he could not comment on whether those "alternative actions" might include abandoning the industry's simplified four-tier structure, adopted last April, which cut full coach fares by 38 percent.
Rumors abound that one or more major carriers will soon abandon that structure, but Delta's announcement yesterday carefully pointed out that both its proposed fare increase and its sale fare "are within the framework of the four-tier pricing structure which Delta feels best serves the needs of the consumers, airlines and travel agents."
But Delta, which lost $506.3 million for the six months that ended June 30, has also been scrambling to cut costs. Much of Delta's loss stemmed from the costs of taking over the former Pan American routes to Europe.
 
Losses by the Leader
 Even American, the industry leader, lost $166 million in the second quarter. While most of that resulted from special charges for a suspended reservations project and settling a lawsuit, the airline would have lost $48 million even without those costs.
American, too, is looking to economize, including considering whether to close as many as three unprofitable hubs. And Continental has reduced workers' pay an average of 10 percent, laid off some, and eliminated employee picnics as well as a summer youth jobs program.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, stocks of the Big Three airlines rose, with UAL up $3.625, to $114 a share; AMR, American's parent, up $1, to $66.625, and Delta up $1, to $56.

Athletes at the Gay Games Face No Commercial Clutter

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
ALL week there has been grumbling about the relentless commercialization of the Summer Olympics, the onslaught of advertisements, promotions and "official" products that threaten to overshadow the pomp and pageantry of the Games.
At the same time, the organizers of another large international athletic event have been watching enviously, wishing that they could have such problems. 
 The disparity between the two events can be explained by their names. One is the Olympics. The other is Gay Games IV, which will be held in New York in June 1994.
"It's an uphill battle all the way because it's a gay event," said Bruce Hayes, who won a gold medal in swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, then acknowledged his homosexuality and swam in Gay Games III six years later. "A lot of people are hesitant to get involved."
Mr. Hayes, now a vice president of the Hill & Knowlton public relations firm in New York, offered this pitch to corporate sponsors: "A lot of people are getting lost in the clutter in Barcelona, and the designation of Olympic sponsor means nothing. In the gay community, to be a sponsor of the Gay Games would mean the world."
How the Gay Games fares in its attempts to attract sponsors could be an acid test of a recent trend that has seen marketers and their agencies edging, however hesitantly, into advertising aimed at homosexuals.
For the better part of a decade, magazines and newspapers for gay men and lesbians have been assiduously courting Madison Avenue, offering demographic data indicating that their readers are affluent and well-educated consumers.
 And that pitch received help from the souring economy, which sent many advertisers scrambling to reach whatever consumer groups were still spending money. Publications like The Advocate, Genre, Out and QW now carry ads for Absolut vodka, Benetton clothing and Time Warner recording artists.
"The timing is really fortuitous," said Jay Hill, co-president of New York in '94 Inc., the group formed to handle arrangements for Gay Games IV. "Companies are really starting to recognize that the advantages of this market far outweigh the risks."
That is particularly true, added Mr. Hill, who is also associate special projects manager at Newsweek International in New York, "for a product that typically is third or fourth in its category, where a niche makes a big difference in market share."
But a sports sponsorship represents a different kind of commitment, because of what many advertising people perceive as tension between the macho imagery of athletics and the stereotypes of homosexuality.
 C. Howard Buford, a member of the board of New York in '94, said that to address those concerns, advertisers were being asked "to think of the Gay Games as less of a sports event and more of a gay and lesbian market event."
"We're pragmatic about this," added Mr. Buford, who is also a vice president and group account director at the Uniworld Group, a New York advertising agency. "We know some people will not want to be known as 'the official blank of the Gay Games.' "
Gay Games IV has one sponsor signed to date, Nora Beverages U.S.A., which markets Naya, a Canadian spring water, in the United States. Nora sponsored the Gay Games' promotional float in the Gay Pride parades last month in New York and San Francisco.
"I believe in niche marketing," said Stewart Levitan, vice president and general manager of Nora in Stamford, Conn., who at earlier stages of his career sponsored ads for Canada Dry soft drinks and Coors beer aimed at gay, black, women and Hispanic consumers. "It's a marketing decision, not a life-style choice."
Mr. Levitan said he had received letters from gay consumers who wrote that they were "switching from Evian to Naya" because of his sponsorship, and he said he was unconcerned about "straight backlash."
"If people say, 'We won't drink your water because you support gays,' I have my answer: 'Are you the bigot, or am I?' "
Organizers of Gay Games IV expect 15,000 participants from 40 countries. For Gay Games III, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1990, there were 7,250 participants, but no sponsors apart from Molson, the Canadian brewer, which paid $5,000 to sell beer on site.
"And sold more than $200,000 worth of beer," Mr. Hill estimated.
The Gay Games IV budget is about $5 million, though Mr. Hill said, "I always joke that if we've got more money, we'll spend it." There is no decision as yet as to how much will be sought from corporate sponsors, which will likely be asked to pay fees in the mid-to-high five-figure range.

HEADLINE: Albany Approves Fiscal Package for Suffolk and Jobs Bond Act

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 30

 BODY:
After bickering and lurching back and forth all day, the New York State Legislature finally passed a number of cleanup items on its agenda today, including an $800 million jobs bond act and a fiscal package for Suffolk County, and prepared to go home for the rest of the year.
The Suffolk bill would grant the county a one-year fix for its ailing economy by allowing it to raise its sales tax by half a cent, to 8.5 percent, and to borrow enough money to close its budget gap. In addition to that, and to the bond act, the State Senate passed a number of health-related bills that had already been passed by the Assembly, including one that would extend a program to provide health care to uninsured children. 
 In the end, it came down to the Suffolk bill. Republican Senators had always made it clear, with typical legislative petulance, that if the Assembly would not pass that measure, it would refuse to vote on either the jobs bond act or on a pair of bills that would allow New York City to continue to negotiate its own bond sales.
Everything finally worked out. But for most of the day, the carefully laid plans fell into chaos for a time when the seven Republican Assemblymen from Suffolk refused to support the Suffolk fiscal package, and Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Democrat, retorted that he would not let the measure come to a vote unless he was sure of their votes.
The seven members remained adamantly opposed despite the frantic exhortations of the Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, a Republican and former Assemblyman who desperately needed the package.
The Assembly members said that politically they could not vote for a package that raised taxes, no matter how much they might support the bill in private. "It's too hot a vote," said Mr. Gaffney. "As some members have indicated, 'There's nothing personal, Bob. Business is business.' "
It was Mr. Weprin who ultimately gave in, saying that he would put the measure to a vote even without the Suffolk Republicans' support. "I didn't want to tear down the entire house just because Mr. Gaffney's brick was missing," Mr. Weprin said.
That created a peculiar situation when Assemblyman John C. Cochrane, a Suffolk Republican, agreed to sponsor the bill and to speak in favor of it, but voted against it anyway.
"Someone from Suffolk needs to carry it," Mr. Cochrane said by way of explanation. But he wouldn't vote for it? "That's correct," he said. "Isn't that interesting?"

HEADLINE: ECONOMY'S GROWTH IN SECOND QUARTER WAS A SLIGHT 1.4%

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
The economy's growth was a stunted 1.4 percent from April through June, less than half the growth rate of the first quarter, and the 1990-91 recession was considerably longer and deeper than previously believed, the Government said today.
As Democrats quickly went on the offensive, seizing the figures to castigate President Bush's economic stewardship, the White House rushed to put the best face it could on the double dose of bad news. 
 Canceling plans to spend a day free of public appearances, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas called a hasty news conference in Little Rock. "Today's economic statistics confirm what the American people have been trying to tell the President for some time now," he told reporters assembled on the lawn of the governor's mansion. "We are in a crisis, an economic crisis, and it's far more painful than this Administration has ever understood."
 
Uneven Growth 'Not Unusual'
 President Bush, on a campaign stop in Waxahachie, Tex., on his way to California for more political appearances, told workers at the supercollider construction site that "this kind of uneven growth is not unusual." But he acknowledged that the economy "is not growing fast enough."
"Economists predict that the economy is going to get stronger the rest of the year," he said, adding that low inflation and exports should help fuel growth.
But the report on gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services produced by labor and operations in the United States -- had few bright spots.
 
'Spurt and Stall Pattern'
 "It's a poor second-quarter number," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "It shows a continuation of this spurt and stall pattern we've seen since the Persian Gulf war ended. You get a couple of good months of growth. Then there's no momentum and the economy stalls out."
While a number of economists are worried that the poor second-quarter performance means that economic growth could fizzle altogether, most economists expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first, spurred in large part by lower interest rates. But few expect a strong pickup soon.
"It's doubtful that the economy can help George Bush between now and the election," said David D. Hale, chief economist at the Kemper Financial Companies. "He's going to have to live with sluggish growth."
Indeed, in an accompanying annual report revising growth estimates for the last three years, the Government said that the recession that began in mid-1990 lasted three quarters rather than two and that during the downturn the economy shrank by 2.2 percent rather than the 1.6 percent previously reported.
As for 1992, economists had expected later activity to be less robust than in the first three months, but the second quarter's 1.4 percent was even weaker than the 1.7 percent that appeared to be the consensus of economists. The drop in growth was accentuated by an upward revision in the estimate for first-quarter growth to a respectable 2.9 percent, from 2.7 percent.
The reasons for the upward revision in first-quarter figures were that business inventories and spending on housing were greater than previously estimated.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the $6 trillion economy, slipped by three-tenths of 1 percent in the three-month period after climbing by 5.1 percent in the first quarter.
 
Signs of Improvement
 There are some signs of economic improvement ahead. The Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to a 21-month low of 400,000 in the week ended July 18, a drop of 21,000 from the previous week. And the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said new home sales, buoyed by lower interest rates, jumped by 7.9 percent in June, ending four straight monthly declines.
But even with these signs, most analysts agreed with the assessment of Albert T. Sommers, chief economist for the Conference Board, a business research organization. "We are in a very spongy environment, with growth in the 1 to 2 percent range," he said. .
J. Antonio Villamil, Acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, asserted that mild winter weather in the first quarter accounted for shopping and housing starts that normally would have taken place in the second quarter. The reduction of withholding taxes and the acceleration of tax refunds pulled some economic activity into the first three months of the year, he added.
The economic growth report showed that exports had slipped in the second quarter, after rising in the first quarter. Perhaps the brightest spot in the economic growth report was the 13.5 percent increase in business investment, compared with 3 percent in the first quarter. Business inventories inched up slightly in the second quarter.
 
Boeing Shipments Cited
 Some economists suggested that exports fell and business investment soared because many of the Boeing Corporation's deliveries were exported in the first quarter, but its second-quarter deliveries were sold to domestic companies, and thus count as investment.
In the housing report, the Government said new home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 572,000, from 530,000 in May. Sales were up strongly in the Northeast and West, but slipped in the Midwest and South.
In the jobless claims report, the Labor Department noted that the average of the last four weeks, which is viewed as a better guide than weekly figures, slid to 410,000 from 415,000 a month earlier.
The revisions of the economy's performance from 1989 to 1991 will further fuel criticisms that growth has been slower under President Bush than under any other postwar President. The report revised downward to four-tenths of 1 percent from six-tenths of 1 percent, the annualized rate of economic growth from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1991.
The report also revised downward last year's growth, saying it was a minuscule one-tenth of 1 percent, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, down from the previous estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent.
The report said the recession lasted from the third quarter of 1990 through the first quarter of 1991, and not just from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the first quarter of 1991, as was originally believed.
Each year the Commerce Department issues updates on its past reports for past economic performance, basing its revisions on more complete reports, like budget, farm and trade data and Internal Revenue Service tabulations.
 
Reasons for Revisions
 The principal reasons for revising the record downward, Commerce Department officials said, were lower than previously reported figures for personal spending on services and on business investment in durable equipment.
The report said the economy shrank by 1.6 percent on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 1990. The Commerce Department had previously reported growth of two-tenths of 1 percent in that quarter.
"What we're seeing is this last recession looks much more like an average recession than the mild recession," said Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw Hill. "Now we know why it felt like an average recession."
The report said the economy shrank in 1990 by five-tenths of 1 percent, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, while the previous estimate was a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent. Growth for 1989 was revised to 1.6 percent from 1.7 percent.
Data included in the gross domestic product for the second quarter of 1992 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates.

HEADLINE: Noncitizens and Right to Vote;
Advocates for Immigrants Explore Opening Up Balloting

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
They are, by most measures, typical New Yorkers who pay taxes, endure the subways, send their children to city schools and complain about rents, crime and alternate-side-of-the-street parking. But one thing sets them apart.
As legal immigrants who are not United States citizens, one million New Yorkers cannot vote in city elections. One-eighth of the population, they are, in the traditional political sense, powerless. But that could change. 
 Increasingly, advocates for immigrants here -- as in Washington, Los Angeles and several smaller cities across the nation -- have begun exploring the sensitive issue of securing voting privileges for immigrants who are not citizens.
"It is said that immigrants' rights are the civil rights of the 1990's," said Jamin Raskin, an American University law professor who is the intellectual author of this grass-roots drive. "By that logic, noncitizen voting is the suffrage movement of the decade."
If noncitizens were given a voice in local politics, proponents say, they would not feel the impotence that occasionally spills over into the kind of street violence that recently erupted in the Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights. But opponents counter that the right to vote should be earned, not given away; it is a prize that many citizens fought to obtain.
There are about 10 million legal immigrants who are not United States citizens. Some are not yet eligible because they only recently arrived or earned legal status; others are unwilling, for personal and financial reasons, to renounce their homelands. In number at least, they represent a potential political force of some diversity and dimension, particularly in such cities as New York.
That, in part, is why this issue is so threatening to some and so appealing to others. But equally important to many critics is that, in their eyes, the concept of voting rights tinkers with the very notion of what it means to be a United States citizen.
"No one should be given the franchise without taking the Pledge of Allegiance," said Daniel Stein, executive director of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group that supports stricter immigration controls. "If you divorce citizenship and voting, citizenship stops having any meaning at all."
 
Ethnic Tensions Fanned
 In cities where legislation was drafted to give noncitizens the vote, ethnic political tensions have been quickly fanned, particularly between blacks and Latinos. In others, even discussion of such efforts has elicited anti-immigrant sentiments. And so far this year, only the suburban town of Takoma Park, Md., has succeeded in granting noncitizen immigrants the right to vote.
Most state legislatures -- which the United States Constitution charges with defining the electorate -- are chronically reluctant to make election law changes. Nonetheless, the debate is gaining energy.
In New York, for example, the recent protests and rioting in the Dominican community of Washington Heights gave fresh momentum to a noncitizen voting-rights drive. The New York State Assembly's 24-member Task Force on New Americans plans to introduce a bill this summer that will enable municipalities to extend the vote to immigrants who are residents but not citizens.
Until World War I, nearly half of the states in the country allowed immigrants to vote at one time or another, even in Presidential elections. Aliens enjoyed voting rights that many citizens -- blacks and women -- did not.
After World War I, at a moment of high military nationalism, state after state purged their constitutions of alien suffrage provisions, although the nation has continued to draft immigrants at times of war. Many states, New York among them, now specify that voters must be citizens. Others, such as Maryland, leave voter criteria up to the localities.
Five Maryland suburbs, in fact, have been allowing aliens to vote for decades without controversy but they are primarily members of the diplomatic community.
 
'Taxpayers and Neighbors'
 What happened in Takoma Park, population 17,000, was different. Ideology was involved.
The suburb provided sanctuary to Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees in the 1980's; some 2,000 noncitizen immigrants, mostly Central Americans, now live there. When it came time to draw up new voting wards, equal in population, based on 1990 Census numbers, an injustice manifested itself, said Professor Raskin, a Takoma Park resident. Those wards with immigrant populations had fewer voters.
"They may be aliens from a national or international perspective, but locally they are taxpayers, neighbors and parents of kids in schools," Professor Raskin said. "No taxation without representation, remember?"
The Takoma Park "Share the Vote" campaign, which succeeded last November by the slimmest of margins, made one dark argument amid its idealism: People without access to normal channels of political participation will find other ways, perhaps violent ways, to make their grievances understood. Look at Mount Pleasant, advocates said.
In Mount Pleasant, a neighborhood in Washington, Central Americans rioted in the spring of 1991 after police officers wounded a Salvadoran man they said was wielding a knife. As in Washington Heights, the immigrants took to the streets to vent frustrations that they said were never paid any heed -- because no politician was beholden to them.
Buoyed by the success of the campaign in Takoma Park and sobered by a visit to El Salvador, the Washington City Council member who represents Mount Pleasant sponsored his own bill for noncitizens. But when community leaders, especially blacks, protested the very concept, Councilman Frank Smith Jr., who is black, shrunk his measure to apply only to immigrants who have formally applied for citizenship, a relatively small group. The bill comes up for a hearing in September.
"The Latino versus African-American issue is not an issue of political power at this point; it's an issue of economics," Mr. Smith said. "Some folks say I'm encouraging people to stay here and compete with us. But they're going to stay here anyway. "
Also this spring, in Los Angeles, Leticia Quezada, the first Latina president of the school board, formally proposed allowing noncitizen parents to vote in school board elections. Her "parent empowerment" proposal, interpreted by opponents as a masked attempt to expand her constituency, particularly angered black educators. A school board vote was postponed, even as Latino parents threatened to pull their children out of school in protest.
"Unfortunately, the temperament of this state, particularly in a recession, is significantly anti-immigrant," Ms. Quezada said. "But even if this is something that cannot be done immediately, I believe we are at the infancy stage of a new movement."
The ethnic dynamics may prove to be different in New York than they were in Washington and Los Angeles. In New York, the immigrant population is more diverse, with large numbers of non-Latino black Caribbean immigrants.
"You'll have certain populations resentful, but possibly it won't be the African-Americans here, but the old-line whites," said Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League.
If history is any lesson, perhaps even the idea will be less controversial in New York, particularly in the city.
In the late 1960's, a radical move in New York City went largely unnoticed. With the decentralization of the New York City schools, all parents -- illegal and legal immigrants included -- were awarded the right to vote in the 32 community school board elections.
Although a very local privilege, it has been used in some neighborhoods to reshape community politics. In Washington Heights, an active parent registration drive in 1986 brought in 10,000 parent voters, most of them immigrants.

HEADLINE: Enjoying the Benefits of Austerity

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Hard times have taught corporate America a powerful lesson: the art of cost-cutting and productivity gains.
Many companies were able to earn better-than-expected profits in the second quarter by honing such skills, making themselves sharper competitors. What remains to be seen is whether they will continue to apply those hard-learned lessons when consumers start buying again in earnest, making profits easier to come by. 
 But for now, against a backdrop of economic malaise and Presidential election uncertainties, the positive earnings are lending confidence to many on Wall Street that the stock market will not collapse when this week's rally subsides. The earnings are "one of the few sources of comfort left in this game," said David Blitzer, chief economist of the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
More than half the companies reporting second-quarter profits in recent weeks have posted gains higher than analysts' estimates. Over all, operating earnings are 1.3 percent above predictions, and 17 percent above the operating earnings posted in the second quarter of 1991, according to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which tracks earnings forecasts and results.
That is an accomplishment, considering that the economy was slowing during this year's April-to-June period. The Commerce Department said yesterday that growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the second quarter, less than half the rate in the first three months of the year.
"Corporations are learning how to be profitable in a slow-growth economic environment," said Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist at Kidder, Peabody.
That lesson was vividly portrayed Tuesday by the Chrysler Corporation, when it reported earnings of $178 million, more than double the forecasts of the most optimistic analysts. Chrysler's wholesale restructuring of the way it develops cars helped the auto maker steer clear of many of the costly changes that would typically have been required before bringing out its new Jeep and a family of new sedans.
Other companies are attributing their improved profits to less expensive raw materials. The Scott Paper Company, for example, reported a 53 percent quarterly rise in earnings, in part because of lower pulp costs. And banks have benefited from interest rates that have fallen to levels not seen in decades.
Stronger-than-expected earnings from companies including Dow Chemical, Du Pont, Tenneco and Phillips Petroleum have calmed some of the nervousness that has made the stock market particularly jumpy in recent weeks. On July 7, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 44 points on fears that second-quarter earnings would hold some unpleasant surprises, a worry sparked by word from Georgia-Pacific that earnings were expected to be lower than a year earlier.
But with the drumbeat of mostly good news over the subsequent weeks, investors relaxed somewhat. "There was not a series of minefields after all," said Eric T. Miller, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
 
Few Workers Benefiting
 The earnings reports have certainly lifted the spirits in many corporate board rooms. Executives of Mitchell & Company, a management consulting firm in Weston, Mass., say that the 50 or so top corporate officers it meets with each month generally believe the worst is behind them and that a gradual upturn is at hand. "People are happier," said Carol B. Coles, Mitchell's president.
The upbeat earnings are not entirely good news, however. Workers are not seeing the benefits through any increase in hiring, as recent unemployment statistics suggest. And yesterday's Commerce Department report underscored the problem, noting that the percentage of companies' revenues spent on compensating workers was flat or down.
"The dilemma is that corporations are not rehiring workers the way they had historically" in other fledgling recoveries, Mr. Vignola said.
From the employers' standpoint, however, some analysts worry that as sluggish times continue, companies may start running out of ideas and opportunities for further cost-cutting measures and productivity increases.
 
Not Every Company Made Money
 To be sure, there was no shortage of companies posting sour earnings reports.
Airlines, badly bruised by their recent fare war, posted deep losses for the second quarter. And profits at many oil companies were down because of depressed demand, although the oil sector over all outpaced analysts' predictions.
Net income figures have also been weighed down in many cases by costs associated with restructurings. Last week, for example, the Amoco Corporation reported a loss of $478 million in the second quarter because of an $805 million charge for job cuts and revamping its business units. And the Digital Equipment Corporation reported a loss of $1.85 billion for its fourth quarter after a $1.5 billion restructuring charge.
In several cases, news about healthy profits has driven down stock prices. Investors sold off bank stocks after many financial institutions reported strong profits, apparently believing that earnings from the wide margins between the cost of buying and lending money had reached their peak.
And on Wednesday, shares of the Ford Motor Company fell even though the auto maker posted second-quarter earnings of $502 million, reversing a loss in last year's period. The previous day, Chrysler's surprise earnings lifted investors' hopes that Ford would repeat the performance, an expectation that drove up Ford's stock $1.75, to $45.75.
But when Ford's earnings turned out to be only even with analysts' predictions, the stock dipped $1.50 -- though it gained back most of that yesterday, closing at $45.50, up $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Small Businesses Still Waiting
 The small-business sector remains troubled but is showing some signs of improving.
A survey of small companies conducted in June for the National Federation of Independent Businesss showed that 22 percent of the small businesses surveyed had higher earnings than a year earlier, while 35 percent had lower earnings. While bleak, those figures are more encouraging than in June 1991, when 17 percent reported higher earnings and 46 percent posted lower profits.
William C. Dunkleberg, the Temple University Business School dean who oversees the survey, also said that hiring plans remained flat at small companies and that inventories were at their lowest levels in the 19-year history of the survey.
"Small businesses are lean and mean," Mr. Dunkleberg said. "They're just waiting for customers."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Dips on Hint That Fed Is Reluctant to Give Support

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell late yesterday, weakening on a senior Federal Reserve official's comments that suggested the central bank was reluctant to buy dollars to support the United States currency.
Gold prices barely budged. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for current delivery fetched $356.50 an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, the price was $356.70, up 30 cents from the day before. 
 Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range through most of the day but fell in New York in the late afternoon on reports of comments by David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Mullins told a group of securities dealers in New York that the dollar's value should be "set in the market by market fundamentals" and should not be manipulated.
"That brought on the selling interest," said John McCarthy, chief dealer for the New York branch of Algemene Bank Nederland, a Dutch bank.
Dealers had been reluctant to sell the dollar aggressively since the Fed acted in concert with other banks on July 20 to swoop into the foreign exchange markets to buy the currency. The central banks acted after German interest rates rose, touching off a sharp decline in the dollar's value and global stock markets.
But pessimism about an improvement in the dollar has remained widespread, as the languishing United States economy shows few signs of improvement and American interest rates keep falling. That makes dollar-denominated holdings worth less compared with currencies in countries where interest rates are significantly higher, like Germany, Britain and France.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.77 Japanese yen, from 127.98 yen Wednesday. Later in London it fell to 127.63 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 127.50 yen, down from 127.80 yen Wednesday.
The British pound was unchanged in London at $1.9185. Later in New York the pound strengthened to $1.9260, from $1.9215 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Cash Flood For Bond Funds

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors are pouring money into bond mutual funds at what may be the fastest rate ever, fund managers said yesterday. And they said that stock funds, after dipping in popularity in June, appear to be bringing in more cash again.
"This is a spectacular sales environment," said Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company. "July will be one of the strongest months we've ever had in the bond area." 
 The surge of cash into bond funds has come as long-term interest rates have fallen, producing profits for such funds. At the same time, short-term rates have fallen to their lowest level in decades, making certificates of deposit and money market funds less attractive investments.
"Bond fund sales are up 25 percent over June," said Bruce Speca of TNE Fund Group, a subsidiary of the New England, a financial services company.
Mr. Speca noted that while money market funds were still yielding around 3.2 percent, much of that comes from securities bought months ago. As those securities mature, he said, money market fund yields will fall below 3 percent by the end of August, which he forecast would send bond fund sales up yet again.
In June, the Investment Company Institute reported yesterday, a net total of $9 billion came into bond funds, the highest of any month this year and approaching the peak levels of early 1987, just before the bond market plunged, ending that bull market in bonds.
The figures from the institute, a trade group of mutual fund companies, showed that a net $5.3 billion was invested in stock funds in June. While that is a high level by standards that prevailed before last December, it is the lowest of any month this year, and indicative of some hesitation by investors who were disappointed by the fact that most stocks have declined in 1992.
But fund managers said that equity fund sales bounced back in July. "We're now at the highest percentage of equity sales we've had all year," said Troy Shaver, the president of John Hancock Mutual Funds. Mr. Speca added that at TNE, stock fund sales were up about 5 percent in June, although they were still below May's record levels.
Stock fund sales were reported to be especially strong in at T. Rowe Price, which was unusual in reporting better cash flow gains in stock funds than in bond funds. Its stock funds had suffered more than most in June, as funds that specialize in small stocks had outflows.
Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price, said total net cash flow for stock and bond funds so far this year was 22 percent greater than the figure for all of 1991, which was the best year ever for the firm.
The professionals who manage stock mutual funds had been growing more cautious for much of the year. In June, they bought a net $1.4 billion in stocks, leaving the rest of the $5.3 billion sitting in cash, awaiting what the managers expected to be lower prices.
Over all by the end of June, stock funds saw their cash levels rise to 9.6 percent of total assets, up from 7.9 percent at the end of January. In dollar terms, cash assets in stock funds amounted to a record $38.8 billion, $9.1 billion more than at the end of January.
Such large amounts of cash can provide powerful support for a stock market, and no doubt some of the money was invested earlier this week, when the Dow Jones industrial average leaped more than 100 points in two days.
By contrast, bond fund managers have been much more willing to invest the cash sent in by investors, evidently expecting bond prices to continue rising. At the end of June, those funds had 6.1 percent of their assets in cash, down slightly from 6.2 percent at the end of May and the lowest figure since February 1987, when the figure was 5.6 percent.
Most fund managers say the surge of cash has been invested in more conservative funds, in both the bond and stock areas, as investors dismayed by low yields from banks and money market funds have tried to increase returns without adding great risk.
That trend was especially strong in stock funds. General equity funds -- ones that are not severely restricted in investment policy -- are divided into three categories. The least conservative, called aggressive growth funds, had net cash flow of $788 million in June, less than half as much as the $1.8 billion that came into the most conservative category, called growth and income funds. Last December, when small and speculative stocks were soaring, aggressive growth funds took in $2.1 billion, compared with $1.8 billion for the more conservative group.
That caution extended to the fund managers. The aggressive growth funds had 12.1 percent of their assets in cash at the end of June, compared with 6.5 percent at the end of January. But growth and income funds had just 7.3 percent of their assets in cash, less than the 7.5 percent recorded in January.
Among the bond funds, funds that specialize in shorter maturities and those that specialize in adjustable-rate mortgages continued to pull in cash. Both have relatively little chance of suffering big losses in principal.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
A More Vigorous Bush Tries To Halt Losses in California

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., July 30

 BODY:
Once this was solid Bush country. Now it is the belly of the beast, and President Bush entered it today, still searching for a formula to revive a suddenly and ominously flagging bid for re-election.
Mr. Bush began a two-day visit to conservative Orange County for what may prove a bellwether of his campaign's ability to pull out of a national slump that so far has defied eight months of strategizing and sometimes hapless politicking. 
 At his first stop this afternoon Mr. Bush showed a vigor that his campaign has lacked lately, giving a barbed, finger-jabbing lecture on military policy to his Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that had a roomful of workers at a high-tech factory on their feet cheering.
Without naming the Democratic Presidential nominee, Mr. Bush ridiculed Mr. Clinton's foreign and defense policies, joking that they took up but 141 words in his 54-minute acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention two weeks ago. "And if you blinked or had to do something else, or even heated up a ham and cheese sandwich in the microwave, you missed the entire part."
 
'Swords Into Pork Barrels'
 The President accused Mr. Clinton of advocating "reckless" cuts in military spending that would be wasted on pet Democratic projects, "beating swords into pork barrels."
"Cuts of that magnitude would jeopardize America's ability to defend our citizens, our interests and our ideals," he told 300 workers at Odetics, a company here that makes robot-like machines for the military and industry. And he added, "Let me bring it very close to home: cuts of that magnitude would cost workers in the defense industry as many as one million jobs."
Mr. Clinton favors gradually reducing the Pentagon's $300 billion-a-year budget by between $60 billion and $90 billion over five years. Mr. Bush proposes a similar phased-in decrease, but totaling about $45 billion.
The President's campaign spokeswoman, Torie Clarke, later beamed. "We're talking about some very fundamental differences in philosophy," she said.
Mr. Bush's new sharpness will also delight many California Republicans. But there is so much more to do, they say. And the hour is very late.
 
'A Sense of Despair'
 "He's in deep trouble in California," Steven A. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer who headed Mr. Bush's California strategy committee in 1988, said in an interview today. "If the election were held today he'd lose, and lose big. There's even a sense of despair, which I think the campaign has to act very quickly to turn around. These people want to see some fight."
Indeed, Mr. Bush's 1988 thrashing of Michael S. Dukakis in Orange County, by a 2-to-1 margin, seems a dim memory these days. One California poll shows him trailing Mr. Clinton by 34 percentage points statewide, and some political experts here say the situation in Orange County is little better.
The good news, Mr. Merksamer said, is that the President can still win California in November. The bad news is that it will be "extraordinarily difficult" and growing more so "with each passing hour."
Worst of all, Mr. Merksamer might have added, is that the campaign's woes in California are but a magnified version of the troubles that plague Mr. Bush everywhere: a bad economy, a listless re-election strategy and the widespread view that the President has little to offer in the next four years.
 
Cracks in Voter Coalition
 Political strategists here and in Washington say Mr. Bush is losing the main ingredients of the voter coalition that carried him to victory over Mr. Dukakis four years ago.
One is the Reagan Democrats, the blue-collar workers who deserted Mr. Dukakis, Walter F. Mondale and Jimmy Carter to vote Republican in the last three Presidential elections. This year many went first to Ross Perot and, after Mr. Perot left the Presidential race two weeks ago, to Mr. Clinton.
The other is the bedrock of far-right conservatives who worshiped President Ronald Reagan and kept faith with Mr. Bush in 1988. This year, dismayed by Mr. Bush's failure in 1990 to honor his campaign pledge against new taxes, and unhappy with his economic stewardship, they are wavering.
Orange County, a bedroom community replete with both groups, is a test of the Bush campaign's ability to win back voters who so far have rejected Mr. Bush's message in droves.
 
Government Out of Control
 What aggrieves California is what ails the rest of the nation, only worse. The collapse of the real estate market and military contracts has pushed unemployment statewide to more than 9.5 percent, compared with 7.8 percent nationwide. The state government is so strapped that it is paying its bills with i.o.u.'s.
Scandals in the state government and in Congress have touched major state political figures, and voters are disgusted with Washington's and Sacramento's seeming inability to control the situation, Republican political strategists say.
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, is even less popular than Mr. Bush, no small handicap to the President since Mr. Wilson's political organization is running much of Mr. Bush's California campaign.
Nevertheless, it is Mr. Bush's campaign, not Mr. Wilson's, that is the primary concern these days, despite five visits by the President to the state this year.
As elsewhere, California Republicans say they have complained to the White House that Mr. Bush seems distracted and sometimes insulated from economic and other domestic problems.
"Where are the street fighters?" asked one California strategist.
 
Lag in 'Energy Level'
 Mark Timmerman, a Sacramento political consultant with Russo, Marsh & Associates, said in an interview that the Bush campaign seemed to lack the "energy level" required for a come-from-behind race.
"They have to structure his time and make him available, get him to the right people," Mr. Timmerman said. "And it's just critical that they don't wait until the convention to put some big events in place, so people can see he has the energy and the capability to run things."
Mr. Timmerman said that if the President hoped to catch up by November he needed a change of strategy in California, in which he stresses the differences between himself and Mr. Clinton more vigorously and more often. And he said he believed Republicans had suffered from the false notion all summer long that Mr. Bush had hit bottom and had nowhere to go but up with Californians.
"I think it caught everyone off guard, and the bottom has been a lot deeper than anyone thought," he said. "But they'd better have seen bottom now."

HEADLINE: Immovable Object;
Granite Regime of Saddam Hussein Seems Little Worn by Political Storm

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 30

 BODY:
Two years after he invaded Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein remains a formidable figure in this part of the world, defying the United Nations and stirring up Arab feeling against the conservative Persian Gulf monarchies that joined the United States in trying to overthrow him.
His army may have been vanquished, and there have been unconfirmed reports about plots from within the army against him. Indeed, today President Hussein realigned his cabinet by shifting the Foreign Minister, Ahmad Hussein, to the Finance Ministry and replacing him with Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf, the official Iraqi News Agency said, without explaining the change. 
 And it is difficult for a visitor to estimate the degree of popular support for Mr. Hussein. This is still a police state, and no opposition is permitted. Any criticism of Mr. Hussein is by its nature private, and only rarely reaches strangers.
 
Hardship Breeds Paradox
 But President Hussein's grip on power seems no weaker, and many Iraqis and diplomats believe he is in fact stronger than at any time since the gulf war ended 18 months ago. And many here believe the United Nations trade embargo, now biting painfully into the lives of ordinary Iraqis, paradoxically strengthens his hand by encouraging them to rally to his Government.
Baghdad continues to assert its claim on Kuwait. Iraqi television is now broadcasting a 30-part series called "Mirage and Reality," explaining why Kuwait is really Iraq's 19th province, which was the premise that led to the invasion on Aug. 2, 1990.
The President's half brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, recently suggested that Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Oman partition the gulf, with Saudi Arabia taking Bahrain and Qatar, Oman taking the United Arab Emirates and Iraq naturally getting Kuwait. This, he argued, would create a more stable region from which the United States could then withdraw.
 
The Force of Arms
 Saddam Hussein's badly mauled forces are still able enough to bottle up the rebellious Kurds in the north and keep pressure on dissident Shiites in the south.
This continuing instability at either end of the country further bolsters the Government by encouraging the President's Sunni Muslim power base to coalesce around him.
Ruthless but benevolent, a man given to sudden acts of generosity as well as brutality, Saddam Hussein is seen by an increasing number of middle-class Iraqis as a bulwark against anarchy and chaos in difficult times.
President Hussein has also opened a propaganda offensive against the kings and emirs of the region, denouncing them almost daily as profligate traitors to the Arab cause while presenting himself as the region's only true Arab nationalist, ready to confront the United States.
"As you see, the mother of battles goes on because the enemy wants it to go on," he said last Sunday in a typically defiant outburst.
 
A Kind of Lure to the U.S.
 This continuing standoff between the man who seized Kuwait and the countries that drove him out is seen by some diplomats as having some advantages for the United States: They suggest that Washington may not be displeased to see this weakened lion roaring safely inside his cage.
Also, the louder Saddam Hussein vows vengeance on his enemies, the more Saudi Arabia and its neighbors will look to the United States for protection, increasing Washington's influence with some of the world's major oil producers. The United States has sold $20 billion worth of arms in the region since the war ended.
And the logic of freeing Kuwait has forced Washington to begin its most serious effort in decades to get Israel to surrender authority in the occupied territories to the Palestinians, as Iraq has demanded. If real progress is made on this issue, few here doubt that President Hussein will claim credit -- and that many Arabs will agree.
 
Backlash From Embargo
 Now Iraq is claiming a second victory, this time against the Security Council's economic embargo, which was to bring Baghdad to its knees.
Life is hard for ordinary Iraqis, with prices soaring and shortages worsening despite President Hussein's campaign against "speculators" that is said to have led to the execution of as many as 40 prominent merchants over the last week or so.
The Government's success in reviving basic services knocked out by the allied air war has become a new source of Government pride, a potent symbol of Iraq's ability to take care of itself and frustrate the embargo.
Self-reliance has become a new Government slogan. And once again it contains an implicit criticism of the oil monarchs, with their costly reliance on foreigners and imported goods.
 
Showdown With the U.N.
 No one knows how Iraq has managed so much reconstruction despite the embargo. Clearly sanctions are being broken and the country still has secret funds abroad.
But the argument heard here is that sanctions will weaken over time and, having survived so long, the President can probably survive some more.
It is also a mark of Mr. Hussein's growing confidence that he is resisting the draconian conditions the Security Council sought to impose after the war.
Iraq has rejected a Security Council offer to sell oil for food and medicine and demands for compensation to victims of the invasion. And Baghdad refuses to accept the demarcation of a new frontier with Kuwait.
As a result, the elaborate machinery the Security Council created to make President Hussein pay for his folly is paralyzed.
 
What's in It for Baghdad?
 It is not difficult to see why Iraq is being hard-nosed. President Hussein himself has said the United States will never lift sanctions while he is in power. So Iraq knows it can expect no letup before the Presidential election in November, even if it does comply with Security Council orders. Thus, cooperation brings no benefits and defiance has no cost.
Nevertheless, Iraq has consistently backed down in confrontations with the Security Council when threatened with force. And that suggests that Saddam Hussein cannot count on his forces' loyalty if they are attacked again.
How much embarrassment Iraq's regular denunciations of the neighboring sheikdoms and their lavish ways causes the rulers there is hard to estimate, but it seems to be making some impact in parts of the Arab world, winning some tolerance if not outright friendship for Baghdad.
Egypt has said sanctions should be eased. Bahrain has recently called for Iraq to be more active in gulf affairs to create a better "regional balance." And Oman kept its embassy open here throughout the recent tension.
The ambassador of one Muslim country even predicts that Saudi Arabia will seek closer ties with Iraq in a year's time, even if Saddam Hussein is still in power.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Defends Position on Iraqi War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 30

 BODY:
For the second time this week, the festering matter of Saddam Hussein intruded into the 1992 Presidential race, as Bill Clinton found himself unexpectedly on the defensive today in attempting to answer Republican accusations that he had misrepresented himself as an early supporter of the use of force against the Iraqi dictator.
Mr. Clinton had called a news conference on the lawn of the Governor's mansion here in hopes of scoring a few quick points against President Bush in light of economic figures released today that show the nation's recovery weaker than Mr. Bush has been inclined to admit. 
 But the questioning quickly turned to accusations raised by the second of the Bush-Quayle campaign's new daily anti-Clinton press releases. In the statement issued by the Republican campaign's Washington headquarters, Mary Matalin, the deputy campaign manager, accused Mr. Clinton of "riding tall in the straddle" in suggesting in public comments that he had been "an early and unambiguous supporter of the President's use of force against the Iraqi army."
 
For Sanctions and War
 At issue is whether Mr. Clinton was among those political leaders who unequivocally supported military action against Iraq or whether he favored delaying the onset of war in hopes that the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations might force the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait.
In explaining his position today, Mr. Clinton seemed to suggest the he had been for both courses of action.
"What I said was that I had a great deal of sympathy with those who were arguing that sanctions had not been given adequate time," he said. "But that the Congress could not afford to go on record, in my judgment, undermining the U.N. position that the war was legal on January 15, and that I thought the Congress should vote to support the U.N. resolution to make the war legal on January 15, and that they could argue tactically if they wished whether hostilities should commence on the 15th or on some later date."
A review of Mr. Clinton's public statements on the war supports his recollection of his position, but also appears to support the idea that he was, at bottom, a very late and very ambiguous supporter of the war, and that he later sought to suggest otherwise, in political appearances and interviews.
 
'I Supported the Gulf War'
 On a number of occasions, and as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Clinton has made remarks that indicated, in clear language, that he was a firm supporter of the war.
"I supported the gulf war, and supported being firm with Saddam Hussein," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Illinois on Tuesday, in one of several such remarks he made during the course of statements harshly criticizing Mr. Bush for his handling of Mr. Hussein and the war.
He made a similar statement during a March 1992 breakfast with Washington reporters, saying, "I supported the President's policy in the Persian Gulf," and he used this stance during a televised debate last December to differentiate himself from his Democratic opponents in the Presidential primary process.
His reported statements in the weeks and months leading to the war were, in keeping with his statement today, much more ambivalent, and suggested a position neither precisely in support of nor precisely opposed to the use of force.
He does not appear to have taken a publicly reported position at all before Jan. 14, 1991, two days after Congress voted to give the President authority to go to war.
He was first quoted on the subject in the Jan. 15 issue of The Pine Bluff Commercial, in an article by The Associated Press and in an article the same day in The Arkansas Gazette.
In the Associated Press article, Mr. Clinton is quoted as saying that, if he had been a member of Congress, he probably -- not certainly -- would have voted with the majority to grant the President war-making authority, but that he personally agreed with the arguments voiced by the minority, that the United Nations sanctions ought to be given more time to work. "I guess I would have voted for the majority if it was a close vote," Mr. Clinton was quoted as saying. "But I agree with the arguments the minority made."
He suggested that a vote to give the President authority to go to war was not necessarily a vote for immediate military action, saying that many members had cast their votes even though they believed that the economic sanctions should have been given more time to succeed.
The Associated Press article, which ran under the headline "Clinton Waffles on War Decision," quoted the Arkansas Governor as saying, "I agree with the arguments of the people in the minority on the resolution -- that we should give sanctions more time and maybe even explore a full-scale embargo."
Asked about that quote in today's news conference, Mr. Clinton said: "I don't know what the quote was, but let me tell you what I said. What I said was that even if I agreed with the arguments about sanctions, I still would have voted with the majority because Congress, in my judgment, shouldn't take a stand undermining the impact of the U.N. resolution, and I still believe that."
In retrospect, Mr. Clinton added, "It was clear the sanctions would not have worked."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Quayle's Words Show Plan for Attacking Clinton

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
It has been difficult in recent weeks to hear Vice President Dan Quayle's words above the static about his job security and his views on abortion, not to mention his spelling skills. But what has been obscured by the din is an early blueprint of the Bush-Quayle campaign's strategy, particularly its plans for attacking Gov. Bill Clinton.
The formula telegraphed by Mr. Quayle in his speeches, interviews and news conferences relies on the predictable labeling of Mr. Clinton and his Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore, as tax-and-spend liberals. But Mr. Quayle also has experimented with a more subtle subtext aimed at reinforcing doubts about Mr. Clinton's character. 
 For instance, he has used every opportunity to refer to Mr. Clinton and his campaign as "slick," a reference to "Slick Willie," the unflattering sobriquet given to Mr. Clinton by critics in Arkansas. At virtually every appearance in the last 10 days, Mr. Quayle has mentioned Mr. Clinton's "slick campaign," his "slick convention" and/or his "slick bus tour."
Although the Vice President has refused to speak directly about suggestions of Mr. Clinton's infidelity and his avoidance of military service, he has been quick to say that character will be an important issue in the campaign. This repetition seems designed to jab at a Clinton vulnerability and also to hint at the possibility of damaging revelations in the fall.
 
Assails Patriotism
 And Mr. Quayle has repeatedly criticized Mr. Clinton for saying at a rally in St. Louis last week that the United States has become "the mockery of the world." Mr. Clinton was referring to the effects of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship, but Clinton aides said that Mr. Quayle distorted the comment so as to assail the Democratic nominee's patriotism.
"I'm a little sick and tired of people running down America," Mr. Quayle said Monday in Cincinnati, calling on Mr. Clinton to apologize for the statement. "America's still the greatest country in the world."
The Vice President's delicate approach to the task of defining Mr. Clinton typifies the Republican dilemma in a year when the political mood is far different than in 1988.
Republican strategists recognize that it will be difficult to chip away at the current Democratic lead without attacking Mr. Clinton. But the Republicans are wary that the heavy-handedness of their 1988 campaign could well backfire this year; Mr. Clinton has conditioned an already surly electorate to be vigilant for low-blow tactics by repeatedly predicting an ugly campaign.
Bush-Quayle campaign officials deny that they are using subtle means to remind voters of Mr. Clinton's difficulties with marriage, marijuana and the military. But they said they viewed Mr. Clinton's handling of those issues during the primary season as a reflection of his integrity and honesty.
"The larger issue is that he's evasive and he's slick," said Mary Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director. "We've never said to the press that he's a philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger."
"The way you just did?" Ms. Matalin was asked.
"The way I just did," she conceded. "But that's the first time I've done that. There's nothing nefarious or subliminal going on."
 
Campaign's Guinea Pig
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle may well resort to tougher tactics after the Republican convention, particularly if they remain far behind in the polls. But for the time being, the Republicans are using more moderate methods, and it has been Mr. Quayle's job to road-test new themes.
"I think he thinks it's legitimate to raise questions but that it's too early for a frontal assault," said one Quayle associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Many of the lines of attack taken by Mr. Quayle -- whether his focus on family values, his argument that the Democrats are stealing Republican ideas or his assault on Mr. Clinton's trustworthiness -- eventually have found their way into Mr. Bush's playbook.
But Mr. Clinton and his advisers have been quick to point out what they regard as the inherent weaknesses in some of Mr. Quayle's debating points, starting with his argument that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are liberals in disguise.
"They came out of New York and said, 'We are these raging moderates,' Mr. Quayle said last week on the CNN television program "Larry King Live."
"That is a bunch of hooey," he insisted. "Al Gore's voting record is the same as Ted Kennedy's. Now, is Ted Kennedy a moderate? No. Bill Clinton as Governor raising taxes something like 128 different times. His record down there is not a record of moderation."
 
Tug-of-War Over Trust
 Mr. Quayle then raised the issue of trust by saying he was skeptical of Mr. Clinton's pledge to raise taxes only on the wealthy.
But Mr. Clinton said Tuesday in Chicago that Mr. Bush was himself vulnerable on the issue of trust, particularly where taxes are concerned.
"This is a guy who said 'Read my lips,' four years ago," Mr. Clinton said. "And he wants to be trusted?"
Mr. Quayle has also labored to blame the country's economic drift on the Democratic Congress. "We wouldn't have had this recession if the Congress had gone along with the President," he argued in Cincinnati on Monday. He also has labeled the 1990 tax increase as "the Democratic Congress's tax increase" and suggested that Mr. Bush agreed to it only because the President did not want a budget crisis in the middle of the Gulf war.
Mr. Bush first spoke of the possibility of increased taxes more than a month before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Mr. Quayle regularly implores his audiences to put an end to divided government by giving Mr. Bush a Republican-majority Congress. "When you think of change I want you to think of changing the Democratic Congress," he told supporters on the tarmac of the Lexington, Ky., airport last week.
Sometimes Mr. Quayle's characterization of the Clinton campaign as slick seems paradoxical. The Vice President inevitably levels the accusation during heavily scripted campaign events, like recent visits to housing construction sites, where advance men advised photographers how to get the best shot of Mr. Quayle hammering a nail.
Mr. Quayle has also made frequent use of what his aides refer to as "impromptus," surprise campaign stops in diners and coffee shops that are not spontaneous but are meant to look that way.
On Monday, Mr. Quayle led a large contingent of cameramen, reporters and Secret Service agents into a suburban Chicago bowling alley. As Mr. Quayle chatted with a pair of bowlers, his military aide used one hand to keep a firm grip on the aluminum suitcase containing the country's nuclear codes while using the other hand to bring Mr. Quayle his red and black bowling shoes.
This mixing of Executive Branch and working-class symbolism was a specialty of Mr. Bush in past campaigns. So far, Mr. Quayle has had the franchise mostly to himself. Despite the talk of dumping him, many Republicans see his speeches and appearances as the liveliest part of the Republican campaign so far.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles Riots, a Witness With Videotapes

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 27

 BODY:
Of the thousands of people who filled the streets in the Los Angeles riots last April, one resident of the area, Timothy Goldman, is finding himself in the role of official witness to the violence.
An unemployed 33-year-old former Air Force officer who likes to play with video cameras, Mr. Goldman lived within blocks of where the rioting began on April 29 and was able to tape the outbreak of looting, arson and beatings. Among other things he captured on tape was the beating of a truck driver, Reginald Denny, who was pulled from his vehicle in the attack at an intersection. 
 Mr. Goldman, with the help of his brother and a friend, used three cameras to film nearly two hours of violence on that first day. Then, having viewed the tapes a couple of times, he said he almost erased them, thinking no one else would be interested.
But the television networks and Government prosecutors were, and the tapes are now among the most valuable of 329 tapes that are being studied by a joint Federal, state and local prosecuting group preparing riot-related charges.
 
Crucial to Prosecutions
 Because of his videotapes and his familiarity with the neighborhood and its residents, Mr. Goldman said in a recent interview, prosecutors are using him as a sort of universal witness, asking him to identify people shown not only on his own videotapes but on those of others.
"After every five or 10 seconds they stop the tape and ask me to identify someone," he said. "The attorney told me they might try to use me as a witness to what was going on and have me try to finger people."
Mr. Goldman said he had been subpoenaed to testify for the first time in public on Friday at a pretrial hearing for three men accused of participating in the beating of Mr. Denny, who remains under medical care with serious head injuries.
The three men, Damian Williams, 19 years old, Henry Watson, 27, and Antoine Miller, 20, are charged with attempted murder, torture, aggravated mayhem and robbery. They have also been charged with assault in the beating of 12 other people in seven vehicles at the same intersection. They are being held on bail ranging from $500,000 to $580,000. If convicted, they would face possible life sentences.
A fourth man who was arrested with them, Gary Williams, 33, will be tried separately on a charge of robbery. Mr. Williams is accused of picking Mr. Denny's pocket while he was lying in street.
 
Victims Also Seek His Help
 Mr. Goldman said some victims of the violence have asked him to testify in their civil suits against the city. His role as a witness to the riot could last many more months.
Mr. Goldman said this role has placed him in danger from the gang members who are his neighbors, many of whom are suspected of taking part in the violence or the looting. Mr. Goldman, who was interviewed at a friend's house, said he is in hiding with his 6-year-old.
"We've had some threats," Mr. Goldman said. "There are a lot of people out there that blame me for a lot of the arrests.
"The Feds have contacted me in the past about joining a witness protection program, but I have taken my own measures to secure myself. No one in my family knows where I live. I communicate through a mobile phone or from a phone booth."
Federal officials would not discuss Mr. Goldman or comment on any grand jury proceedings. But an F.B.I. spokesman said videotapes and photographs by amateurs and news organizations are critical to the riot investigation.
 
Videos Transform Cases
 Indeed, law-enforcement investigations in general have been transformed by the rapid spread of amateur videotapes like the famous tape of the police beating of Rodney G. King in March 1991 that set the stage for the rioting, said John Hoos, an F.B.I spokesman. The attacks at the intersection in South-Central Los Angeles occurred in the first hours after a jury acquitted four white police officers of assault and related charges in the beating of Mr. King, who is black.
"There has never been anything like this," Mr. Hoos said. "The new technology has created a wealth of vital information that is revolutionizing our ability to do investigations like this."
He said that apart from Mr. Goldman's tape, residents have continued to come forward with videotapes and photographs that are helping the task force of about 100 investigators to identify suspects and victims.
But while amateurs have offered their tapes for inspection, most news organizations have resisted subpoenas to turn over any photographs or videotapes that have not been used in broadcasts or published.
Mr. Goldman had also tried to resist giving them up, but his effort failed because there is no law that gives him a right to do so. As a private citizen, Mr. Goldman is not covered by state statutes, called shield laws, that protect the notes or tapes of professional journalists.
 
Blurring of Lines
 "Very broadly, the question is going to be, 'Is the person asserting protection of the shield law a journalist or just a member of the public?' " said Rex Heinke, a lawyer specializing in the First Amendment. "Generally speaking, if I pick up a videocamera and just walk out the front door and decide to take shots and then assert the shield law, it's unlikely I'll be successful."
But he also said the spread of videocameras among the public would eventually test this definition of journalism and the limits of shield laws. "As the technology has evolved so that the average person can afford videocameras, the question as to where you draw the line has become blurred," Mr. Heinke said.
Mr. Goldman appears to have been the quintessential amateur.
"The camera is like a toy to me," he said, comparing it to a police scanner on which, as a former Air Force man, he liked to listen to air traffic transmissions.
He spoke of his videotaping of the riot violence as the last part of a daylong session. "We were downtown all that day filming girls, filming cars, going to bus stops, just recording," Mr. Goldman said.
In the afternoon he said that he was preparing to go to baseball practice when he heard a distress call on his police scanner and that he then went to the street corner near his house, where he saw the first violence of the riot.
"I stood on top of a car filming traffic," he said. "As people headed toward the intersection it was pretty weird to see them making U-turns."
 
Amateur Agent Helps Out
 He said he also saw people being dragged from their vehicles at the intersection and beaten, and he filmed that, too.
When he went out the next day, Mr. Goldman said, he met Gregory Sandoval, a journalism student at the University of California, while taping a standoff between a group of young men and police officers over a safe that had fallen from the back of a truck. He said the two struck up a conversation and that he told Mr. Sandoval he had videotaped some of the violence. He said Mr. Sandoval offered to act as his agent, and he accepted.
In the last three months, Mr. Goldman said, Mr. Sandoval has helped him to earn tens of thousands of dollars by selling broadcast rights, but not the tapes, to the networks and to foreign news organizations.
Mr. Sandoval said that as a first-time agent he did not initially get the best deals for Mr. Goldman's tapes, but that in later arrangements the two had made tens of thousands of dollars by, in effect, renting the tapes out for limited periods to the networks and to overseas news outlets.
In contrast, George Holliday, the plumbing salesman who videotaped the police beating of Mr. King, sold his videotape outright to a local television station. Although it has become one of the most widely viewed home videos in history, he earned only $500 for it.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:
When the genteel town-house restaurant called March opened in 1990, it defied the conventional wisdom about what recession-pinched diners wanted. Just when chefs at most establishments were discarding rack of veal for roast chicken, stripping tablecloths in favor of butcher paper and touting Beaujolais, March was laying on the truffles and offering every creature comfort.
March's success can be attributed largely to its partners, Wayne Nish, the executive chef, and Joseph Scalice, who oversees an ace dining-room team. Mr. Nish made his mark at La Colombe d'Or, and until last month he was a consulting chef at the Supper Club on West 47th Street in midtown Manhattan. 
 March's three polished dining areas feature 12-foot ceilings, teak floors and wainscoting, fabric-covered banquettes, handsome antique furniture, dried flowers and elegantly appointed tables. A back porch is enclosed in glass and looks over a small garden.
Mr. Nish's eclectic East-West cooking style, which has been executed ably by March's full-time chef, Marcey Bassoff, offers many surprises. One of the most compelling is a little giveaway appetizer of Basmati rice cakes holding steamed shrimp and pickled vegetables. I could have eaten a plate of those and called it a night. Another enticing teaser -- this one is not a gift -- is a beggar's purse holding lobster meat and black-truffle mayonnaise.
Those remarkably robust out-of-season truffles return to energize a cold salad of crab meat and sweet corn. Another invigorating starter is intense clear tomato soup holding sliced scallops, scallions and thin noodles. One of the more intriguing dishes is called napoleon of smoked trout with artichokes and ricotta cheese. Actually, it tastes better than it sounds, for the translucent phyllo sheets contribute a delightful textural contrast to the firm artichoke hearts, the enriching ricotta and the delicate smoked trout.
August may not be the ideal time for lusty French specialties like confit of rabbit, yet the version here -- formed into rolls with foie gras and spinach, then set over white beans -- is so good that you should just ask the staff to crank up the air-conditioner and go for it. A pleasing lighter option is the Provencal vegetable tart, aromatic of tarragon and chervil, holding rare-seared tuna.
Wine aficionados can have great fun foraging through the unconventional French and American selection here. It's no bargain bin, although some good buys are scattered throughout. It is refreshing, though, to see so many fine smaller producers represented, especially from the Rhone, Alsace, Bordeaux and Burgundy. Among whites to look for at the lower end of the price scale are the 1990 Chateau St. Jean fume blanc, La Petite Etoile, ($25) from California and, from France, the 1989 cassis blanc from C. Lefevre, Domaine du Bagnol ($29). In reds there is an unusual petite-sirah from Field Stone in Sonoma ($28), and from Burgundy a 1988 Monthelie from H. Laroche ($25).
While main courses at March carry culinary accents from all over, my favorite dish is probably the least exotic: a well-aged sirloin garnished with deep-fried shallot rings and enhanced with an intensely flavorful stock sauce and mashed potatoes loaded with garlic. Thick, firm, well-browned sweetbreads are compelling with a relatively light morel sauce, and rack of lamb with an herb crust is deftly turned out. One dish that left diners at my table politely silent was a roast chicken set in a puddle of harsh and puckering kaffir lime sauce.
A much better combination is pink-cooked salmon rubbed with a melange of Middle Eastern spices, especially cumin and coriander, with asparagus, mushrooms and string beans. Those who like the confit of rabbit appetizer will applaud the highly seasoned duck confit paired with rare-grilled duck breast and assorted chutneys.
Desserts are even more eclectic than main courses. Decent chocolate cake hardly needs the pistachio halvah as an escort. Coriander seed adds a nice, sharp edge to grapefruit sorbet. Crisp, thin pancakes form a stage for vanilla ice cream, mango and summer berries, and sweet vanilla custard is enriched with crumbled candied almonds.
It is heartening to see that March has stuck to its guns and prevailed through tough times. This beguiling spot, as patrician as its Sutton Place neighborhood, may not be for everyone, but for sheer comfort and scintillating food, it's worth keeping in mind.

Sculpture, Sculpture Everywhere

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
JUST as this summer brings disappointment to Mets and Yankees fans, it brings promise to fans of outdoor sculpture. The outdoor sculpture season in New York City is all over the place, geographically and figuratively speaking. Sculptures are to be found as far afield as the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island. Not only are they on view at the scrubby patch of riverfront that is the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, but they also appear unexpectedly a few blocks away in the parking lot of the P.S. 1 Museum. There are sculptures in the courtyards of colleges in Brooklyn and Queens, and at squares and street corners all across lower Manhattan. You can literally trip over them in Tom Otterness's installation at the new Hudson River Park, or mistake one of them for a No Parking sign on Wall Street.
Outdoor sculpture this summer is also across the map in terms of its interests. In this sense, it is an inevitable extension of the larger art scene. If a preponderance of sculptures put forward political and social agendas, and if many of them continue to use humble materials that are themselves an expression of a certain political point of view, there are a few works that unapologetically extend the legacy of monumental sculpture. 
 One of the most curious aspects of this season is the alliance, clearly for reasons of mutual promotion, of four organizations -- the Bronx Council on the Arts, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Snug Harbor and Socrates -- as part of an event called "1992 The Americas?" The presentations by these four groups at Woodlawn, in downtown Manhattan, at Socrates and at Snug Harbor could hardly be less related to one another.
The most provocative outdoor sculptures are not really even a part of the season, namely the three sculptures by John Ahearn that stand temporarily in the parking lot of P.S. 1, for lack of a better home. Their removal last year from the South Bronx site for which they were intended, because of community protests, was the biggest local public art story since the removal a few years ago of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc" from Foley Square, in lower Manhattan. Especially cordoned off behind the parking-lot fence, Mr. Ahearn's painstakingly realistic portraits of three South Bronx residents seem poignant symbols of the tremendous pitfalls of making public sculpture nowadays.
This outdoor sculpture season, like others, is inevitably all over the lot in terms of quality. Among the highlights are the installation by Mr. Otterness at Hudson River Park, for its combination of outward playfulness and inward sinisterness; a group of organically shaped objects made of materials like steel, rubber and metal by Nancy Cohen in Thomas Paine Park in lower Manhattan, and "Border Crossing" by Luis Jimenez at Snug Harbor, which in the depiction of a Mexican man carrying a woman on his shoulders recalls the heroic vein of 1930's Works Progress Administration art.
Tom Finkelpearl has created a clever twist on the notion of the family mausoleum with his entry in the show at Woodlawn Cemetery. Andrew Dunnill's knotted steel construction is one of the best sculptures in an eclectic show at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University. And Mary Ann Unger's "Ode to Tatlin," at Queens College, adds to an otherwise drab and incoherent stretch of campus a monument at once airy and grand.
 
'A Community of Shelter'
 Nancy Cohen
 Thomas Paine Park
 Intersection of Centre, Lafayette, Pearl and Worth Streets
 Lower Manhattan
 Through Nov. 30
Nancy Cohen has managed with this installation to breathe new life into a small and forlorn park, which has lately tended to serve as a haven for cardboard homeless shelters. On the park's modest tree-shaded lawn, she has arranged several sculptures in shapes that resemble shells, pods, cocoons and other natural forms of shelter that sympathetically and obliquely refer to the homeless and their ingenuity in creating makeshift places to sleep. There is also one rectangular sculpture that explicitly evokes their cardboard shelters.
Each of the "shelters" involves a steel armature, and some of them also use red clay, rope or rubber tubing. The works are tied to the trees, which become like their protectors or guardians. Ms. Cohen's evocative shapes are varied in texture and character, and can bring to mind the abstractions of Martin Puryear or Richard Deacon. They underscore in their materials and shapes the fact that the park is both a natural and an urban place. Most important, her installation turns the park into something passers-by are now drawn to.
 
Six Sculptors
 Long Island University
 Brooklyn Campus
 DeKalb and Flatbush Avenues
 Fort Greene
 Through October
This show is an agglomeration of six young artists of very different inclinations: Robert Chambers, Henry Klimowicz, Katarina Isaksson, Simon Lee, Robin Hill and Mr. Dunnill. Most of them have not succeeded at taking dramatic hold of the space offered to them, but two in particular leave a strong impression. Mr. Dunnill is an English sculptor who goes against the strain of contemporary English sculpture represented by artists like Richard Deacon and Tony Cragg. His "Knuckle" sits on the ground in the center of the campus plaza. It is a dense cluster of what look like mechanical parts, yet it can also bring to mind an abstract figure, huddled on its side, its knees drawn up as if in pain. Part of the intrigue in the sculpture is that it seems so out of place, in a sense homeless, in the very middle of the plaza.
Ms. Hill's four Fiberglas and resin objects, hung on ropes from a nearby overpass, recall rather too vividly the art of Eva Hesse, yet they, too, have a certain fascination. The objects look like cocoons or body parts or giant beehives, and these evocations of natural forms, swaying in the wind, make a striking juxtaposition with the stark modernist buildings around them.
 
'Silhouettes of the Southwest'
 Snug Harbor Cultural Center
 1000 Richmond Terrace
 Livingston, S.I.
 Through Oct. 31
This show is incoherent. And yet it includes works that on their own terms are compelling. It features seven artists from Texas and New Mexico. The materials vary widely and the tone swerves from witty to deadly sober. Bob Wade's giant sombrero gateway is the most easygoing work. Jesse Lott's rendition of a black man who was tarred, feathered and burned by steel workers in Pennsylvania in 1911 is the most sensationalistic.
Tim Glover satirically suggests a classic road sign with his "USA Monument," the letters U, S and A formed with rusted steel tubing and capped with a giant knife and fork that distantly recall the upright pitchfork in Grant Wood's "American Gothic." James Drake's "Corazon de Oro" is a gold-plated car engine hung like a carcass from a metal rack, with what are supposed to be golden pools of oil beneath it. The work, violent in spirit, simple in conception and evocative in contrast with its natural surroundings, suggests the environmental damage caused by oil drilling and the American obsession with the automobile.
Paul Kittleson, in the spirit of Pepon Osorio but with more emphasis on handiwork, uses cheap, found materials, in this case soda and beer cans and parts of dolls, to create a witty variation on a gaudy Mexican altarpiece, called "Recycled Virgin/ Virgin of Guadalupe." In a very different mode, Rick Lowe has created a plainspoken hut -- half chapel, half schoolroom -- that pays homage to the roles of religion and education in black society.
And Mr. Jimenez's "Border Crossing," set on a pedestal (and last seen in the Whitney Biennial), invites comparison with traditional sculptures of heroic figures, giving to the labors of the man carrying an older woman on his back something of the mythic status of Aeneas carrying his father, Anchises, out of the burning city of Troy, from which he set off to establish a new nation in Rome.
 
Socrates Sculpture Park
 Broadway at Vernon Boulevard
 Long Island City, Queens
With only a temporary occupancy permit for its site on the East River, Socrates Sculpture Park maintains an uncertain but crucial place in the city's cultural life. There is no show per se, which is a disappointment. But there are a few new sculptures by artists displaying their work for the first time in New York. "Big Bang," by Bruce Johnson, an American artist, is a towering work made of redwood and copper that resembles a tree and that also relates, in its angular design, to the jaunty rhythms of Manhattan's skyline, across the river. On a recent afternoon, it was draped with children who had transformed it into a tree house. "The Strength of an Idea" marks the strong debut of a Catalan artist, Elisa Arimany. A kinship with Susana Solano, her compatriot, is discernible. This piece looks like a collapsing house of cards made of huge steel sheets. It is about balance and motion and it has a strong sense of monumentality. "Oh, Sophocles," by Guy Scohy, a Belgian artist, is also striking for the lively undulations of its bent steel shapes and the free-form abstract design at its top, like a kind of fancy ribbon that caps this playful package.
 
'Houses of Spirit/ Memories of Ancestors'
 Woodlawn Cemetery
 Jerome and Bainbridge Avenues
 The Bronx
 Through Nov. 1
Eight artists have contributed to this largely lame show, whose most interesting aspect is the bucolic, and rather peculiar, setting of the cemetery. Several of the works are variations on memorials. Kathleen McCarthy has created salt tombstones for seven distinguished women, the salt wearing away over time like the memory of these women's accomplishments. It's obvious and poorly realized. Laura Fields and John Sprague have created a banal monument to women's rights, bearing 1992 as the date of death because of the Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing states to limit abortion rights.
Subtler and more affecting is Jann Rosen-Queralt's "Reservoirs and Windows," with its flower-and-bird-seed design in the pattern of a Persian carpet, and its bookcase in place of a headstone; Colin Chase's wood sculpture called "Houses of Many Stories: Prayer Wheel," and Mr. Finkelpearl's "Family Tree." A kind of mausoleum with a tree inside it, Mr. Finkelpearl's work bears the names, birth dates, religions and marriage dates of his parents and in-laws. The family is almost a microcosm of the world: Protestant, Jewish, Islamic and Confucian. At the top are the names of the artist and his wife, and crowning the piece is the birth date of their child. If the earth bears the dead, the upper reaches of this "family tree" represent the young. It's a poetic piece.
 
Mary Ann Unger
 Aaron Copland School of Music
 Queens College
 65-30 Kissena Boulevard
 Flushing
Mary Ann Unger's "Ode to Tatlin" is a permanent addition to the courtyard in front of the Aaron Copland School of Music. The sculpture is like a gateway to the school in the shape of an ellipse sliced in two, with the entrance directly through the middle. The sculpture takes as its inspiration Tatlin's famous "Monument to the Third International," but its slatted sides also suggest staves of music and the supports of a roller coaster whose swooping path is described by the ellipse. The sculpture is least persuasive up close, where the sherbet colors of the painted slats are cloying, and the geometries of the design are hardest to take in whole. From a little distance, however, its combination of playfulness and monumentality, and its distinction as a lively counterpoint to the quotidian surroundings, become clearer.
 
John Ahearn and Art Attack
 P.S. 1 Museum
 46-01 21st Street
Long Island City, Queens
Temporarily housed in the parking lot are Mr. Ahearn's sculptures and the work of a New York artists' collaborative called Art Attack. Art Attack's piece, originally conceived for a show in France and without its sound component, consists of a phalanx of horrific machines. Each includes carcass racks, hooks and all, joined to form a triangle and attached to a hydraulic press that seems ready to thrust the hooks forward. Violent, threatening, the work at the same time has a crisp geometry and connection with industrial materials that links it with Minimalism.
Mr. Ahearn's trio of painted bronze sculptures, made from plaster casts, stand nearby, creating a very different impression. "Corey" depicts a large shirtless black man, his foot resting on a boom box, a basketball under his arm. "Raymond and Toby" is a sculpture of a hooded man, either black or Hispanic, kneeling beside his pit bull. "Daleesha" depicts a black girl on roller skates wearing a Batman T-shirt. The works were intended to rest on pedestals outside the 44th Precinct station house in the South Bronx. They represent people from the neighborhood. Mr. Ahearn also lives in the South Bronx, near the station house.
As soon as the works were unveiled in September, both the police and neighborhood residents raised a storm of protest. The works were criticized for reinforcing racist stereotypes. Raymond was widely thought to look like a drug dealer. There was anger that the city had spent money for what was considered a demeaning work of art instead of on more urgent affairs. Mr. Ahearn, stunned by the attacks on works that were intended to pay homage to his neighbors, agreed that they should be removed.
Perhaps there was resistance to the idea of Mr. Ahearn, a white artist, representing his black and Hispanic neighbors. Certainly Mr. Ahearn miscalculated by not creating new works but instead recycling these pieces, which he had shown previously in the very different environment of an art gallery. In the midst of the station house and the economic devastation of the neighborhood, they clearly suggested that the artist did not believe there were more suitable role models in the community. Mr. Ahearn's works in general are striking for being at once completely literal and yet somehow ambiguous in their meaning. There is nothing about "Raymond" that clinches his identity as a drug dealer; it must be imputed to him. "Corey"looks affable enough, and "Daleesha," while not as simply joyous as other sculptures of children by Mr. Ahearn, is a lively youngster at play. But public sculpture is about context, and ambiguity, often a valuable attribute in art, opens the door to disaster. The debacle involving Mr. Ahearn's sculptures makes that clear.
 
George Segal
 Christopher Park
 Christopher Street and Seventh Avenue South
 Greenwich Village
Like the works by Mr. Ahearn, George Segal's "Gay Liberation" demonstrates the traumas of creating public sculpture, particularly when the sculptures have as their subject a minority group. Twelve years ago, plans were announced for the installation of the work, which consists of four life-size bronze figures painted white -- two women seated on a bench, their hands lightly touching, and two men standing nearby -- to be installed in this park across from the former location of the Stonewall Bar, where riots in 1969 spurred the gay rights movement. Protests, from homosexuals and others, that the work would attract vandals, that it was exclusionary in depicting only whites and that the selection of the artist did not involve an open competition, helped to delay its installation. When the work was exhibited at Stanford University in 1984, it was attacked by an anti-homosexual vandal. Not until last month was it finally unveiled in Christopher Park.
The appearance of the work seemed almost incidental to the whole affair. The fundamental issues were political: who is allowed to speak for a minority community? To what extent must the work please every element of the community? That a protester attacked "Gay Liberation" clearly had more to do with what it represented than with what it looked like. Mr. Segal's sculpture, respectful as Mr. Ahearn's work aimed to be, is in fact not stimulating or provocative or even explicit in its description of the relationships among the figures. As a memorial to the riots, it's deadeningly somber. Still, one feels a little sympathy for it. If public art must be art by public consensus in this divisive political climate, the work is virtually guaranteed to be without complexity and without much fascination.
 
'Repohistory'
 The Lower Manhattan Sign Project
 36 sites throughout lower Manhattan
 Through Jan. 1
Several dozen artists, historians, writers and others got together to create the 36 works that make up "Repohistory." Resembling No Parking signs, they are attached to lampposts around lower Manhattan, each sign bearing a text, and several questions (for example, "Is this part of your history?" "Is history progress or power?") related to the site. At City Hall Park is a sign about the civil rights and civil defense protests that took place there 30 or more years ago. Near the corner of Broadway and Liberty Street, where food stalls are gathered to serve office workers on their lunch breaks, a sign recounts the days when "lady typewriters," as female workers were apparently called in the 1890's, took 20-minute lunch breaks while men gathered in the nearby saloons from which women were banned. The texts are often preachy and the questions condescending. But the signs provide plenty of interesting information about people and movements that do not typically have a place in the standard histories of New York.
 
Tom Otterness
 Hudson River Park
 Battery Park City
 Lower Manhattan
Tom Otterness, in one of his best works, has created a universe of animals and Disneylike characters who have virtually taken over a stretch of this handsome new park and turned it into their own weird playland. The footprints of giants and the remains of a giant's head are lodged in the concrete. A dog is chained to a water fountain; a cat has been bound and gagged and is carried aloft by munchkins. The chess tables are overrun with creatures playing their own matches. Mr. Otterness's work is deceptively cheerful. An undercurrent of conflict and violence is not so far beneath the surface, and it helps to make this elaborate permanent installation appealing to both children and adults.

Recommended for all ages
Tomorrow
The New York City Riding Academy of Randalls Island was started in 1982 by George E. Blair. His rodeo tomorrow will not just entertain visitors but it will feed them as well.
The rodeo is a tribute to black cowboys and cowgirls who migrated to the West after Reconstruction, and to American Indians and Mexicans who also contributed to the development of the West. There will be rodeo stunts on horses performed by students from the academy; supervised horseback riding in a ring; American Indian and black drummers; an American Indian spiritualist who will perform ceremonies, and a Western barbecue. 
 Along with the rodeo, riding, music and chow, scenes from a play, "Mitote," are to be performed. The play, written by Maisha Baton, a black historian from New Mexico, is based on people who lived in the New Mexico region at different times. It depicts three black women, one of whom, Miss Kate, was based on the only black woman said to have served in a calvary unit in the United States Army, around 1900. Like her fellow soldiers, she fought the Indians. It wasn't until she was injured that the Army discovered that she was a woman. She was discharged.
Another character, Miss Ruth, was the supposed lover of Esteban, a Spanish Moor who traveled with the explorer Cortes, as told in Mexican folklore.
The last excerpt is about the Exodusers, a group of former slaves who moved to Texas, California, Arkansas and other points West to start communities, some of which survive today. Miss Yolanda is the third character in the play, an Exoduser who moved to New Mexico.
The M35 bus, which stops at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, goes to Randalls Island Park. If you're driving, take the Triborough Bridge to Randalls Island, and follow the signs for Downing Stadium. Parking is free. Events are from noon to 3 P.M. Tickets, which include the barbecue and horseback riding, are $10 and $5 for children 4 and up.

Tomorrow and Sunday
Twenty-eight teen-agers from New York City and Britain are halfway through a summer theater program. This weekend, they are going to perform "A Midsummer Night's Dream." The program, called Bayfest, for British-American Youth Festival Theater, is built around an exchange of students from the Clwyd Youth Theater of North Wales and mostly inner-city students from New York.
For two years, Bayfest, founded and directed by Robert Shampain, an American director and actor, has been auditioning students from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. Those who are accepted attend summer workshops on subjects including character study, movement and stage combat. As part of the exchange, students from the Welsh company live with Americans and vice versa. After this weekend's performance, the students are to go to Clwyd to perform and then head to Bangor, near the Irish Sea, to study with members of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. The Bayfest faculty members receive no salaries; the program is financed primarily with private contributions from such organizations as the South Bronx Job Corps and New York University.
The troupe promises that its rendition of the Shakespeare comedy will be raucous and easy to understand. Puck, that "shrewd and knavish sprite," will be played by two actors in separate performances. One actor is tall and white; the other is short and black. The play is free, but reservations are required for the Saturday evening show, at 7:30 at New York University. The Central Park performances will be at 2:30 P.M. tomorrow and on Sunday.

Pools close Sept. 8;
recreation center is open all year
The 1898 landmark Beaux-Arts Hamilton Fish Pool and Recreation Center has reopened after a four-year renovation. It now has an Olympic-size pool, a shallower training pool for younger children, two padded playgrounds, basketball and handball courts, a spray fountain for toddlers and the pool-timid and picnic tables sequestered under sturdy trees.
 The second part of a free learn-to-swim program for children ages 3 and up, starting Aug. 3 and running through Aug. 30, will begin at all city pools. Registration for the morning weekday classes will be held today at the individual pools. The Hamilton Fish center is open 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. daily. (The pool is open from noon to 6:45 P.M.; there is also lap-swimming from 7 to 8:30 A.M. and 7 to 8:30 P.M.) Swimmers wear their bathing suits to the pool (there is no place to change); there are guards in the brand-new restrooms, keeping things orderly.

HEADLINE: Older Americans, Dangling

 BODY:
When it came up for a four-year renewal last fall, the Older Americans Act was a shoo-in. And why not? Practically every clause in the bill has proved to be a genuine success since it was first passed in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society program.
Almost half the act's $1.4 billion budget goes to meals for the elderly. Other money helps support senior centers and feeds senior volunteers in primary and secondary schools. The act also fights abuse of older people and helps keep millions of the elderly unemployed afloat by paying them modest wages to perform community service. 
 Though largely unheralded, all these programs have quietly managed to keep millions of older Americans in their communities and out of institutions. Yet nine months after its passage by both houses, the bill renewing the act has still not gone to a conference committee, the victim of one of Congress's deadliest arrows: the crippling amendment.
Last November, after everything seemed settled, Arizona's Republican Senator, John McCain, hooked an amendment onto the act that would allow Social Security recipients to get full benefits regardless of their earnings; benefits are currently reduced if an individual earns more than $10,200. The House promptly countered by amending its version to raise the current earning cap to $20,000.
The two versions have never gone to conference largely because Senator McCain won't negotiate. Many senior citizen groups have only themselves to blame for the impasse. Throughout 1991 they lobbied for both the act and at least some change in the current Social Security earning cap. With the act hung up, some funds are still coming out of Washington. But local agencies across the country report a sharp drop in meals they're able to serve.
Senator McCain, who faces a tough re-election fight, obviously hopes his dogged stand on Social Security will corral Arizona's large senior vote in November. But many seniors now say that eliminating the Social Security earning cap entirely is unwise and unfundable. By refusing to budge, Senator McCain is badly bruising the very constituency he claims to champion.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Should Bush Run?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Can he win? Should he run? Suddenly those questions about George Bush are part of the conversation of American politicians and journalists.
I think the answer to the first question is yes, and to the second, no. That is a paradox, but based on the political and personal realities that envelop Mr. Bush and the 1992 campaign. 
 For months Americans asked those questions about two other contenders. It took Bill Clinton time but he answered them -- by understanding that the change the country sought was a President who would be for a bouquet of goals and people, not always wearing the same droopy ideological flower in his buttonhole.
Ross Perot answered by showing he was a master of the craven art of dynamite-stick fishing. He threw in the explosives, stunned millions of suckers, scooped them up, then dumped the basket and left them gasping on the beach while he went off for other sport, did our brave adventurer, leaving the fish with the bill.
And all that print and TV smarm about the legacy of the "Perot" economic plan -- he never created or adopted it. It should be called the John White Plan, after the employee who crafted it, or the Perot Plan Never.
But yes, Mr. Bush can win. He clings to the memory of Harry Truman as if he himself were a good old Missouri Democrat, not a good old Connecticut Republican. Saddam Hussein can elect Mr. Bush by throwing a few Scuds at the Saudis or Israelis.
Or Mr. Bush can pull himself together, act and talk like a live President, or even a live human being, as when he told hecklers to shut up -- the high point of his campaign so far -- or start accepting blame instead of keeping on pouring it out into dusty whine glasses, stop just getting mad at Saddam and get even by backing the Iraqi resistance movement, or let Barbara Bush say she is in favor of choice, since it is hard to imagine she is not, or come up with an economic plan that is either. Then he can adapt Hillary Clinton's fine line -- this is who I am, if you like me, vote for me, if not, not.
I think there is something in most Americans except the cynical emotion-dead who wish he would do all or most of the above, or something to make a fight of it. One President destroyed himself because of his own personality; to see another do the same brings no pleasure.
The straight-out vote-counting reasons for considering withdrawal stare at him. Few Democrats believe he will suddenly become a doer, thinker, orator and fighter. As they become more committed to Governor Clinton, it will become harder for Mr. Bush to convince them. No Democrats, no Bush re-election.
Meanwhile more Republicans see him as a loser, and say so. The longer their fear lives, the more likely it fulfills itself.
William Bennett, the conservative Republican who served Mr. Bush as drug czar, asked two devastating questions about the President, on the David Brinkley program.
Does Mr. Bush really want the job? If so, what does he plan to do with it?
The strongest reason for Mr. Bush not to run, and the hardest to face, is that he has not made the most of his chances; that is the least Presidents get elected to do.
Abroad, he fought a war, threw away victory, guaranteeing more war -- already being fought by the Iraqi resistance. He misjudged what was going on in the Soviet Union, the Baltics, the Mideast, China, Haiti.
At home, his first term has sunk the country in depression -- depression of the soul -- not sure which will come first, the factory closing slip or the next urban riot.
That's enough.
Perhaps Mr. Bush will find it in himself to recover the admiration of his countrymen. He can do that by saying he had his opportunity, did what he could, but that all told, it would be better to give a fresh Republican team the chance to lead.
Any new Republican ticket would have one tough race, with so little time left. But it would be interesting to find out how many Republican delegates, guaranteed anonymity, think Bush-Quayle has a better chance than a ticket of Jack Kemp and, say, Elizabeth Dole or Jeane Kirkpatrick.
A hard thing for Mr. Bush to do -- but in truth others have faced their mirrors and decided to walk away without being fired and with respect from their peers, and themselves.

HEADLINE: Perot's Plan: Too Much Pain, Too Little Gain

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith, former executive director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, teaches economics at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Inside-the-Beltway Democrats are rushing to embrace Ross Perot's five-year plan to end the budget deficit. They include Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, and Leon Panetta, the House Budget Committee chairman.
U.S. News & World Report said this week that most economists probably agreed with the former candidate's tough approach to a balanced budget. Not me. The plan is bold but imprudent. It mixes excellent ideas with others that are dubious, even harmful. It attempts too much, too soon. In a rush to turn today's $350 billion deficit into an $8 billion surplus, it risks wrecking the economy. 
 On the plus side, the plan calls for $40 billion of needed public investment in highways and telecommunications systems and for equivalent cuts in needless defense spending. The 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax is a serious proposal, as is the call for higher taxes on Social Security. So is the proposal to raise the top income tax bracket to 33 percent. An incremental investment tax credit has respected backers, as well as opponents.
Other details are less appealing. The unspecified 10 percent across-the-board reduction in spending is classic smoke-and-mirrors budgeting. In the absence of a program for reforming health care, so is the $83 billion cut in Medicare. And the plan's huge cuts in existing mass-transit subsidies are hard to reconcile with big spending on new infrastructure.
The plan provides tax relief to one group: rich people who sell their stocks. There is no reputable economic case for this measure. Recent studies suggest that about half the capital gains from such sales are consumed, not reinvested; this break, even restricted to long-term stock holdings, as the plan proposes, is a tax preference for high living. In an agenda urging sacrifice, this is misplaced.
The critical issue is not whether individual details of the program are good or bad but how the program as a whole would affect the economy.
The authors are prepared to inflict a lot of pain to balance the budget in five years. But they do not say, perhaps because they do not know, why we need to gamble the economy on this arbitrary goal.
The plan, while admitting that economic growth would slow down and that unemployment would rise throughout the 1990's, asserts that growth in investment and productivity can be sustained nevertheless. This is very unlikely. If economic growth stagnates, profits and investment and productivity will stagnate as well. Growth is not the whole solution to the deficit, but it is necessary, and is the missing ingredient here. Without it, no amount of public saving can create private investment or growth in productivity.
Japan's economy did not catch up with ours over 40 years by growing more slowly than ours. Yet the plan proposes a decade of stagnation as a way to catch up with Japan!
The plan appears to rely on an easier Federal Reserve monetary policy to sustain expansion. But Alan Greenspan's failure to generate a recovery this year demonstrates the Fed's limits. Under the Perot plan's drastic reductions in the deficit, economic growth probably would be even slower than the proposal predicts.
If that happened, the plan would fail to achieve a balanced budget. Joblessness would rise, driving up spending for unemployment and welfare. By my calculation, the gross domestic product in 1998 could fall as much as $1 trillion below the Congressional Budget Office's projections. Tax revenues would fall proportionately, by nearly $200 billion. In the end, the deficit would be scarcely smaller than if no plan were tried.
Defenders of the program like to speak of "pain," "guts" and "courage." This is not a sensible way to talk when the basic issue is technical and the lives at stake are other people's. Ross Perot knows better. On July 9, he said: "You can't destroy the economy trying to save it. You don't want to disrupt millions of people trying to save it." On July 16, he urged a 12-year program. Too bad his staff ignored this common sense.
All told, this is Wall Street budget-balancing -- the brainchild of orthodoxy. Those looking for an economics of hope will have to go elsewhere.

HEADLINE: U.S. SAYS AIRLIFTS FAIL SOMALI NEEDY

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 30

 BODY:
United States disaster experts who made a one-day visit to Mogadishu, Somalia, said today that emergency airlifts proposed by the United Nations would not solve the problem of how to get food to tens of thousands of starving people.
The director of the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, James R. Kunder, said after the visit to Mogadishu on Wednesday that the major barrier to helping the hungry was the continuing fighting between rival clans in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. 
 A greater effort had to be made, he said, to win agreement between the warring factions in Mogadishu to allow food already in the country to get to the people in need. Mr. Kunder's remarks were made at a news conference in Nairobi, Kenya, and made available in London by news agencies.
In telephone interviews, members of Mr. Kunder's team said that they had concluded that the fighting by heavily armed members of rival clans in Mogadishu was mostly over food and that hasty airlifts would only increase the level of fighting while the starving would still not get the food.
 
Tens of Thousands Dead
 Earlier this week, the United Nations Security Council approved an emergency airlift of food to Somalia, a mostly desert country of 4.5 million to 6 million people on the Horn of Africa. Tens of thousands of Somalis have died from the combined effects of war and drought in the last few months.
A special task force on Somalia was formed at the State Department this week under the leadership of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, officials said. The task force would decide what measures to take in Somalia after hearing from Mr. Kunder on his return to Washington on Friday, the officials said.
Because of the neglect of Somalia so far, officials said there would be a temptation to mount airlifts as a way of appearing to be doing something even though they may not achieve much.
Mr. Kunder, the most senior United States official to visit Mogadishu since the outbreak of civil war there 18 months ago, said, "People are dying in the thousands daily because aid workers cannot move relief food." He described the conditions in Somalia as "the single worst humanitarian crisis in the world."
"It is appalling that there is food at the Mogadishu port and at a store nearby but it cannot reach millions of starving people a few kilometers away because of the insecurity," he said.
 
Urges U.N. Pressure
 Mr. Kunder said the United Nations needed to pressure the two competing warlords of Mogadishu, Mohammed Farah Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohammed, to insure that there was no further shelling of commercial ships coming into the port.
Mr. Kunder was accompanied on his five-hour stay in Mogadishu by Fred Cuny, a disaster consultant to the Agency for International Development, and two other agency officials.
The team members said that ways had to be found to saturate Somalia with food so that the incentive for the fighting would be reduced.
They said food should be trucked over the border from Kenya and left at staging posts in southern Somalia so that people could pick it up there rather than having to trek to provincial centers like Baidoa, or moving across the border into Kenya as refugees.
In the last several months, tens of thousands of hungry nomadic Somalis, their cattle and camels stolen, have arrived in Baidoa, 150 miles northwest of Mogadishu. Many of them have died. There are now more than 330,000 Somali refugees in northern Kenya , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The American disaster experts said another way of getting food to people was to sell relief food to Somali merchants in Kenya who would take the food back to Somalia and sell it at fair prices. Through competition, the price of food would drop and Somalis with some money could buy it, leaving the free food to the most destitute.

HEADLINE: California, Land of Crises, Mingles Despair and Hope

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., July 30

 BODY:
Nothing seems amiss from outside the high chain-link fence on Conant Street as mechanics labor under the Southern California sun to prepare the hulking MD-11 and MD-80 passenger jets at the Douglas Aircraft plant here for airlines in China and Indonesia. The gleaming jets have long been proud symbols of California's economic and technological prowess.
But at the plant gate around the corner, Kent Fulfer displayed another, newer and less appealing symbol of California: his layoff notice. 
 His services as a structural mechanic will no longer be needed after he picks up his last paycheck on Aug. 21, just two and a half years after Douglas told him he would probably have work at least until the end of this century on the new MD-90 jet. The recession-battered airline industry is not buying enough airplanes.
 
Troublesome Changes
 "It's pretty disappointing," said Mr. Fulfer, born in Hollywood 38 years ago to movie-industry parents. For the first time in his life he ponders moving out of his beloved state to find work.
Mr. Fulfer's voice is not unique. His troubles come as California, the most populated state, reels from an extraordinary series of blows, natural and man-made, that have radically altered Californians' perception of their state. Disastrous earthquakes, drought, fires, freeze and floods have now been joined by recession, cutbacks in military spending, deadly racial disorders and the biggest budget shortage that any state has ever faced.
A recent journey that covered much of the length and breadth of this state of 30 million people found a wide diversity of views, including deep despondency and pessimism, some indifference, as well as a good measure of the kind of buoyancy and bold optimism as much a part of this beautiful land of new beginnings and tolerance as palm-fringed beaches and craggy mountains. Nearly all the people interviewed said they had been hurt by the recession.
The journey evoked many of the signature images of California: oil fields, blond and bronzed surfers, Mexican grape pickers, San Francisco hippies, Silicon Valley computer engineers, Basque shepherds, swimming pools, Sunset Boulevard movie glitter, guided missiles and Stealth bombers, beach bums, body builders, desert rats, druggies, struggling Vietnamese immigrants, acid house music and New Age crystal power.
The journey was made against the backdrop of California's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The recession and cutbacks in military spending in a state long dependent on weapons production have together driven the unemployment rate to 9.5 percent, the highest of any industrial state.
Douglas Aircraft, set back by declining aircraft orders, has announced layoffs that will total about 5,000 by the end of this year and Hughes Aircraft, a major military contractor, expects to lay off 12,000 workers, mostly high-paid engineers and technicians, within the next 18 months.
In Sacramento, the state government has been without a budget for 30 days and is paying its bills with i.o.u.'s while the political leadership wrangles over bridging a $10.7 billion gap. No matter how the problem is resolved it means huge cuts for public hospitals, parks, drug-treatment programs, schools and colleges.
Despite all this, there are signs that there will always be a California:
*In Pinole, near San Francisco, a local bus line, WestCAT, recently spent $1,300 to have its new administrative building diagnosed by an expert in feng shui, the ancient Chinese Buddhist practice of arranging surroundings to promote prosperity and harmony. Faced with flickering lights and a water leak, the expert recommended rearranging the furniture, painting a gray fence green and mounting banners on top of the building to draw up "the vital energy of nature," The San Francisco Chronicle reports.
*In Arvin, John Kovacevich, a wealthy farmer, worries most not about the budget gap or urban riots, but the bountiful harvest of plums. "Peaches and nectarines are pretty good, but there are too many plums," says Mr. Kovacevich, now 83 years old. "People don't have money to buy grapes."
*Santa Monica plans a "peace day" celebration on Saturday to dedicate a sculpture, "Chain Reaction," by the political cartoonist Paul Conrad. It is a 26-foot-tall mushroom cloud made of chain links meant to serve as a symbol for world peace.
Indeed many Californians can still identify with the words of Remi Nadeau, who wrote this in 1963 in his book published by David McCay, "California: The New Society:"
"California, perhaps more than any other state, is really a fulfillment of the American dream. Except for some areas of blight, here is the good life -- considerable comfort, escape from drudgery and hardship, reasonable leisure time, and the environment to make the most of it. Is this not the American promise -- freedom to enjoy life as the fruit of honest labor? Following the American tradition to its ultimate, California is really a sort of secular Kingdom Come."
 
'It Was Like a Frontier'
 And indeed, California was the Kingdom Come for Robert Wunsch when he migrated to Los Angeles from New York in 1958, when, as he put it: "We all felt the world was our oyster and California was the leading edge. It was as though I came in a covered wagon. Los Angeles was just Hollywood, oranges and surfers. There were two French restaurants. It was really like a frontier."
"Now," says Mr. Wunsch, a Hollywood talent agent whose home sits near where looters burned stores in the recent riots, "suddenly we see ourselves in disrepair. We thought we were the leading edge of social and racial tolerance, but even liberals have fled. This dream of California as a golden place has now turned sour. I feel an enormous hostility has taken over the city. Half my friends own guns."
More than 100 miles from the frenzy of Los Angeles, over the Tehachapi Mountains in Kern County, no such complaints come from Octaviano Quintino and his wife, Estella. The Mexican immigrants have found their California dream, spending long hot days picking grapes in the Central Valley at $5.50 an hour.
"We have steady work, the children are getting good educations and we have good health care," Mr. Quintino said in Spanish, deftly packing green seedless grapes into a wooden crate. Though an American citizen now, he said he had never voted and did not know who the Governor was.
Like many affluent Californians, Dr. A. B. Falcone and his wife, Patricia Lalim Falcone, of Fresno in the Central Valley, trace the state's troubles to illegal immigration from Mexico. "The problem is illegal aliens," Mrs. Falcone said. "They are really sapping the economy of Fresno."
 
Losing Some Battles
 The California downturn has brought deep disappointment to the Falcones, who have been leading a local crusade to bring a new campus of the University of California to Fresno; that expansion has now been indefinitely shelved.
Corky Matthews of Carmel Village is one of those native Californians who agonize not over the bad economy but what they see as the rapid deterioration of the state's environment. She and her husband, Graham, are both retired teachers. "Thank God for the earthquakes and the fire," she said, on the way to a week of backpacking in the high Sierra. "Maybe it will help keep people from moving here."
Nearby, the local economy is reeling from another source, the end of the cold war. The Army plans to pull out its forces and sell off most of the 29,000-acre Fort Ord, just north of Monterey. This will mean a loss of nearly 20,000 jobs, military and civilian, and a loss of more than $525 million a year.
"I'm going to have to close," said Mack Ado, who has spent the last five years giving tattoos to the soldiers in his second-floor studio on Reservation Road in Marina, the town just outside the base. "Sixty-five percent of my business is military."
For young Californians, the future seems bleaker than it did for their parents. Fees at state colleges have risen rapidly and class offerings are dwindling as a result of the state budget crunch. "I'm really worried," said Janice Krusinsky, a senior at the University of California at Santa Barbara, who is from Novato, a suburb north of San Francisco where her parents are both teachers. "It's so much more difficult to find a job. There's a lot of confusion."
Nearly three years ago, the powerful Loma Prieta earthquake wrecked the home of Forrest and Sandra Hill, who lived just six miles from the epicenter in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They faced the disaster with defiance, determination and self-reliance that is very Californian.
Mr. Hill, a building contractor, came from Manhattan Beach, Calif., 12 years ago; his wife, a native of Toronto, has been here 20 years and works as a flight attendant for American airlines out of San Jose. They scarcely considered moving away and recently finished building a new 2,700-square-foot home on the same site.
Why did they stay? "The Midwest has tornadoes, the Southeast hurricanes, the East freezes, Idaho has conservatives," Mr. Hill said.
A few miles below, the City of Santa Cruz is still rebuilding from the quake, which destroyed most of the historic downtown. Sitting in front of the post office, a 27-year-old homeless woman, Kelly Dodson, bemoaned the state budget crisis, which stands to affect her more than most Californians because of expected deep cuts in welfare.
"This is an expensive town to live in -- there are a lot of snobs," she said, explaining that she usually sleeps in a tent she bought for $2. California, is "going down -- our government doesn't know what it's doing," she said, adding: "The state doesn't have a budget. Some people don't get welfare."
 
A Company Survives
 Beverly Kuykendall grew up in mostly black South-Central Los Angeles, very near where the recent riots occurred. She and her husband, Calvin L. Jones, are partners with Ron Johnson in a small company that distributes medical supplies to hospitals, prisons and schools.
The company, Management Health Care Products and Services, based in suburban Torrance, just south of the riot-torn areas, is the kind of minority-owned business that local leaders hope will provide jobs to youth.
The partners have been deeply affected by the recent troubles, both psychologically because of the racial tensions and economically because of the budget crisis, which means that many of their clients, like state prisons and hospitals, are unable to pay them for now.
"If we go out of business, it's going to affect a lot of people," Ms. Kuykendall said. "We are an African-American company that is surviving. I came out of South-Central. I am not on welfare. I want people to see that."
Her husband, Mr. Jones, who is from Indiana, remains upbeat about his adopted state. "Many who come to California bring images of warm weather and palm trees," he said. "They think life is easy here. Life is going to be difficult here in the 90's, but there are still more opportunities than in other places."
Mr. Johnson, who migrated here from Louisiana, says he would still advise younger blacks to bring their "drive and dreams" to California. "California is so diverse," he said. "Don't let what you see on TV stop you."
 
Site for Star Charts
 It seemed like a million miles away in Stinson Beach, a refuge for hippies, New Age thinkers and escapees from reality north of San Francisco, where Cathy Cohn and a friend were doing each other's star charts at the Sand Dollar bar the other day.
"California was slow to get the recession, but then it was hit hard because it had been in a state of denial," said Ms. Cohn, a disc jockey and manager of musical acts. "California is finally catching up with the rest of the country. It's going bankrupt not because it has no resources, but because of the way it's run. Republicans keep evoking family values that have nothing to do with the variety of families in 1992."
For California's rapidly growing Asian minorities, the tough times have been particularly complex. Nearly 75,000 Vietnamese have gravitated to Orange County, mostly along Bolsa Avenue in Westminster, which they have transformed into a Little Saigon with huge malls.
The original wave, the "75'ers," as they call themselves, came after the fall of Saigon. They arrived in a California with an expanding economy and plenty of opportunity, and many of them grew wealthy.
But the new wave faces more problematic futures, said Nghia Trung Tran, 29-year-old son of one of the 75'ers, a former South Vietnamese military officer. Mr. Tran, executive director of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County, an agency that helps immigrants, says cuts in welfare and other social programs are making life difficult for the newcomers.
To a large extent, the California economy has been driven by the kind of technological entrepreneurship embodied in Silicon Valley, the incubator of computer technology south of San Francisco. But even there times have turned tough with cutbacks in military spending and growing competition from other states and countries.
Tom Hayes, chairman of a recent industry-sponsored study, estimates that the valley has lost 30,000 jobs in the last three years or so.
"There's a lot of angst here," said Mr. Hayes, who is manager of corporate relations for Applied Materials in Santa Clara. "Bankrupcies are twice what they were five years ago. There is a feeling this land of entrepreneurship may not be so, that we are killing the young seedlings."
More than 400 miles to the south, all these cares meant nothing to Joseph R. Stevens, a 43-year-old unemployed man who was drifting through the Mojave Desert. "I've lived in Missouri, Tennessee, Indiana," he said, adding that California ("an excellent state") offered more personal freedom than anyplace he'd been.
"You have the freedom to fertilize your spiritual garden," he said. "And with everything that's spoken of in a spiritual context, there's always the tangible substance, the fruit of the garden."
