HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: RUSH HOLT;
At Last, a Politician Who Knows Quantum Mechanics

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
One of the upsets of the Nov. 3 election was the defeat of the incumbent Republican, Michael Pappas, in New Jersey's 12th Congressional District by Dr. Rush Holt, who had never held elected office. Mr. Pappas was best known nationally as the Congressman who once sang, on the floor of the House of Representatives, a tribute he had composed to the special prosecutor, "Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr, now we know how brave you are."
Dr. Holt, 50, a physicist, was the assistant director of Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He will join Representative Vernon J. Ehlers, Republican of Michigan, as one of two physicists serving in Congress. 
 "We're talking about starting a bipartisan physics caucus," Representative-elect Holt, a Democrat, joked recently in an interview at his mother's Washington apartment.
 Q. In your campaign, you received contributions from 14 Nobel Prize winners. Did they support you because you're likely to put science issues onto the legislative agenda?
 A. I must tell you, we didn't try to recruit Nobel Prize winners to my campaign. But word went out in the community that I was running, and some scientists told others and they gave. My campaign staff was very excited by these contributors and they wrote them a letter and asked if it was O.K. to use their names. My staff picked up on that . . . just like they picked up on the fact that I'd been on "Jeopardy" six times.
 Q. How much did you win?
 A. About $5,500 and a car. This was back in the 1970's when the categories were worth $10 and $20.
But back to my campaign: To be honest, science was not much of a factor in it. I would talk about what a scientist could bring to Congress, but issues of science did not seem to move most voters. Occasionally, I'd meet a voter who said he'd like to see someone in Congress who "really understood quantum mechanics."
But most people cared more about health care, Social Security, education -- issues that they felt affected their daily lives, and I tried to address those.
 Q. Now that you've won, do you intend to be the science community's point man on the Hill?
 A. I can't help but be, yes.
 Q. Are you starting a trend, trading laboratory for legislature?
 A. With all due respect to lawyers, we need more diversity among legislators. I think more scientists should get involved in public policy. But many say: "Politics is dirty. There's too much compromising."
You know the first question everyone asks me is why would a scientist leave a perfectly good job at a major research lab to go into "that muck." But for me, politics wasn't such a big step. This is the first office that I've run for, but I've worked on Capitol Hill in the early 1980's in the office of Congressman Bob Edgar as a science, defense and education adviser. I worked at the State Department during the Bush Administration, doing arms control.
 Q. How do you think your father, the late Rush Holt Sr., a Senator from West Virginia, would have felt about your career change?
 A. I don't think he'd be particularly impressed or pleased with my election, although I showed some skill as a candidate. I think his satisfaction would come if he saw that I was really using the office to accomplish good for people.
My father passionately fought for good government. . . . Ever since my election, I'm getting letters from people in West Virginia who say, "Your father was a hero of mine." He's been dead 45 years, but he's still remembered because he took stands. In fact, he was defeated for re-election in 1940 because although elected as a New Dealer, he fought with Roosevelt on a number of issues.
Last week, during an orientation session the Democrats had for new members of Congress, one of the Congressional leaders said to us, the freshmen, "If you're not prepared to leave Congress over a principle, then you should leave now." I thought that was an interesting statement. So we'll see. . . .
 Q. Why is it important that there be scientists in Congress?
 A. It's not that scientists have a corner on the truth, but a science background is important for understanding the limitations of some policies. Scientists are in a position to define what is possible. There are examples where policy makers promote programs that just are . . . fallacious, that essentially are prohibited by the laws of science. Legislative calls for a space-based Star Wars system had some aspects of this.
 Q. Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is retiring, is said to be a big science buff. Did he support science?
 A. One of the first things Gingrich did was to abolish the Office of Technology Assessment, an agency that advised Congress on science and technology, thus saying in effect, "We don't want scientists telling us what we don't want to hear." After that, I found it very hard to accept Gingrich's claim that he was the champion of science and technology.
 Q. Would you like to see the office re-established?
 A. I don't know what the political possibilities on that are. But I do believe we have to increase the emphasis on science in the government. If there's a slogan on the wall, it should read, "It's productivity, stupid!"
The way our economy is able to provide for its people is through productivity and that comes from educational training and new ideas. The new ideas, primarily that's research and development. So things such as R and D tax credits are very important. If you look to industry, industries more and more are pulling back on research. Economists will argue how much Government funding of research and development leads or follows corporate research and development. I'm inclined to think it leads. But either way, we need more of it.
Take energy research. We're spending more than $500 billion dollars a year on energy and we're not spending 1 percent of that on research into alternatives. Whether you're a cobbler or a tinman if you see that your raw materials are in jeopardy, you extend some effort to find new sources. The point is that our supplies are in jeopardy, and our means of producing energy are environmentally damaging and yet we're paying little attention to alternatives.
 Q. We've heard you'll be advocating reforms in science education.
 A. Well, yes. Science education should not just be for future scientists, but for all kids. We should get away from this idea that in 10th grade you do biology, in 11th chemistry, and if you stick it out long enough, you do physics in the 12th. It should be all mixed up. And we should be teaching science in a way that's integrated with other disciplines -- literature, social studies.
 Q. How did you get interested in science?
 A. I think when I was in elementary school a book on dinosaurs and fossils got me interested, and I decided then I would be a scientist. My mother was a biology teacher and I'd borrow her books. She had a master's in zoology. After my father died, she taught at a junior college for a couple of years. Then, later, she became Secretary of State in West Virginia and she never got back to science. But while she was still teaching, I often went to the building where my mother was teaching and played around with the chemicals.
I didn't know at the time how dangerous it was to play with mercury. But it sure was fun.
 Q. Back to your recent campaign. When you heard Congressman Pappas singing "Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr" on C-Span, what was your first reaction?
 A. That we should rethink our media budget. I thought, every voter in the district should have the opportunity to hear that.
 Q. Would you say, if you were rewriting Machiavelli's "The Prince" one of your new rules might be "Never sing on C-Span?"
 A. Yeah. I think Al D'Amato also sang. What was it? "Old MacDonald Had a Farm." And I think Charles Schumer took a page from our campaign with resurrecting an old Al D'Amato song. And he's now Senator-elect Schumer.

Faith in Stocks: The Dow Hits a Record High

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Wall Street panicked this summer, but Main Street doubted the sky was really going to fall. So far, at least, those who kept their heads -- or at least their stocks -- have done better than those who sold.
Indexes of big American stocks, including the Dow Jones industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500, set records yesterday. Smaller stocks and junk bonds are showing new life. 
 What's going on? Wall Street analysts list a number of causes. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times, reassuring investors that it was determined to avoid a recession. Corporate takeovers are back in vogue, Brazil was bailed out, and the election assured that President Clinton would keep his job.
Such explanations have validity, but they miss the most important part of the story. Individual investors were never as fearful as Wall Street that Asia's woes would affect this country's economy. Russia's default on its debt came as a shock to professional investors, as did the collapse of John Meriwether's hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. But back on Main Street, investors generally couldn't buy hedge funds -- Long-Term Capital required a minimum investment of $10 million -- and had not invested in Russia either. To be sure, mutual funds that invest primarily in American stocks suffered withdrawals of $6.6 billion in August, but all of that money and more came back in September. The initial public offering business is again strong, and speculation in Internet stocks is hotter than ever.
All this reflects the widespread belief that stocks are now, and always will be, the best long-term investment. The spread of that gospel has had important effects on how the stock market relates to the economy. Back when most investors thought that stocks could fall as well as rise, and deemed it important to try to anticipate those moves, the stock market usually began to fall months before a recession began. But in 1990, the plunge in prices began in the same month as the recession.
Now it is quite possible that the stock market will peak not before, or even simultaneous with, the economy. Instead, stocks may keep rising until evidence of a real recession is clear not just to those who follow economic statistics but to all those people on Main Street who have so far shown such faith in stocks.
Then, perhaps, we will see if the faith can endure a bear market. Such a market is not indicated by a fall of 20 percent or any other arbitrary amount, but by continued declines, quarter after quarter, in stock prices. By that measure, the last bear market ended in 1982, long before most current investors took their first plunge into stocks.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Rally Produces Records as Mergers Feed Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices vaulted to record levels yesterday, furthering a recovery that as recently as two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable.
"I thought we were in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never thought or wrote that the bull market was over," said Byron R. Wien, United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company. "Now it seems all of that is behind us." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27. The record is the first since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,337.97.
Since Aug. 31, when the Dow stood at 7,539.07 after a steep slide, the blue-chip gauge has risen more than 24 percent. For the year, the Dow is up 18.54 percent and has a chance of rising more than 20 percent for a fourth consecutive year, something never accomplished before.
Broader averages also climbed.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set a record, rising 24.66 points, or 2.12 percent, to 1,188.21. The Nasdaq composite index did not reach a new high but posted the biggest percentage gain yesterday, rising 49.21 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,977.42. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 398.15.
Yesterday's action was energized by a daily record for the number of mergers and acquisitions valued at $1 billion or more.
The merger announcements not only prompted investors to change estimates of how much companies were worth but also indicated coming declines in the number of shares available for trading.
"This may be a supply-demand story, where demand for stocks is rising and the supply of stock is reduced as one company after another merges," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "The flow of money into mutual funds is fairly strong, and there is pressure on managers to put that money to work."
Two deals seemed to be catalysts for broad swaths of stocks.
News that Bankers Trust may be close to accepting an $8.9 billion offer from Deutsche Bank of Germany heightened interest in financial-services and bank stocks. And word that America Online may acquire Netscape Communications for $4 billion in stock powered Internet and other technology stocks.
Among financial companies, J. P. Morgan gained 6 1/4, to 115 7/8. American Express was up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16. Merrill Lynch jumped 4 3/8, to 76. And Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette rose 3 9/16, to 42 3/4.
Netscape was the most active stock, gaining 2 3/4, to 41 15/16. America Online gained 4 3/8, to 89 1/4.
Other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts said the group, which has seen meteoric gains in recent weeks, was ripe for a steep correction. Yahoo and Amazon.com both became $200 stocks yesterday. Yahoo rose 30 7/16, to 221 7/16. And Amazon.com gained 37 3/8, to 218.
"The performance of the Internet stocks is an unsettling sign," Mr. Wien said.
Still, more-established technology shares also had a very good day. I.B.M. rose 6 7/16, to 166 9/16. Microsoft jumped 5 9/16, to 119 3/16. And Intel closed at 113 9/16, up 1 1/2.
After yesterday's big price moves, Mr. Wien said that according to his calculations, stocks were about 10 percent overvalued. By contrast, in the middle of July the market was 20 percent overvalued, he said.
Nonetheless, the market's recovery, which has been buttressed by three cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, has left many longtime Wall Street hands grasping for historical parallels.
"At this point we are in new ground," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own market research firm. "At the beginning of the year, I said my target for the Dow was 10,000 by the end of 1998. If anyone had asked when the market went through what now looks like a corrective blip, I would have said my new target would have been about 9,000. I am surprised the 10,000 figure came back on the table" for this year.

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
 Prices of Treasury bonds fell for the first time in four days as stocks rallied and Merck & Company sold $500 million of long-term debt, drawing away demand from ultrasafe Government securities.
It is "a continuation of the reverse of the flight to quality," said Edgar Peters, who oversees $16 billion at Panagora Asset Management in Boston.
"A lot of people who bought bonds are dumping them and buying stock," he said.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 , to 9930/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.25 percent from 5.22 percent.
Investors are showing greater demand for stocks and the riskier fixed-income securities since the Federal Reserve trimmed its target rate for overnight loans between banks -- known as the Federal funds rate -- by a quarter-point, to 4.75 percent, last Tuesday.
Many investors are also favoring corporate bonds over Treasuries, wagering that the Fed's three rate cuts will keep the economy on track.
Following are the results of the Government's regular weekly bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.888	97.773	High Rate	4.45%	4.43%	Coupon Yield	4.56%	4.59%	Low Rate	4.38%	4.38%	Median Rate	4.42%	4.42%	Total applied for	$26,476,015	$31,878,309	Accepted	$11,663,765	$11,601,528	Noncompetitive	$1,228,318	$994,109	

Both issues are dated Nov. 27, 1998. The three-month bills mature on Feb. 25, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on May 27, 1999.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Says Proposed Netscape Deal Supports Its Case

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation argued in Federal court today that the proposed acquisition of the Netscape Communications Corporation by America Online seriously undermined the Government's antitrust suit against the software giant.
"From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the Government," William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, said this morning on the courthouse steps. 
 The reasoning behind this assertion, Microsoft says, is that the proposed deal demonstrates that Netscape and the larger software industry are healthy and vibrant -- even with all of the illegal and anticompetitive practices charged in the Government's suit.
But David Boies, the Government's lead attorney, said all of that was irrelevant. "Whatever the deal ends up being -- if there ends up being a deal -- is not going to remove any of the obstacles that Microsoft has placed in the path of competition in this industry," he said.
 Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a Government witness, the economist Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial today that the proposed acquisition undermined his argument that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems. After all, about 22 percent of Americans who use the Internet reach it through America Online. And at present America Online uses Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, as the service's default choice. In exchange for that, Microsoft places an America Online advertisement and Internet link in Windows 98.
Mr. Lacovara asked the witness whether, once America Online's service contract expires in January, "would you expect AOL to continue to distribute Microsoft software?" Yes, Mr. Warren-Boulton responded. "It is not at all clear to me that AOL's incentive to do this is changed by this proposed merger with Netscape." He noted that America Online officials had said their need to be among the on-line services featured in Windows forced them to accept Microsoft terms -- establishing Internet Explorer as the default choice.
Mr. Lacovara then asked him the question that lay under his entire cross-examination of the witness -- and Microsoft's larger assertion today about the proposed Netscape-America Online deal. "Surely this combination," he asked, 'tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry?"
Mr. Warren-Boulton's answer was probably not the one Mr. Lacovara had been after.
"To the extent that this potential merger is the result of Microsoft's actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions," he said, "it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like Netscape, the brightest, newest star."
Mr. Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the Government is to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft operating system. That is the foundation under most of the Government's case since Federal antitrust law forbids certain behavior by a monopolist that would be legal for a firm that faces healthy competition.
Through repeated, often circumlocutious questioning, Mr. Lacovara tried to make the case that Microsoft's overwhelming market share was ephemeral. The software industry is so vibrant and fast moving, he suggested, that Microsoft could be toppled from its position at any moment -- a point of view the company encourages among its employees.
On Friday and today Mr. Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies -- principally Microsoft's greatest rivals -- are writing software for these new systems. But Mr. Warren-Boulton argued that "the existence of these fringe competitors in the operating system market does not mean in any way that Microsoft does not have monopoly power."
This afternoon Mr. Lacovara made an issue of the success the Apple Computer Company is having selling its new iMac computer. He entered into evidence an Apple news release issued last month showing, among other things, that 12.5 percent of the people buying Apple's new iMac computer had previously owned a Windows machine. Apple computers use a different operating system, Mac-OS.

HEADLINE: CUNY Approves Stiffer Test Intended to Gauge Writing Ability

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Adding yet another test to insure the English proficiency of graduates, the trustees of the City University of New York yesterday began requiring that students pass a new writing examination before they enter the third year of studies at senior colleges or transfer as upperclassmen from other colleges.
CUNY's community college students will also have to pass the new test to graduate. The test replaces the writing placement examination that the trustees imposed as a community college graduation requirement in May 1997. 
 The new test will apply to freshmen entering next fall. The proposal passed by a vote of 14 to 0, with the student trustee abstaining.
The test, developed with the help of a faculty committee and testing experts, is widely seen as an improvement over the current writing test, which was designed as a diagnostic tool for placing students in the appropriate writing courses. But some faculty members and students still dislike use of a single high-stakes examination to determine whether students can continue their studies.
The new exam was designed to measure skills needed in standard college course work. Students will have two hours to read a one- or two-page article and then write an essay that shows that they have understood what they read and that offers some criticism or analysis. Several questions will suggest questions to answer or themes to address in writing the essay.
In the placement test used now, students are asked to write a short essay in response to two open-ended questions on topics like "Is America still a land of opportunity?" or "Do celebrities make good role models?"
Some trustees expressed reservations about adopting the test before it has been subjected to a careful pilot review next spring. But Anne A. Paolucci, CUNY's chairwoman, said that it was important to approve the test now "to give us the momentum."
"We need this incentive of having voted on it to go ahead properly," she said, stressing that the board could still amend the testing process after the pilot test was completed.
Some critical details have not yet been decided, including how many times students will be allowed to take the test or what will happen to those who fail it. But on a board where the debate sometimes turns confrontational, most of the discussion yesterday was cordial.
The only vocal opposition came from a small group of student and faculty protesters, corralled inside police barriers across from CUNY's East 80th Street building. The protesters waved large turkey placards with trustees' faces on them and the words "Board of Turkeys."
One protester, Blandon Casenave, a Hunter College senior in economics and political science, called the new test a trap "designed to keep people from having having access to the senior colleges."
The examination will be pilot-tested next spring. In a preliminary trial on 2,000 students in freshmen English courses last spring, just under a quarter failed it. Students are likely to be further along in their studies when they take the new test.
About 68 percent of freshmen failed the current writing placement test when they entered CUNY last year.
Faculty members expressed mixed feelings about the new examination. Although many see it as a clear advance over the current writing examination, others are concerned that it could interfere with students' ability to stay in school.
"It is very unfair to impose this without giving the students the support and teaching they need," said Lawrence Rushing, a psychology professor at La Guardia Community College.
Mizanoor Biswas, the student trustee, expressed similar concerns yesterday, saying he would be more comfortable voting after he saw the results of the pilot test next spring. "As much as I agree this is a better test," he said, "I see a need for more money for English departments."
Another concern is that students who are members of racial minorities performed less well on the preliminary pilot test last spring than their white classmates. Roughly a quarter of the Hispanic, Asian and black students failed the test, compared to only 14 percent of the white students. Students from homes where English was not the only language spoken also did somewhat less well than their classmates.
The old writing examination will continue to be used as one of the three CUNY placement tests (along with tests in mathematics and reading) that determine whether students need remedial help when they enter the university. Under a policy adopted last May, students must also pass all of those tests before they will be allowed to enter the four-year colleges. That policy was to be phased in beginning next fall, but is on hold pending the outcome of a court suit over whether the trustees adhered to the state's open meetings law when they passed it.
CUNY officials said that other state university systems, including those in California, Texas and Florida, used a common proficiency exam or would soon require one.

Imbalance In Baseball Costs George

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
HOW can the New York Yankees not be worth, say, four times as much as the new Cleveland Browns? The answer to a question I continue to hear and have wondered about myself is found in a subtext to the widely speculated sale of George Steinbrenner's team.
That is, the Boss's effort to fortify the middle of his lineup, and the meager number of teams with enough money to contest him. 
 Despite the champion Yankees and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and retro ball parks and a basketball lockout, baseball is flirting dangerously with the collapse of competitive balance. This calamity-in-waiting obviously reflects in the range of the reported sales prices of Steinbrenner's biggest deal ever, one that is said to be in the late innings, with Cablevision's monopoly money closer, Charles F. Dolan, warming up.
The reported low figure is $550 million, and the high one is $1 billion, with the final price likely in between. I'm not implying that Steinbrenner, a la Kenny Anderson, might ever have to sell one of his cars for some pocket change, for the deal ultimately will be an American record. But what, then, are we to make of these figures relative to Rupert Murdoch's $1 billion bid for the Manchester United soccer team and Al Lerner's $530 million fee for that expansion Cleveland football team not yet in possession of a single shoulder pad?
Millions of New Yorkers have been conditioned -- by Steinbrenner, among others -- to believe that no property in the sports universe could compare to a storied franchise whose broadcast rights netted almost $500 million more than a decade ago, and comes with its own collection of monuments to itself. Now a soccer team is worth more, and a shell of a small-market football franchise almost as much?
Believe it, said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College who has written extensively on the industry and claims the legacy of the Babe and Joe D. don't carry as much market weight as a sound revenue-sharing plan.
"That's like saying Chrysler, because of its history, should sell for more money than Microsoft," Zimbalist said. "The fact is, football is golden, with a massive television contract and labor peace. Baseball is still in trouble because you have five or six teams bidding for all the best players."
Think about it. As this free-agent season has evolved, when was the last time anyone uttered the words Kansas City Royals? There are just too many sad welfare cases that have, as the major league baseball executive Sandy Alderson told Murray Chass in Sunday's New York Times, practically "given up."
Alderson used to run one of them, the Oakland A's, which reminds me of a weekday afternoon game in Oakland that I took my family to last July. The crowd was a few thousand, half of them camp kids on 99 cents admission. After the game, in the souvenir shop, my sons reached for batting helmets under a sign that read: $5, 50 percent off.
At the counter, I paid with a $10 bill, and received $5 change. I held up a helmet in each hand. "Two-fifty apiece," the guy said.
When I asked how he could sell merchandise that cheap, he said: "Buddy, you see today's crowd? It's only getting worse." Maybe we do have a distorted view of the game back home, I thought. Maybe that helps explain those shrinking World Series ratings, Yanks or no Yanks.
As the media corporations dig into their pockets, the gulf between rich and poor is only widening. Nobody, least of all Commissioner Bud Selig, will acknowledge that Murdoch, owner of the Dodgers and almost every television signal, has become baseball's de facto czar. As such, he most likely will not even have his hopelessly conflicted partnership with Dolan challenged, if and when the Yankees' sale is concluded.
"Without knowing anything about the Yankees' books, I am surprised that the sales price wouldn't be more in a media market like that," said Tom Murdo, the manufacturer of children's products who unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. "In my opinion, the Browns are not worth $530 million, but football is viewed as a better industry than baseball."
Maybe the Yankees would be worth more if Steinbrenner waited until after the city builds him luxury boxes. Or perhaps he senses that baseball, with no meaningful global upside, like Michael Jordan and Manchester United, has been artificially pumped up by the home run derby. Whatever the deal, Steinbrenner will become richer than ever, but must live on with one nagging thought.
After all these years, he still isn't that much bigger than Cleveland, where he cut his teeth on a silver spoon.

HEADLINE: Long a Leader, U.S. Now Lags In High School Graduate Rate

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
A major new international study shows that American high school graduation rates, for generations the highest in the world, have slipped below those of most industrialized countries.
The report, released yesterday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, which helps coordinate policy for 29 of the richest countries, suggests that the changing picture is less a matter of American backsliding than of substantial recent progress by other nations. 
 For example, in 1990, the average number of years an American 5-year-old was expected to attend school or college was the world's highest, 16.3. In 1996, the latest year for which data were available, the American score was 16.8, but 11 other countries, including Canada, Spain and Finland, had surpassed that number.
In addition, the report found that the United States devoted a smaller percentage of its national income to teacher salaries than other countries.
The United States remains on top in the percentage of students who enter college, but a pattern similar to high school graduation rates is emerging.
"Entry rates to college education in the U.S. are still the highest in the O.E.C.D. but that is likely to change soon," said Andreas Schleicher, principal administrator at the organization and one of the study's authors. "While enrollments in the United States remained relatively stable between 1990 and 1996, they increased by more than 25 percent in 16 O.E.C.D. countries."
He added that the United States also had one of the highest university dropout rates in the industrialized world -- 37 percent.
The report was the fifth such study issued by the organization since 1991, when it started examining educational trends. Mr. Schleicher said that over the last three years the report has been the organization's best-selling publication.
The report offers far more data than analysis, but it suggests that growing emphasis in other countries on high school graduation is a result of "the desire of employers to have better skilled workers and, hence, from individuals who see that educational qualifications improve their life chances."
Mr. Schleicher said the other nations in his organization had placed enormous emphasis on improving access to education, bringing them in line with and surpassing American achievements.
The shifting balance is likely to cause concern in the United States, because the quality of American education has been the focus of growing debate for 10 to 15 years.
"I think we should be quite alarmed by this," said Gerald Graff, professor of English and education at the University of Chicago, who is writing a book on what he considers the dangerous gap between the thinking classes in America and the rest of the society. "We've never fully committed ourselves to the democratic idea of education. There is a kind of silent bargain between schools and many of its students that says, 'We'll leave you alone if you just sit there and don't bother us.' "
Earlier this year, the results of a mathematics and science test for 12th graders in many countries showed students in the United States to be among the least knowledgeable. Earlier tests showed that the lowest 25 percent of 8th graders in Japan and South Korea to outperform the average American student.
Education was widely cited by voters as their top concern in this month's state and Federal elections. Candidates of both major parties vowing increased spending on teacher training and school improvement.
Education has risen and fallen as a political issue for generations. The Soviet Union's launching of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 spurred schools in the United States to require more math and science courses.
The issue most recently gained a high profile in 1983 with the publication by the U.S. Education Department of an alarming report on American education entitled "A Nation at Risk" which said that if a foreign power had imposed such a low level of education on the United States, it would rightfully have been perceived as having engaged in an act of war.
In the years since, there have been numerous efforts to improve the nation's schools, from alternatives to public education like charter schools and voucher plans to projects to improve teacher quality, widely perceived as the system's Achilles' heel. Some states are now testing student teachers more rigorously and offering signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness to encourage better candidates to enter the profession.
Many states are also instituting tests at various stages to insure that students do not graduate without basic skills and knowledge.
Yesterday's report shows that Americans between the ages of 55 and 64, who graduated high school some 40 years ago, had a graduation rate of 77 percent, the highest of those surveyed. Among those ages 24 to 34, the United States' rate slipped to eighth position. Today's graduation rates, with the United States at 72 percent, place it second to last in the 29-nation group, above Mexico.
It seems unlikely that the shift reflects higher standards for graduation in the United States because comparisons of adult literacy rates in the study show Americans to be among the industrialized world's least literate populations.
According to the report, the United States' expenditure per pupil is still among the highest in the group at all levels of education. It stands out in the way it has brought the private sector into college and university education, leading the way, according to Mr. Schleicher, in a growing international trend.
"Across the O.E.C.D., students in both public and private colleges are being asked to pay more for their education," he said. "Unlike in the United States, however, this spending has, in many countries, supplemented rather than displaced public spending on education."
But while the United States spends a great deal on education in absolute terms, its expenditure is about average as a percentage of gross domestic product. Moreover, teacher pay viewed through the same lens shows the United States to be among the lowest, while demands on teacher time in class are among the highest.
An experienced high school teacher in the United States earns 1.2 times the nation's gross domestic product per capita. Only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Norway pay their high school teachers less when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product. In Germany, Ireland, South Korea and Switzerland, among others, teachers earn twice or more of the per capita G.D.P.
Moreover, the average teacher salary in this country is significantly below that of other university graduates; in many other countries, like Australia, France and Britain, it is above it.
The amount of time a typical middle school teacher in the United States spends in front of a classroom per year is 964 hours, among the highest in the report.
The report adds that Americans cannot comfort themselves by thinking that theirs is a society of social mobility. It finds that children whose parents completed college are more than three times as likely to become college graduates as children whose parents did not complete high school. Moreover, the achievement gap between the well-off children of the well-educated and others is above the average for the 29 industrialized nations.

HEADLINE: Et Tu, New Jersey Nets?;
Meadowlands Sports Complex Faces Franchise Unrest

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
For generations, New Jersey officials have excelled at peddling their proximity to Manhattan, using the promise of tax abatements, new buildings and ample parking to lure New York businesses and sports franchises west of the Hudson.
Already this year New Jersey has bid aggressively, and unsuccessfully, to bring the New York Stock Exchange to Jersey City. Members of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's administration have quietly tried to lure George M. Steinbrenner 3d and the New York Yankees to the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford, N.J. 
 So imagine the consternation in the state capital when a group of Newark investors set their sights this summer on a new trophy: the Nets basketball team.
The New Jersey Nets.
The Nets' new owners, headed by Raymond G. Chambers, a philanthropist, want to move the team 14 miles south, from the Meadowlands to Newark. They are lobbying the state to help spur Newark's redevelopment efforts by building a downtown arena on a vacant parcel of land a few blocks from the new New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
The Nets' proposal is only one of many efforts, both in the region and beyond, by team owners trying to obtain new, more lucrative stadium deals. A half-dozen National Football League teams have moved into new quarters in recent years, and last week the Governor of Connecticut announced a deal to build a $350 million stadium to lure the New England Patriots to Hartford from Foxboro, Mass.
In addition, the Nets' plan also comes at a time when the New Jersey Devils' owner, John McMullen, is asking the state to build a hockey arena in Hoboken, placing Mrs. Whitman in the unpleasant position of scrambling to placate existing franchises rather than wooing new ones.
Although the exact details of the plans will be determined during months of negotiations, it seems certain that the Whitman administration will be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to build a new stadium, new roads and rail connections or all three. The Devils' owner says he is unhappy with the team's present site, Continental Airlines Arena, because it isn't accessible by train and has far fewer luxury boxes than arenas housing other National Hockey League franchises.
The Nets' new owners say they want to aid the rehabilitation of downtown Newark and, in the words of the team president, Michael Rowe, "to be part of an urban community where we can make a real difference with kids who live there."
Even the MetroStars soccer team is contemplating leaving the Meadowlands because its players prefer a natural grass field and Giants Stadium is equipped with artificial turf.
The prospect of the Nets' move also raises troubling questions about the future of the Meadowlands, an enormously successful sports complex that coaxed the Jets and Giants football teams out of New York City and helped New Jersey land its own major league hockey, basketball and soccer franchises.
"It's a lot more fun to play offense than defense," said Raymond H. Bateman, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates the Meadowlands.
In New York City Hall, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has frequently criticized New Jersey for snatching New York's businesses, some officials find poetic justice in watching the poachers become the poached. During Mr. Giuliani's tenure, New Jersey successfully sued for the rights to 90 percent of Ellis Island and forced New York City to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to retain the stock exchange, Conde Nast, Avon, General Motors and other major businesses.
And the idea of moving the Nets to Newark also resonates with Mr. Giuliani's desire to build a baseball stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. "This is another indication that the hot place to be is in an urban center," said Cristyne F. Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's director of communications. "If you look at the experiments taking place with baseball stadia moving to the center of cities like Baltimore and Cleveland, it's not at all surprising."
Members of the Whitman administration say the situation, though complex, is hardly a worst-case scenario.
"If people over in New York take comfort in this, we're happy for them," said Peter McDonough, Mrs. Whitman's director of communications. "We've got five pro sports teams playing here and the good news is that none of them are considering moving out of New Jersey."
In some respects, the housing complaints of the Nets and the Devils would not exist without the success of the Meadowlands. Thirty years ago, the current site of the complex was a desolate stretch of swamp; part wetland, part garbage dump.
But in the early 1970's, Gov. William T. Cahill saw the expanse of vacant land, with its easy access to New York City, as a chance to put the state into the entertainment world's big leagues, by luring the Yankees to suburbia. When Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York agreed to overhaul Yankee Stadium, the team decided to stay put. So New Jersey officials convinced the Giants' owner, Wellington Mara, whose team shared Yankee Stadium at the time, that he need not be a second-class tenant, and the Meadowlands won its first franchise.
New York officials nearly managed to scuttle the plan by undermining support for the bonds New Jersey issued to finance the project, but by 1976 both the football stadium and a nearby race track were operating.
In the heady early days, after New Jersey wooed the Jets and made a bid for the Rangers, the Sports and Exposition Authority's executive director, Robert E. Mulcahy 3d, said he once bumped into Gov. Hugh L. Carey of New York in an elevator and was treated as if he were the second coming of Walter O'Malley, the man who moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles.
"He asked me, 'Mulcahy, what are you going to steal next?' " said Mr. Mulcahy, now the athletic director of Rutgers University. "I told him, 'Governor, whatever I can get my hands on.' "
Today, the 750-acre complex, complete with a race track, outdoor stadium and indoor arena, is one of the busiest sports centers in the nation, with revenues near $150 million a year. From 1994 to 1996, it enjoyed its most impressive run of big-name events, as host to the World Cup soccer championships, dozens of outdoor concerts, a visit by Pope John Paul II, the Devils' Stanley Cup Championship and college basketball's Final Four tournament.
But competition for sports franchises has become so fierce, and the economics of stadium-building so convoluted, that a modern arena doesn't necessarily placate franchise owners for long.
Continental Arena, which opened in 1981, is mechanically sound, has good sight lines and is considered a pleasant stadium by most spectators. But Mr. McMullen, the Devils' owner, has complained for years that it does not have enough luxury boxes and corporate suites, which generate huge profits for the franchise. When the Devils made their successful Stanley Cup run in 1995, Mr. McMullen seized the moment to threaten a move to Tennessee, saying that the Meadowlands' luxury box gap had made it financially impossible for the Devils to compete with teams housed in newer centers.
Mrs. Whitman gave Mr. McMullen $5 million a year in concessions and persuaded him to sign a lease until the 2006-7 season. He has since demanded that the state help pay for a new center, to be built over an abandoned rail yard in Hoboken, a proposal many experts believe is prohibitively expensive.
State officials had hoped to persuade both the Devils and the Nets to stay at the Meadowlands by upgrading the arena, and hired an architectural firm this year to study the feasibility of renovating or replacing Continental Arena at its current East Rutherford site. The firm, which will release its preliminary findings next month, is expected to recommend razing the existing building and replacing it with a new 20,000-seat arena packed with restaurants, sports bars, movie theaters, a shopping concourse and an unspecified number of luxury boxes.
But whatever the Meadowlands proposal recommends, it cannot meet one of the primary concerns of Mr. Chambers, the leader of the Nets' new owners -- helping to revitalize Newark.
Mr. Chambers, who owns 19 percent of the team, shuns publicity and declined to be interviewed. But others familiar with his plans say he envisions a new downtown arena as a cornerstone in Newark's renaissance. State Senator Richard J. Codey, an Essex County Democrat who supports the project, said private developers had agreed to build a mall near the downtown site to help develop a shopping district and night life in Newark.
"What I want to do is turn this into a public policy issue," said Mr. Codey, the Senate minority leader. "We've already built the Meadowlands and turned that area of the state around. Why not do the same thing for Newark?"
Although Mrs. Whitman has indicated in the past that she would prefer to rebuild the Meadowlands arena, her aides privately concede that Mr. Chambers' involvement alters the equation.
If the Devils, or the MetroStars soccer team, can be persuaded to relocate to Newark, the state will face additional pressure to build a downtown stadium. Even if the Nets decide to go it alone, Mr. Chambers, who helped finance the Newark Performing Arts Center, has the financial clout to finance a downtown arena without the state's help.
"There's a lot of jockeying going on, between the teams, between the Meadowlands and the teams," Mr. McDonough said. "The Governor's position is just let it all play out and make a decision in the end."
State Senator Franz S. Leichter of New York, a frequent critic of government tax abatements, said it would be foolhardy for New Yorkers to gloat.
"If anything, this will probably accelerate the problem," Mr. Leichter said. "If the Meadowlands loses the Nets, they'll say: 'We have to replace them! Let's go get the Knicks!' "

Police Say Men Died In a Murder-Suicide

DATELINE: CLAYTON

 BODY:
A man who had been barred from contacting his estranged wife went to her house here Sunday night and used a shotgun to kill her male companion and himself, law enforcement officials said yesterday.
The husband, Michael A. Myers, 23, shot the man, Gary Dahl, 36, of Clayton, about 8:45 P.M. as Mr. Dahl baby-sat for the Myerses' 4-year-old son, said Debbie Romano, a spokeswoman for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's office. She said the boy was in the basement at the time and was not hurt, and his mother was not at home. 
 Chief Frank Winters of the Clayton police said a restraining order was issued on Aug. 18 after a series of harassing phone calls and other nonviolent incidents. He said Mr. Myers, who was unemployed and had no known address, called the house from a cellular phone several times on the day of the shootings, once while an officer was present and got on the phone to warn him to stop.
Chief Winters said Mr. Myers may have been watching the house and waiting for the police and his wife to leave.

HEADLINE: Some Depressions Aren't So Bad

BYLINE: By Niall Ferguson; Niall Ferguson is the author of "The House of Rothschild."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
A s the Dow Jones industrial average surged yesterday past the peak it reached last July, I was reminded of the English historian A. J. P. Taylor's remark that the only thing men learn from history is how to make new mistakes. Nothing demonstrates how easy it is to draw the wrong lessons from the past than the overheated talk of a second Great Depression following the short-lived drop in the stock market last summer.
When people refer to the Depression they obviously mean the catastrophic slump that followed the Wall Street crash of Oct. 24, 1929. The scars from that time run so deep that some economists mention it nearly every time the Dow Jones industrial average suffers a big one-day slide. 
 In July and August, when the Dow plunged by nearly 2,000 points, people wondered if Alan Greenspan would see his hard-won reputation as the world's most successful central banker evaporate in one final swoon. Not this time.
Maybe, however, we're looking at the wrong historical precedent. For there is another. It predates 1929, and it is much less scary.
The Great Depression of the 1930's was, in fact, the second such worldwide period of deflation. The first began in the 1870's and did not end until the mid-1890's.
What relevance does the depression of more than 100 years ago have in 1998? In many ways the world today is more like that of the late 19th century than it is like the world between the wars. The global economy in the 1920's and 1930's was hampered by restrictions on trade and on the movement of capital, as well as by numerous structural problems that originated in the huge disruption created by World War I.
By contrast, the world economy in 1873 was characterized by unprecedentedly free trade, thanks to the fashion for laissez-faire economics pioneered by Britain.
Huge infusions of capital were pumped into the world economy as investors sought higher returns in the late 19th century's emerging markets, notably Russia and Latin America. In some ways North America was an emerging market, too.
In those days, the world's financial center was London, with Paris in second place. Today, of course, New York is the hub, even if the Japanese have long been the world's biggest overseas net lenders. Capital movements are managed (if that is not too flattering a term) by giant companies like Merrill Lynch in partnership with smaller hedge funds. In the 1870's the international economy's No. 1 market maker was the House of Rothschild, a vast multinational investment bank that continued to be run, as it had been since the 1790's, as a family business.
The late 1860's and early 1870's were a boom time for the Rothschilds and their lesser imitators. The United States, emerging from the wreckage of the Civil War, was forging ahead with its railway network. German unification was followed by a boom east of the Rhine (rather as German reunification was after 1989).
In Central and Eastern Europe, the economy of the once stagnant Hapsburg Empire in Austria-Hungary began at last to grow. In Russia, the reforms of Czar Alexander II (beginning with the emancipation of the serfs) were ushering in rapid industrialization, financed mainly by foreign investors. Other countries eager for outside capital included Argentina and Brazil. And in the East, British imperialism was beginning to open up the potentially vast Chinese economy.
As in our own day, a key to the global boom was a revolution in communications. For the Victorians, it consisted of railways, steamships and the telegraph. Speeds for international communication were reduced from months to hours.
The Great Depression began on May 8, 1873, with a big slump on the Vienna stock market. The contagion soon spread to London. Central banks cut their base interest rates (the Bank of England's went from 9 percent in 1873 to 2 percent two years later), but to no avail.
The important point about the first Great Depression is that it was primarily a deflationary phenomenon. From 1873 to 1895, British prices fell by 44 percent. This happened more or less everywhere. By contrast (and this is the big difference between the 1880's and the 1930's), production did not fall substantially, and unemployment remained comparatively low.
This has profound implications for our own day. Commodity prices have fallen sharply -- down 18 percent in the past year. But Americans and Europeans are feeling more gain than pain.
Economists and central bankers tend to take it for granted that deflation is a bad thing, with falling output and unemployment its necessary accompaniment. As the case of Japan illustrates, there is some truth in this: indeed, it can be a self-fulfilling trend, in that pessimism breeds reluctance to invest. But the experience of the late 19th century suggests that deflation need not invariably be associated with universal economic misery.
Of course, there were losers then. In the United States, the Populists, a movement that began with disgruntled farmers, attributed the low prices they were getting to a conspiracy of bankers led by the Rothschilds.
The Populists blamed the United States' adoption of the British gold standard system of fixed exchange rates for the economic disruption. What was needed was an infusion of money -- more silver and more paper dollars -- to create mild inflation.
Similar pleas can be heard today, in different circumstances. The economist Paul Krugman has urged Japan to "print money like crazy" to revive its economy -- a remedy that the Populists favored long before Keynes. Other losers (including heavy industry) argued for protectionist tariffs or sought refuge in price-fixing cartels.
If nothing else, the Populists were right about the importance of the international monetary system as a transmission belt for financial crises.
Banking crises recurred throughout the period, notably the Barings bank crisis in London in 1890 (which prompted a bailout financed by the Rothschilds that was much like the recent private-sector rescue of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund).
But the key point is that not everyone lost as a result of deflation in the 1870's and 1880's. Stock speculators and commodity producers certainly suffered. But poorer consumers -- that is, most people -- clearly benefited from cheaper prices for food and other essentials. And falling prices did not discourage businessmen like the Rothschilds or John D. Rockefeller Sr. from investing; in fact, it was precisely the prospect of ever cheaper fuel that encouraged both to invest millions in the nascent oil industry.
So here, for those who want a new lesson from history, is the bad news: yes, another Great Depression is possible. In Japan it may have already begun, though so far central bankers elsewhere are managing to fend off serious deflation by cutting interest rates. (This time there's no gold standard to worry about.) The good news is that, if a depression comes, it will be a lot more like the price-cutting one of 1873 to 1895 than the economic catastrophe of the 1930's.

HEADLINE: Schroder's Morning After: Winning the Vote Was the Easy Part

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Less than a month after he swept into office with a ready smile and talk of a "new middle" that would revitalize Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has lost much of the momentum and good will that propelled his ascent.
Sniped at by state premiers who wield much power in Germany's decentralized system, criticized by his Green coalition partners, attacked by leading businessmen and buffeted within his own Social Democratic Party, Mr. Schroder has appeared unable to impose his stamp on the Government. 
 "There is no need to panic," Peter Struck, the leader of the Social Democratic Party in Parliament, said today, but the admonition itself clearly reflected mounting concern. Heide Ruhle, the party manager of the environmentalist Greens, declared that Germany "cannot be governed by the troops of chaos."
At a time when German companies are on a self-confident buying spree in the United States -- Deutsche Bank's impending purchase of Banker's Trust follows Daimler's acquisition of Chrysler and Bertelsmann's absorption of Random House -- this political uncertainty may appear out of character.
But the reality of Germany today is a streamlined and aggressive corporate sector, acutely aware of the challenges of the global economy, alongside an uncertain social and political model that Mr. Schroder has vowed to galvanize.
In part, Mr. Schroder's difficulties stem from teething problems that are inevitable given the Social Democrats' 16-year absence from power, and from the fact that a coalition government with the Greens was widely regarded as unlikely before the September elections, so few preparations for it were made.
"They were not prepared at all, nothing was prepared, and then the program was put together in haste," said Claus Leggewie, a sociologist close to the Government. "It does look kind of amateurish."
But at a deeper level, Mr. Schroder seems to be suffering from the very ambiguities of his campaign. While his ability to appear both as an energetic modernizer and a traditional Social Democrat sensitive to workers' concerns was effective at election rallies, it seems to be proving too wide a stretch for government.
Tensions in the Social Democratic Party burst into the open with the recent publication of a blunt letter to Mr. Schroder from Wolfgang Clement, the Social Democratic Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, which has a huge economy itself with a population larger than that of the Netherlands.
Mr. Clement said the tax reforms proposed by the Government were inadequate and would do nothing to reduce unemployment, now running at more than 10 percent. He suggested slashing the corporate income tax level to below 30 percent from more than 40 percent, and lowering top tax rates for individuals.
He also denounced Government plans to close tax loopholes for corporations and raise energy taxes, saying the changes would cost businesses about $17.8 billion. The thrust of his argument, which is also that of big business, was that only a deregulation of Germany's economy will spur corporations to create jobs.
The letter revealed the extent of the chasm between reformist Social Democrats like Mr. Clement and Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, who has focused more on the widening gap between rich and poor in Germany, the need to spur growth through cutting interest rates, and the possibilities of creating employment through a state-sponsored "alliance for jobs" bringing together labor unions and industry leaders.
For the moment, Mr. Schroder, whose essential political talent is that of a very effective communicator at once polished and unruffled, has appeared to want to remain above the fray.
This policy of aloofness may spare him the worst of the vitriol flying between the wings of his party, but at some point it appears inevitable that the Chancellor will have to intervene more forcefully or face growing criticism for indecisiveness.

Canadians Raise Concerns About Mexican Labor Law

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Mexican officials have acknowledged that their labor laws do not adequately protect the rights of Mexican workers, according to documents obtained by Canadian union officials who have filed a complaint against Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Canadian complaint involves conditions at an automobile brake plant outside Mexico City that is owned by the Dana Corporation of Toledo, Ohio, and follows a similar action taken in the United States earlier this year. 
 If both complaints determine that Mexico did not adequately enforce its labor laws, it could lead to the first sanction applied since Nafta went into effect in January 1994.
The Canadian office of the United Steelworkers of America and 40 labor and human rights organizations from Canada, Mexico and the United States contend that workers at the plant were intimidated and in some cases beaten when they tried to switch unions in 1997.
According to the complaint, workers at the brake plant, which operates under the name Itapsa, wanted to organize an independent union because wages were stuck at $5 a day and there were dangerous levels of asbestos dust.
The existing union, the Confederation of Mexican Workers, has strong links to the Government and reportedly ignored worker complaints. On Sept. 9, 1997, Itapsa workers voted on switching to an independent union, but they said they did so in the presence of outsiders carrying sticks and pipes. They were also forced to declare their vote at an open meeting in front of plant supervisors.
Under the labor side agreement, each country in the accord has established an administrative office to receive such complaints.
In April, the Canadian office received the complaint about the union vote and the safety conditions at the Itapsa plant. In September, the head of the Canadian office, May Morpaw, traveled to Mexico to meet with her counterpart, Rafael Aranda, and officials from the Mexican Labor Department.
In the notes of the meeting, which were obtained by the steelworkers union, Mexican labor officials acknowledged that union representation elections were usually not conducted in secret, even though workers could be dismissed if they voted for the losing union.
The Mexican officials also said they were not concerned that the lack of secrecy had made it inevitable that employers would know how a worker had voted. The Mexican officials said such elections were free and open, but they could not guarantee that coercion did not occur outside the voting site, according to the document.
In response to calls over several days seeking comment, the Mexican Labor Department sent a one-page summary of the complaint by fax but did not elaborate on the contents of Ms. Morpaw's notes.
The administrative office in the United States issued a report in July supporting most of the accusations in the complaint about Itapsa filed there. The office sent the complaint to the next stage in the regulatory process, which is direct consultations among the labor ministers of the three countries.
Ms. Morpaw of the Canadian office said a vote on whether to make a similar reference was scheduled for early December.
The accusations concerning free association for union members can only be taken up in talks among the labor ministers. But if two of the three labor ministers are sufficiently convinced that asbestos levels prove worker safety laws were not enforced at the plants, the issue could result in the first labor sanctions against Mexico.

F.C.C. Says Sprint and Telmex Overcharged on Some Rates

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Federal Government said today that it had received significant evidence that a joint venture created by the Sprint Corporation and Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, had committed anticompetitive practices in the long-distance market.
As a result, the Federal Communications Commission rejected the venture's proposed rates that are charged to other long-distance carriers. The agency also gave the venture 30 days to explain why officials should not review its long-distance license. 
 "U.S. consumers have to pay much more than they should to reach friends and relatives in Mexico," said William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. "The carriers have not moved quickly enough to bring these rates down and ensure meaningful competition."
Mr. Kennard said that the high rates affected "the most vulnerable consumers," recent Hispanic immigrants who used the service to talk with friends and relatives back home.
Sprint officials said that the joint venture had been caught in a struggle between American and Mexican authorities, and that the company's pricing had not been unreasonable.
"We're disappointed by today's development," the company said in a statement. "The Telmex-Sprint Communications joint venture is in the marketplace today, enjoying initial success because it provides a service that Hispanic and other consumers want and need. We are confident that neither any U.S. carrier nor the public interest has been hurt by TSC's entry into the U.S. market."
Gary Epstein, a lawyer in Washington representing Telmex, said the venture had met all of the conditions of the license and that the company would dispute the allegations.
The joint venture's license was approved three months ago over the objections of the two biggest long- distance carriers in the United States, the AT&T Corporation and MCI Worldcom Inc. The high volume of calls between the two countries has generated some $700 million last year in payments to Telmex, far and away the largest payment overseas by American carriers.
In granting the license, regulators had imposed a list of conditions intended to keep the marketplace competitive. Officials said today that those conditions had not been met, and they took action following a new round of complaints by AT&T and MCI that the joint venture remained fundamentally anticompetitive.
At the heart of the today's action are the rules and fees governing the so-called settlement rate, the fees that phone companies make to each other to complete calls. Settlement rates have historically been set well above the cost of completing a call, particularly in countries with less- developed economies or powerful state-owned telephone monopolies.
Officials said that any reduction in the rates would be passed on to consumers in the form of lower telephone bills.
Telmex had promised to lower the settlement rate to 19 cents a minute by the beginning of the year 2000. The commission approved the 19- cent rate but rejected the company's interim rates of 37.5 cents for 1998 and 34.5 cents for 1999.
The agency also described a variety of other anticompetitive practices, such as a 58 percent surcharge levied by Telmex for international calls made to Mexico.
While officials said that the proceeding initiated today might not lead to the revocation of the venture's license, they expected it would encourage significant changes that would open the market to competitors of the Sprint-Telmex venture.

Concerns on Profit Outlook Help Deflate the Dow a Bit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday on concern that the euphoria that sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 21 percent in six weeks was unjustified by the outlook for corporate profits.
"Earnings expectations still aren't good enough for the run-up that happened" on Monday, said Cummins Catherwood, who helps manage $570 million at Rutherwood, Brown & Catherwood Inc. in Philadelphia. "Cooler heads are prevailing." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 73.12, or 0.8 percent, to 9,301.15, with American Express leading the decline. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 5.22, or 0.4 percent, to 1,182.99. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 11.54, or 0.6 percent, to 1,965.88. American Express fell after an analyst downgraded the financial services company, saying that its profits will suffer as slowing worldwide economic growth reduces consumer spending.
The financial services company exemplifies the market's slump and quick recovery since mid-July. It sank as much as 41 percent, then jumped 50 percent from Oct. 8 through Monday. Yesterday, it fell 4 9/16, to 104 3/8, after Gary Gordon, a Paine Webber analyst, said the company's profit could be hurt by weaker consumer spending as economies in Asia, Latin America and the United States falter. The stock is trading at 22 times estimated 1998 earnings. Both the Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500 rose to all-time highs before retreating. The Dow industrials touched 9,457.95, while the S.& P. climbed as high as 1,191.30. The Dow average rose 214.72, to a record 9,374.27 on Monday, one of its quickest recoveries from a bear market since World War II.
After such a quick rally, "you ask whether earnings justify" prices, said Susan Flischel, the chief investment officer at the Cincinnati-based Countrywide Investments, which oversees $1 billion.
America Online, the No. 1 on-line service, rose 2 1/8, to 91 3/8, after it agreed to buy Netscape Communications for $4.2 billion, or $40.16 a share. Netscape fell 2 1/16, to 39 7/8.
The S.& P. 500 is priced at about 22 times the expected operating earnings per share for the coming four quarters, according to a survey of industry analysts by the First Call Corporation. The only time it has been higher in the last 50 years was in the first and second quarters of this year, when it reached 23 times earnings, said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call.
Market strategists and economists, who typically take a more conservative view of profit growth than industry analysts, expect growth of 4.1 percent for the S.& P. 500, according to First Call.
Corporate profits faltered in the third quarter, putting in the weakest annual performance in almost a decade, the Government said. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect companies in the S.& P. 500 to post year-over-year operating earnings growth of 6.3 percent. At the beginning of the quarter, the forecast was for profits to grow 9.1 percent.
"I think people may begin to realize that valuations are a little out of range here," James Pizzo, a senior portfolio strategist with CIBC Oppenheimer & Company, said.

Bond Prices Climb Again
 By Bloomberg News
 Bonds rose for a fourth time in five days yesterday amid optimism for subdued inflation, increasing the appeal of Government securities.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 26/32, to 100 24/32. Its yield fell 5 basis points, to 5.20 percent. Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded issue, rose 2 basis points, to 4.67 percent.
Demand for bonds was also lifted by the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1.04 billion of Treasury securities to add money permanently in the banking system to address a seasonal shortage, traders said.
Shorter-term securities lagged amid expectations that resilience in the economy and a recent rally in stocks will keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again soon.
"The implication is that the Fed is finished," said Paul Kasriel, an economist at Northern Trust Securities.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Despite Strong Business, Luxury Hotel Renovates

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The hotel business is still booming in New York. According to the latest figures from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm, the hotel occupancy rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be 84 percent this year, up from 82 percent last year.
"Eighty-four percent is essentially Manhattan's capacity," said Sean F. Hennessy, the New York director of the firm's hospitality and leisure practice. 
 So why did the owners of the Peninsula hotel, on Fifth Avenue at 55th Street, close the doors on Jan. 1 for a $45 million renovation of the turn-of-the-century building? According to Niklaus J. Leuenberger, the general manager, there is no good time to close down, so managers of the Honk Kong-based Peninsula Group decided to proceed with the project.
The hotel has been opening floor by floor this month and is expected to be fully in operation by Dec. 1.
"If the business is up, you don't want to close, but if the business is down, you don't want to invest," Mr. Leuenberger said. He said if the renovation was not performed, the property would deteriorate and possibly not be seen by customers as being in the top luxury category that Peninsula hotels aspire to.
"I told the owners that they can't afford to let the hotel run down," he said. "It wouldn't be a Peninsula."
He said he felt fortunate that the decision to renovate was made before economic problems started becoming obvious in Asian economies. "If we had waited until Asia got soft, the owners might have objected," he said. "In the long run, it was the right thing to do."
The bulk of the renovation focused on the 23-story hotel's 242 guest rooms and suites, with largely cosmetic changes to the restaurants and public spaces. Almost no change was made to the Beaux Arts exterior, which was given landmark status in 1992.
The building of what was known for a long time as the Gotham Hotel began in 1902, when that part of Fifth Avenue was converting to a residential from a commercial neighborhood. Despite its age, the building has a modern steel frame.
Although the stone facade, with its massive pillars and carved decorations, appears substantial enough to support the structure, it is actually hung from the steel framework. This structure allowed the renovators to move interior walls almost at will to reconfigure rooms, add 14 more suites by combining rooms and modernize the electrical and plumbing systems.
As befits a hotel whose room rates start at $535 a night ($455 with a corporate discount), a lot of attention was devoted to making guests comfortable and keeping them occupied. All the windows were replaced by windows with dual panes of different thickness. One pane is designed to shut out high-pitched sounds, the other to resist the deeper rumble of trucks and buses. Moreover, they can be opened.
By the bedside, there is an electronic control panel that regulates the room's temperature, lighting and radio and television. For safety, the panel operates on low voltage, with the 12-volt signals from the panel enabling a black box to operate the 110-volt lights and appliances.
For business travelers, there is a large desk with ports on the front to make it easy to plug in personal computers and high-capacity telephone lines to connect to the Internet. A fax machine is standard for exchanging documents and receiving messages. "The idea is that we don't send messages to the room, we fax them to the room," Mr. Leuenberger said.
The bathrooms were enlarged, both to make them more attractive and to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding wheelchair access. (The lobby facing 55th Street was expanded and two short elevators were added to bring people from the ground floor to mezzanine-level bar and restaurant, moving the rest of the hotel into compliance with the rules for the disabled.
Most rooms come with televisions in the bathroom and a speaker telephone that automatically shuts off the sound of the television when a call comes in. In the larger rooms, there are his and hers shower stalls, and everything in sight is faced in marble.
The hotel's suites range from $800 a night for the smallest units to $7,000 a night for the three-bedroom presidential suite.
Although the Peninsula aims for the top of New York's hotel market ("It's the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and us," Mr. Leuenberger said), the hotel industry in the city is busy at less lofty price levels. In recent weeks, Marriott International has officially opened three hotels in the city. Two are its Courtyard brand, one a new building on 40th Street between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas and the other in a converted office building on Third Avenue between 52d and 53d Streets.
The third, under the Marriott brand name, is part of the Renaissance Plaza development in Brooklyn, where it was the first new large-scale hotel to open in the borough in nearly 70 years when it started taking guests in July. The hotel includes 376 guest rooms, 27,000 square feet of meeting and convention space and an 18,000-square-foot ballroom, one of the largest in the city.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Denies That It Withheld Reports on Russian Corruption

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency said today that it had provided many reports on the corruption of senior Russian officials to the Clinton Administration.
The agency strongly denied that its analysts had censored themselves after concluding that senior Administration officials did not want evidence of corruption to obstruct doing business with the Russian leadership. 
 "We have published numerous pieces on corruption in the Russian Government over the past several years and up to the present," said a spokesman for the agency, Bill Harlow. "We do not withhold reports because they are inconvenient."
The statement was a response to an article on Monday in The New York Times.
Some C.I.A. officials, the article reported, said important Administration officials had been dismissive of intelligence reports about the corruption of Russian leaders.
The leaders, the analysts said, included former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and Anatoly B. Chubais, who was until recently considered by Administration officials to be a close and important counterpart in the field of economic reform.
The Central Intelligence Agency said today that its analysts had continued to provide reports on high-level Russian corruption, no matter how they are received.
Officials acknowledged frequent tensions between the agency and policy makers over the reporting.
The ability to remain independent in the face of political pressure is a sensitive issue for agency officials. Political pressure on the intelligence community is a recurring theme here.
The debate may have reached a high point in the battle in 1991 over the nomination of Robert Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence.
Mr. Gates, who had been deputy director of the C.I.A. in the Reagan Administration, came under fire at the Senate hearings because of allegations that he had sought to tailor intelligence reports on the Soviet Union to fit the Reagan Administration's conservative policies.
Mr. Gates was confirmed as director.

HEADLINE: Luba Elianoff, 96, Maker of Elegant Linens

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Luba Elianoff, a Latvian-born little old linen lady whose bearing was a bit too regal, whose spirit was a bit too fiery and whose embroideries were a bit too elegant to be called that to her face, died on Nov. 17 at her apartment on Riverside Drive. She was 96 and had much preferred to be called the Queen of Linens.
A full 50 inches tall in her prime, Mrs. Elianoff, who had shrunk somewhat by the time she retired at 86, may not have had the stature of a queen, but during the more than four decades she spent designing and manufacturing delicately embroidered towels, sheets, pillowcases and the like, no one ever accused her of not charging queenly prices. 
 Still, for a woman who catered to those who routinely paid several hundred dollars for a set of sheets, Mrs. Elianoff, who worked in a second-floor studio above what is now the Fairway fruit and vegetable market at Broadway and 75th Street, was remarkably democratic.
It was she, after all, who claimed to have been the first to persuade the Swiss embroidery industry, which handled her production, to work in polyester rather than cotton, a high-maintenance material better suited to the dwindling number of households whose staffs included maids and laundresses.
For all that, when it came to decorating sheets with borders of a range of intricate, imaginative designs, Mrs. Elianoff drew the line at substituting printed (shudder!) fabrics for stitching.
The daughter of a prosperous Latvian businessman, Mrs. Elianoff, a Riga native whose maiden name was Levitt, learned to sew as as child, but her girlhood heart belonged to the theater. At 16, when the Russian empire was in the throes of collapse, she escaped military patrols by hiding in a hay cart and made her way to Moscow, where she studied drama under Stanislavsky and others.
It was a sideline, as an English tutor, that changed her life twice over, leading her both to Martin Elianoff, a lawyer who became her husband, and to Armand Hammer, the American businessman who helped the couple immigrate to the Philippines in 1930.
In Manila, she began managing and later bought a chic fashion boutique catering to the city's American and European elite. When Mrs. Elianoff began supplementing its line of fine imports with embroideries made of an indigenous pineapple fiber known as pina, her customers were captivated by her designs. The Philippine Government was so delighted with her efforts to bolster the local economy that it awarded her a series of medals.
With war clouds looming (and many of her Western clients being evacuated) Mrs. Elianoff brought her daughter, Anna Lou, to the United States in March 1941.
After a brief reunion when the war was over, she and her husband separated but never divorced. He died in 1982.
After working in a series of Manhattan linen shops, Mrs. Elianoff soon struck out on her own, using a sewing machine in her Riverside Drive apartment to embroider satin lingerie and hosiery cases for sale in local stores.
It was not until full domestic textile production resumed in 1946 that Mrs. Elianoff expanded into sheets, towels, pillowcases and shower curtains, typically buying stock sheets at wholesale prices, replacing the standard border with lace and other elaborate embroidery and reselling them to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor at what seemed to some exorbitant prices.
As one store buyer once told her: "That's not a price. It's a telephone number."
Still, Mrs. Elianoff found such an enthusiastic market for her Luba Elianoff line of luxury linens that she soon had to move her business to her Broadway workroom, where a staff handled the sewing.
In time, demand for her elegant work grew so strong that about 200 stores carried her line, and she contracted out the manufacturing of borders to Swiss factories.
Partly because Mrs. Elianoff was such a perfectionist that she did most of her design work in Switzerland, where she worked closely with production specialists, and partly because her local production staff used a special flat seam that made the attached borders seem like a natural extension of the mass-produced sheet, she was widely recognized as one of the finest designers of decorative linens.
Always open to change, when Wamsutta began producing sheets in a variety of colors, Mrs. Elianoff responded enthusiastically, her once dainty designs blossoming into big, bold flowers and other colorful designs.
As an American citizen, Mrs. Elianoff began to see herself as more than the Queen of Linens. Recalling that as a teen-ager she had made a flag for a Zionist parade in Riga, she came to regard herself as the Betsy Ross of Zionism.
She is survived by her daughter, Anna Lou Aldrich of Manhattan, five granddaughters and two great-grandsons.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Walking on Air At Opening of Gaza Airport

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: RAFAH, Gaza, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Euphoric Palestinians celebrated the long-delayed opening of their international airport today as a parade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to a landing in the flatlands of Gaza.
With brass bands, bagpipes and grandiloquent speeches, Palestinian officials made it clear that they see the sleekly modern airport as the most concrete symbol yet of their fledgling sovereignty. The high emotion and pageantry today stood in stark contrast to the muted response to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank last week. 
 "This is my day of great joy as a Palestinian refugee," said Ahmad Abdel Rachman, the general secretary of the Palestinian Cabinet. "I am standing on Palestinian soil, and I have an airport, I have a flag, I have an airplane. This is our path to the independent Palestinian state."
A potential economic lifeline to the depressed Gaza Strip, the airport was completed more than a year ago, with about $60 million in grants from Egypt, Morocco and Spain and other European Union countries. But its fate became mired in the stalemated peace talks until the peace memorandum signed in Washington last month provided a breakthrough.
Israel authorized the airport's opening in that agreement, but it retains considerable control over security, flight schedules and routes. Israeli aviation officials, in fact, have described the Gaza airport as a new airport under Israel's jurisdiction.
As they do at some of the land crossings into Jordan, Israeli security agents will operate a kind of shadow document-checking system, in which Palestinian officials review passengers' documents, passing them behind a screen to Israelis. Israel retains the right to search passengers, luggage and the aircraft, although it agreed last month not to search Mr. Arafat's private plane.
The Gaza International Airport, with 400 employees, will open for regular business next week. Royal Air Maroc is expected to begin Gaza-Casablanca service. The Palestinian National Airline will fly to Amman, Cairo and Jidda with three planes: two Fokker 50's donated by the Netherlands, and a 20-year-old Boeing 727 given by Saudi Prince Walled bin Talal. There are 20 pilots, most with Egyptian flying certificates.
"It may look like a little airport to you, but to us, it's bigger than John F. Kennedy," said Nabil Shurafa, a travel agent in Gaza City.
The alabaster towers of the new airport rise from a particularly hardscrabble stretch of southern Gaza near the Egyptian border. Thousands of local residents pushed at its gates this morning, begging to be let into the closed ceremony, gaping at the elaborate, Moroccan-style architecture, and ducking with the whoosh of each landing plane.
For Mafa Barbakh, an elderly woman wrapped in black from head to toe, the moment was too important to experience from afar. Like many, she said she had never even seen a plane before. She wanted to be on the tarmac, to ululate and raise her hands to the heavens. She finally did, when the gates were opened and the Palestinians swarmed the grounds -- chanting, dancing, laying down prayer rugs and otherwise making it their own.
"I want to fly to Mecca," she said. "I hope God gives me this gift, to go up in the sky like a bird, on Palestinian wings. Hey, we have Palestinian passports now. I can travel with my Palestinian passport on a Palestinian plane. This is Palestine!"
At 8:30 A.M., with a punctuality remarkable for Gaza, the first of seven planes landed: a white EgyptAir Airbus from Cairo, disgorging Egyptian officials and celebrities. One, a comedian, Adel Imam, caused the entire flight attendant staff of the Palestine National Airline -- 18 women in navy pants suits and Muslim head scarves -- to jump up and down and squeal.
Aircraft carrying delegations from other principal donors to the project followed: the Jordanians, the Moroccans, the Spanish, the Dutch and, aboard an Israeli charter from Tel Aviv, some European Union officials. The bagpipes, a holdover from the days of the British Mandate, seemed a disconcerting greeting to many as they strode the red carpet past upturned bayonets on their way into the V.I.P. lounge to see Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
Last week, the airport was named Yasir Arafat International Airport by Mr. Arafat's aides, and signs were duly posted. But the Palestinian leader was not pleased. The signs were taken down, and the original entry banner restrung: Gaza International Airport, it said today.
The V.I.P. lounge, a lavish building with Moroccan mosaics, crystal chandeliers and a fountain, bears a gilded dome atop its roof, meant to echo the Dome of the Rock Mosque in Jerusalem. In a way that irked Israeli officials, Jerusalem was itself a constant theme as Palestinian officials got swept away by the moment.
"God willing, we will open the Jerusalem Airport next," Mr. Arafat said. "God willing, we will land soon at the Jerusalem Airport."
The fate of Jerusalem will be debated in the final-status peace talks, which began last week. The Israelis say it will remain undivided, but the Palestinians want to reclaim East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel in 1967, as the capital of their eventual state.
Last week, under the peace memorandum signed in Washington, the first of a three-phase Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank tripled the amount of territory under complete Palestinian control. Still, it was sparsely populated, rural land. The Palestinian response was quiet, and Mr. Arafat received only two calls of congratulations from world leaders: one from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the other from a Norwegian official.
Today, in contrast, a who's who of the Palestinian leadership, flanked by dignitaries from the Arab world and Europe, declared the airport's opening a milestone, while the Palestinian police danced with their rifles in the air. The officials said it would ease the claustrophobia of Gazans, who feel locked into their dusty strip of territory by Israeli border checkpoints most do not have permits to cross.
"These people in Gaza have been living in this ghetto since 1948," Mr. Abdel Rachman said to foreign reporters. "More than 60 to 70 percent have never left. Now with free access to the rest of the world, they will feel they're human, like all of you."
During the year-and-a-half delay before opening, the Palestinian airline operated on a limited basis out of El Arish in Egypt. Passengers traveled by bus across the border and often waited hours before departure. Most business travelers flew out of Cairo; those who imported goods relied on Israeli ports or the airport in Tel Aviv.
"Now I'll be able to travel like a regular businessman, on overnight trips," Sayeed el-Madhoun, who owns a floor-covering company, said while videotaping the ceremony. "And it'll make it easier and cheaper to bring materials in and out."
When the airport opens for commercial service next week, there will still be difficulties to resolve.
Some $15 million in donated equipment, including radar and high-tech air-traffic-control devices, has been held up in a dispute between Israel and the donor nations. Most of it has sat in the port of Ashdod for the last year. Now the Port Authority of Israel is demanding $650,000 in storage fees to release it.
And about $3 million in night-landing equipment donated by Germany has been held in Hamburg because the Germans fear similar difficulties with Israeli customs and security officials.
As a result, the airport will at first handle only daylight flights.
Fadda Jabr, a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, brushed aside those issues as mere "technical difficulties."
"Today is the concrete evidence of the success of the camp of peace," he said. "It is very good for peace, and very good for Arafat. He has been promising a promising day for the Palestinians. Now the ink of the agreement has turned into something we can see, we can touch and we can admire. Lovely, isn't it?"

HEADLINE: Security Council Hears Report on Iraq and Takes No Action

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, told the Security Council today that he was disappointed with Iraq's cooperation with resumed inspections, particularly the refusal to produce any documents that the inspectors requested.
The Council took no action beyond noting his report and agreeing to continue discussing the issue. 
 The meeting was described by diplomats as not confrontational, with no real challenges to Mr. Butler, as the Iraqis have demanded. He was asked by some Council members only to explain why the United Nations Special Commission, which monitors the weapons program, needed to see the documents.
The tension and crisis atmosphere of the last two weeks is gone from the Council, and there seems to be a general agreement by critics and supporters of Iraq that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq should have time to demonstrate amply how he intends to proceed before punishment or rewards are rendered.
"This is not a crisis," Shen Guofang of China said. "This is a problem."
Sergei Lavrov of Russia also took a low-key approach, diplomats said, describing the confrontation over documents as something that should be worked out between Mr. Butler and Iraq. Diplomats said, though, that Russia had blocked a British-drafted statement that would have made clear that Iraq's actions "did not constitute full cooperation" with the inspectors.
In Washington officials sought to portray firm resolve in dealing with Iraq a day after having signaled a new policy of patience. Officials used somewhat tougher language than they did on Monday in addressing the refusal on documents that relate to suspected weapons sites.
"I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and requests of the Unscom inspectors," Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said at a news session with Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping of Germany. "So we will continue to follow it. But much depends upon the level and degree of cooperation on the part of the Iraqis."
A spokesman for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy, said Washington was not satisfied with Iraq since it agreed 10 days ago to resume unfettered access.
At the United Nations this morning the Security Council voted, over Iraqi objections, to renew for an additional six months the program under which limited quantities of oil are sold to pay for civilians. The unanimous vote without a debate was taken after several delegations, led by Russia, had proposed changes to the plan at the behest of Iraq.
The changes received no support, diplomats said, because the plan is demonstrating some success at improving conditions in Iraq. Childhood malnutrition has, for example, leveled off, officials say, and more than $444 million in medicines have been imported in two years.
"These delegations dropped their requests in favor of a very quick consensus," the chairman of the Council's Iraq sanctions committee, Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, said. "This is very positive. It shows the awareness of the humanitarian impact of this operation."
Iraq has not said whether it will continue in the program, however. It is left to the Iraqis to decide in consultation with the United Nations how the money will be allocated, and the Iraqi proposals have to be reviewed in New York before goods are bought.
In recent months Iraq has expanded its requests from basic goods like food and medicines to items like telephone equipment and computers for schools. Under the program Iraq has built up or renewed commercial ties with a range of nations.
Last week Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf wrote to the Council, asking that the current six-month phase be extended only an additional two months because Iraq was incapable of producing the $5.2 billion in oil now allowed to be sold every 180 days.
Iraqi officials would also like a shorter renewal period, because they are pressing to have sanctions lifted so that oil can be sold freely, making the program irrelevant.
They complain that the United States and Britain are holding up approval of imported equipment and chemical supplies that independent experts said Iraq needed to upgrade its oil fields and pipelines. The first shipment, barrels of chemical agents to clean crude oil, did not begin to arrive in Iraq until this week.
United Nations officials say much of the reason that Iraq has been unable to meet the target stems not as much from missing parts and supplies as from the fall in oil prices.
The United Nations takes nearly one-third off the top of earnings under the program for a compensation fund that benefits victims of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait and for protected Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. The program also pays the expenses of the United Nations Special Commission.
In the midst of what could be drawn-out negotiations on several fronts with Iraq officials in Baghdad confirmed today that the Iraqi representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, would leave at the end of the year and that his replacement would be his deputy, Saeed Hasan, an economist educated at the Sorbonne.
Mr. Hamdoon, the Ambassador to Washington in the 1980's who is widely considered to have been an effective voice for Iraq there and in New York since 1992, said in an interview that he expected to return to a post in the Foreign Ministry.

HEADLINE: Damage in Central America Stirs Debate on Immigrants

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch in Central America has kicked up a political and policy storm over the Clinton Administration's policy toward illegal immigrants and refugees from that region.
This month the Immigration and Naturalization Service said that because of the devastation left by the hurricane, people from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua who are in the United States illegally and are detained by the I.N.S. will not face deportation proceedings until Jan. 7, 1999. 
 "That was the most tangible, concrete, rapid action that we could take to help these governments cope with this disaster," said Andrew Lluberes, an I.N.S. spokesman. "The last thing that they needed was to have people deported back to their countries."
The Administration is also considering granting temporary protective status to refugees and illegal aliens from the four Central American nations that bore the brunt of the storm: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. That designation would allow such people to avoid deportation and work legally in the United States.
Leaders of immigrant rights organizations also called upon the Justice Department today to ease the standards under which some refugees and undocumented workers who arrived in the United States from El Salvador or Guatemala before fall 1990 can avoid being deported altogether.
"This is absolutely the wrong time to begin a massive deportation to this region," said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization.
The seemingly mixed message on the issue of Central American immigrants puts policy makers in a quandary: obeying the law regarding illegal immigrants and deporting people to the devastated economies of Central America could exacerbate a terrible situation there.
"There is a double-edged problem here for those countries with the immigrants," Hillary Rodham Clinton said today at a briefing on her trip to the region. "One is, they cannot accommodate people at this time. There's literally nowhere for people to live or be put. They also would collapse completely, in some cases, without the funds coming in from the people who are working and sending, in some cases, in at least one of the countries, up to $1 billion a year, which is a huge part of their gross domestic product."
Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, chairman of the House subcommittee on immigration, said he expected that refugees from Honduras, which sustained the most damage and loss of life, to be given temporary protected status. But, Mr. Smith said, the Administration should be careful not to provoke a rush of illegal immigration of Central Americans seeking to escape the chaos following the hurricane.
"The worst thing we can do is precipitate an immigration emergency by signaling that individuals currently in Central America should abandon their countries in their countries' time of greatest need," said Mr. Smith, the leading Congressional advocate of reduced immigration.
At the moment, the policy toward Central American refugees is being played out over regulations governing how a group of about 260,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans can apply to become permanent residents. The group is part of a wave of refugees who fled as their countries became mired in civil wars in the 1980's.
Immigrant rights groups have long accused the Federal Government of a double standard, saying these refugees were deported because Washington supported their governments while others from countries with Communist governments, like Cuba and Nicaragua, were accepted.
Last year, Congress passed legislation that set up two separate procedures. People from Cuba and Nicaragua who arrived in the United States before December 1995 were automatically given amnesty from deportation. Salvadorans and Guatemalans, and some Eastern Europeans, have to prove to immigration authorities that they are of sound moral character and that deporting them would cause them extreme hardship.
Immigration rights advocates today complained that the new regulations do not offer a blanket determination that anyone deported to Central America would automatically suffer extreme hardship because of the hurricane.
"After Mitch, it is hard to believe that the Administration proposes that each individual prove that he will suffer extreme hardship," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant rights group.
Mr. Lluberes said hearing officers would be trained on the impact of the hurricane, although the law required that hardship findings must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

HEADLINE: New Data Show That Economy Remains Strong

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The latest snapshot of the United States economy showed yesterday that the long-predicted slowdown is still more forecast than fact.
The economy performed better during the summer than had been originally reported and consumer confidence bounced back this fall, according to a fresh batch of data released yesterday. Along with other signs of buoyancy -- in jobs, retail sales and housing -- the new data suggest that growth remains surprisingly solid. 
 Despite financial turmoil abroad and tremblings at home, the nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the third quarter, revised upward from an initial estimate of 3.3 percent, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The growth did not reflect goods piling up in warehouses but stronger demand in most parts of the economy. Inflation, meanwhile, was less than 1 percent.
Consumer confidence, as measured by an index by the Conference Board, a private research group in New York, has risen this month after four consecutive declines that brought it to an 18-month low in October.
Armed with the latest data, forecasters are saying that growth in the current quarter could run as high as 3 percent but cool sometime in the new year. "The slowdown turns out to be a 1999 story rather than a 1998 story," said Nick Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank.
Barring a bolt from the blue, the current economic expansion should by January overtake the 92-month boom experienced during the Reagan Administration and close in on the Kennedy-Johnson expansion, the longest ever.
"We're not in familiar forecasting territory," William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. He pointed to the three interest rate cuts made by the Federal Reserve in the last two months. "We don't usually think of an economy with a 4.6 percent unemployment rate that's growing at a rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent as requiring three Fed rate cuts."
All this does not mean that the economy is not suffering some visible strains that presage slower growth in 1999.
Despite healthy growth in sales, American industry is suffering a profit squeeze. Excess capacity at home and intense competition from abroad are making it nearly impossible for manufacturers to pass along rising labor and other costs to customers. The most accurate and broadest measure of corporate profits rose only marginally this summer compared with results from the spring, the Commerce Department said yesterday, and it is down 2 percent compared with figures from the quarter a year earlier.
Despite optimistic forecasts from analysts, few economists expect the corporate-profit picture to brighten much, though the recent surge in the stock market's main gauges indicates that investors think the companies in those indexes will do better than the average business.
What is more, the cash flow that corporations had for retooling and expansion was flat in the third quarter, explaining why spending on plants and equipment -- which was rising at double-digit percentile rates in the first half of the year -- has also stopped growing. And while shipments of business equipment jumped sixth-tenths of a percent last month, orders that prefigure spending a few months down the road dropped 1.7 percent after rising 1.3 percent in September. That probably reflected Asia's woes and those of American producers.
But businesses might have reined in new investment anyway. Another report released yesterday, concerning revised Federal Reserve data on industrial capacity and production going back to 1992, shows that capacity growth has been phenomenal in key industries. In the computer and office equipment business, for example, production capacity soared 58 percent in the last year alone.
A reduction in capital spending by itself does not necessarily indicate slower growth. Half of the equipment American businesses buy comes from abroad -- thus less capital spending means fewer imports, a smaller trade gap and more domestic production than would otherwise be the case. Indeed, imports as a whole rose less than initially reported this summer, at a 1.3 percent annual rate compared with 3.4 percent, while exports also fell less than first reported.
Manufacturing, of course, is the sector where the economy has been weak, though not as weak as previously thought, according to the Fed. In the last two years, industrial output has grown nearly a percentage point more than originally reported. Still, growth has fallen off sharply: only 1.9 percent this year compared with 6.6 percent last year. And forward-looking indicators, like the monthly reports by purchasing managers, suggest that the weakness in manufacturing is deepening.
Manufacturing, though, is not the whole story. American households, whose purchases of consumer goods and services and new homes account for almost three-fourths of the nation's gross domestic product, have been living up to their reputation as big spenders. Spending on goods and services rose at an annual rate of more than 4.1 percent in the third quarter. That is slower than the more than 6 percent annual rate of the first half, but not much.
Meanwhile, home buying in the quarter jumped at an annual rate of 8.6 percent. Low interest rates, fatter household balance sheets and healthy income gains combined with a surge of consumer confidence to keep home and car sales near record highs.
Consumers cannot keep spending faster than they earn, of course. During the last year, the percentage by which consumption has outpaced income has risen to 4.7 percent from 3.2 percent. As a result, saving out of current income has slipped to practically zero. The stock market's rebound has repaired some of the damage to household balance sheets, but few economists expect that stock market gains from here on can provide fuel for big spending gains.
What is more, Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs noted, the impact of improved consumer spirits may be less than it appears. The Conference Board's November reading shows that confidence has returned to the high levels it reached in September. What has not rebounded nearly as much is consumers' assessment of job-market conditions. Just 40.6 percent rated jobs as "plentiful" this month, compared with 45.2 percent in September.

HEADLINE: Building A Business Behind The Screen;
America Online's E-Commerce Goals

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt on line and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores.
Now, the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits. 
 Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy the Netscape Communications Corporation is America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind the computer screen to help companies open and operate on-line stores.
Netscape has already created software that made it a player in providing support for what is already known as electronic commerce. But America Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software, consulting and services for on-line merchants.
"Most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the E-commerce space," Robert Pittman, America Online's president, said in a news conference yesterday. "We see a major business in offering them an end-to-end solution."
The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range from graphic design to the turnkey operation of entire on-line stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market for electronic commerce services and software should top $35 billion.
"E-commerce services are the silver bullet that will enable companies to be able to take advantage of the true business opportunities on the Web," said Traci Gere, an analyst at the International Data Corporation. "The market is growing very rapidly, but it is very fragmented."
Analysts say the leader today in E-commerce services is I.B.M., which has a full line of offerings from sophisticated software products to hand-holding consulting.
Other competitors include well-known information technology consulting companies like Andersen Consulting, the spinoff from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which runs computer systems for big companies, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting and consulting separately but under one umbrella. Software companies like Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with little or no consulting to help customers use them.
There are also plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to provide electronic commerce services. Some, like Agency.com and Organic Online, started basically as advertising and design firms. Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming and consulting. In fact, those two strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group.
America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of about 15 million customers with Netscape software, plus hardware from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's venture into electronic commerce engineering.
"This is the first time anyone has put a true end-to-end solution that starts with the silicon and ends with the audience," said Barry Schuler, America Online's president for interactive services. "We start with Sun's line of servers, then the commerce tools to build a store, the support services to process orders and then a deal for on-line real estate that can drive the traffic."
Despite the advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that America Online faces a variety of problems in its new quest.
Chief among them is whether it can appear to have the consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers demand.
"AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when it comes to business-quality software," said Robert Chatham, a senior analyst with Forrester Research.
Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not enhance its credibility, Mr. Chatham said. "America Online doesn't look like a homogenous vendor," he added. "It looks like customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL, Netscape and Sun."
Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand.
"Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently for a large number of customers have not been able to offer customized one-to-one relationships," she said.
Mr. Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the E-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising on line.
"We are finding people who are expert in running bricks-and-mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure," he said. "They have an on-line store, but their square footage is too small."
Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been rewriting the software that lets companies open on-line stores to be based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language used only on America Online. This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's on-line store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet.
Similarly, it has developed a service that lets users create a file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they can make on-line purchases without retyping all that information each time. American Online is working to offer it -- for a fee -- to stores on the broader Internet.
There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to help companies decide whether and how to sell on line without hurting their traditional sale in stores. There are all sorts of computer systems to be developed, ranging from the on-line stores themselves to connecting those sites to a company's existing inventory and accounting systems.
There are creative services that include graphic design, media buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional efforts. And there are operational services that involve actually maintaining the big servers that users connect to when they use the on-line stores that display catalogues, take orders and process payments.
America Online, Mr. Schuler said, will emphasize services that relate to marketing rather than back-office functions. "We will consult on how to merchandize and sell on line," he said. "We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle."
Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware. "The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best possible solution for their business," said Robert Gett, the chief executive of Viant. "If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their answer is a bit tainted."
Netscape does have an expanding force of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most competitive, Mr. Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts projects rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out a full-fledged strategy on the Web.
"They say, 'Who knows our software better than Netscape?' " Mr. Gett said. "We help customers decide which platform is best for them."
But America Online argues that the combined might of it, Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs. "We always believed that commerce, that is buying goods and services, is the huge revenue stream of the future," Mr. Schuler said. "We have only seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg."

HEADLINE: Oil Pipeline Agreed On for Caspian Area

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Russia, Kazakhstan and major oil companies today agreed to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to link the oil-rich Caspian Sea region with the Black Sea.
The project is scheduled to be completed in 2001 and would be the first major new pipeline in the region. It would connect the Tengiz oilfield to a Russian port. 
 While the move is an important step in tapping the oil resources of the Caspian, it is also part of the Russian Government's struggle to regain credibility with foreign businessmen.
With Russia in the grips of a financial crisis, foreign investors have been fleeing in droves. The nation's banking system is virtually paralyzed. The Kremlin has served notice that it will seek to renegotiate its foreign debt. Major Western oil companies have also scaled back their operations in Russia by cutting back staff and selling stakes in joint ventures.
Today's accord is intended to signal that Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov's left-leaning team is still capable of doing business with an increasingly skeptical West. It will also bring billions of dollars in tax revenue to Russia's cash-starved Government.
But there is plenty of work needed to turn today's accord into a reality.
"It is still a long way to go," warned Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., a unit of the Chevron Corporation. "We have not built the pipeline yet."
The Tengiz pipeline has a tangled history. It has been under discussion for the better part of a decade. At stake were huge profits for American oil companies, greater political independence from Moscow for Kazakhstan and revenue for Moscow.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan agreed that the pipeline should be built in 1996. But it took another two years to iron out the details.
It is hardly the only pipeline project being planned. The United States and Turkey are also pressing the construction of a separate pipeline from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
Turkey has even said that it may try to fight competition from the new Tengiz pipeline by reducing tanker traffic through the Bosporus, the strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, and raising transit fees.
Still, today's accord was an important breakthrough. While Chevron and other oil companies are investing $20 billion to develop the Tengiz field, transportation has been a major problem.
Much of the crude is now shipped by train. The new plan is to ship it along a 900-mile pipeline to the Russian port of Novorossiysk. There, it will be loaded on ships and sold to the West.
The goal is to load the first ship before July 1999. The capacity of the pipeline will be 67 million tons a year, but the plan is to reach a level of 28 million tons a year before the end of 1999.
"The Tengiz oilfield may be fully developed only after this pipeline has been built," Mr. Primakov said. "Many oil companies think this oil region is even richer than the Persian Gulf, although I personally doubt this."
Building the pipeline will cost some $2.3 billion. More than $854 million is to be spent next year. But Russia will ultimately earn as much as $23 billion in tax revenue from the project.
Under the agreement, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium will oversee the project. Russia has a 24 percent share of the consortium; Kazakhstan, 19 percent, and the Persian Gulf nation of Oman, 7 percent. Other shares are held by oil companies, led by Chevron, which has 15 percent, and also including a venture of Lukoil and ARCO, 12.5 percent; Royal Dutch/Shell Group and RAO Rosneft, a Russian oil company, 7.5 percent; ENI S.p.A. of Italy, 2 percent; BG P.L.C. of Britain, 2 percent, and the Oryx Energy Company of Dallas, 1.75 percent.

RUSSIA: LIMITED AID FOR BANKS -- Russia's Central Bank will earmark no more than $1.7 billion to refloat several dozen banks teetering on the brink of collapse, said the Central Bank's deputy chairman, Andrei Kozlov. Government securities would be used to aid regional and large retail banks deemed vital, he said, but hundreds of banks would go bankrupt. (Agence France-Presse) 

SPAIN: RIGHTS INVESTIGATIONS MERGED -- A panel of 11 senior judges upheld the merger of two separate investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina under former military rule, putting both under the control of Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish magistrate who issued the arrest warrant for the former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, on charges of genocide. Britain's highest court rules today on whether Mr. Pinochet, who is in British custody, deserves immunity from prosecution. (NYT)
 
FRANCE: TERRORIST ENDS HUNGER STRIKE -- The international terrorist known as Carlos, left, ended a 20-day hunger strike in a French prison where he is serving a life sentence for murder, according to one of his lawyers. Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was protesting solitary confinement and alleged harassment by his guards, but began eating again after pleas from his family and friends. Craig Whitney (NYT)
 
GERMANY: WASTE IN THE MILITARY -- The German Army squandered nearly $300 million on fork-lift trucks that turned out to be useless because the operators could not see where they were going. The trucks were also too wide to get into army storehouses, the Federal Court of Audit said in a report that accused Government agencies of wasting billions of dollars a year. (Reuters)
 
NETHERLANDS: HEROIN EXPERIMENT EXTENDED -- The Dutch Health Ministry said it would extend an experiment to distribute free heroin to hard-core drug addicts after a three-month pilot scheme showed no serious, undesired side-effects. However, some heroin users complained about the quality of the heroin offered. (Reuters)
 
ITALY: PRESSING GERMANY TO EXTRADITE KURD -- Italy put pressure on Germany to ask for the extradition of a Kurd leader wanted in Turkey. Italy has refused to extradite him to Turkey, where he would face the death penalty. But it is under heavy criticism from the Turks. The rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who is leading a rebellion for autonomy from Turkey, arrived in Rome on Nov. 12. Germany has two arrest warrants for the rebel chief, but says it has no plans to pursue extradition. (AP)

NORTH KOREA: WARNING TO THE U.S. -- North Korea warned the United States that Washington was jeopardizing a 1994 nuclear accord by insisting on inspections of a suspect underground site spotted by intelligence satellites. Under the agreement, the North agreed to freeze its nuclear program in return for two light-water reactors and fuel oil as well as improved ties with Washington. (Agence France-Presse)
 
CAMBODIA: FOOD SHORTAGES -- Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are approaching levels comparable to those in famine-struck North Korea, a United Nations World Food Program representative said. Ken Davies, the agency's country director, said that a faltering economy combined with weak health care and education is causing malnutrition in children. (AP)
 
MYANMAR: U.N. INVESTIGATOR BLOCKED -- The United Nations human rights investigator for Myanmar, Rajsoomer Lallah, has again been denied permission to visit by the military government, but will meet displaced Myanmar minorities in Thailand this week, a United Nations spokesman said. (Reuters)

LEBANON: A SMOOTH TRANSITION -- Emile Lahoud, the former army commander, was sworn in as President in the first smooth transition for a peaceful Lebanon in nearly three decades. He pledged to hold politicians accountable and punish thieves in a public service plagued by corruption and cronyism. (AP)
 
ISRAEL: MOSSAD OFFICIAL RESIGNS -- The operations chief of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus, the daily Haaretz newspaper reported. It was the Mossad's third botched spy mission in a year. (AP)
 
IRAN: RUSSIA BUILDS NUCLEAR PLANT -- Russia agreed to finish an Iranian nuclear plant in the southern port of Bushehr and to study the possibility of building a second one, Iranian radio reported. The United States and Israel have objected to the plant, saying it could be used to develop nuclear weapons. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: RUGBY RACISM RULING APPEALED -- Lawyers for President Nelson Mandela appealed a court ruling that quashed a Government investigation of racism and mismanagement in rugby, a sport once heralded as a way of uniting South Africa's races. The predominantly white South African Rugby Union had gone to court to block the investigation, dragging Mr. Mandela to the witness stand in what many blacks felt was an attempt humiliate him. (AP)

MEXICO: HIGHER WAGES SOUGHT -- Mexico's two most important labor federations said they would join forces to press for a 22 percent wage increase.

The Government last week raised gasoline prices by 15 percent and increased taxes. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: AIR FORCE APOLOGIZES -- Two air force colonels, both chiefs of intelligence units, were dismissed for spying on 10 Argentine journalists who were reporting about airport security and privatization of airport installations.

DEERE SAYS DROP IN DEMAND WILL CUT INTO '99 EARNINGS

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
Deere & Company, North America's largest farm equipment maker, warned yesterday that a bigger drop in demand than previously expected would cause an earnings decline in its 1999 fiscal year. "In this environment, the previously stated goal of reporting flat earnings per share in 1999 is not achievable," Deere said. The company, which is based in Moline, Ill., said its worldwide physical sales volume, which is the total value of equipment production adjusted for inflation and currency effects, would be down 13 percent to 15 percent for the year. Deere also reported that net income for the fourth quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, was $162 million, or 71 cents a diluted share, compared with $211 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier.

DOW JONES TO DISMISS 118 WORKERS TO REDUCE COSTS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Dow Jones & Company said yesterday that it would cut costs by dismissing 118 employees, closing offices and using an outside company to handle subscription telemarketing for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's. The move is part of a plan to stem rising expenses as Dow Jones faces an uncertain advertising market. The New York-based publisher said it expected to take an after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings of about $2 million, or 2 cents a share, mostly for severance and closing offices. The job cuts, affecting about 1.4 percent of Dow Jones's work force, will be made at nine sites in eight states. Dow Jones shares fell 81.25 cents, to $49.125.

A Village Evolving Searches Its Soul

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: TUXEDO, N.Y.

 BODY:
IT is difficult to reconcile the watercolor renderings of pert Dutch-roofed houses and sprawling Tudor apartment complexes with the rocky forest that rings the very private enclave of Tuxedo Park. But if developers and town officials have their way -- and it appears they are close -- Tuxedo, with its population of 3,000, may quadruple in size over the next decade or two. Bulldozers and blasting caps will arrive in the next few years, and this sleepy town -- with its scattering of vacant shop fronts -- will get the development it has dreamed of and dreaded for the last 20 years.
In Tuxedo, 40 miles northwest of Manhattan, two private developers are planning several thousand units of housing, including shingle-style cottages by the architect Robert A. M. Stern. The town and its inhabitants -- those of the gated Tuxedo Park, as well as homeowners of more modest means in the rest of the township -- are struggling to bring order to the new subdivisions, which they worry will clog the main route through town, overcrowd schools and overburden the sewers. But few of the townspeople vow to stop the developers cold. 
 "It's their land," said Mary Yrizarry, chairwoman of the Tuxedo Conservation and Taxpayers Association, alluding to the developers of both Tuxedo Reserve (a partnership that includes the Related Companies in Manhattan) and the corporation known as Sterling Forest L.L.C. Together, they own about 4,500 bucolic acres. Their formal applications to build are stacked in the basement of the Tuxedo town hall.
"Hey, people who own property have certain rights," said Susan Goodfellow, the Mayor of Tuxedo Park, an incorporated village of 325 families within the larger township of Tuxedo. "You work with them."
That is what Tuxedo is trying to do. By Dec. 22, the town will produce its latest master plan for growth. Kenneth R. Magar, the Town Supervisor, said the plan will call for a population increase to "between 10,000 and 12,000 people." While the possible quadrupling of population "might shock some people," Ms. Goodfellow said, "it's better than the 28,000" called for in an earlier master plan.
The proposed developments, including 1,620 units planned for Sterling Forest, about three miles north of the town center, show clustered housing -- around a new village green in the Stern version, around two golf courses in the other -- leaving broad swaths of undeveloped land. While many residents praise the concept of small lots near town greens, now endorsed by a national planning movement known as New Urbanism, they want the developers to pay for whatever problems they cause. The Tuxedo Reserve developers say they will "mitigate" -- developer-speak for pay to make amends -- any damage, but haven't always specified how.
Ms. Yrizarry commended the developers' pledge to protect "the most sensitive area -- a beautiful little lake in a protected valley." But there is the question of the steep slopes. "I don't see how they can help blasting," she said. Town officials agree.
The urge to develop around enclaves like Tuxedo Park -- one of the country's first subdivisions when it was conceived in 1886 as a retreat for wealthy deer hunters -- is part of a trend to graft development onto towns, rather than around suburban shopping centers. After years of building subdivisions on cheap land in the middle of nowhere, or around a vast mall, developers have finally got the message: build a better village (near an existing village with cachet), and people will flock to it.
Since Forest Hills Gardens was created in Queens in 1915 as working-class housing and was promptly snapped up by wealthy homeowners, Americans have shown a yearning for stucco-and-half-timbered village life -- especially next door to a railroad station. Their wishes were largely ignored for decades.
Enter Mr. Stern, master of nostalgic villas and shingled bungalows.
An earlier version of the Tuxedo Reserve development, which called for 2,400 units, received a preliminary approval from the town in 1991. But this year, a newly elected town board demanded far fewer apartments and town houses -- and fewer units overall.
The developers responded last year by bringing in Mr. Stern and lowering the density to 1,747 units, while increasing open space from 66 to 77 percent. There are plans to donate land for a school, to build housing for the elderly and to sponsor small-town retailing. (One cheerful rendering shows a butcher shop and a store selling cider, across from a cafe.) Mr. Stern hopes his plan will relieve what he calls "a general sense of pessimism" in the town.
No one questions that for a decade the town has stopped growing. The pharmacy moved out five years ago; the hospital folded in 1995. An antiques shop moved out last week.
This week, Mr. Magar said the Tuxedo Reserve developers had agreed to lower the number of units to 1,383. If they reduced that number to 1,300, the Town Supervisor said, he would endorse the plan, and he said an informal poll of the town board showed that it would pass.
The other developer in the wings, Sterling Forest L.L.C., plans to build its 1,620 housing units farther away from the center of Tuxedo, on 2,250 acres held back from 15,800 acres of Sterling Forest that were deeded to New York State in February. But the Sterling Forest development, for those older than 55, is less controversial. "Housing for older people is perceived to be tax-positive: they don't have kids in the schools, and they don't use up a lot of town services, like police," Mr. Magar said.
In his Tuxedo Reserve plan, Mr. Stern, now the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, has created different-size lots with $140,000 two-bedroom apartments and $700,000 "estate size" homes. The designs would be regulated by guidelines issued by the developers.
After reviewing the Tuxedo Reserve brochures and press releases, Tony Hiss, whose book "The Experience of Place" explores the ways communities are coping with urban sprawl, said the developers' stated goals -- to bring jobs and businesses, to increase the tax base and to improve the quality of life -- "generated a lot of questions."
Although the developers have increased the percentage of open space, Mr. Hiss called the new figure "really quite low." In Carmel, Calif., he said, a new planned development on land-grant property preserves 90 percent of the open space.
"I would ask whether there is a permanent fund to care for the forest and wildlife," he said. "How will the developers mitigate the impact on traffic? If the new town does attract further development, what would be its effect? And if it will attract new jobs, will they be permanent?"
The developers argue that their revision -- not yet public but summarized for this reporter -- addresses many of these concerns and that others -- like what to do about traffic -- are still to be worked out. They term the percentage of open space high. "In most master-planned communities, it's the opposite -- two-thirds to three-quarters is developed," said Glen M. Vetromile, who is managing the project for the Related Companies. The people of Tuxedo, he added, "are doing a lot of soul-searching right now about what they want to be."
They will continue to search. A hearing on the new plan is expected in February, Mr. Magar said. Construction, which could start late next year, will more likely begin in 2000, he said.
Meanwhile, the groups plan to keep monitoring the projects.
"We won't give up," Ms. Yrizarry vowed, "until the last road goes in and the last house is put up."

HEADLINE: MacArthur Airport Grows Along With Low-Cost Domestic Flights

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
MacArthur Airport at Islip on Long Island says it is still negotiating with Southwest Airlines, which was reported earlier this month to be planning nonstop service from the airport by early spring. Regardless of the outcome, the 33-year-old airport is busy gussying itself up with a $13 million renovation plan scheduled for completion next August.
The renovations will add 300 additional parking spaces, for a total of 1,300, and will almost double the size of the terminal. Security screening will be moved from the rear to the middle of the terminal, the two restaurants will be relocated, and there will be new ticketing and baggage claim areas. 
 The cost of the improvements and expansion will be borne by the $3 tax on departing passengers, according to Trish Pasciutti, a spokeswoman for the Town of Islip.
Nor are the improvements necessarily related to the negotiations with Southwest. "The terminal was designed to accommodate 500,000 passengers," Ms. Pasciutti said, "and last year the airport serviced over 1 million."
If the past is a guide, Southwest, which is based in Dallas, will not just take passengers from rival airlines; its low fares may actually entice more people to fly -- a cause and effect that is well understood by economists, and which in aviation circles goes by the name of "the Southwest effect."
Named for Douglas MacArthur, the five-star general, MacArthur Airport is not widely known beyond Long Island. But it averaged more than 60 daily departures and arrivals last year and is now served by seven airlines.
US Airways Express has the most departures, including flights to Philadelphia, Albany, Boston, Washington, Baltimore-Washington airport in Maryland, Providence, Syracuse, and the Florida cities of Fort Myers, Tampa and West Palm Beach. Spirit Airlines, based in Michigan, which also flies from Islip to Fort Myers, Tampa and West Palm Beach, is the newest airline at MacArthur Airport, having begun service there on Nov. 12.
American Airlines has daily service from MacArthur Airport to Chicago. Business Express, a Delta regional carrier, flies to and from Boston. ComAir, another Delta partner, flies to and from Cincinnati, and Delta Express, also a low-fare carrier, flies to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Sunjet International, another low-fare airline, also flies to Fort Lauderdale from Islip. Despite the "International" designation in Sunjet's name, it does not have any international flights from MacArthur -- nor do any airlines that service MacArthur Airport. And the early word from Dallas is that Southwest won't have any international flights either.

The Scene Shifts: Enter Elgar

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 25

 BODY:
When a flurry of activity surrounding, say, Beethoven falls unbidden from the sky, you can chalk it up to the law of averages. But Elgar?
As much as the composer is revered in his native England and, at least on commencement day, around the world, he seldom gets much attention in the United States. Yet for whatever reason, an Elgar season has descended on the Northeast, the first signs having appeared here in recent days with the American premiere of the composer's unfinished Third Symphony in an "elaboration" by the English composer Anthony Payne, presented by Andrew Davis and the Philadelphia Orchestra. 
 In December, Elgar's masterly Cello Concerto will bid for "Rach 3" status through its use in the film "Hilary and Jackie," based on the life of the English cellist Jacqueline du Pre and her sister. In January, Lincoln Center is to present a weeklong festival, "The Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar," centering on performances by Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra.
Those programs include the "Enigma Variations" and the First Symphony but oddly not the hot Third, although Colin Davis and the orchestra just played it in London, today. Leonard Slatkin and the National Symphony Orchestra, it turns out, hold the rights to the New York premiere and are to present it in March at Carnegie Hall.
Americans vying for access to Elgar? The composer has many admirers here (including this listener), and as many detractors, who find his pomp and circumstance stuffy and contrived. Two symphonies, some would argue, are more than enough.
Elgar himself was of two minds about the sketches for the Third. Three months before his death, in 1934, he said the symphony was "all bits and pieces." He went on: "No one would understand. . . . No one must tinker with it. I think you had better burn it."
Yet Mr. Payne, musing on some of the sketches published in W. H. Reed's "Elgar as I Knew Him" found a way into the work, and any listener kindly disposed toward Elgar must be grateful, if only for the opportunity to hear the gorgeous second theme in the first movement, quintessentially Elgarian in its sinuousness and noble sentiment. (The symphony can be heard in an NMC recording by Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony, who gave the work's premiere in February.)
The first movement as a whole, in fact, worked well at the performance on Tuesday evening, though its developmental material, its "elaboration," in Mr. Payne's word, is largely his. In a valuable demonstration beforehand, Mr. Davis and the Philadelphia Orchestra indicated just how scrappy the original materials were, playing fragments large and small before showing what Mr. Payne had made of them.
The other movements worked less well, though perhaps not for lack of genuine Elgar. In the Adagio and the finale, particularly, the materials themselves often proved uncompelling even before Mr. Payne spun them out in seemingly endless repetitions and sequences. In his Cello Concerto, of 1919, Elgar learned economy, a lesson not reflected in this tortuous venture, born in 1932.
The work will undoubtedly sink in a few years, to join curiosities like the Beethoven and Schubert 10th Symphonies. Still, this was a worthy offering, well executed by Mr. Davis and the orchestra, especially Roberto Diaz, in the viola solos.
Another unfinished symphony, unelaborated, the Schubert B minor, filled out the program in a decent rendering. It is hard to judge in detail any performance in the muffled acoustics of the Academy of Music, deadly for symphonic music. Happily, ground was recently broken for the orchestra's new home.

HEADLINE: Centrist Ruler, Under Fire, Is Voted Out In Turkey

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competing pressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military, fell today when it lost a confidence vote.
The 314-to-214 vote came after Mr. Yilmaz was implicated in a corruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buy a state-owned bank. He has denied all the accusations. 
 President Suleyman Demirel is expected to ask Mr. Yilmaz to stay on as Prime Minister until an interim Government can be formed to run the country until an election in April. But with Turkey's center-right and center-left parties divided by bitter rivalries, there seems to be little prospect that a stable Government will emerge from the election.
As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate political power. Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwark against religious fundamentalism. Critics, however, say the military's political role restricts the growth of democracy.
After two years of revelations about ties between criminals and successive Governments, many Turks have become deeply cynical, and some feel that supporting the Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust. But the commanders may not allow the party to take power even if it wins the election.
Mr. Yilmaz had sought to ease military-backed restrictions on Islamic symbols, which he evidently believed risked creating a political backlash. He urged the military to stop insisting that women studying at universities be forbidden to wear head scarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down. Similar conflicts are likely to afflict the next Government.
President Demirel could name an Interim Prime Minister within a few days. Leading candidates include Hikmet Cetin, the Speaker of Parliament, and the former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
During his term of office, Mr. Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey's inflation rate down from nearly 100 percent to about 77 percent. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on an economic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York, but were canceled today. Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister who was to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in the corruption scandal.
Human rights violations continued during Mr. Yilmaz's term, but apparently decreased steadily. Amnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curb abuses.
Mr. Yilmaz will be remembered as the Prime Minister on whose watch the country's most-wanted fugitive was captured. The fugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel Kurdish army, is in custody in Italy.
Although Mr. Yilmaz is perceived as pro-Western, Turkey's relations with Europe deteriorated during his term. After the European Union refused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership, Mr. Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some European leaders.
Relations seemed to be improving until the capture of Mr. Ocalan last month. When Italy refused to extradite him for trial in Turkey, Mr. Yilmaz accused Italy of embracing terrorism.
The Yilmaz Government was fragile from the start, depending on the support of Deniz Baykal, who controls a faction in Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition. When Mr. Baykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the Government's fate was clear.
Mr. Baykal acted after charges that cast doubt on the Government's integrity. The charges stemmed from a complex scandal that has been spreading for the last two years. It is centered around allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintained ties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders and allowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.
The charge that brought down the Government today was based on testimony from a reputed Turkish crime boss who is being held in France. He released audiotapes suggesting that Mr. Yilmaz and Mr. Taner helped one of his front men buy a bank from the Government.
Mr. Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressed Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, into resigning. But his Government was not able to agree on a strategy to counter rising Islamic influence. Polls suggest that if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finish strongly, perhaps even in first place, as it did in the 1996 election.
Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch together an electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory by the Islamic party.
Mr. Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of his Government's economic successes. "It will be the people who will very soon make the real judgment about our Government," he said today.

HEADLINE: Beijing Says It Will Bid For Olympics Set for 2008

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The city of Beijing announced today that it plans to bid for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.
In a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, suggesting top-level endorsement, Mayor Jia Qinglin submitted the proposal to the head of the Chinese Olympic Committee, which is to decide in January whether to apply to the International Olympic Committee. 
 To an unusual degree, Chinese leaders see acting as host for the Olympics as a matter of pride and international acceptance of China's status as a great power.
"We think that as the world's most populous country with a vigorous and growing economy, China should host the Olympic Games and make more contributions to the Olympic movement," Wu Shaozu, president of the country's Olympic committee, said at today's ceremony, the New China News Agency reported.
Early this decade the Chinese Government lobbied heavily around the world to have the 2000 Games in Beijing, pledging to spend $7.5 billion to improve its creaky urban infrastructure and even, many experts believe, timing the release of prominent dissidents to allay criticism of the country's human rights record.
Chinese, official and ordinary alike, reacted with dismay and anger in 1993 when Sydney, Australia, beat Beijing by just two votes in balloting of the International Olympic Committee.
After China's violent crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, many members of the United States Congress, other Western politicians and human rights groups had argued that it would be wrong to reward China with the Olympics.
Although it was not at all clear that rights concerns, rather than logistical and other factors, caused the loss, many Chinese have borne a grudge on the matter ever since. Today, a Chinese Olympic committee spokeswoman said China had lost the 1993 vote because of "non-sports factors."
In the last few years China has successfully emerged from its post-1989 diplomatic isolation and has worked, with some success, to downgrade the role of human rights disputes in its relations with Western countries.
If, as expected, the International Committee receives a proposal from Beijing, it will have to consider other problems here, including some of the world's most dangerous air pollution and severe traffic snarls. Chinese sports have also been tarnished by repeated scandals involving use of performance-enhancing drugs, though the Government has vowed to clean up the problem.
But there is little doubt that if selected, China would go all out to make the Games a success.
There will be ample time for Beijing and other cities to burnish their applications. Officially, the bidding for the 2008 Games does not open until next year, with the selection in 2001. Toronto, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Seville, Spain, and Osaka, Japan, have already announced that they will vie for the honor.

Shoppers Are Making Lists and Flocking to Discounters

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Don't look for elves in the full-price stores this year.
Building on a trend that started a few years ago, discount merchandisers are winning the nation's shopping wars, cashing in on consumers' growing appetite for bargains. And they are likely to keep their edge right through the Christmas and Hanukkah frenzy, at the expense of old-line department stores and some specialty chains. 
 "Price seems to be the only thing that people are responding to," said Thomas J. Burns, senior vice president at the Doneger Group, a retail consulting company.
From all indications, shoppers are not planning to spend less this year, despite the whipsawing of the stock market and fears that the economy may be slowing. But they are trying to stretch what they spend a little further, and they are changing the mix, often buying smaller, inexpensive items coupled with a few big-ticket purchases.
Anne-Marie Kern, armed with shopping list and credit cards, often heads first for the Prime Outlets at Kenosha mall in Wisconsin, halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago on Lake Michigan.
This year, Ms. Kern, a sports marketing executive in Chicago, picked up a pair of insulated ski gloves there for her brother, along with some cookware and holiday wreaths. She saved about $50, she said, making the hour's drive worth the effort.
"It helps with the budget," she said, adding that she will buy gifts for herself later, when the post-holiday sales are in full swing.
Shoppers like Ms. Kern have already given discounters a lift. Through August, Commerce Department data show, sales in discount department stores rose 9.8 percent from the corresponding period last year, compared with a 3.5 percent gain for conventional department stores and a 1.2 percent decline for chain stores, including specialty retailers like Ann Taylor, the Gap, Barnes & Noble, Abercrombie & Fitch and Toys "R" Us.
Three leading discounters, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target, dominate the field, accounting for 75 percent of total sales.
"I think it's going to be a very promotional season," Mr. Burns said. "Some of the sales are breaking even sooner than ever, even before the decorations are up."
Why is discounting the nation's hottest retail story?
Mainly it is because more and more discount chains are transforming themselves into one-stop shopping meccas. By expanding product offerings and adding services, they can now fill all manner of customer needs.
These days, "a higher-income consumer who may shop at a Nordstrom will also shop at a Target for basic needs," said Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
"People have gradually realized that for certain types of merchandise, you don't need to spend full retail price," Mr. Church added. Shopping at discount stores for some basic items also "frees up a few more discretionary dollars that they can spend in other areas."
Available products run the gamut, from the old standbys -- health, beauty and personal care products, plus a smattering of small appliances and toys -- to food and other grocery items, as well as an expanded selection of toys, sporting goods, linens, housewares, electronics and auto care items. Some discounters even offer their own store-brand labels and other merchandise they sell exclusively, plus services like banking, vision care, shoe repair and photography.
Convenience and pricing make discounters popular not just with lower-income customers, analysts say, but also with a growing number of older, generally thrifty shoppers. And the discounters' efforts to add to the number of trendy products lining their shelves, like fluted goblets, candles and aromatherapy oils, are also helping them attract customers.
On her first trip last week to the Target store in the Palisades Center mall, which opened in February in West Nyack, N.Y., Debbie Carilli of Larchmont quickly loaded her cart with a trove of holiday gift items. These included a gold-painted basket, red-and-green plaid place mats, candleholders, several rolls of gift wrap and blue dessert plates and matching mugs, decorated with snowmen.
"I came for the dishes," said Ms. Carilli, who had received a flier in the mail.
She has tried other shopping methods in past years, such as buying pre wrapped gifts and using personal shoppers, but at Target she said, "To tell you the truth, the value was great." And she happily confided the prices she was about to pay. The plates and a portable vacuum cleaner she was buying for herself. But the basket, an unexpected find, and the place mats would be included in a gift of pasta and other cooking items that she was putting together for her father-in-law.
The store's mix of such small items fits well with Ms. Carilli's plans to buy "lots of little things" to create more personal gifts this year. And she said she would definitely go back to Target, the first discount store she had ever shopped in.
Discounters are also benefiting from a shift in spending, analysts say. Consumers are laying out less on clothing, and the most sought-after gifts are toys, like the latest Holiday Barbie, Furby and Teletubbies. The newest Nintendo and Play Station game disks are popular, and cellular phones, Palm Pilots and other consumer electronic devices top many must-have lists.
As John McCormack of New Hyde Park, N.Y., watched his 6-year-old grandson, Neil Francis of Pearl River, try out the latest Nintendo game in Target's electronics department, his wife, Eileen, was a few feet away trying on a sweater. She had already bought a horse-riding Barbie as a gift for Neil's 7-year-old cousin.
"You're just overwhelmed by the amount of stuff they have for children," Mr. McCormack said of the store, adding that he and his wife had been discount shoppers for years.
Although they have not reined in their spending as a result of the stock market's gyrations this year, he said: "We like the discount stores. I think the prices are better. We definitely buy clothing in the department stores, but buy most other items in discount stores."
Sales at stores open more than a year, considered the best gauge of a retailer's strength, fell 1 percent at department stores in the third quarter but rose 7.2 percent for discounters, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
Discounters' growth may be slowing -- in the first quarter, sales rose an even stronger 8.2 percent -- but the convenience offered by their vast array of merchandise will help them continue to gain ground against traditional department stores, said Dan Barry, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Although the end of the year is a big season for discounters, many do not rely heavily on the last-minute shopping spree to clinch the year's fortunes. But for department stores and other mall-based chains, Christmas often means the difference between ending the year with a substantial profit and ending with a loss.
Moreover, despite the crowds that 11th-hour shopping promises, many consumers are more than willing to wait out department store executives in anticipation of those final, alluring markdowns.
Federated Department Stores, a leading chain, takes in about 60 percent of its revenue in the fourth quarter, Mr. Church of Salomon Smith Barney said. By comparison, Target, which is owned by the Dayton Hudson Corporation, makes about 39 percent and Wal-Mart about 33 percent.
Wal-Mart is anticipating about a 5 percent increase in sales in the fourth quarter, said Michael Maher, a spokesman. "Right now, we're on track for another record quarter," he said.
The addition of grocery products in Wal-Mart's "superstores" has drawn customers in more often throughout the year, reducing the chain's reliance on holiday shopping, analysts said.
In an effort to lift holiday sales, this season Wal-Mart's trademark greeters will also offer young children suggestions of inexpensive gifts they can buy for family and friends. In late December, Wal-Mart will also offer a gift package linked to the new movie "The Prince of Egypt."
At Kmart, which relies heavily on promotions to bring in customers and makes about half its sales in the fourth quarter, the holiday season takes on added importance.
"It's critical," said Robert Burton, Kmart's vice president for investor relations. "It's a tremendous source of the year's profitability," he said, adding that the company was "cautiously optimistic," expecting comparable-store sales to increase 3 to 5 percent.
Target anticipates a 4 to 6 percent increase in the quarter, a spokeswoman said.
The chain continues to distinguish itself from competitors and attracts more affluent shoppers than most discounters, analysts say, by focusing on stocking a number of trendy items popular with consumers.
"We have a trend department, so you'll see the latest apparel trends, such as cargo pants," said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman. "We also have the silver influence in everything from candlesticks, charger plates to jewelry."
And these days, most shoppers crossing the threshold of a discount store do not leave empty-handed.
Anna M. Filomio and Laura Cimini, neighbors from Hawthorne, N.Y., sat in the Palisades Center mall's main food court, with the day's haul of toys, books and housewares overflowing the chairs next to them.
"The key is to find something cost-effective that looks like more than you paid for it, so they're not going to stick it in a closet," Ms. Cimini said. Both women said they planned to buy a mix of small items, mainly from discount stores, along with a few more expensive gifts like American Girl collector dolls.
Despite the discount stores' array of merchandise and toys, one item still eluded the two women. "We've been looking all over for Spice Girl accessories," Ms. Cimini said.
"By nature, the joy of shopping is to get the best price," Ms. Cimini said of their visit to the discount stores.
"To beat the system," Ms. Filomio added.
"That," Ms. Cimini said, "feels great, to think you've got a deal."

Amid a healthy economy but an uncertain outlook these days, consumers are shopping more at discount stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart at the expense of traditional department stores such as Macy's and J.C. Penney.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rose Again in October

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Buoyant consumer spending sent sales of big-ticket goods and previously owned homes higher in October, signs that the economic expansion will continue.
The Commerce Department said today that consumer spending rose a half-percent last month, led by purchases of durable goods like cars and computers, after having increased seven-tenths of 1 percent in September. Personal incomes rose at a slower rate of four-tenths of 1 percent in October after climbing two-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. 
 In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said that home resales climbed 2.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million, the highest since July's record annualized rate of 4.91 million sales. Low mortgage rates helped fuel the advance.
Sales rose in the South and the Midwest last month but fell in the Northeast and the West.
"There isn't anything out there that suggests recession," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass. "The economy has been forging ahead. It has been resilient."
All that spending, though, cut into Americans' bank accounts, sending the savings rate in October to minus 0.2 percent -- meaning that people spent more than they earned -- compared with a revised minus 0.1 percent in the prior month. September was the first month in which the savings rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, had turned negative since the Government began keeping monthly figures in 1959.
"Clearly people are spending every cent they earn -- and then some," said William Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "It's a trend that can't continue indefinitely."
Spending has gained a lift from low unemployment, a slow inflation rate, low interest rates and a rebounding stock market -- all of which have buoyed consumers' confidence in the economy.
The job market's strength was illustrated by today's Labor Department report that the number of first-time claims filed for state unemployment benefits fell by 39,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 300,000, the lowest since the end of September. The four-week moving average, which offsets some of the volatility seen in the weekly data, also fell.
"You can't walk down the street or into a mall without seeing a help-wanted sign," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York.
Meanwhile, figures issued by the University of Michigan suggested people were more optimistic. The university's index of consumer sentiment rose to 102.7 earlier this month from 97.4 in October. That echoed a report released on Tuesday by the Conference Board that consumer confidence rebounded this month from an 18-month low in October.
October's accelerated gain in incomes suggested no slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services. Consumer spending has been on the rise for more than two years.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Agrees to Resume Pakistan Aid, Cut Off After Atom Tests

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund agreed today to resume assistance to Pakistan, which had been cut off earlier this year after the country detonated nuclear devices.
The agreement, announced in Islamabad, followed a decision by the United States to support the fund's resumption of aid to Pakistan, which has been on the verge of defaulting on its international debts. It came a week before Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is to meet with President Clinton in Washington. 
The deal, which will require approval by the fund's board, will unlock up to $1.3 billion in aid, which will be paid in installments starting as early as next month. Pakistan's Government and fund officials said the deal should enable the country to continue making payments on its $32 billion foreign debt and avoid falling further into poverty at a time when much of Asia has been battered by financial turmoil.
Officials at the fund's headquarters in Washington said the agreement called for the reactivation of an existing loan program that was suspended last spring after Pakistan responded to nuclear tests by India with detonations of its own devices. The fund officials declined to provide further details of the pact.
But officials from Pakistan's finance ministry told a news conference in Islamabad that the Government had agreed to a series of economic steps to open up the I.M.F. financing. It agreed to increase the sales tax to raise revenues, to make unspecified spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit and to other measures to fight corruption and strengthen the banking system.
The officials also suggested that the fund would support Pakistan's efforts reschedule payment terms for some of its short-term loans from foreign governments and banks. Pakistan said it also expected aid from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Fund officials said the negotiations got a boost earlier this week when Pakistan agreed to back down from demands it had made to privately owned power companies to renegotiate electricity purchase agreements at lower rates.
Since the tests last spring, the United States, which sees the rivalry between Pakistan and India as the world's most dangerous arms race, has pressed the two countries to limit their nuclear weapons programs. The leaders of both countries said at the United Nations in September that they would put a moratorium on further tests and comply with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by September 1999.
But despite pressure from Washington and the United Nations Security Council, neither India nor Pakistan has promised to forgo deployment of nuclear weapons or join a moratorium on the future production of fissile material for warheads.
As a result, Washington has kept some sanctions in place, including trade restrictions imposed last week on India and Pakistan. The restrictions apply to 300 companies and government agencies in the two countries that are involved in nuclear, missile and military programs, and in effect bar sales to them by any American company.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal;
Is Lewinsky's Boswell a Flatterer? Ask These Folks

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The man hired to write Monica S. Lewinsky's side of the Presidential scandal has become famous here in the last few weeks, maybe even more famous than she is. And from what Kenyans have seen, this much is clear: if she is looking for a sympathetic ear, she probably picked the right man.
Sandwiched between his account of the crumbling marriage of Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the Lewinsky book, the the British journalist Andrew Morton spent three years writing about another public figure: Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, the President of Kenya since 1978. 
 The book about President Moi, a mysterious figure to many people here, was published this month. In the first few days it sold some 7,000 copies here, faster than any book before, as Kenyans rushed to read one of the only in-depth works about their President.
But sales are slacking off, and some Kenyans are growing angry at what they say is Mr. Morton's relentlessly sunny story, from President Moi's boyhood in the rural Rift Valley to his rise to power to the still-unsolved murder in 1991 of one of his top aides.
The biography is so positive and apologetic that many people in Kenya are confused: either Mr. Morton was paid to write the book, which his publishers deny, or he was writing about some other President Moi. "Perhaps because serving his nation is now second nature, he rarely, if ever thinks of himself before his country," reads a typical sentence in the 305-page book, "Moi: The Making of an African Statesman," published by Michael O'Mara Books, which sold St. Martin's Press the rights to publish the Lewinsky book in the United States while retaining the rights to publish it in the rest of the world.
Speaking of the Moi biography, John Githongo said, "It's an odd book." He is a political analyst and columnist for The East African, the weekly newspaper that has been running sections of the book this month, and selling a lot more papers because of it.
"The character that is created is so different from the one most Kenyans believe they know," Mr. Githongo added.
"For Monica Lewinsky, I think it's quite healthy," he added.
Despite his two decades in office, many Kenyans say their President remains a cipher. Critics contend he is an inarticulate throwback: one of the last African "Big Men" who has ruled by opposing multiparty democracy, encouraging ethnic divisiveness and, at a minimum, sitting back as corruption eroded the economy.
There is a more charitable view, which Mr. Morton embraces on every page: that for all his faults, President Moi has been a friend to the West who has kept Kenya largely peaceful as neighboring countries crumbled into conflict. Many people believe education has improved, and Kenyans, and their vibrant press, can mostly say what they please, despite regular exceptions.
As his rule nears an end -- President Moi, 74, must step down in 2002 -- he is reportedly worried about embedding the latter view into history.
Along came Mr. Morton, who had earned millions of dollars on his books about the British royalty, notably, "Diana: Her True Story," written in 1992 with the covert cooperation of the Princess.
There has been much speculation, here and in Britain, about exactly why Mr. Morton decided to take on the project and why President Moi cooperated, apparently granting some of the few interviews of his life. A person close to both the Moi Government and Mr. Morton said the President was concerned about his legacy and felt Mr. Morton would be sympathetic.
"There is a feeling at State House that the President doesn't get a fair wind," the person said.
Despite speculation in the press here about exactly how much Mr. Morton was paid for the book, the person denied that any money changed hands. "He looked me straight in the eye and told me in absolutely no way was he paid by State House," the person said.
Still, the book's tone has done little to dampen suspicions. "One cannot help hoping that Morton was well paid for this book," read a scathing review in The Sunday Times of London, "since it will do his reputation nothing but harm."
Mr. Morton, reportedly holed up in Los Angeles with Ms. Lewinsky working on her book, could not be reached for comment. But he has become a celebrity in his own right here, though much of the attention has not been good.
Most contentious has been Mr. Morton's explanation of the murder of Dr. Robert Ouko, the Foreign Minister who was seen as a possible rival to President Moi. The death has long hung over President Moi's rule, and the killing has been linked to several people close to the President.
Mr. Morton singles out one of them, Hezekiah Oyugi, the security chief, raising the possibility that Mr. Ouko had an affair with one of Mr. Oyugi's three wives.
Mr. Oyugi died six years ago, but his family disputes Mr. Morton's account. One of Kenya's most respected jurists, Justice Richard Otieno Kwach, is threatening to sue Mr. Morton over an allegation that he and two other judges investigating the murder were regularly entertained at Mr. Oyugi's house.
"He didn't give any of us the opportunity to rebut the allegations," Justice Kwach said. "He just swallowed what he was given, hook, line and sinker."
A sampling of Kenyans in Nairobi said that the book was worth reading no matter what, simply, they said, because they know so little about Mr. Moi's life. What they thought of the book depended largely on what they thought of the man.
"Everyone wants to know the personal life of the President -- about why he is such a great President and what his secret is being so powerful, great and energetic," said Jitesh R. Upadhyay, 34, a bookstore owner.
But few were so upbeat. "I want to know how he has survived all these political upheavals," said George Muturia, 26, an anthropology student who had just bought the book. "I'm not very optimistic. But I'm hoping to get some clues."

EUROPE
 
SWITZERLAND: BANANA CHARGES FLY
The great banana battle heated up again as the United States and the European Union went to the World Trade Organization in Geneva and accused each other of violating international law. European countries want to retain import preferences for bananas from former colonies in Africa. The United States, defending American distributors like Chiquita Brands, wants equal treatment for bananas from Central American and the Caribbean. Edmund L. Andrews (NYT)
 
YUGOSLAVIA: ARMY CHIEF DISCHARGED
President Slobo- dan Milosevic has discharged the army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, left, after reported disputes between the two officials. Recently General Perisic subtly criticized Mr. Milosevic's policy in Kosovo, the Serbian province where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence, saying the conflict was partly a result of "certain politicians' wish to stay in power." (AP)
 
RUSSIA: ACCORD ON NOTES FOR DEBT
Foreign creditors who represent holders of Russia's restructured Soviet-era debt agreed to let Russia pay $216 million of a $940 million payment due on Dec. 2 in cash, with the remainder covered by notes that promise to pay the interest later .The original agreement had called for half the $724 million to be paid in new notes and half in cash. (Bloomberg News)
 
RUSSIA: CUSTOMS DISMISSALS IN FUNDS INQUIRY
The heads of four customs departments in Moscow were dismissed after an investigation into the flight of capital from Russia, officials said. Billions of dollars have been taken out of Russia, often illegally, with Russian companies' having hidden $2.5 billion abroad just in September, the officials said. (AP)
 
ALBANIA: IN FAVOR OF NEW CONSTITUTION
With more than half the ballots counted from a referendum on Sunday, Albanians have apparently voted overwhelmingly in favor of enacting the first post-Communist Constitution, an election commission official said. (Reuters)
 
LITHUANIA: RESIGNATION SHAKES GOVERNMENT
The Government, shaken by the resignation of Transport Minister Algis Zhvaliauskas, said it might seek a court ruling on whether it needed a fresh mandate from Parliament. Of the 18 ministers originally appointed to the Cabinet in 1996, seven remain. Mr. Zhvaliauskas resigned after having been accused of using a state airplane to return from a hunting trip in Sweden. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
LIBYA: 3 JAILED IN LOCKERBIE BOMBING
Three top intelligence officials have been tried and jailed in connection with the bombing of a Pan American World Airways jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, The Guardian and Al-Hayat newspapers reported in London. Libyan dissidents saw the arrests as a ploy by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to block the officials' testimony, should two other Libyan suspects stand trial before Scottish judges in the Netherlands under a plan that the United Nations Security Council approved. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: KABILA TO ALLOW POLITICAL PARTIES
Political parties will be allowed in two months, President Laurent Kabila said on a visit to Brussels. Mr. Kabila announced a two-year transition to democracy shortly after coming to power. But his Government has been criticized for abuses of human rights and an apparent lack of resolve to institute democracy. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: SEARCH FOR 500 CORRUPT OFFICERS
Two days after the arrests of nearly 100 police officers in Mexico City and neighboring states on felony charges, authorities have identified at least 500 additional officers wanted for crimes like police brutality and homicide. The Interior Ministry said it would ask the 31 states' attorneys general to arrest the officers, many of whom have been fugitives for years. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
CHILE: INTEREST LOWERED TO 8.5%
In another attempt to jump-start a slowing economy the Central Bank lowered annual interest rates, from 10 to 8.5 percent. It was the fourth rate decrease in two months. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: EX-RULER HELD IN KIDNAPPINGS
A former military ruler, Emilio Massera, has been arrested in connection with the kidnappings of two infants born to political dissidents imprisoned by the previous military dictatorship, BBC News reported. It cited an estimate that from 200 to 400 babies were taken from their detained mothers and given to military and police couples in the 1970's and 80's.
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: JIANG STARTS 5-DAY VISIT
President Jiang Zemin of China, left, arrived for a five-day visit that is expected to touch on issues like relations with Taiwan and memories of World War II. Mr. Jiang, the first Chinese head of state to visit Japan, met Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for an unofficial dinner. The leaders plan to issue a communique calling for warmer ties between China and Japan. Nicholas D. Kristof (NYT)
 
CHINA: TRIAL OF COMPUTER SPECIALIST DELAYED
The trial of a computer software specialist accused of inciting subversion by providing e-mail addresses to a dissident publication, has been postponed. Authorities gave no reason for delaying the trial of the defendant, Lin Hai, had been scheduled to begin on Friday in Shanghai. Erik Eckholm (NYT)
 
AFGHANISTAN: LAST IRANIANS FREED
The last of dozens of Iranian prisoners held by the Taliban militia has been freed, Iranian radio reported. The release may ease tensions, but the Taliban are still resisting Iran's demands that those responsible for killing Iranian diplomats in August be punished. Douglas Jehl (NYT)

HEADLINE: Like Sybarites on Beer-and-Nuts Budgets

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Conspicuous consumption may be off a little this year, much like many a Wall Street bonus, but a bit of luxury and indulgence is definitely still in style. And for those on smaller budgets, the appearance of luxury -- in, say, fake fur trims and gold- and silver-colored candles, handbags and champagne flutes -- works just as well.
America's Research Group predicts that 40 percent of consumers will spend more this year. With forecasts like that and consumer confidence on an upswing, "there's nothing to suggest the holiday is going to be a bust," said John Konarski, director of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks shopping trends. Whatever the budget, when it comes to holiday shopping, emotion takes over. 
 In the luxury corner, white gold, platinum and silver are popular, turning up in everything from cross pendants to Edwardian and Victorian designs inspired by the movie "Titanic." Watches, long a gift staple, feature dials with colors like gunmetal gray, salmon or mother-of-pearl, and bracelet versions.
Exotic travel locales, though, might bring to mind Indiana Jones more than James Bond.
"People are looking for experiences," said Arnold Brown, chairman of Weiner, Edrich, Brown Inc., a New York firm that helps business analyze change.
Holiday vacations this year, he says, are as likely to focus on the self-indulgent luxury of a spa or cruise as on an educational trip such as an ecology tour or whale watching.
Low-end computers, priced under $1,000, will make their way into the homes of many shoppers, from retirees and other first-time buyers to families adding a model exclusively for the children. Recent price cuts are also expected to help computer and video games and cell phones disappear from store shelves, along with hand-held computer devices.
The trend in apparel leans toward the casual. Fleece pullovers, the brighter the better, are flying off the shelves, said Thomas J. Burns, senior vice president at the Doneger Group, retail consultants based in New York.
In women's clothing, cashmere is generally expected to sell well, with some sweaters offered as low as $40. But analysts expect consumers to balk at the lowest-priced, thinnest versions. Velvet and suede are also popular choices to add a hint of luxury.
Then there are the gifts you can never go wrong with: books. But move over, Martha Stewart; Oprah Winfrey reigns here. Though cookbooks have long been a gift staple, this year mystery, suspense and self-improvement are hot. And anything Ms. Winfrey picks for her television book club is an instant best seller.
"If you go into a Barnes & Noble, they have a section that says 'Oprah's Picks,' " Mr. Konarski said. People believe that "if Oprah says it's good, it must be good."
And whether shoppers want them or not, scented soap and candles will be inescapable. These days, few stores fail to carry them, in all shapes, sizes and colors.
Candles also offer a New Age twist. As 1999 brings the eve of a millennium, a religious or mystical influence will be felt everywhere from candles to jewelry, books to music.
Convenience is gaining converts as Internet shopping continues to grow, lifted by a broadening array of products available by computer.
"For the last 15 years, I've done all my shopping from my chair," whether by catalogue or Internet, Mr. Brown acknowledged. "You have the list of all the people you're shopping for, and bang, bang, bang, you do all the shopping."

HEADLINE: This Demure Day of Thanks

 BODY:
Thanksgiving is still a simple holiday, yet for most of us an occasion of genuine feeling in a crowded festal calendar. To judge by house and yard decorations in rural America, Halloween has spilled over its once-meager banks and washed away all of October and much of November. In cities, the Christmas season as we know it now -- an economic indicator with colored lights and eggnog -- can no longer be confined, as it used to be, within the month that begins on the day after Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving sticks strictly to its allotted Thursday, and the power of this quiet holiday is evident in the trouble so many of us go through to get home in time to honor it. There is something invariably touching about a feast of thanks at which we all find our own reasons to be thankful, in which the feeling is named but not the cause.
The year is getting old and the light weak by the time Thanksgiving comes. The only color in the woods is the green of damp moss and the bright orange berries of bittersweet. There are historic reasons that Thanksgiving falls when it does -- matters of Pilgrim fact and Presidential proclamation -- but over time it has become a holiday emblematic of this bare season. By the end of the eleventh month, the year is ancient enough to have shown us its wisdom. We know what to be grateful for by now, or gratitude is simply beyond us. 
 You do not have to be very old to remember Thanksgivings that began at 4 or 5 in the morning, when women rose alone in the dark to start cooking the turkey. By the time the men and children got out of bed, the bird had already been roasting for a couple of hours on the back porch in its own enameled turkey roaster, a device that lived in the basement all but one day a year, resembled an electric bassinet, and kept the main oven free for pies. Thanksgiving then meant haste in the early hours, a long delay before the big midafternoon dinner, and scratch meals -- why eat now? -- for breakfast and lunch, a day in which you went straight from starvation to stupefaction, in which men and children felt more than ordinarily useless whenever they came near the kitchen.
Sitting down to the big meal seems like the crux of Thanksgiving, but it really comes a couple of hours later. The pumpkin pie is gone, the dishes are done, the dogs and overnight guests are napping, and there is a strange vacancy in the afternoon light. For a moment the year halts, a moment when the wakeful are not quite sure what to do with themselves. In that instant, that hollow in time, you find yourself listening to the unnatural stillness of the afternoon, pausing to look closely at the world around you. That is all the celebration necessary on this most modest, most poignant of days.

HEADLINE: Earl Kim, 78, Noted Composer Of Austere and Dazzling Works

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
Earl Kim, a composer whose music valued economy, precision and quietude, and who was an important mentor to younger composers during a 23-year career at Harvard University, died last Thursday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 78.
He had recently been diagnosed with cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Kim received the most public attention for works he wrote for the violinist Itzhak Perlman, which were were somewhat out of character for the composer. In 1979 Mr. Perlman gave the premiere of Mr. Kim's Violin Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall.
Though a compact, 20-minute, one-movement piece, the concerto teems with an almost Romantic lyricism and brilliant writing for the violin. Following this, Mr. Kim composed a set of dazzling violin caprices for Mr. Perlman that have become popular with many violinists.
But for the most part, Mr. Kim's music was modest of statement and infrequently heard outside of contemporary and chamber music circles. He was a modernist in the sense that his musical language was steeped in contemporary procedures, including touches of the 12-tone idiom. But his voice was deeply personal: aristocratic, restrained, with not a note wasted.
Mr. Kim was especially admired for his vocal works. Versed in several languages, he selected texts of distinction by authors like Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Rilke, Anne Sexton and, his favorite, Samuel Beckett.
The spareness, abstraction and mystery in Beckett's writing was reflected tellingly in Mr. Kim's many musical settings, including "Exercises en Route" and "Earthlight."
Some of Mr. Kim's vocal works use the singing voice traditionally. But he was especially noted for his melodramas, in which the words are spoken or quasi-sung, accompanied by spare instrumental gestures. Bethany Beardslee and Benita Valente were among the singers who championed Mr. Kim's vocal music, and Dawn Upshaw took the title of her album "The Girl With Orange Lips" from one of the songs in his cycle "Where Grief Slumbers."
Mr. Kim was born in Dinuba, Calif., on Jan. 6, 1920. In 1939, he began studies in composition at the University of California at Los Angeles with Schoenberg; the following year he transferred to Berkeley, where he worked with Ernest Bloch. From 1952 to 1967, he taught at Princeton. He then accepted a position at Harvard, eventually becoming James Edward Ditson Professor of Music. He retired in 1990.
Mr. Kim was active in political causes. In 1983, as president of Musicians Against Nuclear Arms, he participated in a concert at Avery Fisher Hall to raise funds for Physicians for Social Responsibility. In 1990, he refused an invitation to join a music panel of the National Endowment for the Arts to express his opposition to "all forms of censorship of the arts," as he wrote in a letter published in The New York Times.
He is survived by his wife, Martha Potter, a violinist; a daughter, Eva, of Cambridge, and a daughter from a previous marriage, Shawna Kent of Manhattan.
Mr. Kim's last major work, "The White Hour" for chamber orchestra, was given its premiere this year by the Boston Chamber Music Society.

Welfare to Work Partnership: Promises That Might Be Kept

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
A robust economy has provided a respite -- at least until the next recession -- from the fangs of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which threatens to withdraw aid from millions of poor families. But now a longer-term, if still partial, answer is slowly emerging.
Prodded by the Welfare to Work Partnership, a nonprofit organization run by Eli Segal, a former adviser to President Clinton, companies are connecting with community groups to recruit, train and hire welfare recipients for entry-level jobs. 
 "The motive," Mr. Segal said, "is the most reliable of all -- profit. Companies are finding that properly trained welfare enrollees stay at their job longer than other recruits, cutting the firms' recruitment and training costs."
Beginning in early 1997, the partnership initially signed up about 3,200 companies to hire an estimated 135,000 welfare enrollees for entry-level jobs. About three-fourths of the hires are for full-time work with health benefits. The program has now expanded to about 7,500 companies.
The partnership's key strategy is to link companies to nonprofit community groups, like Goodwill Industries and churches, that specialize in recruiting, training and counseling welfare recipients. The idea is to provide enrollees the English, math and so-called soft skills -- manners and attitude -- that qualify welfare recipients for an employer's own training program. The groups also provide counseling and mentor aid once the welfare recipient starts the new job.
The initial jobs were in all the expected unskilled fields: fast-food restaurants, clerical positions, retail sales. The obvious question was whether the partnership's strategy could be expanded to handle any number close to the two million or so women on welfare who will soon need jobs.
The new wrinkle is that the partnership has pierced good-paying white-collar jobs in industries that are expanding. Next week the partnership plans to announce in New York City new commitments by banks and other financial institutions. Therein lie the seeds of replication.
Take Chase Manhattan. The bank has set up three tracks for hiring welfare enrollees into jobs that pay as much as $24,000 a year. The first uses the Wildcat Service Corporation, a nonprofit group specializing in training low-skilled workers, to train enrollees to become bank tellers at Chase's branches, using Chase terminals and computer programs. Chase then puts these new employees through its own two-week training course. The distinct feature of the program is that Wildcat trains enrollees to perform tasks specific to work at Chase.
Carol Parry, who oversees the program for Chase, said that her "managers are thrilled with their new recruits, and the welfare recipients say they are very happy to be working at Chase." Typically, she says, about half of Chase's new tellers leave within a year, forcing Chase to spend between $3,000 and $5,000 to recruit and train a replacement. But so far, only about 10 percent of the tellers it has hired through Wildcat have left.
Chase has turned to two other nonprofit groups to train welfare enrollees to serve as customer service representatives who answer telephone inquiries about Chase bank products and as back-office workers who reconcile transactions on Chase's automated teller machines.
Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage unit of Citigroup, has also turned to Wildcat to train welfare enrollees specifically for its entry-level jobs. So far, more than 90 percent of the enrollees that Salomon has hired through the program remain employed two years later. And Republic National Bank, which promises a job to each graduate of its program, trains 120 welfare recipients a year.
By expanding beyond fast food and retail sales, Mr. Segal notes, the partnership strategy opens the possibility that employers will absorb most if not all the welfare recipients who will enter the labor force in the next several years.
Some independent evidence suggests that Mr. Segal's optimism may be justified. Prof. Harry Holzer of Michigan State University surveyed employers in three Michigan metropolitan areas, finding that almost 9 percent of their jobs in the next year would be open to welfare recipients, even those without high-school diplomas or work experience. That percent reflects a number many times larger than the welfare population that will need work.
Of course, not all the evidence is encouraging. The Holzer study emphasized that the employers' willingness to hire was tied to temporarily tight labor markets and that the offices of many employers are situated well beyond the easy access of most welfare enrollees. And there remains the serious issue of matching recipients to willing employers -- the very task that the partnership was set up to accomplish.
Another study found other obstacles to success as well. Prof. Sandra Danziger and colleagues at the University of Michigan surveyed women on welfare in an urban Michigan county in early 1997, then followed up with interviews about nine months later. They found that of the women who were not already working, perhaps half were potentially hirable, especially if they were to receive the type of services offered by Mr. Segal's program.
But many enrollees faced serious, multiple barriers to employment. Some of those barriers were physical; about a third of the women suffered from mental problems like depression; a third had not finished high school. And half the women lacked access to transportation.
The welfare recipients beset by more than one handicap -- about half the group -- did not easily find work. And the study found that only about 5 percent of the women who faced several of the barriers were employed.
It's easy to list reasons why optimistic signs that welfare-to-work programs are succeeding are just that, optimistic. The Danziger study identified and measured some of the core obstacles. And 60 years of welfare experience proves the point.
But it is equally valid to bask in the good news. The Holzer study says that employers are prepared to hire welfare recipients. The partnership results -- though skimpy because they come from a program still in its infancy -- say that promises can be translated into permanent jobs, a mellow note on which to start the holidays.

Global Sales Slump to Slow Nestle's '98 Profit Growth

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Nestle A.G., the Swiss food giant, has become the latest European company to feel the bite of the emerging-markets meltdown, announcing today that collapsing sales in Russia and Asia will drastically slow profit growth this year.
Nestle, known in the United States for Taster's Choice coffee and Perrier mineral water, said food sales in its Africa, Asia and Australia regions had slumped by 8.7 percent in the first 10 months of the year, to 10 billion francs, or $7.1 billion, compared with sales in the period a year earlier. In Russia, sales plummeted by 30 percent, though Nestle gave no sales figure. In July, Nestle reported that sluggish sales in Japan and Brazil, markets that had shown abundant recent promise, coupled with a stronger Swiss franc were clouding its growth outlook. 
 At a news conference at its headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, Nestle said global revenue in the first 10 months rose by 4 percent, to 59.2 billion Swiss francs, or $42.1 billion, from 56.9 billion francs in the period a year earlier.
More seriously, Nestle said commitments in Russia to deliver products at dollar prices calculated before the ruble's 60 percent plunge in value against the dollar would cut into earnings.
Peter Brabeck, who took over last year as Nestle's chief executive, said that higher interest rates in Latin America would also weigh on earnings. He added, however, that continued robust demand for Nestle products in the United States and Western Europe would help offset the downward trend elsewhere.
The results demonstrated how tricky it is becoming to keep a global giant like Nestle on course in the turbulence of recent months.
Mario Corti, Nestle's chief financial officer, said that the vast Russian market, where Nestle had predicted it would generate sales this year of 1 billion francs, or $711 million, had remained strong through June. "Then, it fell out of bed," he said.
But Nestle's misfortunes in Russia were amplified by inadequate hedging against the ruble's sharp drop against the dollar, the currency on which Nestle bases its business there, he said.
Investors punished the company by selling its shares, pushing the share price on the Zurich market down by more than 4 percent, to 2,990 Swiss francs, or $2,126.
But analysts' reactions to the news were mixed. Nestle reported that real internal growth, or growth in revenue excluding acquisitions, divestments and changes in sale prices and exchange rates, was 4.6 percent. Rene Weber, who follows Nestle at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, called the figure "rather good," given that most analysts' estimates were about 4 percent. But estimates of earnings growth for the full year, he said, which had been about 9 percent, "have now gone back actually to zero."
Nestle said it expected sales of more than 70 billion francs, or $49.7 billion, in the full year. Mr. Brabeck said that he expected real internal growth for the full year to reach 4 percent and that profit growth would "slightly exceed" that figure. Vontobel's Mr. Weber said internal growth would be lower than total sales growth because of the exclusion of Spillers, a British pet food company that Nestle acquired earlier this year for $1.16 billion, but which he termed a "good long-term investment."
Mr. Brabeck said Nestle was taking "energetic measures" to counter the crises in Asia and Russia, including such "back to basics" steps as introducing lower-priced products, developing new distribution channels and reviewing costs.

HEADLINE: HUD Starts Inspection Plan Intended to Repair Housing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The high-rise building at 5929 East Capitol Street here is a mess.
Known as Capitol View Plaza II, it is a 12-story collection of 300 one- and two-bedroom apartments, many of which are Government subsidized, with leaks in the roof, broken plumbing, inoperable boilers, interior walls covered with graffiti, carpets pock-marked with cigarette burns, exposed wiring, missing fire extinguishers, no sprinkler system and air-vent chutes filled with garbage. 
 Perhaps worst of all is this: Until recently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees subsidized and public housing across the country, had no idea that the conditions at Capitol View Plaza had deteriorated to such a miserable extent.
In fact, after 30 years in the housing business, the department is still not certain just how many other federally subsidized buildings around the country housing low-income people have problems threatening the health and safety of the 12 million residents.
All that is about to change. A new $24 million enforcement initiative is under way to inspect all 372,800 properties the agency is involved with, like Capitol View Plaza, through subsidies, guaranteed mortgages and local public housing authorities.
Replacing a toothless system in which banks and property owners were responsble for their own inspections to maintain Federal contracts, the new procedures will require the owners of troubled properties to fulfill all the terms of their contracts by fixing problems. If conditions are not repaired, the owners will face action by the Department of Justice.
"All we're asking for is what we have already paid for," Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo of the Department of Housing and Urban Development said of a system in which the Federal Government provides incentives to landlords and housing authorities to maintain safe and decent housing. "And this is the problem the American taxpayers have with H.U.D. They have paid for a product, and we haven't delivered."
The inspection program is one of the most ambitious efforts undertaken by Mr. Cuomo since he took office last year. He said it would not only lead to the department's first computerized inventory of housing nationwide but also its most complete profile of troubled housing projects and guaranteed action by the Federal Government against problem landlords and property managers.
By protocols of the program, data from each site is sent to the department's new Real Estate Assessment Center for analysis and disposition. Department officials said a pilot program of 4,000 properties conducted earlier this year found that about 30 percent of them required significant repairs, most of which were needed to correct problems that exposed residents to health and safety risks. No repairs have yet been made or action taken against owners and landlords.
To highlight the importance of the inspection system to the department and the millions of people who live in subsidized housing, Mr. Cuomo invited a reporter to accompany him and other senior housing officials today as an inspector toured Capitol View Plaza, noting on his hand-held computer all the problems he found.
But some skeptics question whether the program will ultimately lead to real improvements in the Governments's housing program or merely shine a spotlight on Mr. Cuomo, the son of the former New York Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, who has made no secret of his greater political aspirations, including the possibility of running for the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York plans to retire from in 2000.
"The theory is good," Denise Muha, executive director of the National Leased Housing Association, said of the initiative. "The Secretary is trying to accomplish better data and better reaction. But the proof is in the pudding."
Jim Brigl, director of governmental affairs for the Public Housing Authorities Directors' Association, expressed concerns over the objectivity of the inspectors and the department's analysis of the data, saying, "Good quality physical inspections are a good idea, but the jury is still out on the vehicle he is using."
Acknowledging the possibility that some of Mr. Cuomo's motives might be political, Mr. Brigl added: "Like anybody else in Washington, the Secretary wants to do a good job, which will give him some political headway."
Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, chairman of a House housing subcommittee, welcomed the new inspections but said their effectiveness "depends on what H.U.D. does with the data."
Since its inception in 1968, the housing department has spent billions of dollars though a variety of programs for poor and working-class families. Many of the programs involve private investors, taking advantage of tax credits or Federal subsidies to manage large apartment buildings.
One such landlord is Allan Rozansky of Rockville, Md., whom housing officials identified as the owner of Capitol View Plaza. But reflecting one of the major problems with the building -- and subsidized housing, in general -- housing officials say Mr. Rozansky is virtualy impossible to find.
He is not listed in any Maryland telephone directory. The telephone number department officials have for his company, Capitol View Plaza Phase II Associates, has been disconnected. The managing agent for the building, H. R. Crawford, provided a number but said he was not sure if it was Mr. Rozansky's. A message left on an answering machine at the number was not returned.
"It is a very awkward system," Mr. Crawford said of his efforts to coordinate repair efforts with the owner. As a result, he added, "We are resigning at the end of the year."
Johnnie Williams, a 70-year-old great-grandmother who has lived in Capitol View Plaza for five years, welcomed the group in to see her cramped two-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor with water damage along her walls and cockroaches in the kitchen. Despite that, she said, "I'm all right with it here."
It is impossible, for now, to know how many other buildings around the country present the same kinds of problems posed by Capitol View Plaza. The inspections are not expected to be completed for another year, and forcing landlords to act could take years beyond that.

HEADLINE: OPEC Said to Be Near Agreement to Bolster Sagging Prices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
After a day of meetings, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared to be nearing an agreement on what action they would take to try to keep oil prices from falling further, but a spokesman for the group said yesterday that there were still more issues to discuss.
The spokesman, Rilwanu Lukman, the Secretary General of OPEC, said in Vienna, where the group is meeting, that "we are still discussing everything," according to a Bloomberg News report. 
 Mr. Lukman said the group will reconvene today.
John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, Inc., research group for the oil industry based in New York, said OPEC had little choice but to extend the production cuts it made earlier this year. Those reductions have have helped to keep oil prices from collapsing.
"What else can they do?," he said. "They already have an agreement. It's unlikely that they will not extend it."
There has been dissension among members of the group on what course to take. Some major producers such as Iran have asked Saudi Arabia to make deeper cuts. Venezuela has been reluctant to extend the cuts that the group agreed to last June, which have helped to keep crude oil prices from dropping below $10 a barrel.
The group agreed last spring to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily supply of 74 million barrels.
Analysts had expected the group to simply extend the current level of cutbacks but even that could be in doubt because of the differences among the members.
Dissension among OPEC members was viewed as one reason why crude oil futures prices fell yesterday. Crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15. Prices have fallen about 40 percent from late last year.
Meanwhile, inventories keep building up in the United States as the driving season winds down.
The American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, reported yesterday that a rise in imports of oil, which hit near- record levels last week, was a major reason for the rise in crude oil inventories.
There are huge forces adding to the extra supplies that are beyond OPEC's ablity to manage, such as the economic slump in Asia, increasing exports of some non-OPEC producers, and unseasonably mild weather in the United States, which has reduced demand for heating oil.
Saudi Arabia has been aggressive in building up its exports to the United States to offset some of the loss of revenue because of the steep drop in the price of oil.

HEADLINE: Lobbyist Named as Transportation Chief

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
New Jersey's Transportation Commissioner resigned today, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman quickly announced that she would replace him with a lobbyist who represented a casino owner in his dealings with the state.
The nominee, James Weinstein, who worked in several state government positions during the 1980's, has been a lobbyist since 1990 and has represented Mirage Resorts Inc. of Las Vegas, Nev., since 1996. 
 Mr. Weinstein said he directly lobbied state officials for money to build a $330 million tunnel to the site of a proposed casino resort in Atlantic City. The state has has agreed to pay at least two-thirds of the project's $330 million cost.
The much-debated tunnel will connect the Atlantic City Expressway to the 168-acre site where Stephen A. Wynn, the chairman of Mirage Resorts, plans to build a $1 billion casino and resort, including a 4,000-room hotel. Mr. Wynn has agreed to contribute $110 million to the tunnel.
The project has drawn opposition from Donald J. Trump and other owners whose casinos will have to compete with the Mirage project, from residents who will be forced to move and from environmentalists.
Today, some Atlantic City residents criticized the ties between Mr. Weinstein and Mirage Resorts.
"It's very shocking to me that there would a lobbyist instead of a transportation specialist for the top job in the entire state," said Lillian E. Bryant, an Atlantic City homeowner who has opposed the tunnel. "These people are supposed to look out for the citizens of New Jersey, not just the rich casino owners. How can we take this project seriously?"
Mr. Weinstein, 52, said he would avoid potential conflict of interest by recusing himself from any matters involving Mirage. "Anything regarding the tunnel, or the casino, I will have no involvement in," Mr. Weinstein said today. " It will be dealt with by the deputy commissioner."
Mr. Weinstein's permanent appointment requires the approval of the State Senate.
Across the country, as the number of gambling establishments has grown over the last decade, something of a revolving door has developed between government and the gambling industry. Because gambling is so heavily regulated, and casinos frequently receive tax abatements and other publicly financed incentives, casino owners have actively recruited influential politicians to negotiate favorable deals. Casinos are so profitable that they can easily attract government officials to work for them.
Mr. Weinstein would not discuss the salary he made by lobbying or the fees he was paid by Mirage, but said he was honored to be returning to public service. Mr. Wynn's spokesman, Alan M. Feldman, did not return calls for comment.
Governor Whitman's communications director, Peter McDonough, said Mr. Weinstein has extensive experience in transportation, as the former director of the New Jersey Governor's Authorities unit, which oversees the operation of the New Jersey Turnpike, New Jersey Transit, Garden State Parkway and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Mr. McDonough dismissed the criticism of Mr. Weinstein's appointment as the grumbling of a handful of rival casino owners who were threatened by the competition with Mr. Wynn. They refuse, he said, to acknowledge the economic lift that the tunnel project will provide to South Jersey.
"This is a project that will create thousands and thousands of jobs where they are needed most, in Atlantic City," Mr. McDonough said. "It's a project that people all over the country rave about."
Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment and his lobbyist, Alan Marcus, said the Trump organization would make no public statements about the appointment.
The departing Transportation Commissioner, John J. Haley, said he was leaving to accept an unspecified private job.
Mr. Weinstein, who will begin working as acting commissioner on Dec. 7, said that his top priorities would include carrying out the EZ-Pass system on New Jersey highways, advancing construction of a light rail rapid transit project in Bergen and Hudson Counties, and improving the service of New Jersey Transit trains and buses.

More Signs of Economic Strength
The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose a half-percent last month, led by purchases of durable goods like cars and computers, after having increased seven-tenths of 1 percent in September. Personal incomes rose at a slower rate of four-tenths of 1 percent in October after climbing two-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. C4.
 
Stocks Rally Further
Stocks in the United States rose as investors helped send the Dow Jones industrial average to its fifth advance in six days. The Dow rose 13.13 points, to 9,301.15. Broader market indexes also advanced. Citigroup and Advanced Micro Devices were the biggest gainers. C5.
 
Bond prices rose, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 5.18 percent, the lowest this month. C5.
 
I.M.F. Overture to Pakistan
The International Monetary Fund agreed to resume assistance to Pakistan, which had been cut off earlier this year after it detonated nuclear devices. The agreement came after a decision by the United States to support the fund's resumption of aid to Pakistan, which has been on the verge of default. A15.
 
Nestle Hurt by Global Weakness
Nestle, the Swiss food giant, has become the latest European company to feel the bite of the emerging-markets meltdown, announcing that food sales in its Africa, Asia and Australia regions had slumped by 8.7 percent in the first 10 months of the year. C2.
 
Slumping world markets caused Britain's trade deficit to nearly double in September to $4 billion, the highest since the country began recording the data. C2.
 
Deutsche Telekom Results Improve
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest phone company, said that it had improved third-quarter earnings by narrowing losses in cable television and other divisions even as rivals took a bigger bite out of its long-distance business. C2.
 
Gabelli Amends Public Offering
Alpha G, the holding company for Gabelli Funds, which is run by the New York money manager Mario Gabelli, has filed an amended initial public offering registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying it plans to offer six million class A common shares that may be priced between $16 and $19 a share. After the offering, Mr. Gabelli will indirectly own shares of common stock having about 97.6 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock. C4.
 
Nippon Reducing Japanese Holdings
Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's biggest life insurer, said it wanted to reduce its holdings of domestic securities in favor of higher returns abroad. The company said it would buy more securities denominated in foreign currencies, while monitoring exchange rates. C6.

HEADLINE: Exxon Talks With Mobil Are Reported

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS with LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said yesterday.
It was unclear yesterday whether talks were continuing. If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest United States company in terms of revenue. 
 A possible merger was reported separately by The Financial Times of London and Bloomberg News. The reported talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of the General Electric Company, and Mobil, the No. 2 United States oil company, came as oil prices sank to their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue.
The financial terms of the discussions could not be determined yesterday. Neither Exxon nor Mobil would comment.
Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and what later became Mobil was two companies, Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil.
As oil prices have plummeted to levels last seen in the mid-1980's, oil companies have been under pressure to cut costs. Exxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of being fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of low oil prices. But this has been a particularly unsettling year for the oil industry, and there is little prospect that crude oil prices will recover soon.
Consequently, chief executives of most oil companies, even the most independent, have had to swallow their pride and look for suitable partners. This summer, British Petroleum P.L.C. announced an agreement to buy the Amoco Corporation for $48.2 million, creating the world's third-largest oil company and prompting analysts to predict even more widespread consolidation.
"It showed that megamergers are doable," said Adam E. Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex. Brown.
He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge.
Exxon, he added, is a "well-run company that likes to grow its own businesses."
He added that Lee R. Raymond, the chairman of Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., and Lucio R. Noto, the chairman and chief executive of Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va., were different personalities.
"It will not be easy," he said of combining the two far-flung companies that have vast networks of refineries and gas stations that overlap in the United Sates and Europe.
"If you offer enough money, you can make anything happen," he added.
The two companies are also under pressure to find new oil reserves to survive in the long term. Like other oil companies, they had hoped to quickly tap into the vast reserves of Russia.
They have found, however, that even though they were prepared to spend billions, their progress was hindered by the political and economic turmoil in Russia and the reluctance of the Russian Government and Russian oil companies to give up control of the country's oil.
Thus they have had to fall back on exploration areas of their own like the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as West Africa and parts of Asia. Such exploration is very expensive and even when a big field is discovered, platforms costing $1 billion or more are required to bring it into production.
Oil prices have been under pressure for more than a year, falling more than 40 percent from the $20-a-barrel level as a result of growing inventories of petroleum and declining demand in Asia because of the economic crisis there. Yesterday, crude oil for January delivery fell 29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $11.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, close to the 12-year low of $11.42 reached on June 15.
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and some other other oil-producing nations, notably Mexico, have tried to stem the price decline with pledges to cut back on production. But those pledges have not always been honored, and rallies in the oil market this year have been short-lived. Yesterday, OPEC members continued their discussion on extending their production cutbacks, and an agreement is expected as early as today.
In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce its production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels. So far, the main result of that agreement appears to have been to keep oil prices above $10 a barrel.
Washington regulators said yesterday that they had not been notified about the Exxon-Mobil discussions. The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews such corporate combinations, is still reviewing British Petroleum's pending purchase of Amoco.
But an Exxon-Mobil deal would be certain to receive several months' worth of scrutiny by the commission, which would review how much of the industry the combined company would control.
Analysts and investment bankers were split about the logic of a potential deal.
"If you asked me if Exxon needed to be bigger, the answer is probably no," said Garfield Miller, president of the Aegis Energy Advisors Corporation, a small independent investment bank in New York.
Specifically, Mr. Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses. "They really do overlap quite a bit," he said. "You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy."
Another investment banker in the energy business, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also questioned the rationale for the deal. "When you look at the B.P.-Amoco deal, you can rationalize it," he said. "But none of those reasons apply to an Exxon-Mobil deal."
But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker 3d Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the two companies would be logical, in part because it would give them greater influence in bidding for development projects in the Middle East.
"This is a deal that makes sense," Ms. Jaffe said. "With this combined company, there is no project that would be too big."
Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each company with assets in areas where it had little influence. "There are a lot of complementary assets," she said.
For example, she said, Exxon has a strong presence in Angola, while Mobil does not. But, she said, Mobil has significant assets in the Caspian Sea and Nigeria, where Exxon is weak.

A Horse's Life: It's a Beauty
How do you present a convincing stage version of a novel whose main characters are horses? Theaterworks/USA has done it as its young audiences might: with few props and lots of imagination. 
 In the company's new musical adaptation of Anna Sewell's "Black Beauty," the actors' only equine accouterments are bright tails, which they carry behind their backs, hands clasped. It's a brilliant touch: chests thrust forward, forced to communicate with their heads, legs and feet, they seem to occupy horses' bodies automatically. Directed by David Armstrong, they all do a fine job, particularly Jamie LaVerdiere as Beauty and Megan Morrison as Ginger, the stable's resident cynic.
The hourlong production, intended for children 6 and older, follows the fortunes of Black Beauty, a turn-of-the-century carriage horse. Although his youth is sweet, Beauty suffers crippling injuries when saving his master's life in a stable fire, and a financial crisis leads to his sale to harsher and harsher owners. But since this is a children's story, Beauty's last ride is to a happy home rather than the glue factory.
Mindi Dickstein, who wrote the book and lyrics, perfectly balances poignancy and humor. When the horse-savvy trainer Little Joe Green (Peter Giambalvo) speaks to his charges, his words are perfectly comprehensible, whereas the speech of Lord Birtwick, an aristocrat, comes out "Blah, blah." The play also has the strength of Daniel Messe's music, which is as memorable as many a Broadway show's.
The only point that will be hard for today's children to accept is that there was ever a real contest between automobiles and horses. But it's to the play's credit that they'll leave the theater championing the old-fashioned kind of horsepower.
"Black Beauty," tomorrow and Sunday at 12:30 P.M. at the Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan. Tickets, $18.50; (212) 627-7373 or (212) 239-6200.
 
Meet the President
Although George Washington is one of the most familiar heroes of American history, the facts of his life are tangled in myth. There's that cherry-tree business and the jokes about wooden dentures.
"The story of the cherry tree was made up by Parson Weems, Washington's first biographer," said William Sommerfield, an actor and historian. As for the teeth, "they were made of carved animal bone."
Mr. Sommerfield should know. For almost 14 years, he's been portraying Washington at Mount Vernon, the first President's Virginia home. Now he's taking his act to the New-York Historical Society, where he will perform today through Sunday in a family program to be held in honor of the society's latest exhibition, "Treasures From Mount Vernon: George Washington Revealed."
"I try to bring in things that are not known about his life," Mr. Sommerfield said of his show, "things you wouldn't read in history books." Washington, for example, danced a mean minuet, which Mr. Sommerfield will demonstrate with the help of a young girl he chooses from the audience. Washington also learned to fence as a young man, and Mr. Sommerfield plans to teach basic swordsmanship to another volunteer.
"At the end, I do a Presidential news conference," Mr. Sommerfield said. "Anyone in the audience can ask me a question, and I answer as George Washington." Just remember, the Government didn't have interns in those days.
"Meet George Washington," through Sunday at 11:30 A.M. and 1:30 and 3:30 P.M. in the auditorium of the New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 873-3400. Free with admission: adults, $5; students and the elderly, $3; children 12 and under, free.
 
Turkeys' Thanksgiving
Most turkeys you'll see this weekend will be gobbled rather than gobbling. But that's not the case at the Queens Wildlife Center, where three will take center stage.
They're the lucky stars of Turkey Time Weekend, a tribute to the species Benjamin Franklin wanted to name the national bird. Although you may be just as glad the eagle won out, the zoo plans to increase appreciation for wild turkeys.
"They're a good example of a bird that's made a terrific comeback," said Stacie Nuttall, a spokeswoman for the zoo. "In the 1960's and 70's, they had been overhunted and their habitats destroyed."
Today and tomorrow, at 1:30 and 3 P.M., wildlife experts will offer special tours of the zoo aviary. "People are surprised to learn that turkeys can fly," Ms. Nuttall said. "And that they gobble to attract their mates." While visitors won't be allowed to touch the birds (you can't blame turkeys for being nervous at this time), they will see them closely.
On Sunday at the same hours, the zoo will present "animal encounters" with some of the turkey's North American neighbors, like Eastern box turtles, ringneck doves and corn snakes.
Children will also be encouraged to think and act like turkeys. Though the birds don't do much of the former, small guests can get into the spirit by making paper-bag puppets and turkey headdresses -- the only trimmings this Thanksgiving event will allow.
Turkey Time Weekend, through Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M. at the Queens Wildlife Center, 53-31 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 271-1500. Free with admission: adults, $2.50; the elderly, $1.25; children 3 to 12, 50 cents; under 3, free.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
LeoBurnett is named one of the business leaders of the century.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
LEO BURNETT, the adman behind the Marlboro Man, has been selected as one of the 20 most influential business leaders of the 20th century.
In 1935, Burnett started the Chicago agency, still bearing his name, that has grown into one of the world's largest. Burnett, who died in 1971 at 79, specialized in strong client relationships and building brands through the creation of colorful characters -- "critters" in the parlance of the Leo Burnett Company -- that personify the products they peddle, from the rugged Marlboro cowboy to the giddy Pillsbury doughboy to the tasteful tuna named Charlie. 
 Burnett is the only advertising executive honored by Time magazine in an issue saluting the business leaders, the third in a series of six special issues called the Time 100. Among the Time editors who compiled the list, there were two runners-up to Burnett: William Bernbach of Doyle Dane Bernbach and David Ogilvy, 87, of Ogilvy & Mather.
The issue -- titled "Builders and Titans" in the glib Timespeak of tycoons and pundits -- is to come out on Monday. A companion television program is scheduled to be broadcast by CBS at 10 P.M., Eastern and Pacific times, on Wednesday.
Among the other honorees are two whose firms are today clients of the Burnett agency: Walt Disney of the Walt Disney Company and Ray Kroc of the McDonald's Corporation. The list also includes Henry Ford; William H. Gates of the Microsoft Corporation; the cosmetics queen Estee Lauder, the only woman, and Akio Morita of the Sony Corporation.
"You can't look at the 20th century without looking at advertising," said Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time, the news weekly published by the Time Inc. division of Time Warner Inc. in New York.
"Advertising has affected our lives," he added, "and made us the type of consumer society we are."
Bill Saporito, a senior editor at Time who is business editor, agreed.
"The economy is two-thirds consumer spending," Mr. Saporito said, and if "one component of consumerism is an informed consumer," advertising is important in "giving the consumer information from which to make choices."
"Is Charlie the Tuna that voice of information?" he asked, chuckling. "Not always. But clearly, advertising is a driver."
The selections of Burnett and the other business leaders were made by a Time team that included Mr. Isaacson, Mr. Saporito and Stephen Koepp, an executive editor, in consultation with advertising industry executives and journalists.
One agency executive polled was Patrick R. Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott, the Minneapolis shop handling the Time account.
"Leo Burnett, David Ogilvy and Bill Bernbach are what most of us in this business would consider the Big Three," Mr. Fallon said. "But when they asked my opinion, I said there's no comparison: it's one person -- Bill Bernbach, who for me personally changed the face of advertising."
Mr. Saporito said: "It was a really close call. There was a really fierce group of Bernbach loyalists, and we heard from them."
"At the end of the day," he added, "what people associate advertising with in a television age is the types of images associated with Leo Burnett. So he gets the nod."
In an essay in the issue, Stuart Ewen, chairman of film and media studies at Hunter College in New York, writes that Burnett "built his reputation around the idea that 'share of market' could only be built on 'share of mind,' the capacity to stimulate consumers' basic desires and beliefs."
And the primary Burnett method for achieving that, Mr. Ewen writes, was through characters like the Marlboro Man, "for better or worse one of the most enduring advertising icons ever devised," selling Marlboro cigarettes for the Philip Morris Companies; Charlie, for Star-Kist tuna; Tony the Tiger, for Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, and the Jolly Green Giant, for Green Giant vegetables.
The essay also discusses the significant shifts in advertising since the heyday of Burnett.
"Though Burnett's talismans endure, they occupy a world where consumers are increasingly caustic about the products that they purchase," Mr. Ewen writes. "The effort by marketers to capitalize on the cynical mindset of an MTV generation has overwhelmed the quest for universal human archetypes."
A small article accompanying the Burnett essay discusses Bernbach, a co-founder of Doyle Dane, now part of the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, and Mr. Ogilvy, whose agency, now known as Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, is owned by WPP Group P.L.C.
The article praises Bernbach, who died in 1982, for leading "a velvet revolution in advertising" in the 1960's, "relying on creativity, sly humor and instinct." Doyle Dane work included the famous "Think small" campaign for the original Volkswagen Beetle, the "We try harder" ads for Avis and the "Hey, Mikey!" commercial for Life cereal.
The article compliments Mr. Ogilvy for working for only those clients "whose products he felt were beyond reproach" and creating such enduring brand imagery as the dapper "Man in the Hathaway shirt," always sporting an eyepatch, and the bearded Commander Schweppes, the veddy British spokesman for Schweppes mixers.
Another reason that Burnett prevailed over Bernbach and Mr. Ogilvy may be that he is one of the few founders of modern Madison Avenue with a distinctive identity. His agency continues to promote the red apples he set out in bowls at the office, his black copy pencils and his sayings like "Reach for the stars."
"Leo Burnett has always been a titan in our eyes," said Richard B. Fizdale, chairman and chief executive at the Burnett agency. "You cannot work here for any length of time and not come into contact with him."
What Mr. Fizdale described as the "tiny eight-person shop" that Burnett began now ranks No. 13 among the world's agencies, with estimated billings of $6 billion from clients like Disney, McDonald's, the Coca-Cola Company, the Kellogg Company and the Procter & Gamble Company.
The timing of the Time selection is serendipitous for the agency. After difficulties with lost accounts and turmoil among top executives in 1996 and 1997, there has been a rebound in recent months that included new assignments from P.& G., Diageo P.L.C., the H. J. Heinz Company and the Sara Lee Corporation.

HEADLINE: New Rules Alter Plans for Diesel Engines

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The walls and roof are almost finished on a huge new General Motors diesel engine factory in southwestern Ohio. Several thousand engineers in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois are still developing new diesel engines for future cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
But the industry's broad plans to start putting diesels into millions of vehicles early in the next century have suddenly been thrown into confusion. California environmental regulators voted earlier this month to eliminate the more lenient pollution standards that have long prevailed for diesel-powered vehicles. Instead, diesel engines will have to meet the same pollution standards as gasoline-powered vehicles. 
 These gasoline engine standards are being tightened, so regulators say that it will be almost impossible to design diesel engines to meet the new rules, despite considerable progress over the last decade in the design of cleaner diesels. The result is a virtual ban on diesel engines in California, which accounts for a tenth of the nation's auto sales, once the new rules are phased in between 2004 and 2007.
Auto industry executives are furious. They had been counting on diesel engines as part of the answer to environmentalists' concerns about global warming and poor fuel economy, particularly the low gas mileage of full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
The latest diesel engines use as much as 33 percent less fuel per mile as their gasoline counterparts, according to auto industry engineers. And while even the cleanest diesels still produce slightly more soot and smog-causing gases than gasoline engines, diesels emit up to 20 percent less carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.
G.M. in particular had been counting on diesels to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases that may contribute to global warming, and the company is particularly upset by the latest setback. "It's a major concern coming out of the California regulations," said John F. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation. "It goes to the fundamentals of what is our long-term strategy for dealing with emissions and so forth."
Engine manufacturers are even angrier. They contend that if they build gasoline engines, they will be criticized for contributing to global warming, and if they build diesel engines, they will be accused of contributing to smog and soot.
"Which environmentalist group is going to be in power tomorrow, so I know whether diesels are going to be the greatest thing or the worst thing?" asked Timothy D. Leuliette, the vice chairman of Detroit Diesel, a unit of the Penske Corporation.
California regulators say that reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is not their problem, and should be handled by the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. "Our clear, unmistakable authority to enact regulations is to reduce urban smog," said Allan S. Hirsch, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. "Global warming is an international issue and the U.S. E.P.A. ought to be the agency taking the lead."
The E.P.A. is drafting its own new- vehicle pollution standards, to be released early next year, and declined to discuss what they would include. The agency has a tradition of adopting regulations slightly less strict than California's. The California Air Resources Board's own technical staff recommended a more lenient standard covering diesels, but the board rejected this idea after strong pleas from environmentalists during the hours before the board's final vote on Nov. 5.
Many American environmentalists are dubious about diesels. They point to research indicating that tiny soot particles can cause cancer, and warn that diesels will always create somewhat more soot than gasoline engines.
Environmentalists also warn that converting to diesels will limit opportunities to tighten pollution rules even further someday. And they contend that diesel engines are not the only way to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases -- alternatives include building smaller vehicles, developing advanced technologies like fuel cells or even taking such simple steps as installing multivalve gasoline engines, said Daniel Becker, an energy efficiency expert at the Sierra Club.
Mr. Becker said that in installing diesel engines, auto makers were not really interested in addressing global warming. Instead, he said, they want to keep building ever-bigger sport utility vehicles, which earn the highest profit margins, and must install diesels to continue meeting Federal fuel-economy rules. The light-truck operations of G.M., the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. are all struggling to comply with these rules.
Auto makers are beginning to install relatively fuel-efficient multi-valve engines in some of their large sport utility vehicles, but are reluctant to do so on a wide scale because this hurts the vehicles' towing capacity. And the American public shows little interest in buying small fuel-efficient cars, said Robert J. Eaton, a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
Auto makers, particularly G.M., last tried to sell diesel engines during the oil crisis of the early 1980's, when high gasoline prices made some buyers interested in diesels' greater fuel economy. But the diesel engines marketed then were comparatively smoky, noisy and smelly. They have virtually disappeared from the light-vehicle market in the United States.
Yet since the early 1980's, enormous progress has been made in building better diesels. The latest diesels coming out of the laboratories emit no visible smoke, produce up to 90 percent less soot and generate up to 75 percent less noise than the vehicles of the early 1980's, industry engineers say. Even the smell has faded.
Manufacturers have spent heavily on diesel development mainly because of these engines' popularity in Europe. Fuel prices are four times as high per gallon in Europe as in the United States, and there has been considerable public interest there in global warming. Diesels are now installed in 22 percent of new family vehicles in Europe, compared with less than 2 percent here. Engine factories have been unable to keep up with demand in Europe, and diesels are expected to reach 30 percent of the European market, once the factories catch up.
The auto industry has a history of saying that further pollution reductions are impossible, only to find ways to comply with new regulations. Patrick E. Charbonneau, the vice president for engine engineering at the Navistar International Corporation, which is designing diesel engine prototypes for the next generation of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles, said that research on diesel emissions was not as advanced as research on gasoline engine emissions. Further spending might lead to breakthroughs, he said.
But making diesel engines as clean as gasoline engines is particularly difficult because current regulations, particularly in California, allow diesel fuel to be much dirtier than gasoline. California regulations require oil companies to remove almost all of the sulfur from gasoline, for example, because sulfur clogs catalytic converters and allows a vehicle's emissions to soar. But California's rules allow diesel to have nearly 17 times the sulfur of gasoline.
Mr. Hirsch said that the state's environmental regulators had not focused on sulfur levels in diesel until now, but would try to work with the Environmental Protection Agency on the issue next year.

HEADLINE: Blockbuster in Hong Kong

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG,Nov. 26

 BODY:
The Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation entered Hong Kong's video-rental market by agreeing today to take control of the territory's largest rental chain. Blockbuster, a unit of the American entertainment company Viacom Inc., signed a conditional agreement and has 30 days to buy some assets of the bankrupt chain, KPS Retail Stores Ltd. KPS had assets of $176 million (Hong Kong), or $22.7 million (United States), its liquidator, Ernst & Young, said earlier this month. Like other retailers, KPS has been hard hit by Hong Kong's recession.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:
Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. 

BLUES TRAVELER, Roseland, 239 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Ten years into its career, Blues Traveler gives its fans an occasion to twirl in their tie-dyed T-shirts while the band stretches whiny songs into interminable jams. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $22.50 (Jon Pareles).
 
* RAY BROWN, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. It can be heard immediately: the precision of his time, his thick sound and his faultless intonation. Mr. Brown, a bassist and a major figure in be-bop, is simply apart from the rest of the competition. And he's a fine band leader; his tunes and arrangements are detailed and make trio performances more than improvisations on a theme. He'll be joined by Geoff Keezer on piano and Karriem Riggins on drums. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday, sets are at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; the cover is $35 and the minimum is $5 (Peter Watrous).
 
COMBUSTIBLE EDISON, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. In Combustible Edison's neo-lounge music, easy-listening tempos and cheesy keyboard tones enfold angular jazz harmonies and oddball structures. The music suggests that martinis were the hallucinogens of the 1950's, plunging their users into realms of exotica and uncharted strangeness. Tomorrow night at 9:30 and 11; admission is $12 (Pareles).
 
* MARSHALL CRENSHAW, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. He's a scholar of rock-and-roll dreams, a man who knows how to shape a melody and a trusty live wire in concert. In short, Marshall Crenshaw is a local treasure, and he deserves devotion. Currently preparing for the birth of a baby and the recording of a new album that he promises will emanate vintage cool, he will probably break out some fine new material for these gigs and stretch out on some classics. Tonight, Michael Shelley opens the show; tomorrow, the Moonlighters share the bill. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10; tickets are $12 (Ann Powers).
 
ELVIS CRESPO, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2672. He's the king of the radio with his hit "Suavemente." It's merengue, and as usual, it comes in one flavor. But Mr. Crespo can move and entertain, and he'll be joined by the salsa singer Jerry Rivera. The show tomorrow night starts at 11; the cover is $30 (Watrous).
 
* DAVE DOUGLAS'S TINY BELL TRIO, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. With this band Mr. Douglas runs Eastern European music through the post-Ornette Coleman wringer. Given all of the band members' other diversions (they might be in 20 groups among the three of them), the band hasn't performed in quite a while. Gearing up for its next recording, it will be playing new material through the weekend. Sets, tonight through Sunday night, are at 8 and 9:30; admission is $10, and there is a one-drink minimum (Ben Ratliff).
 
CANO ESTREMERA, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2672. A night of five bands, including Mr. Estremera and his group; he's considered one of Puerto Rico's finest improvisers. He'll have some heavy company tonight, including the singers Hector Tricoche, Sammy Gonzalez and Luisito Carrion. The show starts at 9; the cover is $10 for women and $15 for men (Watrous).
 
CARLOS GARNETT QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. Once a satellite in Miles Davis's orbit (he played on "Get Up With It" and "On the Corner"), the saxophonist Carlos Garnett has been playing more traditional fare in recent years. He appears here with a rhythm section including the extraordinary young pianist James Hurt. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 9, 10:30 and midnight; there is an $8 cover charge and a two-drink minimum (Ratliff).
 
* EL GRAN COMBO, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. One of the Caribbean's great bands, El Gran Combo has been playing around town fairly often recently, and that's a good thing. Puerto Rico's swing machine -- it developed out of the percussionist Cortijo's band -- led by Rafael Ithier, is still powerful. It's elegant and reaches its ecstasy carefully, step by step. And there's always the choreography, which is controlled yet extravagant. The band's an experience. It will be joined by Tony Vega, a good salsa singer. The show tomorrow night starts at 11:30; the cover is $20 (Watrous).
 
ARLO GUTHRIE AND PETE SEEGER, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Every Thanksgiving weekend brings this annual celebration of two cantankerous American traditions: the tall tale, as spun by Mr. Guthrie in songs and between them, and the determination to crusade through song, as Mr. Seeger has through his long career. The audience will be there to sing along. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M.; tickets are $20.50 to $32.50 (Pareles).
 
HOT TUNA, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street , Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from the Jefferson Airplane, but it has now outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis; with Hot Tuna's electric lineup, he also unleashes one of the most distinctive solo styles of the psychedelic era, burning with cold like liquid nitrogen. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $30 (Pareles).
 
KISS, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300. All Kiss had to do was reconvene its original lineup, put the makeup back on, hook up the fireworks and stage blood, and voila! -- nostalgic old fans raced younger thrill-seekers for tickets. The heavy-breathing songs are workmanlike; the spectacle is its own reward. Tonight at 8 P.M.; tickets are $30 to $85 (Pareles).
 
VICTOR LEWIS QUINTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Lewis is a marvelous drummer, known in the 80's for his associations with Stan Getz and Bobby Watson, and in the 90's for freelancing and playing with his own band, which constitutes the menu for this weekend. The band includes the saxophonist Seamus Blake, whose John Wayne style of delivery challenges the theory that fast playing equals good playing, as well as the pianist Stephen Scott and trumpeter Terell Stafford, important contributors to the current scene. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with 12:30 sets tonight and tomorrow night; admission is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $17.50 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum at all shows (Ratliff).
 
STEPHIN MERRITT, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street between Delancey and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Stephin Merritt, the abashed creative genius leading Magnetic Fields and several other underground combos, writes standards for individualists that evoke Cole Porter with a cold while never abandoning their roots in moony 1980's New Wave pop. Here, he does the solo thing as part of this Lower East Side club's singer-songwriter series, although he'll probably bring along a few interesting friends for occasional support. Sunday night at 9 and 10:30; tickets are $8 (Powers).
 
* PINETOP PERKINS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Pinetop Perkins, 85, was the longtime pianist in Muddy Waters' Chicago blues band. He has the entire blues vocabulary in his fingers, from boogie and shuffle bass lines to florid barrelhouse trills and filigrees. But he plays his solos like a cardsharp who only shows what he needs to, and his ruthless economy translates into pithy, ornery blues. Tonight and tomorrow night, with sets at 9:30, 11 and 12:30. Admission is $15 (Pareles).
 
* ERIC REED TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan (212) 576-2232. The pianist Eric Reed plays in a sweet style, radiant with gospel and the blues. He's a sentimentalist, but that's only one card in a packed hand. He's increasingly inventive with song structure and arrangement; he can also set fire to a band. And the accompanists -- the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Rodney Green -- are probably enough to insure that this gig is worth hearing. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $20 cover ($15 at midnight) and $10 minimum; on Sunday night, there is one set, at 7, and the cover is $15 with a $10 minimum. A new practice begins at the club on Sunday: half price (Sunday only) for anyone under 18 (Ratliff).
SASHA AND DIGWEED, at Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea (212) 462-9422 or (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disk jockey team of John Digweed and Sasha. On their album "Northern Exposure," steady repetition holds time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Tonight; doors open at 11, with John Digweed and Sasha starting at 12:30 and continuing well past dawn. Admission is $25 (Pareles).
CLARK TERRY, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The trumpeter and fluegelhornist developed one of the great distinct styles of the 1950's and 60's, and his solos with Duke Ellington are marvels of rhythmic and melodic development. Like the better, younger members of the orchestra, Mr. Terry assimilated and used both swing and be-bop ideas and turned it all into something important. His approach is, like Thelonious Monk's, above copying; it's simply too personal. Mr. Terry's band includes Don Friedman on piano, David Glasser on saxophone, Marcus McLaurine on bass and Sylvia Cuenca on drums. Sets are 9:30 and 11:30 tonight through Sunday. The cover is $20 on Friday and Saturday; $15 on Sunday with a $10 minimum at all shows (Watrous).
 
THE TRAGICALLY HIP, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. New York's usually invisible Canadian contingent should turn out in force for the Tragically Hip, a band that's hugely popular up north. Long before the Dave Matthews Band or the Wallflowers, the Tragically Hip was matching disillusioned lyrics to 60's-flavored folk-rock, turning riff songs into chipper, extended jams that throw off their frustration in brash guitar workouts. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $22.50 (Pareles).
 
RANDY WESTON, Iridium, 48 West 63d Street, Manhattan (212) 582-2121. The pianist Randy Weston has been essential in the process of bringing African elements into jazz; he's traveled all over the continent and is tireless as its exponent. Before he took that route, though, he was a student of Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington, and no other pianist in jazz has the Ellington touch that he does: ringing, big and percussive. The band includes Benny Powell on trombone, Talib Kibwe on saxophone, Alex Blake on bass and Neil Clark on percussion. The sets are at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M. and midnight with no third set on Sunday. The cover is $25 and the minimum is $10 (Watrous).

OPEC Leaders Delay Decision On Further Cuts in Production

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, deeply divided over the best strategy for propping up sagging crude oil prices, took no action yesterday on making further production cuts, delaying any decision until March.
Rilwanu Lukman, the secretary general of OPEC, which was meeting in Vienna, said that the organization already had an agreement in place from June for restraining oil production and that any further agreement would be decided at a meeting in March. 
 The oil markets showed only a modest reaction to OPEC's move, since it was widely expected that the organization would merely continue with the current production cuts, which are scheduled to run out in June. In London, Brent crude oil for January delivery ended the day up 6 cents, at $10.96 a barrel, after a slight decline earlier. The oil markets in New York were closed yesterday in observance of Thanksgiving.
"This was about the minimum that was expected," said John H. Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a group in New York that does research for the oil industry. "If they really stick to their quotas it might at least put a floor on oil prices."
The price of crude oil has fallen by about 40 percent since the beginning of the year because demand has declined and inventories have grown as a result of the economic downturn in Asia and the warm autumn in the United States.
Earlier this year, OPEC agreed to cut production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily supply of 74 million barrels. Leading the cuts were Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which are OPEC's largest producers, and Mexico, which is not an OPEC member but is also a big oil producer.
There was dissension among the members, with some ministers, including Youcef Yousfi of Algeria, advocating deeper cuts. "I would prefer to have seen further output cuts now," Mr. Yousfi told Bloomberg News after the meeting.
Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar-Zanganeh, argued that Saudi Arabia should make further cuts in its production.
Saudi Arabia had replaced most of the oil production lost when Iraqi supplies were cut off after its defeat in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
But the Saudis said OPEC should enforce its existing cutbacks. This has been a point of contention, because some members have failed to make all the cuts they pledged.
As a result, crude oil prices are very likely to remain low.
"Unless they do something in March, prices will stay very low through 1999," Mr. Lichtblau said. "It's good for the consumer. You will have the lowest gasoline and heating oil prices since 1986."
The lower prices, however, have hit the oil industry hard, with some major oil companies cutting already-lean work forces back further and trimming exploration budgets.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
One Big Bite After the Other Leads to Indigestion for Banks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Wall Street banks earn big profits greasing the wheels for companies to buy one another. But when banks merge, sparks often fly.
Banks rarely blend well. The best investment banks have such strong cultures they are sometimes compared to cults. Their most important assets are not loans and custody accounts but traders and deal-makers -- assets that, as the industry saying goes, walk out the front door every night. 
 If, as expected, Deutsche Bank A.G. and Bankers Trust complete what could become the largest international bank merger in history early next week, then they can ponder all those challenges and one more: Bankers Trust itself has been a ravenous acquirer of late, and its most aggressive purchase, $2.8 billion for the boutique investment bank Alex. Brown & Company of Baltimore, has caused some indigestion. Analysts said the difficulties in merging those two banks should raise a warning flag for Deutsche Bank, which will try to bridge a much wider gulf between two companies on two continents.
Like the German and American banks, Bankers Trust and Alex. Brown had different cultures, about as different as two East Coast houses of finance can be. Alex. Brown, the oldest independent investment bank in the United States before the merger, is a button-down provincial firm that specializes in financing new companies -- it underwrote initial offerings of stock in Microsoft and Starbucks, for example -- as well as managing money for wealthy clients. Bankers Trust is a swank New York firm best known for designer derivatives, an impressive client list and risky bets in emerging markets.
On paper, that made the two seem more complementary than redundant, and merger-related layoffs were insignificant when the two were joined more than a year ago. But the process of integrating them proved trickier than expected, current and former BT Alex. Brown employees and outside analysts said.
Alex. Brown has tussled with its New York parent for months. Some issues are minor, like whether Bankers Trust should appear on Alex. Brown business cards. Others are more weighty, like determining how bankers should be paid. Alex. Brown managers have complained about what they see as extravagant perks afforded to their Bankers Trust colleagues, especially the president, Frank N. Newman.
The disagreements have taken a toll. Of a dozen top Alex. Brown executives at the time of the merger, six are gone. A. B. Krongard, the chief executive and the man who made the firm a top contender in stock underwriting nationwide, left to take a senior post at the Central Intelligence Agency. The co-head of investment banking resigned. Two other senior executives defected to Legg Mason, a crosstown rival.
In recent weeks, top Bankers Trust executives have rushed to Baltimore to soothe flared tempers, especially after the parent company reported big losses in its international trading operation and saw its share price plummet.
"The two companies are entirely different and don't mesh culturally," said Gerard Cassidy, a senior vice president and equity analyst at Tucker Anthony. "It's always hard to integrate firms, especially when a New York bank clashes with a smaller, non-New York organization used to being on its own."
Bankers Trust officials argue that the merger has worked out well. Some departures from senior ranks were expected, they said. And they point out that the new BT Alex. Brown has not had more troubles than the newly formed Citigroup or the merged BankAmerica, both of which have sought to meld securities companies with traditional banking operations and have seen wrenching turnover in senior staff.
BT Alex. Brown also says it has realized some sought-after synergies. Bankers Trust's traditional focus on bond markets, especially junk bonds, has complemented Alex. Brown's stock market expertise. "We both had what the other needed," said Alexander Mason, a Bankers Trust managing director and co-head of corporate finance for BT Alex. Brown. For example, he said, Bankers Trust and Alex. Brown teamed up to underwrite a complex $1 billion stock offering for Chancellor Media, the owner of radio stations, earlier this year -- work that might have been assigned to another investment bank if the two banks could not offer combined services.
Some analysts agree. Brad Ball, a bank industry specialist for Credit Suisse First Boston, said that at least before turmoil in world markets pummeled the financial markets serving start-up and highly leveraged companies, the stomping grounds of Alex. Brown and Bankers Trust, synergies were evident. He estimates that matching Bankers Trust's client list with Alex. Brown services, and vice versa, led to a one-third increase in business for the combined entity.
Still, few deny the merger has been rocky at times. And several Alex. Brown bankers said they were wary of taking on another merger partner before resolving issues from the first marriage. "People are willing to give it a chance, but I would not say they're optimistic," one current employee said.
The frustrations all seem to involve cultural issues. Examples abound. Even the most senior Alex. Brown executives were accustomed to flying economy class cross-country with few exceptions. Their colleagues at Bankers Trust fly first class. Alex. Brown, a pillar of the Baltimore business community, took special pride in its annual effort to recruit new bankers, a function now largely controlled by Bankers Trust in New York.
Several current and recently departed Alex. Brown executives said they took umbrage when Mr. Newman, who had a senior position in the Treasury Department before becoming the president of Bankers Trust, came for meetings at Alex. Brown offices in a style they described as imperial. He flew in a rented corporate jet with a retinue of bodyguards, equipped with microphones on their suit lapels. One executive said a bodyguard barred others from using the men's room when Mr. Newman was inside.
Bankers Trust staff parties, including one annual meeting at the New York Public Library where the cast of the Broadway musical "High Society" provided the entertainment, were described as lavish. "We would rather have had chicken and rice and a short pep talk and kept the rest as a bonus," one Alex. Brown executive joked.
A Bankers Trust official said some at Alex. Brown had complained about entertainment and Mr. Newman's personal perks. But the official said that the issue had been exaggerated and that Bankers Trust spending was neither extravagant nor unusual.
Some at Alex. Brown have clung to traditional ways of doing things, even when they run up against what has often become standard Wall Street practice. For example, Alex. Brown has fought to retain a commission-oriented pay system for some traders and brokers while Bankers Trust has pushed a now industry-standard annual bonus plan, people involved with the debate said.
The two banks also butted heads over differing perceptions of how to treat clients. Because Bankers Trust is a big supplier of derivatives, which are financial instruments tied to an underlying security, it frequently enters into contracts in which it takes the opposite side of a bet from a client, becoming what bankers call a counterparty. That is a normal service many big banks provide. But the old Alex. Brown did not deal much in derivatives. Some at the Baltimore bank found the idea of trading against a client inimical. "We never put ourselves in a position that we would root for a client's transaction to be a bad one," one former Alex. Brown banker said.
Some of those issues seem likely to be resolved in coming months. "I think you need two years to make a merger like that work, when people stop thinking about it as us and them," a Bankers Trust official said.
But the unrest at Alex. Brown cannot be a good omen for Deutsche Bank, which has a record of buying securities companies that perform less well than hoped under its tutelage. The new German-American bank will have to combine far-flung securities operations into a single efficient one. That probably means centralizing investment banking and asset management in New York and London, not Baltimore. Some layoffs seem inevitable, as does a further loss of autonomy for the managers at Alex. Brown.
For the Deutsche Bank-Bankers Trust merger to make sense for the German bank, expenses, mainly people, will have to be cut by $1.5 billion a year, Mr. Ball said. That figure is higher than what Deutsche Bank officials have hinted at so far. Mr. Ball said he thought most of the savings would come from streamlining United States operations.
Michael Flanagan of Financial Service Analytics in Philadelphia sees trouble ahead. "I don't think Deutsche Bank will be satisfied with what they have now in BT Alex. Brown," he said. "It doesn't level the playing field for them against Merrill Lynch or Goldman, Sachs. You will probably see further consolidation and reorganization, which will really add to the already tense situation there."

HEADLINE: Markets in Asia and Europe Advance in Light Trading

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Stock markets in Asia and Europe advanced today, as Japanese investors awaited economic stimulus measures and the European markets percolated with rumors of a big oil merger.
Tokyo's main barometer, the 225-issue Nikkei index, gained 134.30 points, or 0.89 percent, closing at 15,207.77. The index rebounded from a drop of 91.17 points on Wednesday. 
 Share prices rose amid optimism that recent moves to stabilize Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Government would prove beneficial to the ailing Japanese economy.
Investors have been encouraged by an alliance between Mr. Obuchi's ruling party and the minority Liberal Party, which has called for suspending an unpopular sales tax and trimming the Government bureaucracy, traders said.
The main stock index has rallied about 800 points this week. On Tuesday, it closed above 15,000 points for the first time since Aug. 25.
In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng index rose 57.93 points, or 0.5 percent, closing at 10,778.92. The Hang Seng has gained 8.4 percent in two weeks. HSBC Holdings, the financial giant, led the charge today, rising $5 (Hong Kong) to its highest level in more than six months.
Most other Asian markets posted slim gains or losses, with the exception of South Korea, where shares fell 3.8 percent. Analysts said the losses were caused by broad selling by local institutional investors to hedge against the futures market.
In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 72.6 points, or 1.26 percent, closing at 5,827.9 points.
Some traders attributed the gains to a Financial Times report that said that United States oil giants Exxon and Mobil were in an advanced stage of merger talks. Several European oil companies saw their shares benefit from the prospect of continued industry consolidation, led by the British-traded shares of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies, which rose 4 percent. British Petroleum, which stunned the industry in August with its $49 billion acquisition of Amoco, also rose.
Most other European markets rose, too. Frankfurt's DAX closed 2.3 percent higher, the Paris CAC-40 rose 1.7 percent and the main indexes in Milan and Madrid both rose 2.6 percent.
Volume in most markets was light, as traders took cues from the United States, where markets were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Old Guard Repels Challenge At Staid Marks & Spencer

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The clothes it sells are, mildly put, conservative. Its line in precooked food caters to everyone from brown-bag lunchers to dinner-party hosts too pressed to attend to the cuisine themselves. Marks & Spencer P.L.C. is -- in other words -- dependable.
Until now. 
 For the last month, the venerable British retailer has been roiled by the unthinkable: an unseemly board room tussle aired in public after profits cascaded and the company stock plummeted.
Britain's financial journals, moreover, gleefully picked over what they called Marks & Spencer's parochialism and introverted management culture, criticizing as slow footed its effort to take its distinctive green and white storefront to a broader European market. The company's autocratic chairman, Sir Richard Greenbury, even flew back from India to halt disclosures about a power struggle over the succession to his job.
Today, the company -- known affectionately to many in Britain as Marks and Sparks -- moved to stanch the bloodletting. After a board meeting that lasted into Wednesday night, Sir Richard's heir apparent, Peter Salsbury, was named to succeed him, and an insurgent executive who had sought to usurp him was pressed into early retirement. Sir Richard, 62 -- who had been both chairman and chief executive -- was seen as having triumphed by securing the post of nonexecutive chairman until 2000. Mr. Salsbury, 49, will be the new chief executive beginning in February. The deputy chairman, Keith Oates, 56, will retire in January after 15 years with the company.
The markets were not impressed. Shares of Marks & Spencer, which have underperformed the London Stock Exchange blue-chip index all year, fell 21 pence today, to 425 pence, reflecting investors' assessments that the new chief executive might not be able to turn around the company's sliding fortunes. Profits fell 23 percent in the first half of 1998, the first drop in six years, and the decline apparently precipitated Mr. Oates's bid for the top job.
The crisis in what has been known as Britain's most profitable retailer comes after criticism by outsiders who said the company had failed to introduce new ideas to remain competitive. Sir Richard has been with the company since he joined it at 17. Mr. Salsbury is a Marks & Spencer lifer who joined after leaving the London School of Economics 28 years ago. According to analysts who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Oates -- with only 14 years at the company -- was seen as a newcomer with a background in finance rather than retailing.
Marks & Spencer pioneered the sale of pre-prepared food for the upscale market in its stores, only to be challenged by other Main Street retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury. It bought Brooks Brothers in the United States, but though the acquisition introduced button-down Oxford-cloth shirts to a British mass market, it has lost money. A global expansion plan valued at $3.7 billion was announced last year, just as consumer demand was about to falter. And Sir Richard insisted on a high level of British content in his products, which made them expensive in Continental Europe.
The woes escalated this month when Mr. Oates, the deputy chairman, sensed he would be passed over for promotion to the top job when Sir Richard divided his titles -- a move that initially had been scheduled for next May. According to reports in the British media, Mr. Oates appealed to nonexecutive board members for support. That brought Sir Richard flying back from a vacation in India to put down the revolt and defend his management style.
"I'm not an ogre," he said. "I'm blunt and I'm competitive."
Mr. Oates said today that he was "disappointed to be retiring early from Marks & Spencer."
And Sir Richard said it was "very sad that as part of the modernizing of our top management structure, there is no longer a full-time role for Keith."

Talks Between Oil Giants Reflect Global Realities
The talks between Exxon and Mobil on a possible combination show how global competition and advancing technology have made what were once seen as unthinkable deals practical and even necessary.
Even industry giants have been forced to seek ways to cut costs on huge, expensive international projects. In addition, oil companies have decided that they will not be rescued soon by a rebound in oil prices. Page A1.
 
Health Insurance Costs to Rise
Many working Americans will have increases of 8 percent to 20 percent or more on health insurance premiums next year in the sharpest price increases since the early 1990's. A1.
 
OPEC Won't Cut Production
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, deeply divided over the best strategy for propping up sagging crude oil prices, took no action on making further production cuts, delaying any decision until March. C3.
 
Default Expected on Soviet Debt
Russia has told Western bankers that it will renege on the terms of repaying $28 billion in Soviet-era debt to creditors, effectively paving the way for a default on interest payments next month, bankers in London said. C3.

A LOOK AHEAD
Consumer and retailer confidence appears strong this year, but retailers say they are increasingly concerned about 1999.
 
Consumers are expecting to spend an average of $814 each, or 4.5 percent more than last year. Of that total, consumers say they have already spent $163, compared with $74 at this time last year.
 
Total holiday spending is expected to reach $172 billion to $174 billion, which would represent a 5 percent to 6 percent increase over last year.
 
Nearly 80 percent of shoppers say they will visit a discount department store to do some of their holiday buying, up from 70 percent in 1997.
 
Nearly 72 percent of consumers will buy apparel this season, and 65 percent plan to buy toys.
 
For the 30 percent of internet users who will buy gifts on line, the average percent of their expenditure will be 27 percent of their total gift budget, up from 25 percent last year.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
A Low-Rise Complex for Coney Island

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Eighty-six attached single-family houses are to be built in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn over the next two years, bringing to a close an effort, begun 15 years ago, to attract moderate- and middle-income families to the waterside neighborhood.
The new houses, called Sea Beach Homes, will rise on 10 scattered and mostly empty lots along Mermaid Avenue, from West 15th to West 33d Street. When completed, they will bring the number of such low-rise homes built in the neighborhood since 1983 to nearly 1,000. 
 The $13.2 million project is being developed by Leewood Real Estate Group of Bulls Head, Staten Island. It will be built in two phases, with construction of the initial 62 three-bedroom homes, priced at $135,900, to start next month. Completion is scheduled for next fall. Once those units are completed, construction is to start on the remaining 24 homes, of the same size and price.
Leewood also plans to use 10 other lots on Mermaid Avenue to build 75,000 square feet of retail space, mostly freestanding stores or small retail strips. There will also be eight buildings combining 1,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and two apartments above. It is expected that the homeowner will run the store, live in one apartment and rent out the other.
"This project is the perfect segue from residential to retail and will enable residents to benefit from additional retail and service-related opportunities," said R. Randy Lee, president of Leewood, which has built 300 single-family homes in the neighborhood over the last decade.
Both Sea Beach Homes and the retail project are advancing under two city programs: one to fuel the construction of affordable housing, the other to spur the development of stores to serve the new population. The sponsors include New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Housing Partnership, an affiliate of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce.
The 86 houses in the Sea Beach project are part of the New Homes Program, under which houses are built on city-owned land, and city and state subsidies help keep them affordable to families earning $33,000 to $70,950. For Sea Beach Homes, Leewood received a subsidy of $15,900 per unit.
The project is also eligible for a 25-year tax abatement from the city, which for 20 years will keep the annual taxes on the units at $144, compared with $1,620 without the abatement. Taxes will be phased in over the last five years.
Each house will have 1,800 square feet of space, a 500-square-foot backyard and one parking space in surface parking lots in front of or behind the homes. Mr. Lee said contracts have been signed or reservations taken on all of the first 62 homes.
In the mid-1960's, the city declared Coney Island an urban renewal area. Many of its small brick homes and bungalows were razed to make way for 14 rental towers, with a total of 5,000 apartments, many of them for low-income tenants.
In the early 70's, residents of the area rejected any additional rental towers and successfully campaigned for the single-family homes, the largest concentration of such homes built under the New Homes Program, said Veronica M. White, president of the New York City Housing Partnership.
The Sea Beach homes, when added to the others already built, "will change the character of Mermaid Avenue, now dotted with vacant rubble-strewn lots, and help the community become more ethnically and economically diverse," said Judi Orlando, executive director of the Astella Development Corporation, the project's nonprofit community sponsor.
It will also "serve as a catalyst for additional commercial development," Ms. Orlando said, noting that the 75,000 square feet of retail space "will fill in most of the remaining gaps" along Mermaid Avenue. The city also plans to turn 11.7 acres, about nine blocks west of the majority of Sea Beach homes, into a 6,500-seat minor-league baseball park and athletic complex. The site, between West 16th and West 21st Streets and Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk, was once occupied by Steeplechase Park.
Leewood's retail project, Mermaid Commons, is part of the two-year-old Alliance for Neighborhood Commerce and Home Ownership Program, or Anchor. Under it, developers receive financial incentives like construction loans and loan guarantees to build retail projects on empty sites leased from the city in neighborhoods where new housing has gone up. Developers must attract additional financing from private sources and market the projects to tenants. The Coney Island project is one of eight, either under way or expected to begin next year, that together will produce 375,000 square feet of retail space, according to the partnership.
Mr. Lee said the 67,000 square feet of traditional retail space will cost $10 million and be constructed over the next five years.
Meanwhile, Leewood will start selling the eight residential and commercial buildings, a demonstration project under the Anchor program. "It provides people with a place to live and work, giving them a bigger emotional and financial stake in the community," Mr. Lee said.
Ms. White added that the concept would be expanded to other neighborhoods if successful.
The eight buildings, to cost $2.5 million, will rise on a single site on Mermaid Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets. Each will have a 1,000-square-foot ground-level store topped by two 1,200-square-foot three-bedroom apartments. They will be sold for $292,000 to people with annual incomes of $40,000 to $70,950.
Construction will start after four of the buildings have been sold. Mr. Lee said that he expected those sales to occur by late spring and that it would take one year to complete all eight buildings.

HEADLINE: Valentin M. Berezhkov, 82, Interpreter for Stalin at Talks

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Valentin M. Berezhkov, a Russian who interpreted for Stalin and Molotov at conferences that they, Roosevelt and Churchill attended during World War II, died last Friday at his home in Claremont, Calif. He was 82.
At his death he was the Diane and Guilford Glazer Distinguished Visiting Professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles. 
 "I have had the good fortune to be witness to some of the events that have helped shape our century," Dr. Berezhkov wrote in his volume of memoirs, "At Stalin's Side: His Interpreter's Memoirs from the October Revolution to the Fall of the Dictator's Empire" (1994, Carol). He was also a Soviet diplomat and a journalist during the Soviet era.
But in 1991, with the Soviet system disintegrating, he and his wife Valeria moved to Claremont, Calif. He went on to teach at Pomona, Pitzer and Harvey Mudd Colleges, which are all in California, before going to Occidental. The subjects he taught included World War II and the cold war. He also lectured widely about Russia and about Russian-American relations.
In his book Dr. Berezhkov, a tall, strapping man with flowing white hair, recorded his impression of Stalin when he first saw him, late in 1941 in Moscow. At that time Dr. Berezhkov was a promising young interpreter. He had been picked to work for Stalin, who was meeting with a British-American delegation.
"When I took a look at him, I felt a shock," Dr. Berezhkov wrote. "He was completely unlike the image of Stalin I had formed in my mind. He was short and haggard, his tired face, covered with smallpox scars, was the color of the earth. His uniform hung loosely on his lean frame."
Dr. Berezhkov also recalled: "Stalin always treated me in the same, even indifferent, manner. Sometimes it seemed to me that he was looking right through me." But he described Stalin's fury after he was kept awake by a blind peasant's barking dog: he ordered a guard to kill the dog, saying that if he failed to do so, "I will order you killed, too."
In an interview after the book came out, Dr. Berezhkov recalled that sometimes Stalin would ask a nervous subordinate suspiciously: "Why don't you look me in the eye? What are you afraid of? Why are your eyes shifting around?"
Dr. Berezhkov also wrote that just before Stalin met with Roosevelt at the Teheran Conference in 1943, the Soviet leader paid careful attention to the placing of the furniture, and "It occurred to me he might be nervous before his meeting with Roosevelt." But when the two leaders got together, he recalled, "They asked about each other's health, spoke about the harm of smoking and the benefits of fresh air. It was beginning to look like a meeting of old pals." At the conference, attended also by Churchill, agreement was achieved about the extent and scheduling of military operations against Germany.
Dr. Berezhkov was born in St. Petersburg, studied English and German and received an engineering degree in 1938 from the University of Kiev. After serving in the Soviet Navy he went on to become an aide to Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, and an official of the Soviet Embassy in Berlin in the period leading up to the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
Late in 1940 he accompanied Molotov to Hitler's office in Berlin and shook hands with Hitler. "His palm was cold and damp," he wrote in the book, "giving me an unpleasant sensation, as if I were touching a reptile."
After the war Dr. Berezhkov became a journalist in the Soviet Union and rose to be a high editor of the foreign affairs weekly New Times and of the journal U.S.A. Economics, Politics and Ideology. In 1974 he received a doctorate in international relations from the Soviet Academy of Science in Moscow. From 1978 to 1983 he was a high official of the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
Dr. Berezhkov's 1940 marriage to his first wife, Galina, ended in divorce.
Besides his second wife, Valeria, whom he married in 1966, he is survived by two sons, both of Moscow: Sergei -- who interprets for President Boris N. Yeltsin and for Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia -- and Alexei; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Gift for Americans

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Here I come bearing a lovely gift: proof that with the power of the passion for freedom, Americans can rise high above the government they elected and compel politicians to follow them.
Those good tidings were rarely more important than now, when from Washington rises the odor of a garbage-dump of corruptions. 
 Our President has such contempt for his job and countrymen that he risked the Presidency on back-room sex, sure that if caught he could lie his way out of it. Congress skitters about, looking for a solution, desperate not to see it in the Constitution: impeachment, trial and verdict. Whatever Congress does, or flees, Bill Clinton's decision to risk the Presidency like a dollar chip is his immortal insult to America.
All the while, the capital is afloat in the greed of Americans who transfer to foreign countries the political skills they acquired while taking U.S. paychecks, and our country becomes the personal yo-yo of Saddam Hussein.
Sometimes the stench of cynicism is so powerful that we fear it will smother us all. But unwrap the gift. You will see that for almost three years, tens of millions of Americans, without money to fight the power of the lobbies, without advertising to break through the press's bored near-blackout, without any weapons but their letters, voices and prayers, with no reward except to look at themselves without shame, these Americans forced the Administration to accept what it had used claw and dollar to defeat.
What was this demon that the Administration-trade lobby alliance tried to destroy? It was a bill that condemned persecution abroad of Christian and other minorities and called for economic or political penalties against the persecutors.
Why did it take years of hard struggle to pass? One reason is that the Administration trembled at the warnings of lobbies that fury of the persecutors might damage trade. Washington was also jittery that most of the persecuting countries are Muslim.
Persecution cannot be the godly expression of any religion but is its perversion by man. Persecution in Muslim countries is a blotch on Islam. It would help if more Muslims in free countries said so.
American Christians may be the only religious group in the world that has never been persecuted. It took them, and Jews, too long to get it through their heads that Christians could be tortured and murdered still, not just in the New Testament. And it took self-examination for some American Christians to understand that Asian and African Christians are not exotic guest-Christians but as deeply rooted in their religion as the President who carries his Bible to Sunday service but calls China's persecutor regime his partner.
Other Americans turned up their noses at cooperating with conservative Christians, although the issue was not divisive, or debatable.
But eventually so many did understand that the issue was American unity against persecution that the Administration heard the sound of votes, if not prayer. It caved.
The final Senate vote for the bill often pronounced dead was 98 to 0. Supporters made concessions. But the bill keeps essentials -- a commission on international religious freedom, appointed by the President and Congress, an annual report naming persecuting nations, a list of sanctions from which the President must choose or explain why he prefers none.
The list ranges from near-nothings like private demarches to real somethings that might persuade persecutors that oppressing religion does not pay -- like suspension of U.S. developmental or strategic assistance and loans, and withholding of export licenses.
For America, the special importance is that conservatives and liberals showed that action for human rights is not the property of either group and that success depends on the support of both.
Now, back to work. In China, recently, 140 more Christians who refuse to submit to government domination of their churches were beaten and arrested. In the Sudan, the Government uses the civil war to kill, starve and enslave Christians. In Pakistan, the Government enforces on Christians the harshest forms of Islamic law, including death for blasphemy. Et cetera.
So, as they say at many church meetings in America, pray on Sunday, and act on Monday.

HEADLINE: One Democrat Has Hat in Ring, and in Hand, for Presidency

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Publicly, Vice President Al Gore refuses to acknowledge the obvious: that he is running for President. Other Democratic and Republican aspirants are also playing coy about their designs on the White House in 2000.
Not Senator Paul Wellstone: the liberal Democrat from Minnesota is so unabashed about his ambitions that he was the first candidate to establish an "exploratory committee" as an initial step for a White House run. Already, the committee has helped finance Mr. Wellstone's travels as part of his drive to build support. 
 Beyond the committee, the Senator recently mailed a solicitation letter to Democrats around the country -- liberals in particular -- asking them to give up to $750 to his committee. In the letter, Mr. Wellstone, a former political science professor who was elected in 1990 and re-elected six years later, sounds out populist themes for a campaign.
"The American people deserve leadership that comes to grips with bread-and-butter economic issues and takes on powerful interests," he wrote. "The American people deserve a foreign policy that truly reflects our democratic ideals and places human rights at its center.
"We must learn to strike a new balance with nature, conducting ourselves as though the Earth is a precious gift we hold in trust for our children and our children's children," the letter continued.
Then, Mr. Wellstone got to the heart of his appeal: "Our campaign must be the opposite of cynical," he wrote. "We will organize, galvanize and energize. So I ask you again: Will you join me?" He asks for "a check for $25, $50, $100 or more."
While many other Presidential contenders insist that they are still mulling over their decision -- many are expected to announce their candidacy early next year -- Mr. Wellstone noted that the early primaries in 2000 and demands for early fund-raising bring the campaign season closer than ever.
"Nov. 7, 2000, probably seems a long time away to you. (It does to me!)," he wrote. "But the realities of present-day Presidential politics demands that any potential candidate who relies heavily on grass-roots organizing must get started at the earliest possible moment. That moment is now!"
Mr. Gore is widely viewed as the overwhelming early favorite for the Democratic nomination, especially given his position as Vice President, an extensive fund-raising network at his command, and the fact that, from top to bottom, the White House is behind his candidacy. While Mr. Wellstone is considered a long shot, he is popular among liberals and is trying to fashion himself as a force in the process by being the candidate of the left.
For well over a year, Mr. Wellstone has traveled the country, trying to build support for a populist-style campaign. Routinely, he said, he asked people two questions related to a Presidential run: "Can I gather the necessary support? Can I raise enough money to run a competitive campaign?"
Not surprisingly, he said in the letter, "My travels during the past year strongly suggest to me that the answer to both those questions is 'Yes.' For the balance of the year, I am committed to devoting all the time and energy I can to continue traveling across America to seek those answers."

HEADLINE: 2 Republicans Seek Inquiry Into District's Abortion Payments

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Two Republican members of the House committee that handles the budget in the District of Columbia have asked a Federal prosecutor to investigate the use of local money to pay for abortions.
Congress stipulated as early as 1993 that the District could not use local money to provide abortions to poor women, but District officials acknowledge that the practice continued in violation of the law until last month when a financial control board official noticed the restriction in the latest appropriations act. 
 In a letter dated Nov. 13 to Wilma A. Lewis, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, Representatives Todd Tiahrt of Kansas and Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama, wrote: "We are outraged that officials and employees of the District of Columbia government have feigned ignorance to justify their blatant violation of Federal law."
Their letter also said, "Disregard for Federal law is a disturbing pattern of behavior that seems to occur whenever the District of Columbia government disagrees with the statutes enacted by Congress to govern the District."
Ms. Lewis would not comment on the investigation.
District officials acknowledge that the abortion ban had been overlooked, even though it consistently appeared in appropriation bills and those measures were widely covered in local newspapers.
"All evidence thus far indicates that this was an administrative snafu, pure and simple," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in the House. "This occurred during a time when the District was flat on its back -- it's only now recovering -- from a financial and management crisis."
Ms. Norton said she was confident that District officials had always meant to follow the laws enacted by Congress, even though some have resented some measures that undermined local policy.
In the last two years, the District has spent $202,000 to pay for 756 abortions. Many of the women who had abortions were receiving welfare and were advised to apply for money from the Medical Charities Program, officials said.
In 1996, 13,674 abortions were performed in the District of Columbia, 6,771 of them reported as being for District residents.
The Medical Charities Program, which does not rely on Federal funds, is financed from property and income taxes.
The fund helps poor residents of Washington pay medical bills if they are not covered by Medicaid, or if they are ineligible for Medicaid because they are childless or able-bodied.
Federal policy prohibits Medicaid -- health insurance programs for the poor and disabled that are financed by Federal and state governments -- from paying for abortions except in cases when the mother's life is in danger or in cases of incest or rape.
States are free to use local tax money to pay for abortions.
Paul Offner, the District of Columbia's commissioner of health care finance, whose office oversees the Medical Charities Program, complained that the abortion rule was an example of Congress telling the city what to do with its own money.
Last month, Congress also barred the use of Federal or District money to pay for needle-exchange programs, which have been active in the city for several years.

HEADLINE: Racial Disparity Seen in Immigrant Housing

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
A report commissioned by the Fannie Mae Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered home-mortgage provider, shows the extent to which race plays a determining role in where immigrants live in New York City.
Using the most comprehensive housing survey available, the study focuses on the conditions immigrants face in their communities, rather than just their buildings. 
 The study, prepared by the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, shows that black and Hispanic immigrants live in those city neighborhoods with the highest rates of serious crime, tuberculosis and unsafe buildings, and that their experience is rivaled only by conditions faced by blacks born in the United States. Immigrants from Europe, Asia and the nations of the former Soviet Union, by comparison, live in neighborhoods with fewer deleterious conditions.
Titled "Nativity Differences in Neighborhood Quality," the study builds on the findings of a previous Fannie Mae study of immigrant housing. The earlier study, released in May, found that black and Hispanic immigrants lived in the city's most dilapidated buildings, paid the highest percentages of their incomes for rent and had the lowest rates of home ownership. And, as in the new study, those conditions were matched only by those faced by native-born blacks.
"Our results suggest there is a racial hierarchy of neighborhoods in New York," said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. real estate center. "Blacks and Latinos live in worse-quality neighborhoods than whites, regardless of whether they were born in the United States or not."
The new report was prepared by Professor Schill, Samantha Friedman of the N.Y.U. center and Emily Rosenbaum, a sociology professor at Fordham University. It examined six neighborhood conditions: crimes against persons per 1,000 residents; tuberculosis cases per 10,000 residents; the percentage of buildings with safety violations; the percentage of the neighborhood population on public assistance; the percentage of subsidized housing units, and the availability of physicians per 10,000 residents.
In every category except the availability of physicians, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, other Caribbean countries, Latin America, Africa and Puerto Rico (for statistical purposes, island-born Puerto Ricans were considered an immigrant group) lived in neighborhoods that posted the top four or five rankings, indicating that they faced the worst conditions.
For example, in the category of crimes against persons, Puerto Ricans, at 17.58 cases; Caribbeans and Africans combined, at 15.57 cases; Dominicans, at 13.99, and Latin Americans, at 13.02, lived in neighborhoods with the second through fifth highest crime rates, topped only by native-born blacks, at 19.01.
In the category of tuberculosis cases per 10,000 residents, Dominicans topped the list, at 34.99, followed by native-born blacks, at 34.37; Puerto Ricans, at 31.66, and Latin Americans, at 29.48.
The study was based on data from the 1996 Housing and Vacancy Survey, which is considered the city's best source of housing data, as well as on crime and other housing statistics. The Housing and Vacancy Survey, conducted every three years by the Census Bureau, sampled 15,752 households, of which 5,933 were headed by immigrants.
Surprisingly, immigrants from the former Soviet Union live in neighborhoods that rank particularly well with respect to crime, disease and unsafe housing -- even when compared with native-born whites. The crime rate for neighborhoods occupied by those immigrants ranked lowest on the list, at 8.69 incidents per 1,000 residents, compared with 9.39 for native-born whites.
With tuberculosis as an indicator of the prevalence of disease, Soviet immigrants experienced the lowest rates of exposure, 17.52 cases per 10,000 residents, while the rate for native-born whites was 18.31. And in terms of housing safety, the average number of buildings with code violations for Soviet immigrants was 0.14, compared with 0.23 for native-born whites.
"Russians do well on these indicators," said Dr. Rosenbaum, one of the study's authors, "largely because of their concentration in relatively well-to-do neighborhoods like Forest Hills and Manhattan Beach, and even Brighton Beach."
"They have a relatively higher proportion with college educations, compared to other groups," she said. "But I think part of it is that they are white. It's really race and ethnicity that drive the difference between the ethnic groups." The two groups with higher proportions of college educations than immigrants from the former Soviet Union were those from Southeast Asia, and from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, taken as a group.
In the category of physician availability for every 10,000 residents -- based on the location of the doctor's primary office -- immigrants from the Indian subcontinent had the lowest number of doctors in their neighborhoods, 20.64; those from the former Soviet Union had the second lowest number, 20.79, and native-born whites had the most doctors available, 37.61.
Naomi S. Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, said the study was commissioned because "Fannie Mae is committed to eliminating discrimination in the mortgage financing system."
"One of the challenges that the study shows we must address," she said, "is how to reach people who may not have access to information about the home-buying process. We really think that there's a great improvement in neighborhood conditions when there's a higher proportion of homeowners."
Professor Schill said the public-policy implications of the study "are that stepped-up enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, such as the Federal Fair Housing Act, and investment in minority neighborhoods, such as that promoted by the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, are likely to go a long way in improving conditions of immigrants living in this city."

HEADLINE: Employees Facing Steep Increases in Health Costs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Many working Americans will pay 8 to 20 percent more for health insurance premiums next year, the sharpest price increases since the early 1990's.
The rises in premiums follow several years of failed efforts by health maintenance organizations and other managed health care companies to stem the growth in medical costs, particularly the large price increases for prescription drugs, advanced surgical devices and techniques, and services to patients outside hospitals. Cost-cutting has also been thwarted by legislation in a number of states that prevents H.M.O.'s from restricting patients' access to specialists and diagnostic procedures. 
 As costs climbed, health plans for a time had trouble raising rates significantly because big employers and purchasing groups beat down their demands and even, in some cases, forced them to swallow lower premiums. But now, after a wave of mergers and acquisitions and the departures of H.M.O. companies from some communities, there is less competition -- and the H.M.O.'s have found it easier to raise prices to try to restore profits.
As businesses and organizations from Sears, Roebuck & Company and the American Express Company and the Federal Government to law firms and gas stations face sharply higher premiums, many of them, reluctant to irritate workers in a tight labor market, are sharing the increases proportionately with their employees. But others are asking employees to pay more for out-of-pocket charges or to pay larger percentages of the employer's premium costs.
Three thousand employees of J. Baker Inc., a retail shoe chain, will pay 9 percent more in insurance contributions next year, reflecting a 9.2 percent rise, on average, in the company's overall premiums. Out-of-pocket charges to employees for prescription drugs, admission to hospitals and visits to doctors and emergency rooms will also rise. Dorothy Finigan, benefits manager at J. Baker, which is based in Canton, Mass., said that if the company's health plan had not been revised to require the added out-of-pocket charges, the insurance companies would have raised J. Baker's overall premiums by 20 percent.
The Alltel Corporation, a telecommunications company in Little Rock, Ark., will pay 9.6 percent more, on average, to 80 H.M.O.'s, but the increases will be much steeper for many of Alltel's 17,000 employees because the company pays only a set amount for each worker.
Alltel pays about 80 percent of a $497 monthly premium for a family in an H.M.O. The company is raising the dollar limit on its contribution for each employee for the first time in four years, said Joe Meyer, manager of corporate benefit planning. Even so, in an extreme case, some employees will pay 31 percent more, or $19.42 more each month.
Workers at other companies may soon face similar increases in their contributions to premiums, as well as higher out-of-pocket charges for drugs, visits to doctors and hospital stays, benefits executives and consultants said. And a growing number of employers will be transferring even more of the costs to employees by 2000, said Tom Beauregarde, a principal at Hewitt Associates, a consulting firm.
Some medium-sized employers in Florida with 500 or 600 workers "are getting killed," said Becky J. Cherney, president of the Central Florida Health Care Coalition, a group of large employers in Orlando. Her members have three-year H.M.O. contracts with 3 percent annual increases, but some middle-sized companies are facing 20 percent increases, she said.
Costs are also sharply higher for small businesses, and some are considering giving up health benefits, which would add to the 43 million Americans who do not have insurance. Neil Caggiano, owner of the Glen Head Flower Shop in the Long Island community of Glen Head, N.Y., with nine employees covered, is waiting for notice of his 1999 rates, which take effect in February. "If it goes up more, we may not be able to offer it," he said.
The two employees at Howes & Howes, a four-person law firm in Raritan, N.J., began contributing $10 a week last month. Tim Howes, a partner, said the payments would help cover an increase in the firm's premiums. "We had to switch to less comprehensive coverage and still pay an increase," he said.
Riverdale Texaco in Morris County, N.J., will face an 11 percent rise, to $720 a month, in 1999 to cover the owner, Sal Risalvato, and two full-time employees. Mr. Risalvato joined an H.M.O. offered by Aetna U.S. Healthcare when his former insurer left the state. "If we had taken a comparable policy, the increase would have been 20 percent," he said.
Even at the biggest companies, the increases have jolted benefits executives, who fear a return to the fast-rising health costs of the late 1980's and early 1990's. Government economists say they expect that the upswing will continue over the next few years, adding hundreds of billions of dollars to national health spending. Medical costs are now projected by consultants to rise more than three times as fast as the current 2 percent annual rate of inflation.
While information on next year's premiums is still being gathered, the trend is already clear. Medical costs are up 6 percent and H.M.O. premiums are rising 8 percent, according to a survey of 50 of the nation's largest companies and 1,000 medium-sized employers by BT Alex. Brown Inc.
Health benefits executives across the country confirmed the findings in interviews. Sears, Roebuck reported increases for next year averaging 8 percent to 9 percent, compared with 3 percent this year, at 200 H.M.O.'s that serve 136,000 Sears employees and early retirees. The company declined to provide an average amount of employee contributions, saying there were too many variations. American Express said it would pay 8 percent more, on average, for 33,000 employees in 150 H.M.O.'s next year, after paying virtually no increases in 1998.
Federal employees, whose health plan is the nation's largest, will pay 7.4 percent more, on average, next year. The Government agreed to average increases in premiums of 10.2 percent, the biggest since 1989. The employees will pay only part of the increase because the taxpayers are absorbing the rest.
Consolidated Edison employees who are union members will pay 8 percent to 9 percent more next year for H.M.O. coverage, under a three-year contract. Edwin Ortiz, director of employee relations for the company, said H.M.O. premiums paid by the company were rising 5 percent to 13 percent, compared with 6 percent to 9 percent in 1998.
The California Public Employees Retirement System bargained rates down in each of the last four years. Now it has agreed to increases averaging 7.3 percent for 900,000 members, including a 10.75 percent rise from Kaiser Permanente, one of its biggest insurers. The 31,000 state employees who have family coverage from Kaiser, for example, will pay $18.57 a month. Previously the full premium was covered by the state.
The premium increases have been welcomed on Wall Street, where most health maintenance organizations have been out of favor with investors during several years of small or nonexistent profits. Indeed, by last year, most health maintenance organizations were losing money, according to Interstudy, a managed care research center in Minneapolis, and many H.M.O.'s are still in precarious financial straits.
"I was really surprised and shocked that the price increases are coming through," said William McKeever, a health care analyst at Paine Webber Securities, who added that the year 1999 could be the "best since 1993" for H.M.O. profits.
In New York, where state approval is required for increases in H.M.O. premiums that exceed 10 percent, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield has received approval to raise rates for some employers for a popular health plan by 15.1 percent in 1999.
The H.M.O. industry has benefited from rapid consolidation, which has left the surviving companies in a stronger position. Sixteen of the nation's 25 biggest H.M.O.'s were swallowed by other managed care companies in the last three years.
"There are only a few national carriers left: Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare," Ms. Finigan of J. Baker said. "Because the number is so limited, they are calling the shots."
The pinch is apparent in many places. In Chicago, a group of big employers asked for bids from 11 local H.M.O.'s earlier this year. By the time the negotiations ended, three had disappeared into mergers and one had left town.
With 85 percent of all insured workers now in H.M.O.'s or other types of managed care, there are few opportunities left for employers to lower costs just by transferring people to managed care from traditional fee-for-service health plans. That process, many experts say, was the prime factor in temporarily holding down costs for employers.
Mr. McKeever said managed care insurance was moving into "underwriting cycles" of three years of losses followed by three years of profits, following a pattern in traditional insurance. In the down cycle, insurers reduced rates to attract new business until they lost money and "had to either raise rates or exit the business," he said.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "KEEPING TRACK: Rising Cost Of Coverage"
Starting next year, employers will pay more for health insur-ance plans and some will shift the cost to workers. A national survey of 106 employers pro-jected average increases in premiums of 8.5 percent. Graph shows percentage change in premiums from previous year, for traditional plans, preferred provider organizations, point of service plans, H.M.O. plans and all plans, from 1996 through 1999.

HEADLINE: Talk of Deflation Is Wishful Thinking

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Some Depressions Aren't So Bad" (Op-Ed, Nov. 24):
Niall Ferguson's article is yet another example in a long line that presume that the late 19th century and the past quarter-century are similar to a high degree. 
 In fact, they could not be more different in the one area that matters most.
In the late 19th century the production of goods and services rose much more rapidly in the United States, even as prices fell, than it has in the past 25 years.
Gross domestic product, after discounting for changes in prices, grew by 4 percent a year on average between 1870 and 1910. Since 1973 it has grown by only 2.5 percent a year.
This is an enormous difference. We would be producing about 45 percent more goods and services in 1998 (more than $3 trillion) if we had grown at a rate of 4 percent a year since 1973. The reason we didn't is the slow growth of productivity, or output per hour of work.
Between 1870 and 1910, productivity grew by about 2 percent a year. Since 1973 it has grown by 1 percent a year, much more slowly than it has over any other sustained period since before the Civil War.
Today, there are admirable productivity gains in some industries.
In the late 19th century there were enormous productivity gains in a much wider range of goods and services. These gains are what drove prices down then.
Today, prices are going down primarily because of global over-investment and, secondarily, because of Government policies that are designed to constrain demand.
Simple historical comparisons to the 19th century are highly misleading.
Any optimism about the possibility of deflation in the United States is unwarranted.

HEADLINE: Rare Stamps Worth $1 Million Are Stolen After Show

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

 BODY:
What Jeffrey Forster considers art looks to most people like a stack of old mail. But in the rarefied world of philately, his collection of 1869 stamps -- most still affixed to their original envelopes -- are masterpieces worth an estimated $1 million.
Last weekend, Mr. Forster's precious collection was stolen outside the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in midtown, where it had been one of several collections on display at the Postage Stamp Mega Event. 
 Mr. Forster, 53, a lawyer from San Jose, Calif., said the theft occurred on Sunday afternoon as he left the exhibition hall with a locked briefcase holding his stamp collection and two other pieces of luggage. Mr. Forster said he set his bags near the curb at 11th Avenue and 35th Street and turned his back for a few seconds to hail a cab. When he turned back around, the briefcase was gone.
The police said they had no leads in the case, but Mr. Forster said he remained hopeful the stamps, which are fully insured, would be found. In a telephone interview yesterday, he said he was offering a $25,000 reward for the return of his collection.
The theft, believed to be the largest ever of rare stamps, brought a sad end to one the most prestigious stamp exhibitions of the year and has ignited panic among stamp collectors across the country.
"It sends a shiver through the hobby," said Bill Welch, editor of the American Philatelist, the journal of the 56,000-member American Philatelic Society. "It simply underscores the point that when you're traveling with your stamps, you can't let them out of your grip for one second."
Linn's Stamp News, a weekly publication based in Sidney, Ohio, that is sent to some 70,000 subscribers, reported the theft on its front page under the headline "Million-Dollar Collection Swiped from a New York Sidewalk." Its publisher and editor, Michael Laurence, said collectors who heard the news have discussed plans to increase the insurance on their stamps and ways to make stamp exhibitions safer.
"These are like rare works of art," Mr. Laurence said.
The theft was most distressing, of course, to Mr. Forster, a business lawyer who spent 25 years acquiring his collection and exhibited it at stamp shows around the world.
"Collectors of stamps, just like art collectors or collectors of rare books, are caretakers of history," he said. "We are simply preserving these things for the next generation of collectors."
The stamps in Mr. Forster's collection, issued for eight months in 1869, are rare because they were examples of the first two-color pictorial stamps ever printed in the United States. Before this series, stamps featured only the faces of dead presidents.
The 12-cent-stamp was a green stamp depicting the steamship Adriatic. The 15-cent stamp had a brown-and-blue scene of Columbus's arrival in the New World. And the 24-cent stamp was a green-and-violet vignette of the famous Turnbull painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence that is so detailed, Mr. Forster said, that with the help of a magnifying glass it is possible to distinguish the faces of the signers.
"When these stamps came out people hated them," Mr. Laurence said. "They didn't like the two colors and they thought it was inappropriate to put pictures on stamps. But collectors loved them from the moment they were printed."
Mr. Forster's collection was also rare, he said, because the stamps are affixed to their original envelopes, and many of them traveled to exotic corners of the world, including Natal, the South African province, and St. Helena, the South Atlantic island where Napoleon died in exile.
Often the letters took weeks to reach their destinations, making stops at several international post offices along the way. At each stop, the envelope would be stamped with a date and the name of the town. The more postal markings on a stamp and its envelope -- called a "cover" by philatelists -- the more valuable it is to the collector.
Mr. Forster said one of the most valuable pieces in his collection, an item valued at $50,000 to $60,000, is a bright yellow 10-cent stamp, with an eagle on a shield, that is affixed to an envelope that was sent in 1870 from Rochester to a city in the old West German province of Baden called Bruchsal. The envelope had markings from post offices in New York City, Bremen and Bruschal, where it arrived three weeks after it was mailed.
Another valuable stamp in the Forster collection is the 90-cent stamp of President Lincoln, his image in carmine and black.
"Stamp collectors do this because it's fun," said Mr. Laurence, himself a collector for 50 years. "The hunt for rare items takes a lot of determination and dedication. It's a great way to learn about history, and a great way to learn about geography."
There is also a financial incentive, he acknowledged. "The economics of it are quite good, too," he said. "Rare stamps, over time, have held their value rather decisively."
For his part, Mr. Forster said that while saddened by his loss, he will continue to hunt for gems on the corners of old envelopes.
"Stamp collecting is a passion for me," he said. "Even though it's sort of a dark day right now, it will still remain a passion."

HEADLINE: Shoppers May Find A Shortage of Help Over the Holidays

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, was looming across the mall like a dirigible. And with 85 hours to go, Harris Friedman's sportswear store was already a wreck.
"I have to admit, the place looks kind of shabby," said Mr. Friedman of the Footaction U.S.A. store, in the Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove, N.Y. He has so little help this holiday season, he said on Tuesday, that he is forced to spend less time as the store's manager and more as its locker room attendant, picking up shoes, fetching stray laces and folding uniforms. "We've got the shoppers, but not workers." 
 Mr. Friedman said he had yet to find any acceptable holiday employees, much less fill in the holes on his full-time roster for today, a day that can determine whether a store will be in the black -- or in a black hole.
"The kids are lazy," he said, explaining that he would rather weather the holiday buying blitz with a smaller staff than with an incompetent one. "They don't want to work. They dress terrible. I can't hire them. And the older people don't want to work for 6 bucks. They want $9 an hour."
Even though Asia's economic troubles have sent tremors through the American economy, retail stores -- particularly in suburban areas -- say they are struggling to find enough workers to staff their outlets this holiday season. With the lowest unemployment since the Vietnam War era and better-paying jobs in other industries creating an especially taut labor market, merchants say that as Christmas draws near, they cannot find enough people to take temporary jobs -- even when they pay a premium over the minimum wage.
For shoppers, that could mean longer lines at checkout counters, fewer sales workers to answer their questions and overworked employees short on holiday cheer.
"It's been a problem with the retail industry for the past few years, but this year, it's the worst," said Rick Church, a retail analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
The traditional holiday workers -- young people, homemakers and retirees -- are passing on the seasonal jobs available in the nation's malls. So to try to lure workers, managers are coming up with novel incentives like theater tickets, signing bonuses and even retirement plans.
"For the first time ever, we held a job fair this year," said Terry Katula, marketing manager of Woodbridge Center Mall, in Woodbridge, N.J. "There's a lot of competition for jobs. People have lots of choices, and retail is a very demanding field. It's hard to find labor, let alone good labor."
For those who live in the affluent shadows of the shopping complexes, the idea of a $7-an-hour job during the holiday season is less palatable than a hand-me-down fruitcake.
Marty Fortenza, 17, watched as the N-24 bus from Queens arrived at Roosevelt Field, the gargantuan shopping mall in Garden City on Long Island, where it dispatched a stream of passengers heading to work at the mall. Mr. Fortenza, a high school student from Valley Stream in Nassau County, said that although he was once an eager Christmas season worker, this year was different.
"I'm not sticking no feet in no shoes or frying burgers for six bucks an hour, period," he said last week. "Why should I? My dad's doing all right."
Just how much an attitude like his will hurt the retail industry remains to be seen. A seven-year economic expansion, an annual inflation rate of less than 2 percent and a national unemployment rate of 4.6 percent are all expected to bolster sales during the holiday season, which can account for as much as half of a retailer's annual profit. But that boom has a flip side, and a scarcity of workers may cause problems with customers that could cut into the bare-bones profits of retailers.
The biggest question may be how shoppers react to a smaller sales staff and less attention paid to them.
In megamalls like Roosevelt Field -- 106 acres of glass and marble and tile -- finding that perfect size 9 in chartreuse this season may be as difficult as finding your car in the mammoth parking lot.
"The malls need valets, and they need sales assistants," said Bruce Van Kleeck, the vice president of the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. "Staffing is a major issue nationwide. The suburban areas don't have the labor pools."
To entice the reluctant would-be worker, Macy's is offering a 20 percent merchandise discount through January for seasonal workers who stay through Dec. 24 as well as a $300 completion bonus for sales associates, said Linda Martin, a Macy's vice president for human resources.
Those bonuses, however, are regional; workers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island will get them because unemployment rates are at an all-time low, 2.6 in Nassau and 3 percent in Suffolk.
Workers in New York City, where unemployment hovers around 8 percent, will get no bonuses.
"It is generally easier to staff the New York stores," Ms. Martin explained. "But in some regions, there is a lot of competition, and because we seek a better caliber of people, it is necessary to come up with unique methods of attracting potential employees."
Nevertheless, the vibrant job market is starting to filter down to more traditionally depressed parts of the economy, soaking up workers in the inner city. Victor Resis, 22, who lives in St. Albans, Queens, was happy to take a job in the suburbs, despite the commute.
"There's no work in New York City," he said after an hourlong ride from the Jamaica bus terminal in Queens to his new $7-an-hour stock job at Macy's in Roosevelt Field. "You do what you have to do to work. That's life. You have to make a living."
The big department store chains have also taken to advertising in college newspapers and on movie screens. If the labor market gets too tight, Macy's may consider busing workers into understaffed stores.
The retailers' skittishness is palpable. In the suburban malls, application displays compete with merchandise space. The sales staff is encouraged to ask shoppers to apply. There are theater ticket giveaways, bonuses for employees who sign up their family members and friends, and even 401(k) plans to attract part-timers.
At the Palisades Center mall in West Nyack, N.Y., "help wanted" signs hang in the windows of the large department stores, including Filene's, as well as in the smaller mom-and-pop stores.
Steven Steransak, the owner of Legends and Heroes, a sports memorabilia shop, said the lack of workers has forced him to raise the hourly salary he pays to $6.50 or $7 an hour from the minimum wage of $5.15. Still, he said, he cannot find good help.
"Whoever pays the most they go to," Mr. Steransak said, referring to teen-age workers. "They just switch jobs a lot."
Mr. Steransak is looking forward to mid-December, when college students come home on break.
"They like to work," he said. "They only have a short time, and they want to make money."
Then, he said, he may be able to stop working 12-hour days. Unfortunately, by then the holiday season will be almost over.
Regina Cutrone, manager of Laura's Hallmark, at the Palisades Center, said the store had raised the wages it pays to $6.50 an hour and begun offering 401(k)'s to part-timers in an effort to attract employees. So far, she was happy to report, the strategy had worked. Hiring for the holiday season began in October, and the store is now almost fully staffed.
"We're lucky," Ms. Cutrone said. "Maybe it's that people who come here want to work at a Hallmark's." Or maybe it's the promise of early retirement.
Other shopkeepers said they were worried that the lack of help could turn customers off.
Amy Smith, 25, the assistant manager at the Body Shop in Roosevelt Field, was working the register, helping customers and replenishing counters on Wednesday afternoon. Her teen-age sales assistant decided not to show up that day for her $7-an-hour shift.
"Excuse me, I'm pregnant and my lips are chapped," said one customer seeking assistance.
Ms. Smith, who is also a part-time flight attendant and student, was wrestling with a bottle of ointment. "I'm sorry, we're having such a hard time," she explained.
"But I need exfoliator," the customer said. "If you can't give it to me, I'm sure someone else can."
Bob McCabe, the manager of the Bombay Company store in Roosevelt Field, said teen-agers are less inclined to have to work when the economy is robust.
"Times are good, so kids are flighty," Mr. McCabe said. "They have no worries. Can you blame them?"

HEADLINE: COMPUTER TROUBLE LOOMS FOR STATES IN 2000, U.S. FINDS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Most states are behind schedule in renovating their computers for the year 2000, and as a result it is likely that benefit payments will be delayed, or services interrupted, for some people who receive welfare, Medicaid, food stamps or other types of assistance, Federal and state officials say.
State employees are working feverishly to fix the problem and to draft contingency plans in case their computers are not ready by Jan. 1, 2000. But some states are lagging, and states that have repaired their computers for one program are often behind schedule in fixing the computers used for other social welfare programs. 
 Federal officials say the problems could begin as early as January 1999 in some programs like unemployment insurance. A person filing a claim for jobless benefits typically has a year to draw all the checks to which he or she is entitled. The last day of this "benefit year" is recorded when an application is received. So computers must be able to handle dates with the year 2000, starting in January 1999.
Randy Johnson, chairman of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners in Minneapolis, and former president of the National Association of Counties, said: "I'd be surprised if there was not some dislocation and some interruption of services. We are trying to work with our clients, many of whom are elderly or frail, to make sure they know how to reach us if they have problems."
The perspective of county officials is important because many Federal benefit programs are administered at the county level, and county officials will have to deal with the consequences if payments are late.
The year 2000 problem arises from the fact that early computer programmers often used a two-digit format to express the year. In such computer programs, 2000 is often indistinguishable from 1900. If the problem is not corrected, experts say, computers could produce inaccurate data or shut down.
A recent survey of the states by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that many were behind schedule in renovating their computers. Only one-third of the 421 computer systems used for seven major health, welfare and nutrition programs were ready for the year 2000.
"The compliance rate ranged from only 16 percent of the Medicaid systems to about half of the child care and child welfare systems," the accounting office said.
Failure to make the necessary repairs "could result in billions of dollars in benefit payments not being delivered," the report said. In addition, it said, states may have difficulty determining the eligibility of new applicants, and people already on the rolls may receive late payments or underpayments.
Joel C. Willemssen, who supervises the work of the General Accounting Office on computer operations of civilian agencies, said the results of the survey were "fairly discouraging."
The Federal Government had set September 1998 as the target date for computers to be renovated. That date would allow time to test the performance of computers and to correct software errors. "Testing is 60 to 70 percent of the job of getting ready for the year 2000," said Wendy W. Rayner, the chief information officer of New Jersey.
Steve E. Kolodney, director of the Department of Information Services in Washington State, chairman of a panel studying the year 2000 problem for the chief information-technology officers of the 50 states, said: "There is likely to be some dislocation, some disruption of services. I don't think there will be a wholesale failure of these computer systems. But it's inevitable, when so many systems are being renovated, that there will be some delays and hiccups."
The interruption of services "won't be for lack of attention or concern among state officials," Mr. Kolodney said. "It would occur because we are overwhelmed with the number of fixes that need to be made."
Many Governors, including George E. Pataki of New York, have recognized the year 2000 problem as a priority for state government.
But John A. Koskinen, a White House official who supervises preparations for the year 2000, said, "We are concerned about some states where it's not a priority of the governor and it's viewed as merely an information technology problem, off on the side." Mr. Koskinen is chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, an interagency group formed in February.
Governors may ultimately be held accountable if benefits are not paid on time. John Thomas Flynn, the chief information officer of California, said: "If social services are disrupted, you'll have more than computer problems. You could have civil disturbances. That's why this issue is a high priority for us."
Janice G. Lilja, acting deputy administrator of the Federal Food and Nutrition Service, said the Government had asked the top welfare officials in each state to certify that they had fixed their food stamp computers to cope with the year 2000, or that they had some alternative means of delivering benefits.
Welfare agencies could issue checks by hand for a few weeks, as they sometimes do after an earthquake or a hurricane. State and local officials could simply assume that everyone on the rolls of a particular program in December 1999 was entitled to assistance in January 2000. Or the Federal Government could advance the necessary money to the states for a few months, without receiving the data normally required to justify such payments. Likewise, a state having difficulties could seek help from other states with extra computer capacity, or could hire companies to write checks and perform other tasks normally done by government agencies.
Even a state that fixes its own computers may have problems if its repairs are not compatible with those made by the Federal Government or by counties and cities in the state. In addition, state officials must deal with thousands of providers and vendors of services, who may or may not have made the necessary computer changes.
A state Medicaid program, for example, receives tens of thousands of electronic claims from doctors, dentists, hospitals, pharmacies, nursing homes and home health agencies. If such health care providers do not fix their computers to cope with the year 2000, their Medicaid payments may be delayed.
Joel Schnedler, deputy director of computer operations for the Missouri Medicaid program, said there would be no problem paying hospitals and chain drug stores that file large numbers of Medicaid claims. But Mr. Schnedler said he worried about doctors and dentists who filed just a few claims a month. State employees may have to do some "manual manipulation" of the data before paying such claims, he said.
Mr. Koskinen, the White House official supervising preparations for the year 2000, said, "Six or eight states have difficulty even identifying who operates these electronic data exchanges," so they are in no position to test the arrangements.
Jeff Jinnett, a lawyer who specializes in technology issues, said several states, including Georgia, Virginia and Hawaii, had passed laws to shield themselves against possible lawsuits if their computers failed. Under such laws, Mr. Jinnett said, if a person does not receive a benefit check and therefore cannot buy medicine needed to treat a severe illness, the person might be barred from suing the state for damages.
States are attacking the year 2000 problem in different ways and vary greatly in their efforts to measure progress. Judi Worsham, data-processing manager for the Medicaid program in Oklahoma, keeps track of her work with great precision.
"As of Nov. 5," Ms. Worsham said, "we have completed 55.07 percent of the work to be done by June 30, 1999, and we have used 56.51 percent of the days available since we started on Jan. 1 of this year."
Health and welfare officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said they had been renovating their computers for several years and foresaw no major problems. "We are about 95 percent ready for the year 2000," said Joyce A. Thomas, Commissioner of Social Services in Connecticut.
But Sarah M. Mingledorff, deputy commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency, said: "Our existing computer system is not being touched. We won't upgrade it. We'll put in a new one on Oct. 1, 1999."
But Federal officials said that approach was a risky strategy because information technology projects were rarely completed on time and often required extensive testing to eliminate defects.
Alabama has posted a progress report on the Internet. It says, "Jan. 1, 2000, will be here before most of us are ready." Moreover, it shows that the state has done just 6 percent of the necessary work on the computers that track child abuse and neglect cases and less than 10 percent of the work needed to fix the computers that issue food stamps and welfare benefits.
A report prepared for Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina says "a significant number of large computer systems will experience year 2000-related failures" despite the best efforts of state employees.
"Payments to welfare recipients could be severely delayed," the report says, "because compensation systems either halt or produce checks so erroneous that the system must be shut down and checks processed manually."
California has upgraded its Medicaid computers but told the General Accounting Office that it could not provide statewide data on the renovation of computers used to establish eligibility for welfare and food stamps because the computer systems varied from county to county.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Paradoxes Are a Recurring Theme at an Annual Conference on Gerontology

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Robert L. Kane, a physician and gerontologist from the University of Minnesota, was talking about one of the paradoxes of modern aging: "Here we are, spending megabucks to understand the genome, but at the end of the 20th century, we still don't have a basic system of care that responds to chronic disease. We can study these tiny molecules, and rearrange them to change the nature of life itself. But we can't come up with a health care system that really responds to what people need."
He was among the 3,000 gerontologists here for the annual conference of the Gerontological Society of America. They included anthropologists, sociologists, economists, psychologists, geriatricians, biologists, nurses, philosophers and social workers. They discussed everything from policy issues involving Medicare, Social Security and long-term care to the biology of longevity to Alzheimer's to Milton's blindness as a metaphor for aging. 
No Nursing or Home
 With the meeting's theme, "The Changing Contexts of Aging: Opportunities and Challenges in the New Millennium," there was plenty of discussion of paradoxes.
In one session, Dr. Kane pointed out that the term nursing home is a misnomer. The vast majority of nursing homes in this country provide neither a homelike environment, nor good nursing care, he said. The average nursing home resident receives about 70 minutes a day of actual hands-on care, mostly from aides, he said.
"The nursing home was not something we ever set out to invent," Dr. Kane said in an interview. "We just backed into it. We need to find new approaches to care, to require services to be brought to people in places where they live. You've got to start with the person. Once you do that, all these artificial mechanisms developed by payment mechanisms disappear. Most of our health care is defined by payment, not by people's needs."
Dr. Kane was joined at the conference by his wife, Rosalie A. Kane, who is also a gerontologist from the University of Minnesota. The Kanes, both 59, are the authors, with Richard C. Ladd, a health care consultant, of The Heart of Long-Term Care (Oxford University Press, 1998).
Joshua M. Wiener, an expert on long-term care from the Urban Institute in Washington, also raised the issue of payment. Without additional public resources for long-term care, he said in a session on policies on aging, the costs will become intolerable for most people, especially those who are middle-income.
In the same session, Robert H. Binstock, professor of aging, health and society at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said essential policy changes involving Medicare and Social Security would be politically feasible, despite the conventional wisdom. It is projected that under current law the annual deficit under Medicare alone will be $370 billion a year.
Professor Binstock debunked what he called "the third-rail myth: touch Social Security and you're dead." He pointed out that Ronald Reagan was a major advocate for reducing Social Security benefits in his first term, and that older voters gave him a larger majority in his second campaign than in his first.
"Older people are just as diverse in their voting behavior as younger people," Professor Binstock said. Changes in the Medicare and Social Security programs can be made to raise revenue and reduce costs, he added.
"They will be politically feasible," Professor Binstock said. "It takes a little courage from political leaders who are just so afraid there's going to be a cohesive vote against them. All sorts of changes can be made to Medicare and Social Security without any politicians' suffering."
 
 Geriatric Nurses Recognized
It was a gratifying conference year for geriatrics nurses. The Gerontological Society, in partnership with the John A. Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing of New York University, gave the first Doris Schwartz award for outstanding contributions in gerontological nursing research to Cornelia Beck, a professor of gerontological nursing at the University of Arkansas, for her research on elderly people who have cognitive problems.
Ms. Schwartz, who is 85 and lives in Folkways Lifecare Community in Pennsylvania, came to the conference in her wheelchair to present the award.
In the 1950's, she conducted the first geriatric nursing research on chronic illness in aging.
With the rise in the number of older patients, and the shortage of doctors trained in geriatrics, more geriatric care will be given by nurses, said Terry Fulmer, a registered nurse and co-director of the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing.
Of the nation's 60,000 nurse practitioners, 10 percent are trained in geriatrics, said Dr. Fulmer, who has a Ph.D. in higher education administration. "We're finding they're very cost effective," she said.
 
A Lesson from Dickens
 The conference featured hundreds of workshops and sessions, including highly technical ones on such topics as the "Role of Telomeres in Cell Senescence," and "Do Genes Regulating Apoptosis Contribute to Longevity in Humans?"
Harry R. Moody, director of the Brookdale Institute on Aging at Hunter College, talked about Charles Dickens, and the novel he died before finishing, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." Just as readers have to decide for themselves who killed Edwin Drood, Mr. Moody suggested, people need narrative approaches to help them make decisions about the end of life.
"We need to help people complete the story of their lives," he said, "to think about life as a story that we're making up as we go along."
If a person is unconscious or demented or otherwise unable to make decisions about medical procedures, Mr. Moody added, it falls to relatives, or other surrogates, to complete the story.
"We have to think, 'Hey, what would the person want if I knew something about their history,' " he said. "We have to help them tell the story, whether they can speak out loud or not."

HEADLINE: Japan's Finance Minister May Step Down at End of the Year

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, a key figure in efforts to revive Japan's economy and stave off a global recession, suggested today that he would step down formally from politics and from his Cabinet post at the end of this year.
Such a move, which has apparently been in the works for a while, may raise questions about Japan's economic policy, in part because Mr. Miyazawa had more credibility and connections with the West than other Japanese politicians. But it is unlikely that Mr. Miyazawa's resignation will lead to dramatic changes in Japanese economic policy, and he may well continue to exert enormous influence from behind the scenes. 
 In addition, finance ministers in Japan generally have less influence than the bureaucrats who work under them. Mr. Miyazawa was unusually authoritative, for he was a former Prime Minister as well as a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat. He also tended to agree with the judgments of the bureaucrats working under him.
"First I have to make sure the budget gets done right," Mr. Miyazawa said today, as quoted by Kyodo News Service. A spokesman for his office said that Mr. Miyazawa would step down as Finance Minister when he resigns as leader of his political faction within the Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Miyazawa, who heads what is effectively the second most powerful political faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, suggested that he would step down from that party position at the end of this year.
In some ways, the departure from formal politics of Mr. Miyazawa, who is 79, reflects a generational shift that has been taking hold in the last few years. Mr. Miyazawa has been considered one of the two most influential politicians in Japan, in addition to Noboru Takeshita, who still has a strong grip on the political strategy behind the scenes. Within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Miyazawa's resignation will make way for Koichi Kato, 59, who will take over Mr. Miyazawa's faction and will become a candidate for prime minister in the future.
Politicians like Mr. Kato have been exerting greater influence on major policy and personnel decisions, and it was partly because of his opposition that the Liberal Democrats rejected proposals to stimulate the economy by cutting the national consumption tax.
Some politicians who are even younger, such as Nobuaki Ishihara and Yasuhisa Shiozaki, both Liberal Democrats, have at times gained surprising influence in helping build the party's strategy on economic and banking policy.
Mr. Miyazawa has helped shape Japan's policy for years, particularly in economic relations between the United States and Japan. At virtually every step of the way, he has been the architect of the nation's strategy to rescue the banking system and to revive the recessionary economy, Japan's worst since the end of World War II. Yet although American officials have generally admired him -- he speaks almost perfect English -- there has been annoyance in Washington lately that he has not pushed for more stimulus of the Japanese economy.
Mr. Miyazawa was the Prime Minister for three years, until 1993. For many Americans who have not met him, he is probably best known for holding the state banquet that was an embarrassment for President Bush. It was Mr. Miyazawa's lap into which President Bush threw up when he suddenly fell sick on an official visit to Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Chic Has a New Address;
World's Highest-Rent Retail Zone Is Now on Madison Ave.

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
As the holiday shopping marathon begins today, bells are ringing on Madison Avenue. There are Christmas chimes, of course, and the jingle of cash registers (or at least the whisper of platinum plastic). But the peal most audible to store owners and real estate agents is of celebration, tinged ever so slightly with alarm.
Madison Avenue between 57th Street and 72d Street has just been officially declared the most expensive stretch of shopping space in New York, in the country and in the world. To rent one square foot of space there costs an average of $550 a year, according to a survey by Cushman & Wakefield, the big international real estate firm. 
 That may not surprise anyone who has ambled down the avenue lately, but it does represent a change from just a year or two ago, when Fifth Avenue was a far more expensive spot to open a store, and Causeway Bay in Hong Kong was the most expensive retailing real estate on the planet. Just five years ago, it seemed as if almost every block of Madison was pocked by an empty storefront.
In its own way, the current state of Madison Avenue illuminates some of the most powerful economic trends now shaping New York: the shrinking globe, the resurgent stock market and, of course, all those tourists.
And boy, are they out there, dressed in bright hues and sensible shoes, jamming what used to be the exclusive shopping district of Fifth Avenue between 57th Street and Rockefeller Center. While some of the most glamorous names in selling -- like Bergdorf Goodman and the jeweler Harry Winston -- are still on Fifth, so are all the stores that sell sneakers and blue jeans and Bugs Bunny wabbitiana to the crowds.
"The feeling is that 57th and Fifth have lost their cachet," said Susan J. Kurland, a director of Cushman & Wakefield. For expensive retailers, particularly those from Europe, she added, the area just has too many "mid-America mall-type tenants."
Which is why the most chic stores have been flocking to this stretch of Madison, where real estate costs are only slightly ahead of those on Fifth and 57th. Fashion designers whose names are best known to the devoted readers of Vogue are lining the avenue: Cerruti is opening its first American store near 67th Street, Gianfranco Ferre is expanding at 70th, Gianni Versace is revamping at 68th, next to the new Max Mara store, and Hermes, a stalwart on 57th Street, has plans to move to Madison at 62d. And that's just to name a few.
Tourneau, which specializes in lavish watches, has two stores on Madison that are just two blocks apart -- but worlds away from each other. On 57th is the "Time Machine," four floors of loud music, flashing lights, video screens and zillions of watches, from the $18,500 Paul Newman Rolex ("pre-owned," though not by the movie star himself) to $40 plastic Swatches decorated with teddy bears. Also clocks in the shape of golf balls, clocks in the shape of pianos, and huge clock faces on the building facade.
At 59th is a more traditional jewel box of a store, full of glass and wood cases, solicitous salespeople and gleaming "timepieces." No plastic. "This store caters more to the customer who does not have time to browse," said Scott Saylor, who manages it. Prices start at about $200, and get as high as $43,000 for a gold Patek Philippe wristwatch, even higher for antique jewelry.
"Fifty-seventh is a must-see for anyone visiting New York," said Anthony J. D'Ambrosio, executive vice president of Tourneau, which opened its store there last year. "Upper Madison Avenue," he added, "is a must-see for a certain type." That's the rich type, the European type, the big-spending type. When designers are asked why they must be on Madison, they tend to claim that they sort of stumbled on the perfect spot for a store, which just happened to be on Madison.
"It's always been really about the space, more than the location," said Patti Cohen, spokeswoman for Donna Karan International, which is opening a big boutique at 60th Street for its DKNY line. The company will not say how much it is paying for this location, but real estate brokers say the deal was a record breaker.
Following in the footsteps of Giorgio Armani, who two years ago opened two stores on Madison, Ms. Karan recently announced that she would open a shop for her most luxurious line between 68th and 69th Streets. The store, she said in a statement, "will be an expression of who I am personally and creatively," which is the way designers tend to talk.
But real estate experts say the clustering of designer stores on Madison is no accident. "Retailers are feeling the necessity to be around each other, to keep up with the Joneses," said Robert Cohen, senior managing director of RKF & Associates. As a result, Mr. Cohen added, "Madison is tight as a drum -- if space is available, landlords don't have to hang signs."
One of the few sites that is up for grabs is the old Baby Guess store just north of 66th Street. Who is likely to rent it? "Someone international who wants their name to be on Madison," said Richard Michaels, a director of Jones Lang Wootton, the real estate firm handling the property.
International -- mostly European -- names dominate big stretches of Madison, and foreign tourists are among their biggest customers. Even, perhaps especially, if the same brands are available back home. (Baccarat, the French crystal store, was recently full of French people.)
Last year, 6 million foreign tourists spent $1.3 billion just on shopping in the city, according to the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, while the 27 million American tourists spent less than $600 million in shops.
This year, the number of visitors from abroad is down slightly because of the economic turmoil in Asia (which also accounted for Hong Kong's loss of the title of most expensive shopping street in the world). But the number of travelers from Europe and Latin America has increased, the board said, adding that an increasing number of English visitors are popping over for a long weekend -- just to shop.
For designers and manufacturers trying to appeal to these shoppers, Madison Avenue today serves as a genteel, expensive billboard. Most of the stores sell only their own merchandise, not products produced by others, as department stores and traditional boutiques do. Probably half of them, real estate mavens estimate, have moved to the avenue in the last three or four years.
It is the billboard effect that makes retailers willing to pay more per square foot than, in many instances, they can possibly hope to recoup by selling even the most expensive handbags or shearling coats. "They're loss leaders," said Ms. Kurland of Cushman & Wakefield. "Perhaps half the cost goes into the budget line of advertising and marketing, as opposed to rent."
That is not true for all of them, of course. Both Armani and Timberland report that they do big business at their Madison Avenue outposts. But for most of these stores, "if they are making money, it is not much," said Howard Davidowitz, a longtime retailing analyst.
Despite what he called "the hiccup in the financial markets," Mr. Davidowitz said he expected this to be a great Christmas for city retailers. "New York is a boom town with tourists. You can't get a reservation at the Carlyle; it's hard to get into Le Cirque -- that's some indication."
Other forecasters are a bit more subdued, but far more optimistic than they were just two months ago. Madison Avenue should benefit from the recovery of the stock market -- which hit an all-time high this week -- because it puts money in the pockets of "the more established rich of the Upper East Side," said Alex Cohen, the research director of Cushman & Wakefield. On the other hand, many bond traders have lost their jobs, and Wall Street bonuses are likely to be far lower than they were last year.
And the stock market's gyrations appear to have unnerved consumers, who tell pollsters that when doing their holiday shopping, they are more interested in "value" -- retail-speak for cheap stuff on sale -- than they were a year ago.
It is hard to say just what that might mean on Madison Avenue. Will shoppers pass up Tanino Crisci oxfords in favor of Timberland boots?
Will they skip the china at Christofle in favor of pottery from Crate and Barrel? Or hope their sweethearts will settle for a rather nice cubic zirconium ring from Agatha rather than a diamond solitaire from Cartier? Or will it just mean empty stores?
And that's where the alarm bells come in. While a poor Christmas season is hard on all retailers, it can kill those with high real estate costs to cover. That fact has been easy to ignore for several years, at least until last summer, when the stock market plunged and economists began predicting that a recession might occur.
"When we had that scare back in August, there was some realization that when this thing ends, a lot of real estate could end up on a lot of plates," said Mr. Cohen of RKF. "I sincerely hope rents are coming to some sort of peak, because they have been getting a little out of hand."

Ed Ruscha
 Richard Gray Gallery
 1018 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street
 Manhattan
 Through Dec. 5
No one confounded the verbal and the visual with more economically inventive wit during the 1960's and 70's than Ed Ruscha. This show of mostly small works on paper gives a good account of his work from that period. 
 Among the earliest efforts on view is a series of copies of the word "Annie" from the "Little Orphan Annie" comic strip, done in 1962. That was Mr. Ruscha's road not taken; instead of copying ready-made signs like a Pop artist, he created his own from scratch and embodied them in all sorts of funny and unpredictable ways and always with what seemed to be effortlessly deft precision. Two of his favorite tactics were to give words illusionistic dimension and to embody them in offbeat materials: in a 1967 drawing, the phrase "Eye Infection" is spelled out in an illusory, undulating ribbon; the medium is gunpowder.
Mr. Ruscha has also got much mileage out of typographic style. In "Faith" (1972), slanting, modernistic letters cut in white out of a Rothkoesque red field set up an understated collision between Romanticism and irony. In some groups of works, on the other hand, he employs plain letters to broadcast such gnomic utterances as "Nice, hot vegetables." And in a landscape from the late 70's, tiny phrases like "your love stories" and "your comedies" hover against vast Western distances. Concrete poetry never looked so good.
Also on view, though unfortunately under glass, is a selection of Mr. Ruscha's eccentric books from the period, like "26 Gasoline Stations," "Every Building on Sunset Strip" and "34 Parking Lots."

Landfill Cleanup Head Resigns, as Expected

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LYNDHURST

 BODY:
The executive director of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, which oversees development and landfill cleanup in 14 towns in Bergen and Hudson Counties, has resigned.
The announcement by the director, Anthony Scardino Jr., at the commission's meeting on Wednesday was expected. He had served with the commission for 18 years, during which he helped build its Trash Museum as well as its headquarters and environment center. 
 Opened in 1989 in Lyndhurst, the Trash Museum features exhibits on solid waste disposal and is a popular destination for school classes studying environmental issues.
The commission named Alan J. Steinberg as executive director, effective Tuesday.
Mr. Steinberg, executive vice president of the State Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, was an assistant commissioner at that agency's predecessor, the State Department of Commerce.

Evocative Cells: Uptown, Downtown, All Around

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
There's a lot of Ross Bleckner to see in New York City right now, with two gallery exhibitions and a spate of Absolut Vodka ads in glossy magazines. Taken together they suggest an artist in search of diplomatic immunity, that is, easy travel to different artistic planets, from mystical light-filled abstraction to political art to popular illustration. They also provide a particularly clear view of Mr. Bleckner's strengths and weaknesses and his tendency to undermine and cheapen his own accomplishments.
The gallery shows are at Lehmann Maupin in SoHo and at the artist's longtime home base, Mary Boone, on 57th Street. The Lehmann Maupin show, which includes a soupcon of political photo-based work (a new tangent for the artist), features some of the best paintings he has made in years, maybe ever. Seductive, refined, dominated by his characteristic grisaille palette and infused with a melancholy inner light, these works treat motifs and effects that the artist has pursued for years but with a new economy and force. 
 Thankfully, Mr. Bleckner has jettisoned the greasily varnished fields dotted with birds, flowers or flares of light that dominated so many of the canvases in his 1995 mid-career survey at the Guggenheim Museum. While those works were often described as memorials to the devastation wrought by the AIDS epidemic, such meanings seem largely tacked on by admirers. What really came across was an air of slick Victorian kitschiness.
In these new works, gray-toned expanses of tiny overlapping shapes suggest tiny cells, the transparent cytoplasm of larger cells, microscopic views or cross sections of skin or fish scales. They evoke illness and the body more concretely but also more abstractly than anything Mr. Bleckner has done before. They also resurrect his penchant for Op Art-like effects but seem less a quotation of the earlier style than an attempt to extend it.
The fields are generated by a real dazzler of a technique: hundreds of quick, closely spaced bursts from an airbrush transform still-wet surfaces dotted with circles and spheres into fluctuating networks of cells and shadowy forms. (Think of Yayoi Kusama nets painted in the style of Roger Brown's tightly rendered shaded clouds.)
In fact, the new technique is so dazzling that the first reaction to these paintings may simply be, "How were these things made?," followed quickly by a close-up examination of the surface, which doesn't explain much. You can almost forget to back up and look at them whole, which is something of a weakness. Such mysterious high finish goes bravely against the grain of most current abstraction's emphasis on self-evident process; it's even mildly Victorian (we also look closely at paintings by Edward Burne-Jones or Richard Dadd to try to see how they're made) but with a contemporary sci-fi edge.
It is not surprising that one of two paints titled "Tolerance," in which the little cell-shapes are organized into a big mandalalike dome or wheel, is the best work here. Its concentric circles and radiating spokes add a larger purpose to the tiny pulsating units. In addition, it is more loosely worked: the airbrushed cell-shapes read more clearly as the little pool-like clearings of paint that they really are. And they're not continuous; patches of Mr. Bleckner's casually brushed underlayer remain visible.
Having returned to more abstract imagery, Mr. Bleckner presents his political conscience as a kind of side dish. Along one wall at Lehmann Maupin are a series of photographs of page A3 of The New York Times, all with a major international story appearing beside an ad for Tiffany's. This kind of appropriation was done much better nearly 20 years ago by some of Mr. Bleckner's contemporaries, among them Richard Prince and Sarah Charlesworth. In addition, this juxtaposition of images of harsh reality (war-torn Bosnia, for example) with smug promotions of high-priced elegance seems disingenuous, considering that Mr. Bleckner's paintings belong to the second category themselves.
Things deteriorate further at Boone, where Mr. Bleckner essentially puts his new technique into overproduction, something he has done before. The addition of stronger colors makes the paintings seem more obvious and cloying. DNA-like chains of cells come in pleasant shades of blue, yellow and pink; red is added to other works so that blood cells and scientific illustrations are evoked. And the airbrush technique seems to tighten, which means that many of the cells seem to be made of jelly-beans or beads; suddenly the paintings seem more photo-realist than abstract.
The vodka ads, which also feature the cell-shape surface, are something like the last straw. In this context, a motif intended to set off a certain visual and poetic resonance is leveled, stripped of seriousness and reduced to entertainment. There are very few artists whose work can travel from art gallery to magazine advertisements and retain anything close to its original character; Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Barbara Kruger are possible exceptions. It would be easy to say that Mr. Bleckner misunderstands his own art if he thinks it can, too, but maybe the misunderstanding is ours.
 
Ross Bleckner's new work remains at Lehmann Maupin, 39 Greene Street, near Grand Street, SoHo, and the Mary Boone Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, through Jan. 19.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 28, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An art review in Weekend yesterday about two gallery exhibitions of the work of Ross Bleckner misidentified a painting described as the best in the show at Lehmann Maupin in SoHo. It was "Signaling Pathway," shown in a picture with the review, not "Tolerance."

HEADLINE: Behind Exxon-Mobil Talks Lies a Humbled Oil Industry

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON and AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Whether or not the talks between the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation lead to a merger or some other alliance, America's economic history is already being rewritten.
In energy as in businesses like financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, unthinkable combinations have been made practical, even necessary, by global competition and technology. 
 Oil companies like Exxon and Mobil are under especially great pressure. Crude oil prices have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels, adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo 25 years ago. The oil companies, having spent years cutting their costs, are urgently seeking further savings in order to continue operating profitably with such unexpectedly low prices.
Exxon and Mobil are the two largest, strongest competitors to have emerged from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. Now they face a Royal Dutch/Shell Group that is larger than either of them. They will also confront a British Petroleum P.L.C. made far more potent in the United States by its agreement this summer to buy the Amoco Corporation for $48.2 billion. Industry executives say further deals on this scale are inevitable.
Executives at both companies did not return calls yesterday for comment on the talks, and it was unclear last night what the outcome might be.
But if Exxon and Mobil agree to combine, antitrust regulators are likely to be cautious about putting back together much of what they long ago broke apart. Even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them.
"The ultimate beneficiary of all this will be the consumer," said Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees. Analysts say that of the about 80,000 global employees at Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., and the more than 40,000 at Mobil, in Fairfax, Va., thousands would be likely to lose their jobs.
Exxon, with Lee R. Raymond, and Mobil, with Lucio A. Noto, both have chief executives who have been preoccupied with the humbling accommodations that low oil prices have made necessary. Oil companies were everybody's favorite targets during the trust-busting era early this century and again during the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970's. Now they seem particularly vulnerable as demand weakens in much of the world, especially in economically troubled Asia, weighing further on already depressed prices.
"They're pitiful, helpless giants," said Ronald Chernow, the author of "Titan," a biography of Rockefeller.
As such, these giants are compelled to continue cutting costs and spreading the risks of their huge, expensive international projects to develop oil reserves for the next century.
Mobil, with $58.4 billion in sales last year, might seem large enough to undertake anything. But in competing for rights to develop huge natural gas fields in Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, Mobil was unable to match Shell's offer to build a pipeline for $1 billion or more.
Oil companies have decided that they cannot count on a rebound in oil prices to revive their fortunes any time soon. Earlier this month, the Energy Department predicted that the collapse of Asian demand would continue to depress oil prices for nearly a decade, and by as much as $5.50 a barrel in the year 2000.
And yesterday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put off until March any decision on extending its oil production cutbacks in order to prop up prices.
Improving technology for exploration and production and the opening of new regions to development have added to the huge supply of oil already available.
In response, many energy companies have already begun new waves of cutbacks in staffs and operations. To further reduce costs, companies like Mobil are forming partnerships that stop short of full mergers. Two years ago, Mobil agreed to combine its European refining and marketing operations with British Petroleum's, resulting in annual savings of about $500 million. Shell and Texaco then formed a refining partnership in the United States and Europe.
In the face of these partnerships, said Amy Jaffe, an energy analyst with the James A. Baker 3d Institute for Public Policy in Houston, "if you're an Exxon, how do you compete?"
Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapsed in the 1980's. Thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies through acquired companies like Citgo.
Under Mr. Noto, Mobil has hunted for ways of becoming large and lean enough to survive. He took the lead in the deal with British Petroleum and has considered buying up smaller companies. And he has made it clear that corporate or personal pride would never block a deal. In the European agreement with British Petroleum, Mobil's signs have come down from the fronts of many gas stations, while the green and yellow BP logos have gone up.
As major oil companies team up, said John D. Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, "If the price is right, egos will not get in the way."
In the past, Mobil reportedly had further talks with British Petroleum about other combinations, as well as talks with Amoco about forming an American refining venture. Mobil was also interested in Conoco Inc. when the DuPont Company began looking to divest itself of that oil and gas business. But no deals were reached. More recently, there was speculation on Wall Street that Mobil had been talking with the Chevron Corporation.
The British Petroleum purchase of Amoco put more pressure on Mr. Noto to seek a deal, Mr. Hervey said. "I don't think this whole thing would have started if British Petroleum had not pulled the trigger," he said.
The British Petroleum-Amoco deal, progressing quickly since the August announcement toward an expected $2 billion in annual savings, has put even companies as large as Exxon on the spot. There, Mr. Raymond has so far concentrated more on making his operations more efficient than on finding allies.
Though Royal Dutch/Shell's financial resources are greater than Exxon's, analysts say Exxon still has the size and soundness to absorb a company of Mobil's size.
Only the largest oil companies can afford to take advantage of today's best opportunities. Finding new fields in the deep waters off the coast of West Africa or in the Gulf of Mexico can require platforms costing $1 billion or more. Producing oil in the states of the former Soviet Union has taken more time and money than many investors anticipated.
In September, Mr. Noto was among the American executives invited by a Saudi leader visiting Washington to greatly step up investments in his country, too. Mr. Noto spent 1977 to 1985 in Saudi Arabia himself, building up Mobil operations including a huge refinery. But any new partnerships with the Saudis might require both Mobil's connections and Exxon's capital.
Exxon was once known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil is descended from Standard Oil of New York. Even after the Standard Oil monopoly was broken up, those two companies remained in the same building on lower Broadway in Manhattan for several years.
Mr. Chernow, the Rockefeller biographer, noted that two pieces of the Standard Oil trust are already likely to be united. British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970's, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana.
The breakup of Standard Oil and the resulting competition has often been cited as a precedent for the current antitrust action against Microsoft. Mr. Chernow sees no reason why allowing an Exxon acquisition of Mobil to go through should suggest more leniency for Microsoft. "Exxon would not be obviously larger than its leading competitors, the way Microsoft is," he said. In the energy business today, he added, "there are other large dinosaurs that stalk that particular jungle."

 CORRECTION:
Charts with the continuation of a front-page article yesterday about changes in the oil industry and the talks between Exxon and Mobil misstated the companies' 1997 revenue. Exxon had $137.2 billion in revenue, not $120.3 billion, and Mobil had $65.9 billion, not $58.4 billion. A combined company would have had $203.1 billion in revenue, not $201.6 billion.

HEADLINE: Robert Eisner, Steadfast Keynesian Economist, Dies at 76

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Robert Eisner, former president of the American Economic Association and a staunch advocate of a view unpopular among an increasing number of academic economists that active Government spending is needed to achieve full employment and growth, died Wednesday at his home in Evanston, Ill. He was 76.
The cause was complications from a bone marrow disorder, his daughter, Mary Eccles, said. 
 Mr. Eisner, the William R. Kenan Emeritus Professor of Economics at Northwestern University, served several years as the chairman of the university's economics department.
Prof. Robert Coen of Northwestern, who was a student of Mr. Eisner and a longtime colleague, said: "He was a leading authority on the economics of public budgets, business cycles, Social Security and taxes. He brought a rare combination of passion and scientific precision to policy discussions. His technical contributions were central to some of the most important policy debates of recent times."
Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "Mr. Eisner was fearless. He never softened his language to ingratiate. Yet no serious person in the profession ever dismissed his views."
Mr. Eisner's early statistical studies concluded that business investment in plant and equipment was determined more by the state of the economy -- how close the economy was operating to capacity -- than by interest rates and other economic factors. His research made him skeptical that monetary policy, which operates through interest rates, could keep the economy on a steady upward climb.
He called instead on Government to drive the economy toward full employment, running deficits if need be. This so-called Keynesian view -- that the economy could not on its own achieve full employment and could use help from the Government -- conformed to the teachings of leading figures within the economics profession during the 1950's and 1960's. But the view increasingly fell out of favor in the aftermath of the inflationary bursts and soaring deficits of the 1970's and 1980's.
Mr. Eisner, in scores of professional publications, Congressional testimony and articles for newspapers, backed up his call for active fiscal policy by criticizing what he regarded as simplistic attacks on deficit spending. Mr. Eisner argued in several books in the 1980's and 1990's that the Government's measure of deficits greatly exaggerated their size and importance. Once the impact of inflation and the size of the economy were taken into account, he concluded, the country could readily afford deficits of $200 billion or more. He also cautioned against cutting Federal spending on education, research and infrastructure for the sake of reducing Federal borrowing.
Mr. Eisner also took issue with economists who attributed the nation's lagging growth rate to low savings -- a faulty diagnosis, he said, that led to regrettable policy prescriptions. Again, he dissected the way Government measures savings, concluding that it was arbitrary and narrow. In a phone interview, he once said: "When a firm pays for slabs of concrete, we call that investment. But when parents pay tuition for their children, we call that consumption."
The key to growth, he wrote, was to increase investment spending by running a fully employed economy rather than to persuade families and government to consume less.
His most pointed criticism was directed at economists who advocated what he regarded as the pernicious idea that the Government could not use monetary or fiscal policies to drive unemployment below, say, 5.5 or 6 percent, out of fear that the effort would lead to escalating inflation. The idea, Mr. Eisner argued, relegated millions of workers to needless unemployment. Mr. Coen said Mr. Eisner took satisfaction in the fact that unemployment has now fallen well below levels that his critics said could never be achieved and, as a byproduct, the once-threatening deficit has been eliminated.
In his most recent book, "Social Security: More, Not Less," and other writings, Mr. Eisner took on critics of Social Security who contend that the program is financially decrepit and must be radically overhauled, perhaps by turning it into a system of individual savings accounts. By Mr. Eisner's calculations, the system is only modestly out of financial alignment and can be balanced with minor tinkering. He took aim at critics who pointed to the financial drain that the growing population of elderly would put on future taxpayers, but who ignored the fact that those same taxpayers would have fewer children to support and, besides, would be earning far higher wages than today's workers.
Mr. Eisner proposed innovative ways for the Government to track the economy and keep its books. For example, he sought ways to take official account of the work done by at-home spouses. Several of his ideas have been formally adopted. Others, though excluded from formal Government documents, are included in occasional reports.
Mr. Eisner was, according to colleagues at Northwestern, a zealous teacher who took special delight in teaching introductory courses to undergraduates. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the Econometric Society, and was the 15th recipient of the John R. Commons Award of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the international honor society in economics.
Mr. Eisner was born in New York City, received his bachelor's degree from City College in 1940, his master's degree in sociology from Columbia University in 1942 and his doctoral degree in economics from Johns Hopkins University in 1951. He served in the Army from December 1942 to August 1946, rising to the rank of captain.
He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Edith; two daughters, Mary Eisner Eccles of Chevy Chase, Md., and Emily Eisner of Chicago; a brother, Alan Eisner of Redwood City, Calif., and three grandchildren.
Despite his often controversial views, Mr. Eisner, according to colleagues, remained highly popular among his peers. James Tobin, a Nobel laureate from Yale University, said: "Bob was never considered an outlier. His colleagues knew he played in the right ball park."
Nor, Mr. Solow of M.I.T. said, are Mr. Eisner's Keynesian views necessarily a relic: "He taught the profession a lot. And it ain't over. The Keynesian idea, or some such variant, that the economy is not self-correcting and needs government help is coming back. Mr. Eisner is not obsolete."

HEADLINE: Census Chief's Dream: Grand Tally Minus Politics

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Kenneth Prewitt, the new director of the Census Bureau, certainly talks like an intellectual, sprinkling his speech with Britishisms like "full stop," when dramatically ending a thought.
He certainly has the life style of an intellectual, living in Manhattan's SoHo section with his wife, Susan Vogel, a collector of African art who last year undertook an eight-week boat trip up the River Niger, where Mr. Prewitt caught up with her on Christmas Eve in Timbuktu. 
 "The Timbuktu?" asked an impressed aide, who heard the story for the first time recently. "The Timbuktu," Mr. Prewitt assured him.
But as Mr. Prewitt, who was confirmed last month on the day the Senate broke for recess, wanders into the fracas over whether the 2000 census will use sampling, he has sought to put the partisan denizens of Washington's political world on notice that he is not some pointy-headed milquetoast from academia they can push around.
At a meeting of the Census Monitoring Board, a panel set up by Congress and the Administration to keep tabs on preparations for the 2000 census, Mr. Prewitt, 52, complained that his staff was being hamstrung by the constant and often redundant requests for information by myriad overseers, including the House Subcommittee on the Census, the monitoring board and the General Accounting Office.
"Maybe we need a hearing on oversight and monitoring responsibilities and relationships," Mr. Prewitt suggested.
The message was politely delivered, but unmistakable: leave us alone and let us do our job. Get the partisan politics out of the census.
Given the importance that Republicans and Democrats have placed on how to conduct the census, which is crucial to Congressional redistricting and may help determine the makeup of the House, the notion of politics being removed from the census may be impossible. But friends say Mr. Prewitt, who has moved to Washington and commutes home on weekends, is at least trying to bolster the morale of the bureau.
Norman Bradburn, a close friend who is a political science professor at the University of Chicago, said, "I think he's trying to reassert the professional competence of the bureau, and the bureau director, and to establish some sense that these are professionals who know what they're doing."
Mr. Prewitt's full-throated cry for respect and independence for his agency did not come as a surprise to his friends and family. Mr. Prewitt, a former college professor, vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation and director of the Social Science Research Council, which seeks to promote new research in the social sciences, is well versed in the often-ferocious politics of the academic and foundation worlds.
Ms. Vogel, his wife, said: "Many people have commented on the intense politicking in academic institutions. The joke is that the politicking is so intense because the stakes are so small. But there it is. It's not something he hasn't done before."
And friends say that beneath his bespectacled and slight frame is a man who is not averse to risk. After all, this is a man who every three weeks gets together with his buddies and plays "pot limit" poker, meaning that the whole pot can be bet on any one hand. Pots can range as high as $400.
And while he is steeped in the world of statistics, he is also a man who lived for years in East Africa, where he would fly his own plane to places so desolate that should one develop engine trouble and go down, chances of rescue were two standard deviations on the wrong side of slim.
"He certainly has never been afraid of hard things," his wife said.
Throughout his adult life, Mr. Prewitt, who has two grown children from his first marriage, also has assiduously tried to find the middle ground, including carving out compromises between his own inner impulses toward social activism and scholarly contemplation. As a young man, he attended Harvard's Divinity School. At the same time, he worked on the weekends at a settlement house in Somerville, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston.
"I found it difficult," he said, "to go from the realities of the kids and their lives and that neighborhood on the weekends and then go next to theoretical discussions."
He forged a compromise. He quit divinity school. But rather than becoming an advocate, he turned to studying political structures and how they could be made to improve the lives of real people. That interest led to teaching in the mid-1960's and early 1970's at the University of Nairobi in Kenya and the University of East Africa in Uganda.
Mr. Prewitt said that experience taught him the value that high-quality, apolitical statistical data could provide to governments. "I have watched countries struggle with trying to put in place the capacity to guide their policies without good data," he said. "The colonial powers did not bequeath the African nations the capacity to understand their own societies. And I've watched countries be crippled by the absence of reasonable intelligence about demography and economics."
During that period he was also a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, where he became involved in the civil rights movement and participated in teach-ins against the war in Vietnam.
In one of life's paradoxes, his anti-war activities in Chicago placed him in political opposition to the city's Mayor, Richard J. Daley. Now, 30 years later, he is working for a son of the Mayor, William M. Daley, who as Secretary of Commerce, oversees the Census Bureau.
In 1976, Mr. Prewitt became the director of the university's National Opinion Research Center, a leading survey research organizations that had suffered from directors who were more concerned with research than management.
Mr. Prewitt's colleagues figured that he would end up being the president of a college or university. Instead, he surprised them by taking a position as president of the New York-based Social Science Research Council, then senior vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation and then, once again the head of the Social Science Research Council.
"He's an academic, a scholar, a well-established political scientist with good administrative skills and a sort of broad view about the development of different fields of study and institutions," Mr. Bradburn said. "Anybody in the academic world who has those kinds of skills usually will become dean, work their way up to be provost and then to president."
But Mr. Prewitt felt that was not for him. "I was sensing that a large part of a university presidency and university administration has ceased being what I wanted," he said. "It was all money raising. The jobs I took at S.S.R.C. and Rockefeller were closer to the research world."
Keeping the Census Bureau squarely in the research world -- and out of politics -- is now the challenge Mr. Prewitt faces.
"He will do as well as possible under the circumstances," Mr. Bradburn said. "It may be that the political circumstances will not allow the Census Bureau to do the best job that it could. If he's able to bring it off, people will say he did a brilliant job. If he doesn't, of course, he will be blamed."

HEADLINE: Is the Box Half-Full or Half-Empty?;
Top Cereal Maker Fights To Retain Eroding Share

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Those snap, crackle and pop folks have been asleep at the breakfast table.
The Kellogg Company's cereal business is in trouble, upstaged by bagels, breakfast bars, bran muffins and, right on the next shelf, no-name cereals. 
 Increasingly, time-starved consumers who once started their day splashing milk over a bowl of wheat flakes prefer to nosh a bagel in the car or nibble a breakfast bar on the way to school. And prices for brand-name cereals have gotten so high that shoppers think nothing of trading down to generic brands or steering clear of the breakfast aisle altogether.
All this comes at a time when Kellogg is also increasing its spending on new products and promotions -- just this week it added a new ad agency -- all of which puts an added squeeze on profits.
The staleness of its growth, meanwhile, has led to speculation of a management shake-up at the top. Carlos M. Gutierrez, who was named president and chief operating officer in June and thought to be the most likely successor to Arnold G. Langbo, Kellogg's chief executive, might have a chance to step up his role sooner rather than later. Last Wednesday, as speculation grew about an imminent change or a reduction in Mr. Langbo's role, Wall Street signaled its approval by driving the company's shares up.
All this has put the maker of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies in a quandary: How can it freshen up its cereal business?
For one thing, Kellogg, which is far more dependent on cereal than its rivals are, will try to tune in to today's tastes by selling more non-cereal foods and pitching its cereal as a nutritional part of a healthy diet. Beyond that, it simply hopes to run a tighter ship. The company, said a spokesman, Joseph Stewart, plans to increase its investment in research and development and marketing innovation, expand lines like Eggo frozen waffles, Nutri-Grain bars and other alternative breakfast foods and cut costs worldwide. The company has made management changes, announced that job cuts are coming at its headquarters in Battle Creek, Mich., and, most visibly, has come out with advertising that stresses nutrition instead of sugar.
One new ad campaign uses the tag line "a healthier life is within your reach" and tries to link the nutritional benefits of certain ingredients in cereal with a lower risk of birth defects, heart disease and cancer.
Kellogg, in fact, is taking the nutrition angle a step further by introducing a product line next year called Ensemble -- foods it will promote as being healthy. The line is expected to be rolled out in Midwestern markets by the spring and should be on store shelves nationwide by the fall of 1999. It includes frozen entrees, cookies and muffins that contain grain or whole oats, which studies have shown can help lower cholesterol.
Kellogg, of course, is not abandoning cereal, but it is trying some new tricks to sell it. For one, while the company will not say whether it plans to lower prices further, which would almost certainly set off a price war, it is in effect doing so through heavy use of coupons and other promotions. It recently introduced Breakfast Mates, a packaged combination of cereal, milk and a spoon sold in the dairy case. And more change is in the works. "We are just at the beginning of this," Mr. Stewart promises.
The problem is that consumers -- and investors -- may not bite. The trend toward low-fat, healthy food seems to have peaked. And while packaging cereal with a spoon is certainly a novel idea, it may still be tough to get today's frenetic masses to sit still long enough to add the milk. And even for those consumers still focused on health, convincing them to buy Frosted Mini-Wheats for the fiber instead of the frosting may be a bit of a stretch.
"I can't feel particularly encouraged by any of the moves that have been announced lately," said Peter Schofield, an analyst with John Hancock Sovereign Investors Fund, which owns about 250,000 shares in General Mills, the No. 2 cereal maker, but has steered clear of Kellogg. "I think that because they've been on a slide in terms of market share they have a lot of making up to do now and they are not playing from a position of strength."
In general, analysts and portfolio managers say, Kellogg's new marketing initiatives are at least a year too late, product innovation has been slow and spotty, and the company is still struggling to find the right pricing mix. Compounding those problems, they say, is that Kellogg's management has been stingy on details of its turnaround plan and sensitive to criticism of its missteps.
"It's almost like saying their daughter is ugly," said John M. McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. He rates the company's stock a hold, concluding that for investors "it's too late to sell and too early to buy."
The company's stock has fallen more than 28 percent this year, closing yesterday at $35.9375.
To be sure, Kellogg is not alone in its suffering. Other cereal makers, like General Mills, maker of Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms, have faced many of the same pressures in a shrinking market.
Children, the biggest consumers of cereal, have cut their demand about 3 percent in the last two years, according to NPD Group, a market research organization, while adults have pared cereal consumption by about 5 percent over the same period.
In the last five years, sales in the nation's cereal business have declined by $1 billion, to $7.134 billion. Kellogg has lost the most ground over that period, with its share dropping to 32 percent from 35.5 percent, according to Information Resources Inc.
The share of the market held by makers of private-label cereals, like the Malt-O-Meal Company, meanwhile, has risen to 7.5 percent from 5.4 percent as they have aggressively rolled out cheaper alternatives to the name brands.
Even though the struggle to fend off private-label companies and to get people to eat more cereal is not confined to Kellogg, the company has been the hardest hit because more of its sales and profits are dependent on cereal.
"They are the category leader and this is their core business, so they are going to benefit more in good times and be hurt more in bad times," said Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, which sold its 540,000 shares of Kellogg months ago. "At this point they are a bit stuck."
Last month, the company reported a 32 percent drop in third-quarter profits, to $141.9 million, or 35 cents a diluted share. Kellogg has also warned that profits for the full year will be disappointing, possibly falling as much as 20 percent.
It has also not helped Kellogg's performance, analysts and fund managers say, that the company has tended to have a cliquish corporate culture in which all the ideas come from the old guard.
"Simply stated, there was no creativity," said Steven M. Galbraith, a money manager at Pzena Investment Management and a former food industry analyst. "They relied on what used to work in a dramatically changing consumer environment."
Lately, however, there is a sense that Kellogg is finally taking a different approach. The company has ordered all executives at its headquarters to justify their jobs, and may announce the outcome of the review as early as next week. In September, it announced the departures of two top executives, Thomas Knowlton, head of the North American division, and Donald Fritz, president of the European division.
And in one of his first major moves as president, in September Mr. Gutierrez announced with Mr. Langbo a three-month review of Kellogg's overall administrative structure. The goal is to shave $100 million in costs, in part to free more money for promotional spending. The addition of the Martin Agency this week to its roster of three ad agencies for ready-to-eat cereal in the United States was seen as an effort to bolster slowing sales and to stem eroding market share.
Kellogg has reduced costs and promised big savings before, though, leaving Wall Street less than impressed this time. And even attempts to take on new competitors have not always added much to profitability.
When, for instance, Kellogg realized that bagels had became the breakfast of choice in many kitchens, cars and cafeterias, it did get in on the action by buying the Lender's frozen-bagel business in 1996. But by then, many consumers were nibbling fresh bagels with yuppified ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes and pesto. Bagel shops were popping up everywhere, and even supermarket bakeries were selling fresh ones.
"They paid like $400 million two years ago to buy a frozen-bagel business that was kind of yesterday's news," said Mr. McMillin of Prudential. He estimates that Lender, whose numbers Kellogg does not break out from its overall results, has had double-digit volume declines since Kellogg bought it. "To buy a frozen product when clearly the movement of consumers was to fresh," he said, "didn't make much sense to me then and it doesn't now."
Aside from the Lender's line, however, Kellogg says it sees other ways to grow, particularly with international expansion of convenience foods and cereals. But recent economic turmoil in international markets has hit many American consumer product makers hard and underscores the pitfalls that Kellogg may face as it expands abroad.
Despite all the challenges, though, Kellogg still has a solid lead in the cereal business and the expertise and resources to fight back.
"For all their current problems," Mr. McMillin said, "Kellogg is still an enviable franchise that controls 45 percent of the global cereal industry. This is a franchise that is still very valuable and I think has the potential to grow."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Hong Kong Says Economy Shrank 7% in Quarter

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Posting the worst performance since the keeping of records began nearly four decades ago, Hong Kong said today that its economy shrank by an estimated 7 percent in the third quarter.
But officials here said the territory might have hit bottom -- with agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund forecasting that output would rebound in the second half of 1999. 
 Hong Kong's economy has been shrinking at an accelerating rate since the first quarter of this year, as the Asian financial crisis has pummeled retail sales, exports, tourism, and domestic consumption. Today's announcement was a new low.
"These were quite depressing figures," said Sir Donald Tsang, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, at a news conference.
But Sir Donald expressed some optimism. He said the Hong Kong government expected a full-year decline of 5 percent. That implies Hong Kong's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic growth, would drop by less than 7 percent in the current quarter.
"We have to go through what I call a psychological barrier," Sir Donald said, noting that Hong Kong probably faced two more quarters of negative performance before the trend reversed.
For all the horrendous numbers, Hong Kong's stock market barely wavered today, with the Hang Seng index edging down 37 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 10,732. As they have for nearly two months, investors disregarded Hong Kong's fundamentals, preferring to focus on recent cuts in interest rates here and in the United States, which they believe will reinvigorate consumer demand.
"Yesterday we had a historic low in export figures and the market went up; today we had a historic low in economic output, and the market barely moved," said Dong Tao, the senior regional economist at Credit Suisse First Boston here. "The market is simply ignoring all the bad news."
Real estate prices have rebounded even more sharply than the stock market. A stock index that tracks leading property developers has risen 90.7 percent in the last two months -- the sharpest increase ever in that period, according to a report by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
It is unclear what the growing disparity between the markets and the underlying economy means. Some forecasters say the improved sentiment will pull up the economy, since Hong Kong has always been fueled by intangible factors like consumer confidence. Some say the rising property and share prices merely delay what will be a painful economic adjustment.
"Hong Kong is on a placebo therapy," Mr. Tao said. "The improved sentiment is a good thing. But placebos are just sugar pills."
Others say the buoyant markets prevent Hong Kong from reducing its costs, which are the highest in Asia and put it at a competitive disadvantage. Singapore, vying with Hong Kong to be the financial hub of East Asia, adopted a package of wage and pension reductions earlier this week that will carve $6.5 billion in costs out of its economy.
"The recovery in Hong Kong will be the slowest in the region simply because the price levels haven't fully adjusted," said Marc Faber, the chairman of Marc Faber Ltd., an investment advisory firm here.
Indeed, a new report by an outside agency, the Asian Development Bank, predicted that for all of 1999, Hong Kong's economy would contract by 2 percent.
Mr. Faber said Hong Kong's high costs were already negatively affecting areas like shipping. He said that container traffic in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city across the border from Hong Kong, had increased 90 percent so far this year, while traffic in Hong Kong's port had risen only marginally.
There are signs that Hong Kong is beginning to confront its costs. On Thursday, Hong Kong Telecom reached an agreement with its employees to tie their bonuses to the company's financial performance.
Hong Kong Telecom had earlier announced an across-the-board salary cut of 10 percent. But it was forced to retreat after employees protested and it came under criticism from Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.
Beyond cutting costs, analysts said there was little Hong Kong could do to hasten its recovery. With an economy heavily reliant on trade, its future depended very much, they said, on the health of its trading partners, primarily China and, to a lesser extent, the United States and Japan.
"If we had a situation where Japan and the rest of Asia stayed lackluster, the U.S. and Europe slowed to 2 percent growth, and China slipped to 6 percent, next year could be pretty bleak," said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
There was scarcely a hint of boom times in the statistics released this week. Retail sales declined 20 percent in the third quarter, while exports fell 17.5 percent in October. And tourist arrivals declined 11 percent in the first 10 months of the year.
Hong Kong's consumer price index rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in October -- the smallest increase ever -- prompting some analysts to declare that Hong Kong had entered a deflationary spiral. But today, a government economist took issue with that, noting that in a genuine deflation, property and share prices would have to fall as well.
Nor are real estate and stocks the only things going up. While the number of people visiting Hong Kong has declined over the year so far, tourist arrivals rose two-tenths of 1 percent in October. And the Hong Kong Monetary Authority reported that its foreign reserves rose slightly last month, to $88.7 billion.
More important, analysts said fears that China would become the next casualty of the Asian crisis have receded a bit. China's economy expanded 7.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with the corresponding quarter last year. That is an increase from 6.6 percent expansion in the second quarter.
The strength of the Chinese economy is crucial to Hong Kong, because much of its trade consists of exports that flow from the mainland into Hong Kong, where they are repackaged and shipped elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Bargain Hunters Are Out Early in City and Mall

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
By midmorning yesterday, Steven Tamasy had found the perfect Christmas gift. Of course, it was for himself.
Mr. Tamasy, 32, a travel agent from Brookline, Mass., went in for the kill at Filene's Basement in Boston, an off-price store. His find was a velvet shirt-style jacket, listed originally at $500, marked down to $81. 
 "I suppose it's kind of like a hunter when he bags a deer," he said, reflecting on his prize. "I mean, I would have strapped that thing to the hood of my car if I could have."
It was not so long ago that the day after Thanksgiving was when American shoppers raced to the stores to beat each other out of the most popular items, willingly paying full price and rarely expecting to unearth a bargain. But the 1990's have transformed the holiday shopping experience into one giant national hunt for deals, with retailers forced to court shoppers with promises of low prices rather than rare goods.
What's behind the change? A tough economy in the early part of the decade impelled retailers to slash prices. From then on, consumers resisted any effort on the part of retailers to return to full price, even in more prosperous years. Meanwhile, pretty much the same merchandise was readily available in a variety of stores across the country, forcing merchants to differentiate themselves with price tags.
And do not forget the mood of plain old thriftiness that has become a badge of honor even among affluent shoppers who love to say they got their Donna Karan cashmere jacket at a sample sale for half price.
The kickoff to the 1998 holiday season was much the same as last year, only more so, as dozens of chains opened their doors at the crack of the dawn, some as early as 5 A.M., offering heavily promoted early-bird specials.
Shoppers formed lines outside discount stores, and retailers like Bloomingdale's used giant, red sale signs as their principal form of holiday decoration.
While there will be some exceptions -- the apparently irresistible Furby dolls, for instance -- that will sell out early and at full price, plenty of merchandise could already be had for at least 10 percent off yesterday. And many shoppers, spooked by the inexplicable movements of the stock market, said they would watch their pennies this year a little more carefully.
"I'm cautious about the economy," said Carol Cooper, 61, who was shopping in Manhattan's SoHo district yesterday with her daughter, Sandy. "It's a little too good to be true, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop."
In Santa Monica, Calif., Cherie Hankal, a 38 year-old assistant television director, sat sipping coffee yesterday at the Third Street Promenade, a pedestrian mall. She had no plans to shop.
"I lost my job this year, so I'm not doing a lot of shopping," she said. "I'm going to bake. That's the nice thing to do for people."
But low prices could be the lure for others. Still, while all the sales come-ons -- some department stores even had them in their trim-a-tree departments -- might be great for shoppers, it can be risky business for retailers looking to turn a profit in the busy season. "I'm worried about my companies," said Susan Silverstein, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. "In the last months, the level of ads and coupons has been pretty aggressive. It seems to be getting earlier and earlier."
Black Friday, as the day after Thanksgiving has been known -- retailers have counted on the day to turn red ink into black for the year -- has become less popular in recent years.
Although it is still a frenetic day, people tend to buy even more in the final few days leading up to Christmas and in the super-bargain days after. Last year, for instance, retailers had a mediocre holiday selling season, but ended the year on an upbeat note with sales made from Dec. 24 through the New Year.
To entice shoppers to buy more now, merchants have combined price slashing with early hours, offering special deals for those who are willing to come out at dawn for sweaters and coffee makers. Stores from Best Buy to Zale jewelers to Macy's -- like Bloomingdale's a unit of Federated Department Stores -- offered lower prices for those willing to shop roughly between 7 A.M. and 11 A.M.
In Denver, the strategy appeared to pay off. By 7:30 A.M., there was a line of several hundred people outside a Best Buy store in Westminster, one of the city's western suburbs. "To save $20 I waited in line for two hours," said Nancy McCarthy, 45, an insurance company employee. "No sale is worth it or that good."
By 5:30 A.M. at the Newport Mall in Jersey City, dozens of shoppers were outside the Kay-Bee Toy store, a unit of Consolidated Stores. "One guy lined up at 2 A.M.," said John Konarski, vice president of the International Council of Shopping Centers. "Who does that?"
A Christmas theme for several years had been the Phoenix-like rise of the discount stores, once left for dead because of a reputation for tackiness but currently attracting shoppers from all walks of life.
In Boise, Idaho, for instance, shoppers waited at 7 A.M. yesterday for the doors to open at the Target store, a unit of Dayton Hudson. By 7:30 A.M., the parking lot was jammed. Lynn Jones, 41, of Boise woke up at 3 A.M., finished her job of delivering 300 newspapers and then picked up her friend, Shelly Draper, to hit the discount stores. They bought several Raggedy Ann dolls, Hot Wheels cars and children's clothes. They were the 700th and 701st people to arrive at the store, so they got their Hot Wheels cars free.
Retail analysts and economists will probably keep a sharp eye on the luxury shops for insights into the well-being of the normally free-spending wealthy. In recent months, business has been a little shaky, with women's high-end clothes and men's expensive suits selling poorly.
Wall Streeters, despite the big rebound in the market, appear cautious. "I've survived so far, but this Christmas, I think I will take it easy," said Alex Ryshawuy, who works for an investment bank, as he looked over some ties at Barneys New York. "I feel a little bit nervous. I'll still buy luxury items this year, just probably fewer, select items."
And many shoppers around the country are thinking similar thoughts. "This is the first year we've created a budget," said Beth Knight, 33, who lives in Jacksonville, Fla. After her family's stock portfolio took a heavy blow this summer, she and her husband sold some stocks before they rebounded. "We acted a little prematurely; we panicked," she said. "Maybe next year will be better."
Very few red-hot items stood out yesterday, and it was too early to tell whether digital videodisks -- DVD -- will bail out electronic retailers, which have been waiting in vain for another breakthrough product like the VCR.
But as usual, at least one toy managed to create some hysteria and resentment among adults who were going crazy to get their hands on it. It was Furby, the doll manufactured by the Tiger Electronics unit of Hasbro. It speaks an imaginary language called "Furbish."
Karen Jenkins, a cashier who also lives in Jacksonville, said she arrived at a Wal-Mart Stores outlet at 6 A.M. because the store advertised a stock of Furby dolls that would be sold on a first-come basis. She found 70 people in line already, most of them holding tickets to purchase Furby. "I was disgusted," she said, before trooping off to Target.
In recent years, retailers have also been forced to compete for holiday spending dollars. Some of the diverted cash is easily traced. The travel industry is booming, for example, as many people choose to take trips rather than buy gifts. "We're not really shopping," said Kurt Hotto, 41, a software designer from Denver, even though he was sitting in the middle of a mall. "We're taking the kids to Mexico, and it's a surprise."
Other things are harder to trace, such as the $150 a man might spend to give his wife an English gardening magazine, or the $500 tennis lessons a woman may choose to give her boyfriend rather than a new suit. Stephanie Gray, who was browsing Bloomingdale's in Manhattan yesterday, said she was giving her husband's car a spiffy detail job as one gift. She also said she liked to take her daughters for a "spa day."
"We do more things like that than we used to," said Ms. Gray, 50. "Sometimes it is neat to give things that are not from stores."
But retailers profess not to be worried. "Everybody is really up this year," said Mr. Konarski, the shopping centers' executive. "Our sales-for-the-year index is up 3.1 percent. In 1997, at this time, it was up only 0.9 percent. People just feel like they have more money. Inflation is flat, and job growth is strong. The fact that things aren't getting worse may be good enough."

HEADLINE: New Data Point Blame at Gun Makers

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
As many as half the handguns used in crimes had been purchased from federally licensed dealers within the prior three years, passing far more quickly from manufacturer to dealer to criminal than previously believed, according to new Federal law-enforcement data that are expected to play a major role in suits against the handgun industry.
That finding, along with other evidence that is emerging in the suits, challenges a long-held view that most guns used in crimes are stolen, say academic experts, gun-control advocates and lawyers suing the gun makers. They say the data show that many handguns enter an illegal black market even as they leave the store, contrary to the industry's argument that its dealers are not the source and that measures like better inventory control and tighter regulation would do little to keep guns from criminals. 
 "The data is hugely significant, because it shows that there is a stream of guns, especially semiautomatic handguns, that are moving very rapidly out of gun stores into the hands of criminals," said David Kennedy, a researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and director of the Boston Gun Project, which has helped reduce juvenile violence in Boston by identifying and cracking down on gun dealers who sell to minors.
"It means this is something we can fix," Mr. Kennedy said.
Spokesmen for the gun industry call the statistics exaggerated and argue that in any case, the length of time between sale and crime is a poor gauge of whether a gun has most likely been stolen.
One of the first tests of the research's significance will be in New York, where Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, a suit brought by the relatives of victims of gun violence, is scheduled for trial this January in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn. This suit, like one brought by the City of Chicago, accuses gun makers of creating a public hazard by flooding the market with their products and, through negligence in distribution control, virtually guaranteeing that some guns will wind up in the hands of people who have no business owning them.
A study prepared for the plaintiffs in the Hamilton case, based on data compiled by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, contends that nearly 40 percent of the handguns used in crimes around the country had been purchased from licensed dealers within the preceding three years.
The bureau itself, which is collecting the data as part of a major new effort to trace the origins of handguns confiscated in crimes, has reported that 48.8 percent of the confiscated guns that it could trace had been sold by a dealer within the previous three years.
"I think there is a large segment of gun makers who should know that criminals and young people are a large share of their market," said Kristen Rand, a lawyer for the Violence Policy Center, an advocacy group in Washington. "The great unknown is whether they deliberately turn a blind eye because they don't want to know what is happening."
Guns legally move from a manufacturer to a distributor and then to licensed dealers. But the new data suggest that many handguns enter the illegal market through dealers' selling them to straw purchasers acting for another customer, to out-of-town buyers who cannot legally buy guns back home or to buyers who lack gun permits.
In Chicago, for example, which has one of the nation's most restrictive gun laws, undercover officers recently went to suburban dealers and were able to buy guns while posing as members of city street gangs. Chicago is using evidence from that sting operation to seek hundreds of millions of dollars in its own lawsuit against gun makers.
Both the analysis prepared for the Hamilton case and the data compiled by the Federal firearms agency are strongly disputed by the gun industry. "Obviously if a gun is stolen, it can be stolen when it is young, so their assumption is incorrect, that short 'time to crime' means the gun is purchased by a criminal and not stolen," said James P. Dorr, a Chicago lawyer who represents three of the gun makers named in the Hamilton suit: the Smith & Wesson Corporation, which is owned by Tomkins P.L.C.; Sturm, Ruger & Company, and the Colt's Manufacturing Company.
In addition, Mr. Dorr said, the analysis in the Hamilton suit and the firearms agency's own estimate fail to take sufficient account of the large number of guns that for any of several reasons -- their age, perhaps, or the erasure of their serial numbers -- cannot be traced to the manufacturer and licensed dealers.
"Given all of this, we think their high-end figure is meaningless," Mr. Dorr said of the firearms agency's estimate.
But officials of both the agency and its parent, the Treasury Department, said their data had been carefully weighted to include those guns that could not be traced. That is why the agency provided a range, one official said, with a low estimate that 26.6 percent of all guns seized in crimes had been purchased within the last three years -- along with the high estimate of 48.8 percent, reflecting only those guns traced to the dealer.
The figures were based on a study of all handguns seized by the police in 17 cities, New York among them, during 1996 and 1997.
The estimates in the Hamilton case are based on a different set of data: the firearms agency's figures on confiscated handguns traced nationwide from 1989 to 1997. These estimates were prepared by economists with National Economic Research Associates, New York consultants who often provide expert testimony for corporations.
The economists, working for Elisa Barnes, the lawyer who filed the Hamilton suit, also estimated from firearms agency data that 23 to 25 percent of all handguns sold from 1989 to 1992 had been used in a crime by the end of 1997, and that 54 percent of handguns used in a crime in New York State had been purchased within the preceding three years.
In addition, the economists estimated from the agency's data that 90 percent of handguns used in crimes in New York State were originally sold in other states. More than half the handguns used in crimes in New York, the economists concluded, were brought in from just five states, all with lax gun-control laws: Virginia, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
Statistical analysis proves, the economists said, that the sales in these states with weak gun-control laws "are higher than can be explained by legitimate demand -- suggesting that a substantial proportion of sales in such states are not for legitimate purposes but for resale to the criminal market." This, they said, amounts to gun makers' deliberately oversupplying dealers in these Southern states, knowing that the excess guns will be taken to states like New York with strong gun laws.
A review of depositions by some of the 50 gun makers being sued in the Hamilton case, the economists said, "suggests that many if not all manufacturers deliberately chose not to exercise any supervision over the distributors and dealers to which they sell."
That, Mr. Dorr said, is "absolutely incorrect." Such accusations "ignore the regulatory system" in which all dealers must be federally licensed and all handgun sales are "pre-approved" by law-enforcement officials, under either the Brady Law or equivalent state laws. If there are rogue dealers selling to criminals, he said, it is up to law enforcement to arrest them.
Moreover, Mr. Dorr said, although the firearms agency usually communicates with the manufacturer when doing a trace of a gun seized in a crime, it does not disclose anything about the crime, or even that there has been one, leaving the gun maker in the dark about whether its product has actually been used for criminal purposes.
Ms. Barnes, the lawyer in the Hamilton suit, said gun makers could reduce the number of guns flowing to criminals by adopting modern inventory control and other strict distribution standards. Such measures are already widely used by the makers of other hazardous products, like scuba gear and certain chemicals and paints.
Coincidentally, the five-day waiting period required before buying a handgun under the Brady Law will expire on Monday. It is supposed to be replaced by a system in which gun dealers can immediately get information, from computers set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or state police agencies, on whether a customer is a convicted felon. But Ms. Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that "nobody knows what will happen" on Monday, because Congress has not approved sufficient money to create the F.B.I. system and many states have moved slowly to set up databases of their own.

HEADLINE: A New York Symbol of Openness Battens Its Doors

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
City Hall, the ornate, off-white building that has stood -- in symbol and in fact -- for open government in New York City for almost two centuries, has been virtually off-limits to the public for three months now, as part of an extraordinary security strategy imposed by the Giuliani administration.
In keeping with a security plan called Operation Bravo, concrete barriers create what is called a "protective zone" around the old building, and police cruisers block access to its parking area. As part of a "pedestrian freeze" tactic, police officers are turning away tourists and banning all protests and news conferences from the steps of a building that has been the historic last recourse for the city's wronged and outraged. 
 The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani justifies the need for the security crackdown by citing the impending trial of three terrorism suspects now in detention at a Federal jail in lower Manhattan, not far from City Hall. But that trial may not take place for months, or even years, spurring criticism that the city's landmark of democracy will probably remain closed to the general public indefinitely.
Civic groups, City Council members and state legislators have complained that although they understand the need for heightened security, they do not see why City Hall must be held captive. And this week, Judge Harold Baer Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan agreed with a nonprofit group's contention that security measures at City Hall seem intended more to stifle protest than to bolster security. As a result, he has ordered the city to allow the group, an AIDS service organization called Housing Works, to hold a news conference this Tuesday on the steps of City Hall.
In his decision, Judge Baer questioned how the city could deny access to small groups because of safety concerns, and then allow thousands to jam City Hall Plaza for last week's tribute to John Glenn and other astronauts, and for last month's celebration of the New York Yankees' World Series victory.
The city has appealed the ruling; a hearing in the Federal Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit in Manhattan is scheduled for Monday. Marilyn Mode, a Deputy Police Commissioner, declined to explain the reasoning behind the Police Department's security plans for City Hall, other than to say, "Events of the day dictate necessary security arrangements."
It is not so much the decision to increase security that troubles people as it is the extreme measures that have been taken. Many government buildings, including City Hall, have long had security systems, including guards at the doors and metal detectors in the lobbies. And after the United States fired missiles at two suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and the Sudan in August in retaliation for explosions at two American embassies in East Africa, the Police Department determined there was a need for more security. At the city's initiative, for example, sand trucks and concrete barriers were set up near the Federal courthouse on Pearl Street.
But critics say that even now, the general public has more access to other public buildings than they do to City Hall. Judge Baer noted -- and a spokesman for the United States Marshal's office confirmed -- that news conferences are still permitted in front of the courthouse where the terrorism suspects are to be tried.
But at City Hall, people must prove to police officers standing guard at the barricades that they have business inside the building; they are then often rerouted from the front steps to a basement that has a metal detector. Even then, a person might not get through, said Elizabeth Lubetkin Lipton, the president of the Women's City Club, a civic group. "We know there were City Council hearings where people were not allowed in."
Tourists and city residents can no longer wander into a building whose doors were once always open to everyone from passers-by to residents wanting to complain about garbage pickups or to corner their Council members about some personal concern. The steps of City Hall, where news conferences and protests of all kinds traditionally take place -- just a few months ago, several rabbis assembled there to invoke a biblical curse -- are now off-limits.
"It's lost a lot of its sense of being a small-town center," said Kenneth K. Fisher, a Council member from Brooklyn. "It used to be that people would hang out on the steps because you never knew who you'd see, and you could get a lot of business done that way. But now the nature of the building has changed."
Stephen DiBrienza, another Council member from Brooklyn, agreed. "There is not a day that goes by that when I leave City Hall, there are not a couple of tourists or city residents wanting to come in," he said. "I can't tell you how many times I hear the police explaining to people, 'I'm sorry, it's closed.' And I don't get it."
But Mayor Giuliani said this week that the Police Department -- and few others -- have the expertise to make decisions about security.
"The Federal Government has decided to try these terrorists in New York," he said earlier this week, in explaining the measures. "At the same time, it's a Federal judge now who's trying to decide what the security arrangements should be. And he wants the security arrangements to be less than the security arrangements that he has for Federal buildings in Washington and other places."
Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union -- which argued the case for Housing Works -- cited the testimony of Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the F.B.I. in New York. Although City Hall "could be an attractive target," Mr. Schiliro said, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had "no specific information that City Hall is a target at the present time."
Mr. Siegel said the barricading of City Hall reflected the Mayor's view that "he's the epicenter of the world, that terrorists are plotting to bomb City Hall.
"There's no evidence of that."
Information booths on either side of City Hall -- intended to assist tourists who now have no access to them -- attest to the historic value of the building, which was completed in 1812. Inside, a double-curved stairway leads to the spot where the body of Abraham Lincoln lay in state in 1865. Upstairs are Revolutionary War-era artifacts; downstairs are the Yankees' World Series trophies.
"I've been here since 1974," said Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, "and I still get a thrill walking into the building. It's such a treasure."
Until a decade ago, people could freely walk into the building from three entrances. After the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, security measures at City Hall were increased for a few weeks, but not enough to disrupt the building's hurly-burly atmosphere.
But earlier this year, at the Giuliani administration's direction, the police started to enforce a little-known regulation prohibiting the assembly of more than 25 people on the steps of City Hall. Politicians and advocates alike know that a press corps contingent works inside, and that the building's dramatic facade can add credibility to their news conference musings.
In July, Judge Baer ruled in another case filed by Housing Works that the policy was unconstitutional and selectively enforced. He also urged the city to "fashion a policy which meets constitutional muster."
Less than a month later, the United States launched missiles at suspected terrorist targets. The next day, Mr. Giuliani announced Operation Bravo, and City Hall was soon surrounded by barricades.
A glaring exception to the heightened security was evident last month, when Mr. Giuliani held a World Series parade on Broadway for the Yankees that ended with an extravagant City Hall reception attended by as many as 6,000 invited guests. Seeing in the ceremony another chance to challenge the administration's City Hall policy, Housing Works notified the city early this month that it was planning a parade up Broadway on Dec. 1 to commemorate World AIDS Day. The group said it also planned a news conference on the steps of City Hall.
On Nov. 6, the city told Housing Works that access to City Hall would be denied. Then, court documents say, city officials met on the following Monday to put into writing the security guidelines that the police had been enforcing at City Hall for nearly three months.
Those guidelines say that the Police Commissioner may authorize the use of City Hall Plaza for occasions that are "of extraordinary public interest," "uniquely appropriate to City Hall," or "unique, nonannual events of major civic and citywide importance." Such events, they say, would include celebrations of military triumphs, local world championship teams and space exploration.
Judge Baer said in his decision that he was bothered by the city's last-minute scurrying to put in writing a policy that he had suggested it formalize months earlier. He also questioned the subjectivity of the guidelines, including the phrase "extraordinary public interest," which he wrote was "a determination apparently made by the Mayor."
Michael D. Hess, the city's Corporation Counsel, said the judge's ruling was "a political statement rather than a judicial decision," and he pointed out that the city had invited Housing Works to hold its event a few hundred feet to the south, in City Hall Park. "The First Amendment certainly doesn't say that it's an all-or-nothing situation," he said. "That you either have no events whatsoever on City Hall's steps or you have to permit all."
But Mr. Siegel said he saw the ruling as a crowbar to be used by other groups to pry open the doors of one of the city's most famous public buildings. "City Hall is the quintessential public place," he said. "It should reflect the spontaneity, the diversity, the zaniness of New York City. Now it's as if it's a mausoleum."

YUGOSLAVIA: KIDNAPPED REPORTERS RELEASED -- Rebels in Kosovo freed two Serbian reporters who were kidnapped 40 days ago and also released two moderate ethnic Albanian politicians. The Kosovo Liberation Army called the releases a good-will gesture. (Reuters)
 
RUSSIA: MOVE TO BLOCK COMMUNISTS -- Galvanized by last week's murder of the legislator Galina V. Starovoitova, prominent reformers announced plans to form a coalition to prevent the Communists from returning to power. The coalition includes former Prime Ministers Yegor Gaidar and Sergei V. Kiriyenko, and former Deputy Prime Ministers Boris Y. Nemtsov and Anatoly B. Chubais. In the past, Russian liberals have been torn apart by rivalry. (AP) 

RUSSIA: BILLIONAIRE SUED FOR LIBEL -- The former chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, Nikolai Kovalyov, said he has filed a libel suit against the influential billionaire businessman, Boris A. Berezovsky, left, who had alleged that secret agents were plotting to kill him. The Federal Security Service is a successor to the defunct K.G.B. (AP)
 
BRITAIN: SOCCER HOOLIGANS BEWARE -- The British Government has announced 29 measures to crack down on soccer hooliganism by English fans, which has damaged the country's image abroad, scared off fans at home and prejudiced England's bid for the World Cup in 2006. The proposals include banning known troublemakers from traveling and making the chanting of racist taunts a crime. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: AIDS DEATH RATES DOWN -- Medical researchers in London reported that AIDS death rates have fallen 80 percent in Europe in the four years since new multidrug cocktails were introduced to fight the disease. The results of the 17-country study, which appear in The Lancet medical journal, are similar to the declines in AIDS death rates in the United States. (Reuters)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: A PARK FOR SLAIN BOYS -- The house in Ballymoney where three young Roman Catholic brothers were burned alive in their beds by Protestant arsonists in July is being replaced with a memorial park. A local assemblyman, Sean Farren, said six other homes in the housing project would be leveled to make a recreation area dedicated to the Quinn brothers: Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and Jason, 9. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
KENYA: REPORT ISSUED IN '90 SLAYING -- The Government broke nearly nine years of silence on the murder of Dr. Robert Ouko, a former Foreign Minister whose death remains a charged political issue. An 85-page report exonerated Nicholas Biwott, one of two aides to President Daniel arap Moi who were arrested, then released, after the 1990 slaying. President Moi had disbanded investigations into the killing, which remains unsolved. Ian Fisher (NYT)
 
ANGOLA: U.N. CONVOY ATTACKED -- The United Nations World Food Program said two staff members were shot to death and one was injured on Thursday when their convoy was attacked in northern Angola. The assailants were not identified, but the agency's spokeswoman, Christiane Berthiaume, said the convoy of 30 trucks, carrying about 400 tons of goods, was clearly marked. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
INDIA: A POWERFUL SIGN OF COOPERATION -- India and Pakistan have agreed to have their technical experts meet next month to study how Pakistan could sell its surplus power to India, which is desperately short of power. The small step in cooperation is the first concrete sign of progress to emerge from recent talks between the two nations. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
PHILIPPINES: ASIAN ECONOMY TO GROW -- The Asian economy, pulled up mainly by China and Taiwan, will grow about 3.5 percent in 1999, almost double this year's rate, but a quick return to former growth rates approaching 10 percent is unlikely, the Asian Development Bank said in Manila. (Reuters)
 
SRI LANKA: REBELS PROPOSE PEACE TALKS -- Sri Lanka's top Tamil rebel leader proposed talks to end decades of ethnic bloodletting in the island country and said he favored third-party intervention to open political negotiations. Velupillai Prabhakaran, the head of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, said they had "not closed the door for peace." (Agence France-Presse)
 
CHINA: INVESTMENTS IN FOOD -- China will invest an estimated $1.2 billion over the next seven years to turn the northeast into the country's largest granary and meat-processing base, the official New China News Agency reported. It said the region, which is also known as Manchuria, expects to raise its grain output to 99 million tons by 2005, from 81 million tons in 1996. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: BUSINESS PEOPLE, NOT TOURISTS, ATTACKED -- Iran disclosed that the 13 American "tourists" attacked by Islamic militants in Teheran last week were actually members of a business delegation exploring investment opportunities. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the executives had been allowed into Iran to increase pressure against United States sanctions that ban American companies from investing there. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: BANK BAILOUT IN TROUBLE -- The debts of Mexico's beleaguered bank bailout program have risen by more than 10 percent since February, Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria said late Thursday, after a day of acrimonious hearings on economic policy in the Congress. A program to rescue Mexican banks was hammered out in 1995 but needs refinancing to put it on firmer footing. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
CUBA: FRACAS AT JOURNALIST'S TRIAL -- Opponents and supporters of the Communist Government traded blows and insults at the trial of Mario Viera, a dissident journalist accused of insulting a Foreign Ministry official. In an article on the Internet, Mr. Viera accused the official, Jose Dionisio Peraza, of hypocrisy in calling for an independent international criminal court. (Reuters)

DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO IDLE 348 AT MISSOURI PLANT

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler A.G., the world's fifth-largest auto maker, will idle 348 workers at its minivan plant in Fenton, Mo., in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in minivan sales. The company employs about 4,700 workers at the suburban St. Louis plant, one of two North American plants that build Chrysler minivans. DaimlerChrysler said it did not know how long the Missouri workers would be laid off. The auto maker said on Wednesday that it would suspend production next week for one week at its 2,900-worker Sterling Heights, Mich., plant to keep inventories of its Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus small cars under control.

Clinton Tells House Panel He Did Not Lie Under Oath
President Clinton insisted once again that he had not lied under oath about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, in terse, formal responses to 81 questions submitted by the House Judiciary Committee.

When the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing next Tuesday on the consequences of lying under oath, Republicans will try to show there is a double standard for President Clinton, while Democrats will say that perjury, while serious, is not an impeachable offense. The witnesses each side plans to call -- six by the Republicans and five by the Democrats -- reflect the two sides' competing strategies, aides said. A13

HOVELL, LARRY LEBANUS

 BODY:
HOVELL-Larry Lebanus, Sr, 58, the son of Ellen Stewart, the founder and director of La MaMa E.T.C., of Green Bay, Wisconsin passed away on Monday, November 23, 1998. He was born to Larry and Ellen Stewart Hovell on October 25, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois. Larry attended DuSable High School in Chicago, IL and Upper Iowa University in Fayette, Iowa. Upon graduation from college he enlisted in the U.S. Army where he fought in the Vietnam war and received an honorable discharge. Larry moved to Green Bay in October of 1987 to become the owner of Bay City Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. While in Green Bay, Larry was a strong advocate of the greater business and civic community and was loved and respected by all that knew him. Larry's leadership in the business community was recognized by many, this was seen by him serving on the Board of the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce, as a member of the Green Bay Economic Development Commission and Daimler Chrysler National Dealers' Council, and as Vice President for Chrysler Minority Dealers Association. He was also a member of St. Bernards Catholic Church, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc, Scottish Rite, the Lodge Council Chapter of Consistory Masons, the Red Cross, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, and the local Shriners. In addition he was a sponsor of the University of WisconsinGreen Bay Women's Basketball team and served on the St. Norbert Diversity team.

HEADLINE: Converting Obsolete Chicago Hospitals to Housing

BYLINE: By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
RESIDENTIAL conversion has become the prescription of choice for some failing hospitals in Chicago, and now another hospital is taking the cure.
In the last 10 years, at least four unprofitable hospitals have been converted into loft apartments, and several others in prime locations were sold and razed as a result of consolidations in the health-care field, making way for upscale developments. 
 One of the first hospitals in Chicago to be converted to residences was the Manchester Lofts in 1990, a renovation of a 110-year-old hospital in the Near West Side. Closed for many years, it first became a light manufacturing facility and then artists' studios before being renovated into 18 loft apartments.
The latest hospital to undergo such a transformation is Chicago Osteopathic Medical Center in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the city's South Side. It had belonged to the Nashville-based HCA/Columbia health-care chain and was sold as part of the company's reorganization plan, said Jeff Prescott, spokesman for the chain.
When the $50-million transformation is complete sometime next fall, the hospital and its grounds will be turned into a residential development with 225 loft apartments, 28 town houses and 16 detached houses in a complex to be called Renaissance Place.
All but one of the 13 hospital buildings on Chicago Osteopathic's campus were shuttered when HCA/Columbia began searching for a new owner. A clinic continues to operate in the remaining one and is not scheduled to close until next summer, when it will be demolished as part of the construction plan, said Roger Mankedick, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Concord Development Corporation of Chicago, which is developing the project with Kenard Corporation, also of Chicago.
The developers, who paid $5.8 million for the property, plan to renovate two of the hospital buildings into condominium loft apartments. The other buildings, which are not suitable for re-use, will be razed to make room for the construction of a two-story parking structure, the town-house condominiums and green space, said the project architect, Patrick J. FitzGerald of FitzGerald Associates in Chicago.
According to Mr. FitzGerald, many of the hospital buildings were not adaptable for residential space because they were below grade or had no windows. Others, like an auditorium, were not economically feasible to renovate.
The two buildings that will be converted into apartments will still require substantial demolition. Mr. FitzGerald said several additions have to be removed. "Institutional buildings and in particular hospital buildings tend to grow over time by additions and remodeling," he said. "We thought that by peeling back some of the additions we could make the old space new and then by demolishing the others we could do the new construction."
The detached houses will be built on a parcel of land two blocks from the main campus, which was also part of the hospital property.
SALES and construction are scheduled to begin by the end of the year. The loft apartments, which will range in size from 800 to 1,400 square feet, will be priced from about $100,000 to $150,000. Two-bedroom town houses will be priced at approximately $240,000, and the detached homes, which will range in size from 2,400 to 3,000 square feet and offer three to four bedrooms, will be priced from $350,000, said Mr. Mankedick.
He said he expected many of the buyers to come from the neighborhood, home to the University of Chicago, where there is an abundance of rental apartments and high-priced historic homes, but little moderate-cost new construction, Mr. Mankedick said.
The conversion of hospitals into residential developments is happening on a case-by-case basis, said J. Philip Lathrop, a health-care consultant who is a vice president at Booz Allen & Hamilton, a management consultant firm with an office here.
Most health-care companies try to sell unprofitable hospitals as a going concern to other operators to yield the greatest return. But in Chicago, many of the older hospitals are either obsolete or too inappropriately located to be upgraded as a hospital. "Selling to a real estate developer is a default," Mr. Lathrop noted.
In the last 10 years, several other Chicago hospitals, closed due to declining revenues and too many beds, have been sold to residential developers, most of whom buy the properties for their land only.
For example, Chicago's MCL Companies razed the former Henrotin Hospital on the city's Gold Coast and the former Augustana Hospital in Lincoln Park to build upscale condominium apartments and town houses.
Mr. FitzGerald said the reason many developers prefer demolition of the hospital buildings over renovation is because of the infrastructure found inside the facilities. Hospitals typically were built with no thought of adaptive re-use. "There are lots of small rooms with closely spaced columns, which do not allow the same degree of flexibility that a large bay structure does," he said.
In addition, the mechanical systems are complex. Piping for sterile water, oxygen and communication lines are built into the walls and are costly to remove. Interior walls can be as thick as 22 inches and require masonry saws to tear down.
The demolition costs for converting hospitals tend to be significantly higher than any other type of conversion for loft space, making the purchase price for the property a key factor in the ultimate sales price of the completed units, Mr. FitzGerald said.
One of the developers of Renaissance Place was not deterred by the challenge because it was his second conversion of a hospital.
THE first one, called Columbus on the Park, involved the renovation last year of St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital near the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois on the city's West Side. The nearly 90-year-old hospital was renovated into 105 loft apartments and 28 town houses were built on what had been the hospital parking lot, said Harold Lichterman, president of Kenard, the developer.
The units, which were priced from $80,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $350,000 for a three-bedroom town house, were sold out in seven months, Mr. Lichterman said.
A spokesman for Catholic Health Partners in Chicago, which sold St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital to Kenard, declined to comment on the reasons behind the sale. But Anthony Smaniotto, first vice president for investment properties at CB Richard Ellis in Chicago, who handled the sale for the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, who owned hospital, said fewer than 40 percent of beds were being used at the time of the sale.
Kenard, he said, was the only developer bidding on the property that did not plan to demolish the hospital. Preservation of the hospital building was important to the owners because they wanted to leave a legacy of their work in the neighborhood.
In addition to preserving the hospital building for Columbus on the Park, some of the hospital's original ornamentation also was kept, including the entrance and several interior hallways decorated with glazed clay tile.
Mr. FitzGerald, who also designed Columbus on the Park, said preservation of the St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital building was just as important to the developer as it was to the owners.
"Anyone who lives there knows some of the history of the building," he said.

For Rye Brook, a Pfizer Sales Training Center

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: RYE BROOK

 BODY:
IN an unusual linkup of a company management training facility with an existing complex that serves a variety of companies, the Pfizer Corporation has broken ground on a 110,000-square-foot education center on the grounds of the Doral Arrowwood hotel and conference center.
At the groundbreaking, B.J. Robison, Pfizer's senior vice president for corporate employee resources, said that the training center, which will be used by the company's sales managers, would be vital to the company's plan to move up from its present position as the fourth largest pharmaceutical company to become the largest in the world. 
 "It will help us attract, train and retain the best people," Mr. Robison said. "Our management-training programs will be conducted here as of January 2000, when the center opens, which is significant since Pfizer will become the world's No. 1 pharmaceutical company by the year 2001." He added that the center itself would create 120 new full-time jobs.
Establishing such a corporate presence at an existing conference center "is a unique arrangement," said Steven Smith, spokesman for the International Association of Conference Centers, based in St. Louis.
"Most companies build their own discrete centers in isolated locations," he said in a telephone interview. "But that can backfire because when they're not using it they can have a tough time attracting other users. Also corporations aren't in the hospitality business and usually aren't very good at it."
Pfizer already had a long-term relationship with Arrowwood, according to Art Silverman, Pfizer's director of corporate services. He said it had conducted many of its training programs at the 318,000-square-foot center on Anderson Hill Road, where it maintains 25 to 30 full-time employees.
"We decided we needed to build our own center because we're expanding our sales force," Mr. Silverman said.
This is due in part to Pfizer's introduction of several new drugs in recent years, including the much-discussed Viagra male-potency enhancer. "There are several more in the pipeline," said Mr. Silverman said, adding that the company believed that they would dramatically increase business.
Before deciding to build at Arrowwood, Pfizer had considered the feasibility of establishing its own separate center, according to Josh Kuriloff, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, which was enlisted by Pfizer to find an appropriate site.
"We looked for about a year, mostly in New York and New Jersey," Mr. Kuriloff said. Arrowwood was ultimately chosen because it was "known territory, close to Pfizer's headquarters in Manhattan," he explained.
"In addition," he noted, "it had an existing infrastructure the company could utilize, such as hotel rooms, recreational and dining facilities."
Mr. Kuriloff said Pfizer would have an exclusive 15-year lease valued at around $170 million. "That includes everything," he said, "use of the center, hotel, all the facilities." Among other things it calls for Pfizer's committing to 33,000 room nights a year. "Working out the details was overwhelmingly complex," Mr. Kuriloff said.
To persuade Pfizer to build its center at Arrowwood, state and county officials, working with the Village of Rye Brook, eventually came up with an incentive package worth around $27 million in grants, tax abatements and energy rebates, according to Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.
"They were being offered even better deals to move to New Jersey," Mr. Gargano said. "But their good working relationship with Arrowwood proved a major selling point."
The $40-million construction project, which received its final approvals on Nov. 17, is a boon for the Village of Rye Brook, according to Christopher Russo, the village manager, and one of the most complex economic deals in the village's history.
HE explained that during negotiations, Arrowwood agreed to drop a $2.5 million judgment that it had won for overpayment of village taxes, in exchange for economic incentives for the project. "We dodged a bullet," Mr. Russo said. "I don't know where we would have gotten the money."
The center will occupy a sloping piece of property adjacent to the existing conference center and abutting Arrowwood's nine-hole golf course. To accommodate the increased business generated by the center, 100 new hotel rooms will be added to Arrowwood's current total of 274.
"From the outside, the center will connect to Arrowwood as if it were one building," said Ron Rheaume, project manager for the Hillier Group of Princeton, N.J., which designed Arrowwood in 1983. But inside the Pfizer Learning Center (its official name) "will have its own separate entrance and identity," Mr. Rheaume said.
Arrowwood is a low-slung, cedar-sided structure that sits on 146 heavily wooded acres. The design for the center will attempt to take advantage of the surroundings, Mr. Rheaume said, and "bring the outdoors in."
"There will be tree-like lighting elements throughout and a leaf pattern on the ceiling, as well as lots of glass looking out on the golf course," Mr. Rheaume added. The center will have a restaurant, meeting rooms and a studio for developing training tapes and making live training broadcasts.
All the meeting rooms will have rear screen projectors and seats equipped with computer ports. "From their seats, employees can connect to the network and, using keypads, vote on instant corporate surveys," Mr. Rheaume explained.
Arrowwood itself has recently completed an $8 million refurbishment of its facilities, guest rooms and an expansion of its sports center, according to Bruce Blum, president of Doral Hotels and Resorts.
"The rooms have all been upgraded with new finishes, so they will look like new and match the new rooms being built for Pfizer." When the new rooms are not being used by Pfizer, they will be open to other guests, as well, Mr. Blum added.
While the timing coincided, the upgrading of hotel facilities was not done exclusively for Pfizer, Mr. Blum said.
"While we're working with companies like Pfizer and others during the week, we also have to be a resort for the people who come here on the weekends and pay out of their own pockets," he said. (The weekend rate for Friday and Saturday, $135 per night, includes buffet breakfast.) "To attract that business in our competitive marketplace, it requires doing total upgrades of facilities on a regular basis."

Voices Raised
After months of rehearsals, vocal groups on the Island this week start doing the thing they do at least twice a year, at Christmas and Easter: sing holiday concerts. The seasonal rush begins today when the Hofstra Chamber Singers journey to Christ Church on Main Street in Oyster Bay to perform a program that includes Britten's "Ceremony of Carols" and settings by Villette and Britten of "Hymns to the Virgin" at 3 P.M. (463-6644).

Soprano's Return
There's nothing like an alumna returning triumphantly to the campus that helped train her. That is what Christine Goerke, a native of Medford, will do on Tuesday when she gives the annual alumni concert at the State University at Stony Brook. In the few seasons since her professional debut, Ms. Goerke, a soprano who is a product of the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artist Development Program, has sung major roles at the Met, the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., and the Opera Theater of St. Louis. She has also appeared in concert with the New York Philharmonic, the Atlanta Symphony and the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Her concert, a preview of her Carnegie Hall recital on Friday, is at 8 P.M. at Staller Center, and in May she is to return to another alma mater, Suffolk Community College in Selden, where she studied from 1987 to 1989 (632-2787).
 
John Tesh Live
Those who are absolutely wild about John Tesh can see him perform on Thursday and, in the best tradition of killing two birds with one stone, be charitable as well. The first 200 people who buy "WALK's Holiday CD," a record of 10 Christmas standards, will receive a pair of free tickets to the concert at 8 P.M. at the Gateway Playhouse on South Country Road in Bellport. The $10 for the CD goes to 10 children's charities chosen by listeners of WALK-FM in Patchogue. The CD's with the free tickets (one pair per customer) may be purchased only at Gateway's box office at the Patchogue Theater, where the playhouse will present "Nutcracker on Ice" from Dec. 17 through 29 (286-1133).
 
Dickens Festival
Charles Dickens never visited Port Jefferson. But since he was a pillar of the Victorian era and since the quaint waterfront village harks back to the same period, his name is taken (not in vain, the local economic development council hopes) for a pre-holiday celebration. Hence the Charles Dickens Festival, Friday through next Sunday throughout the village. The activities on Friday include a lantern procession down Main Street at 6 P.M.and a free concert by Peter Duchin and his orchestra at 7:30 P.M. at the Jefferson Street School. Saturday's highlights include an ice sculpture display at 1 P.M. at Bayles Park; a "Dickens Filmfest" from noon to 4 P.M. at the library, and a Victorian Candlelight House Tour at 5 P.M. On Sunday, there are children's shows at 1 and 2 P.M. at the Jefferson School, and Douglas Broyles portrays the novelist in "Charles Dickens in Person," at 1 and 2 P.M. at the library. Each day there will be Victorian carriage rides, caroling and instrumental music concerts, and rides on "The Little Red Trolley" (473-4724).
 
Busy Tilles Weekend
Twyla Tharp brings her new company, Tharp!, to Tilles Center in Brookville on Friday with three new works: "Roy's Joy," "The Fugue" and "Sweet Fields." On Saturday, in keeping with the calendar, Aengus, Robbie O'Connell's musical troupe, offers a "Celtic Christmas Celebration." Joined by Eileen Johnson and John Jennings, Irish step dancers, the quartet of traditional musicians will explore the Christian and pagan traditions surrounding the winter solstice in a mixture of songs and instrumental pieces. Both concerts are at 8 P.M. on the C. W. Post campus (299-3100). BARBARA DELATINER

 BODY:
IN the early 90's, Hank Paine, whose family had owned the Howland-Hughes department store in Waterbury since 1922, ran a "staying in business" sale. Like other independent retailers, the store had been affected by a slow economy and the competition of malls, and so it was reinventing itself. A quarter of Howland-Hughes's original space would now house The Connecticut Store, all of whose products were made in the state.
Though Mr. Paine said he knew the "diversity, quality, innovation and price" of the goods would be their selling points, he also knew the challenge of the goods not being known to customers. 
 While he doesn't single out any one reason for the state's products and services not being known, he illustrates it by citing a purchasing problem when beginning the new business. He said he was impressed by Waterbury Neckwear, a producer on the same street as the store (but part of the M. Aron Corporation of South Norwalk), and so he decided to order from them.
The process was like following a maze. After being shuttled to his neighbor's New York office, then to a Las Vegas trade show, he ordered four dozen ties -- which did not make it to the store. He said he finally made an arrangement with the manager of the Waterbury operation, and "the store got ties."
Mr. Paine described keeping in touch with small but thriving state businesses who sold products at his store and who shared similar frustrations. Matthew Bristow, the chief executive officer of the felt and blanket maker Charles W. House & Sons in Unionville, and Brooks H. Titcomb, president of Woodbury Pewter, and Mr. Paine realized they needed an organization to compete, and out of these informal talks grew the Made in Connecticut Guild Ltd.
The Guild is a year-old nonprofit organization of some 40 members who pay dues and have twin goals: to educate retailers and consumers that these products are here.
"Connecticut residents will buy Connecticut first," Mr. Paine says in a kind of creed, if "the product is at least equal in quality and price -- and they know about it."
Key marketing strategies begin in the Howland-Hughes department store. Next to a display for blankets by Charles W. House, which the store presents as comparable to or better than those from L. L. Bean of Maine, the customer sees an enlargement from the Bean catalogue, with its higher prices. Mr. Paine explains that, with retail spending in the state estimated at $70 million a year, the customer who chooses the local blanket makes a difference. "Any fractional change, not because of patriotism but because the manufacturers' earned it, is mind-blowing," he says.
A glance around the store shows products from Knitworks of Harwinton, the Great American Puzzle Factory of South Norwalk, Old Saybrook Pottery Place of Sharon and the Woodpecker of Westbrook. Even the restaurant serves coffee roasted in Hartford and tea from R. C. Bigelow in Fairfield.
Formal promotion by the Guild includes advertising in all media, at hotels, with tourism bureaus and on the Internet. The Internet, Mr. Paine says, is particularly useful for people who used to live in the state but now live elsewhere.
Advertising has had a recent boost from popular culture. The store is an outlet for Waterbury Companies Inc., a nearly two-century-old manufacturer of buttons that has supplied the military and municipal services, sports tournaments and clothing makers as well as the crew of the Titanic; it's now "the worldwide marketer and distributor for the replicas of Titanic uniform buttons," Mr. Paine said.
Mr. Titcomb, of Woodbury Pewter, sees a role for the Guild in organizing and coordinating information. For instance, after the Guild caught the eye of the Governor and the state's Department of Economic and Community Development at an Eastern States Exposition, Mr. Titcomb says, the state agency referred out-of-state inquiries for statemade products to the Guild.
"Purchasers contacted the state, which in turn called us," he said.
And Mr. Bristow, of Charles W. House, said the Guild persuaded him to open a retail outlet last year which, like The Connecticut Store, sells statemade products. "That decision took me from serving just the industrial market," he said, "and would never have been made without the soft-nudging of the Guild."
Mr. Paine says local initiatives may encourage state manufacturers to centralize, placing porcelain and glass enamel, for example, or pewter and engraving, in the same building, preferably at a crossroads like Hartford, Danbury or Mystic.
The Guild also works on companies' awareness of other businesses in their own backyards. One of the biggest company-meets-company stories is Waterbury Leatherworks and Charles W. House. The result: collaborative manufacture of a handbag that now hangs in the center of the store.
The Danbury Square Box Company, one of the store's vendors with products not finished for retail, has acquired three new accounts in joining the Guild. "I expect to get more business," said the company's president, John Allen, also a Guild board member.
Mr. Paine explained that such cooperation was born at the end of a long road of indifference by advertisers and producers not considering Connecticut a market. In recent years, he adds, this negligence was fueled by business downturns and uncertainties, like those at Stanley Works and Electric Boat, Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky.
"Then our own Department of Economic and Community Development said it was proud to announce the transition from manufacturing to service," Mr. Paine said. "Would you say that's an environment conducive to 'Made in Connecticut'?"
But the state is now keeping its own doors open, he added, and the overall climate is changing.
Indeed, a spokesman for the Department of Economic and Community Development, Chris Cooper, says that, although his department has not provided the Guild with financial assistance, its exhibit at the Eastern States Exposition was "one of the most popular."
The Guild has found perhaps its biggest friend in the Manufacturing Alliance of Connecticut, whose main legislative issues are workers' and unemployment compensation, energy initiatives and taxes.
"Anything that could help a manufacturing company grow, expand or remain in Connecticut" is welcome says the Alliance's executive director, Frank J. Johnson.
"If in two or three years 'Made in Connecticut' is a household thought," said Mr. Titcomb, "we go beyond there, much as 'Made in Vermont' products has."
Mr. Paine said he believes that, all things being equal, Connecticut residents will buy first in their state. "And we don't have equal quality and price -- we're better," he said.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
A Woman in Black Fascinated by Rouge

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IT takes the real thing to play the real thing. Tovah Feldshuh is a genuine, bona fide character actress and Diana Vreeland was the exemplar of artifice as heightened reality. In the Theater Works production of "Full Gallop" in Hartford, the two of them are one.
If the old-fangled designation character actor isn't being used much anymore, it's because its practitioners are hard to find. Ms. Feldshuh's total immersion into another being lifts the word versatility from show business hyperbole to communicative art. In a notable career, she has transformed herself into a Talmudic student disguised as a boy, a lusty Latin widow, a smothering and smoldering Jewish mother, a withering Jewish grandmother, a flamboyant star of stage and screen. And we're still counting. 
 Summoning her considerable experience as a cabaret performer, Ms. Feldshuh draws the audience in as the role's creator, Mary Louise Wilson, did not. She will offer you rouge or put aside a crystal vase of flowers that obstructs someone's sight line. But if you're crinkling a candy wrapper, beware.
Never misplacing the hauteur of the fabled "Oracle of Beauty" and "High Priestess of Fashion" (actually high and low, for "a splash of bad taste" was necessary to Mrs. Vreeland; it was no taste that offended), Ms. Feldshuh deflates pretense with one imperious look.
With the eternal self-esteem that true devotion between human beings bequeaths, she also tells a love story through spare references to a dapper man, Thomas R. Vreeland. Her recollection of his illness, the last chapter of their 40-year marriage, is an object lesson in the precision and economy of acting.
But first things first. "I am out of a job," Mrs. Vreeland declares. Musing on her last day as editor in chief of Vogue, she startlingly recalls being told "Your future is behind you."
Ms. Feldshuh's exaggerated vocal attack, a multi-lingual drawl, is a wildly theatrical realization of Mrs. Vreeland's idiocyncratic accent, which was described by Christopher Hemphill, her collaborator on the gorgeous book of photographs and commentary, "Allure," published in 1980, as "rococo speech."
"Her voice itself almost allows one to see the italics she speaks in," Mr. Hemphill wrote of Mrs. Vreeland "for whom the tape recorder might have been invented."
And wait till you see her, a spider woman in black, "fascinated by rouge," stalking about in a flower flooded apartment ("You can never have enough flowers," she pronounces) of flaming red ("bright, cleansing, revealing red"). If Michael Schweikardt's evocative set design is not really scented, no one wants to know.
Ms. Feldshuh's grand Tony Award-nominated performance as Signora Maria Merelli, the tempestuous wife of a temperamental opera singer in "Lend Me A Tenor," can now be perceived as a dress rehearsal for this new star turn. Whatever the behind-the-scenes power struggle or the hard-core facts of business accounted for her dismissal from Vogue, it is the divinely biased account of a spectacularly instinctual icon that matters. Besides, it isn't long before she agrees to be a consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York -- her last professional blaze of glory.
"You give them what they never knew they wanted," is how Mrs. Vreeland sums up a singular uncompetitive rule of success. "Nobody gives a damn about authenticity if it's ugly," she declares. "I want to be drowned in beauty."
It comes as a surprise, a treat and, finally, a revelation to be unutterably moved by an image of largesse from whom you reasonably expect to feel distanced. She remembers a childhood of privilege -- seeing Isadora Duncan, Pavlova, Nijinksy -- and recounts a fabulous life (knowing everybody). "It is beauty that is leaving this world," she bemoans, all too prophetically. "There was a time people never ceased perfecting themselves."
Whether she is appreciating the tonality of color -- "magentas and mauves," "the orange of Diaghilev, the orange that changed the century," or the blue of the Duke of Windsor's eyes, his "azure aura," or relishing one puff of a Lucky Strike, Ms. Feldshuh imparts the essence of enjoyment.
Rob Ruggiero's graceful staging is a knowing acknowledgment of the skill and craft with which Mary Louise Wilson and Mark Hampton wrote the very model of a seamless one-woman piece (with funny French maid on the intercom) and the wit of Ms. Feldshuh's playing -- truly, she plays -- is a testament to the eccentricities and the resilience of an original character who may have invented the flair for reinvention. This is high theater.

HEADLINE: Stock Tournaments Find Ready Combatants in Younger Generation

BYLINE: By BARBARA HALL 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
PETER LYNCH, the mutual fund manager and stock investment analyst, wrote a book with John Rothchild, former financial columnist for Time, called "One Up on Wall Street" (Simon & Schuster). In it, he told about venturing into an elementary school where he interviewed youngsters on their favorite products: clothing, foods, toys. He then made investments based on those conversations. The result was alchemy. Mr. Lynch profited nicely.
Darren Gurney, a social studies teacher at New Rochelle High School here, had an explanation. "Kids, who are in a sense not distracted by all the professional analysis, all the talk on the street, can sometimes get to the heart of things," he said. A case in point: Mr. Gurney's Entrepreneur Club at the school, which is holding its own in a student stock tournament co-sponsored by CNBC, the cable financial network. 
 The contest, now in its second year, has attracted more than 2,500 teams from the United States and Canada. Several of the clubs are from Westchester, with names like the '29ers of Mamaroneck, the Husky Traders of Harrison, Dark Wind of the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry and the Alstars of Rye -- more than a dozen in all.
"I find the team turnout very encouraging," said Bill Griffeth, a CNBC anchorman and the tournament director. "The perception of most students probably was that investment was, A, for older people or, B, for rich people. Investment should be for everybody, and especially for this generation."
At issue is what he called financial literacy.
"We felt that this younger generation -- who would not have Social Security to deal with, would not have pensions to benefit from -- needs to take control of their financial futures. The best way to do this is to teach them as early as possible about investing. So, by October of last year the whole idea came together to put this competition on our Web site.
"What we're finding is this generation is going to do all right; they have it in them to do it. These kids are bright, and they bring to the contest a natural curiosity they will need in the future."
The tournament works this way: initially, each team gets $100,000 in what CNBC calls "fantasy funds" -- hypothetical money. This will be used to invest in stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq/AMEX Market group. The team that fares best at the close of the semester will receive 250 shares of General Electric common stock, valued at about $20,000.
Teams with the highest weekly percentage gains in their portfolio are featured on CNBC. So far, several Westchester teams have been among those recognized.
The contest rules have been refined since last year. For example, to counter what Mr. Griffeth called "day trading frenzy" on the part of student investors, organizers established commissions. By doing so, CNBC reasoned that the young people would be prompted to take a long-term view.
A sweep of the Westchester schools reveals a spectrum of team makeup and methods.
The majority are high school groups that meet once a week with a faculty adviser to review investment standings and strategy. The '29ers are an example of the norm. As William Beaver, a senior active in the club, explained recently: "Basically, we hold weekly meetings. We have about 30 kids subdivided into 5 groups of 6. We tabulate which small group has the best returns, and they pick the stocks for the following week."
Then, too, there is the team of three 10th-grade girls from the Masters School, a private elementary and high school in Dobbs Ferry. They go by the name of Jacyurmar, a fusion of the first three letters of each girl's first name. The girls said they meet for an average of 20 minutes a day to see how the market is affecting their holdings. "I've definitely learned from this," Marissa Riviello, one of the girls, said. "It's fun."
And there is Mr. Gurney's Entrepreneurs. The club predates CNBC's tournament. Founded several years ago, the group is a mixture of grades and races. Its members include Brandon Woods and Irene Morales, both seniors.
As her club's lone girl, Irene said: "At first, I was really intimidated by the others who knew what they were doing. I guess I've learned since then, that as much as people think this is a man's world, a woman can be involved. With a will to succeed, anything's possible."
Brandon, too, is upbeat, based on his three years with the club. "I think, with the economy doing well, there's definitely momentum for minorities in the market," he said. "I read things like Black Enterprise, and I'm finding there's much opportunity for us. I really have learned from this contest. It has made me think about being a stockbroker, a trader, in the future."
With Mr. Gurney as supervisor, the New Rochelle team has to perform a balancing act, considering the students' varying approaches to the market. For instance, Michael Queller, a self-described gambler, takes an aggressive stance, with the club and in his personal investments. Mr. Gurney is also more than a player on paper. The two often meet informally during the day to compare notes. "Whatever company I'm invested in at home, I'm invested in for the school competition," Michael said.
His approach is tempered by Rick Gottlieb, the team researcher -- Mr. Gurney's term -- and Brandon, who takes an interest in both history and the long term.
Mr. Gurney seems to take satisfaction from the club.
"I tell my students, 'I just want you to be passionate about something in life, whether it's stocks, sports, drama, history,' " he said. "When we have stock club meetings, the kids are definitely passionate. It's enjoyable to be around."
No report on school investment clubs in Westchester would be complete without mention of the Hackley Hornets of the Hackley School in Tarrytown. Last year they placed first in the CNBC tournament. School administrators are now considering how to use the club's winnings of $18,000. Their choices include authorizing students to invest the money in the market, using the money to start a scholarship fund or putting the money in the school's general fund.
The Hornets' faculty adviser, Jenny Lyons, called Aaron Siegel the force behind the school's victory. Aaron is looking into new competitions for the investment club, one of which is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank.
As for the CNBC tournament, Aaron said: "It takes the mists away from how the market works and allows you to see how it actually is. For us, it has been a remarkable experience."

HEADLINE: Will the Patriots Draw in Fairfield?

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
BELIEVING that his team needed corporate support from Fairfield County if it was to survive in Hartford, Richard Gordon, then the principle owner of the Hartford Whalers hockey team, invited 146 executives from the region to attend a reception, dinner and a Whalers' hockey game in February of 1992.
As it developed, only six people showed up, convincing Mr. Gordon that, when it came to big league sports, Fairfield County was strictly attuned to New York (and New Jersey) teams -- something he had suspected all along. 
 In large measure because they were unable to attract fans from the southwestern part of the state, along with corporations that might buy high-priced sky boxes, the Whalers eventually left Connecticut for North Carolina in 1997. Now, amid the euphoria surrounding the projected move of the New England Patriots of the National Football League to Hartford in 2001, a key question remains: Will enough corporations from Fairfield County, including the 14 that are included on the Fortune 500 list, pay up to $100,000 a year for one of the 150 or so luxury suites at the proposed 68,000-seat stadium along the Connecticut River near downtown Hartford?
"That is clearly a major concern for the Patriots," said Joseph McGee, vice president of the Southwestern Connecticut Area Commerce and Industry Association, which represents about 600 companies in Fairfield County. "Nobody knows whether they'll get that corporate support in an area where most fan loyalty is with New York teams."
As the State Commissioner for Economic Development under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Mr. McGee was involved in earlier efforts, in 1993 and 1994, to lure the Patriots to Hartford with the promise of building a 70,000-seat stadium with $252 million that had been authorized by the Connecticut legislature. "At the time some interest in luxury boxes was expressed by corporations from Fairfield County," Mr. McGee said. "Whether there would still be interest today, I don't know. But I personally think there will be a lot more interest in the Patriots in Fairfield County than some people think. For one thing, it will take about the same amount of time to get to the Patriots' stadium in Hartford from Stamford as it does from Stamford to the Meadowlands."
Many football fans in Connecticut root for the New York Giants, who trained at Fairfield University in the late 1950's and in the 60's (when Andy Robustelli of Stamford was a star defensive end) and who played their home games at the Yale Bowl in 1973 and 1974 while Yankee Stadium, then their home field, was being renovated. By comparison, a much smaller number of Connecticut fans pull for the Jets, who began play as the New York Titans in 1959, 34 years after the Giants joined the National Football League, and who, like the Giants, play their home games at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. But there are long waiting lists for season tickets for both teams, and for luxury boxes, which Mr. McGee said, could make the Patriots in Hartford attractive to at least some fans -- and corporations -- in Fairfield County.
"If you're boxed out of getting season tickets for Giants and Jets' games, tickets for Patriot games could be attractive," Mr. McGee said, "and I think some companies would buy them."
At present the Patriots' fan base in Connecticut is mainly confined to the northeastern part of the state. Some sports analysts say that even in Hartford -- which is 100 miles from Foxboro, Mass., where the Patriots play their home games -- the Patriots are a second choice in fan support to the Giants, whose home base is 125 miles away.
That should change, though, if the Patriots do indeed move to Hartford, a move that is contingent on the the General Assembly authorizing a $350 million bond issue for a new stadium. But it is not likely to alter the rooting pattern of Giants and Jets fans in the lower part of the state. "There's a loyalty that has been built up over the years for a team like the Giants in Fairfield County," said Herb Kohn, a longtime Stamford sports activist who has had season tickets for Giants' home games since 1955. "And you don't change it by having another team move into the state. I personally think they're going to have to develop a new following," he said of the Patriots.
If they do, that new following will be complemented by thousands of die-hard Patriot fans from Massachusetts and Rhode Island who are expected to continue to hold on to their season tickets for Patriot games in Hartford. Indeed, at present there is a four-year waiting period to buy season tickets to Patriot games at the 57,000-seat Foxboro Stadium. If anything, that may limit the availability of seats for Connecticut residents -- although the proposed stadium would have about 11,000 more seats.
No one knows what kind of support a Patriot team would get from residents in an area not renown for football, unlike Charlotte, Nashville and Jacksonville, which in recent years have acquired National Football League franchises. Apart from the glory days of Yale football -- from the 1930's through the 60's -- and the intense rivalries between high schools in the Naugatuck Valley, which have drawn big crowds at games in Ansonia, Derby, Shelton, Seymour and Naugatuck, Connecticut has not been regarded as a hotbed of football. "But there's a big difference when you talk about an N.F.L. team, compared to high school football," said Owen Canfield, the veteran sports columnist for The Hartford Courant. "An N.F.L. franchise in Hartford can't possibly fail."
Assuming the memorandum of understanding between Gov. John G. Rowland and the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, evolves into a signed contract, the Patriots' move to Hartford will prove a boon to the University of Connecticut football program. The university's board of trustees late last year approved a plan to upgrade the football team from Division I-AA to Division I-A. But the plan died aborning when the General Assembly turned down a $35 million bond issue to cover the cost of a new stadium on the Storrs campus that was needed to meet seating requirements of the National Collegiate Athletic Association for Division I-A.
Now, if a stadium is built for the Patriots as part of the billion-dollar Adriaen's Landing project along the Connecticut River near the intersection of Interstates 91 and 84, the UConn football team will be able to share the stadium and thus play on the Division I-A level. The UConn Athletic Director, Lew Perkins, who has been a strong proponent of such a move, is convinced that a UConn football team in the upper echelon of college football would draw large crowds while playing other Big East teams such as Miami and Syracuse.
The Huskies have never drawn well at 16,000-seat Memorial Stadium on the Storrs campus or attracted large statewide interest. "It's a totally different situation when you play on the Division I-A level," Mr. Perkins has said in his effort to to elevate the football program to the higher level. "People from all over will come to see UConn play, say, Syracuse and Miami."
While the Patriots' fan base in Fairfield County remains to be seen, the proposal to build a rent-free stadium for the team has drawn support from several key Fairfield County legislators of both major political parties. State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Greenwich Republican, who is regarded as a conservative on fiscal matters, has endorsed the plan, describing it as "truly urban renewal" since it includes a convention center, hotel, parking and other features. State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat and the Senate majority leader, has said he also favors the plan. That came as a surprise since Mr. Jepsen had opposed state funds to build a football stadium on the UConn camps.
"Getting the Patriots will enhance the image of the entire state," Mr. Jepsen said, "and it's probably the only chance Connecticut will ever have to get an N.F.L. team. It's an incredible opportunity."
As for the impact on Fairfield County, Mr. Jepsen said that, among other things, "Hartford will now become one more entertainment option for people in the county." Agreeing with Governor Rowland, the senator said he thought that the stadium will pay for itself through a 10 percent surcharge on tickets and from income tax revenue from players' salaries. "If the state has to put out any money, I think the state subsidy will be small," he said.
Drawing an analogy with bipartisan support that often backs a President on foreign policy in Washington, Mr. Jepsen, who often opposes initiatives from Mr. Rowland, said, "As far as we're concerned in Connecticut, this is foreign policy, and we're standing behind the Governor."
 
When Hartford Was in N.F.L.
 IF the New England Patriots do move to Hartford, it will mark a homecoming of sorts for the National Football League.
Not many people remember it, but in 1926, the league's seventh year of existence, a team known as the Hartford Blues played its home games at the East Hartford Velodrome, a stadium that had been built for bicycle racing.
Plagued by bad weather and a weak team composed mainly of players from the Hartford area with names like Furlong Flynn, Lefty Jamerson and Mule Werwaiss, the Blues won three games and lost seven while playing in front of home crowds that ranged from 6,500, against the New York Giants, and 500 against the Kansas City Cowboys.
By the next season, though, the Blues had been voted out of the league, which had decided to cut back to 12 teams from 22.
If the Patriots do move to Hartford, they will do so with a 30-year lease arrangement, insuring that they would last longer than the Hartford Blues. JACK CAVANAUGH

HEADLINE: The View From/Collin's Diner, Canaan;
Giving a Voice to Poetry, Lebanese Zest to a Menu

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
COLLIN'S DINER of Canaan is a traditional place. The National Historic Landmark, built in 1941, is also a local landmark in the village's restored railroad depot center. The diner, which is open seven days a week, attracts plenty of regulars as well as travelers on Route 7.
Sometimes, however, what patrons are expecting is not exactly what they get. The owners, Aida and Mohammed Abo-Hamzy, encouraged their son, Ameen Storm Abo-Hamzy, to begin a monthly poetry reading in 1994, and since then the little diner has been filled one night a month with people from New York and Massachusetts as well as from Connecticut. Everything looks just the same, but guests might get free verse served up with their meatloaf and potatoes. 
 For the October reading, while a few regular customers finished dinner -- on this night traditional Lebanese cooking -- ghouls, grim reapers and Draculas mingled with children dressed as bunnies and storybook characters.
Once the dinner hour was over, Mr. Abo-Hamzy started with his own rendition of the song "Never Give Up On You." Students from Housatonic Valley Regional High School, Explorations Charter School in Winsted and the Forman School in Litchfield signed up to read their work while a panel of randomly selected judges rated them on costume, presentation and poem.
Mr. Abo-Hamzy's poetry series has featured published poets like Susan Kinsolving of Bridgewater, Dennis Finnell of Amherst, Mass.; Honor Moore of Kent; Courtney Davis of Redding; William DeVoti of Sheffield, Mass., and Michelle Gilette of Stockbridge, Mass. Faith Vincenzanza, who coordinates Connecticut's poetry slams, and members of the Litchfield Monday Poets group -- Julia Bolus, Davyne Verstandig, Sandra Bishop Ebner and Cheryl Boutenoff -- have also joined in the series.
"It has been a real mix of people," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "Some of them are published and well known, others aren't. Clea Fowler, for instance, is young and unpublished, but an incredible poet."
The first formal reading was a historic event, Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "Oliver Eldridge, who published 'Beach Grass,' came, along with Andrew Gromiller and The Organically Grown. I met him in the gas station and asked him to perform. His work is a sort of folksy-rock with a gospel voice," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "Some readings draw as few as five people, others a full house," he explained. "We fit everybody in. You might have to sit with someone you don't know, but that is part of bringing everyone together." Guests at the diner, whether or not they are there for a poetry reading, are encouraged to go from booth to booth reading the poetry series framed over the center of each table.
A recent series featured work by Mr. Abo-Hamzy: "The first showcase of poetry was poems in memory of friends who had died of AIDS," he said. "While I lived in New York I had so many friends who died. AIDS was claiming one to two people I knew each week because I was involved in the business of music, hairstyling and theater. It was unfathomable."
Mr. Abo-Hamzy's path through life led him from his hometown of Canaan to New York and back again. He graduated from Housatonic Valley Regional High School and then went to Norwich University, the military college of Vermont. "I got a ROTC scholarship; I liked the discipline," he said. "I was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and graduated with a degree in English literature from Norwich." As a paratrooper in the Airborne, he was discharged early because of an injury. "Then I went to Manhattan and became a waiter while I learned to cut hair," he explained. "Waiting tables was the most lucrative way to make money in the city. I'd done it all my life; what could be simpler? When my Dad got sick, I decided to come back to Connecticut."
Mr. Abo-Hamzy's parents have owned and run the Collin's Diner since 1969.
Now he helps his mother run the diner, in addition to a variety of other artistic pursuits. "I've always been a writer, as far back as I can remember. My first poetry reading was in eighth grade," he said. "I try to create three to four pieces a day, not necessarily finished product." In addition to poetry, he said he is working on short stories and a novel as well as studying for a master's degree at Wesleyan University and serving on the board of the Litchfield County Writers Project at University of Connecticut, Torrington.
Cutting hair gives him the money to keep the poetry series alive. "You've got to do what you've got to do to do what you love best," he said. "I wanted to establish this series on my own hard effort. I didn't want it to seem a given. At first, it started as something to do in the country when there wasn't much to do in the summer."
Although attendance can wane in the winter months, a "Poetry Is Music" program in July has become a crowd pleaser. This outdoor open-mike with musicians and poets festival, featuring his mother's Lebanese cooking, is held as part of Canaan Railroad Days. "The diner is a backdrop and the parking lot is our amphitheater," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "The money I get from hair cutting goes into promotion. My parents donate electricity and food for performers. The artists donate their time. I tell them I can feed them, but not pay them."
Hummus, tabouleh, stuffed grape leaves and cinnamon rice are often on the menu. "It's whatever she decides," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "She used to spend all day making hamburgers and pancakes and then go home and spend three hours making stuffed grape leaves for us." Poetry readings have helped to bring in people hungry for something other than hamburgers.
"I always try to have a published feature poet, or someone well known, and then an open mike afterwards," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said. "I didn't want to do slams. I wanted people just to get up and share their words. So much of the world is about economics. I didn't want art to be about that. The reason I started this series was not about making money; only last year did I put a jar out. I just ran out of money."
Poetry readings continue on the fourth Thursday of every month at 7:30 P.M. though the next featured reader, Michael D'Onofrio, will appear on Dec. 10 instead of the fourth Thursday in deference to the holidays. "Mr. D'Onofrio's earnest poetry will be celebrating the holiday season and the first year of his new son's life," Mr. Abo-Hamzy said.
January's reading will be a surprise, and the Feb. 18th reading, the fourth anniversary of the series, will feature Hugh Ogden, a professor at Trinity College in Hartford and the author of the recently published book "Gift."

HEADLINE: WORKING;
When a Boss Turns Abusive

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. I recently received a promotion, but my new boss dislikes me and has been verbally abusive, to the point of using an obscene term to describe me in front of my colleagues. (I reported the incident to the department head.) Obviously, this behavior can't go on. What are my rights? Can I sue?

A. In America, everyone has the right to sue. You could claim defamation of character or infliction of emotional harm. With luck, Judge Judy would hear your case on TV. But that wouldn't necessarily solve the problem. 
 Your recent promotion indicates that your grievance isn't with the company, but with the cretin to whom you've been assigned. You need to target your counterattack more precisely than with a lawsuit. In short, it's time to get personal.
First, do a little detective work, advises Joel Neuman, director of the Center for Applied Management at the State University of New York at New Paltz. "Is this common?" he asked. "Has your manager done this to others?" If so, you have additional ammunition for your case. If not, you may find that your boss has short-term personal problems that are making him hot-tempered.
After sizing up the situation, confront your tormentor privately (and quickly, since you've spoken to the department head). When you aren't in the heat of the moment, the two of you just might be able to resolve -- or at least clarify -- the problem.
The step you've already taken -- going over your boss's head -- should have been a last resort. The outcome is rarely happy; the sad reality is that management (like the rest of us) often suffers from an us-versus-them mentality, and just finding a senior person to back you up can be a nightmare.
For instance, if the department head hired and trained your nemesis, he's probably your boss's ally, said Gary Namie, a psychologist in Benicia, Calif., who started the Campaign Against Workplace Bullying. In that case, you'll need to go even higher up the chain of command. Assuming that you find a sympathetic ear, take care when outlining your complaint. Don't expect management to take you seriously if you get all weepy. Lay out your case as impersonally as possible and try to show how the situation is hurting the department's performance, Mr. Namie said. Wonder aloud whether your boss's actions have become apparent to customers or are undermining staff morale.
To avoid the your-word-against-his trap, try to round up witnesses. Most employees will be less than eager to get involved, but you can probably convince a few to confirm public incidents. Your boss's habit of carrying on like a deranged harpy in front of others should make this easier.
Of course, even if you succeed and your boss is reprimanded, you can expect relations to worsen radically. Consider pushing for reassignment to a new manager or division. Barring that, it may be time to start thinking about moving on. If you thought your boss was unpleasant to begin with, just wait until he learns that you've squealed.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Valley Cottage, N.Y.;
A Diverse, Close-In Rural Hamlet

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
WHEN Chinazo and Everett Cunningham began to feel a little cramped in their 1920's colonial in Nyack they looked for a bigger house on a quieter street in the same neighborhood.
But when they couldn't find the home they wanted in Nyack, Dr. Cunningham, an internist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, and her husband, director of international training and development at Pfizer Inc. in Manhattan, were troubled. "We didn't want to leave the town, or the school district," said Dr. Cunningham. 
 But about five minutes away, nestled between Nyack and Congers, the Cunninghams found a home in the small, rural, hamlet of Valley Cottage in the Town of Clarkstown. This month the couple and their two daughters, 7 months and 22 months old, moved into what Dr. Cunningham called "truly our dream home" -- a new house on two-and-a-half wooded acres "that feels like it's 100 years old." Some of its fixtures were were taken from old farmhouses. Its price tag was $646,000.
But the best part of the move for them is that they remained close to the shopping and restaurants of Nyack, as well as the 2-million-square-foot Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack, and are still part of the same school district.
"Hardly anyone knows about Valley Cottage," said Dale Lydecker, owner of Lydecker Realty in Nyack. "It's tucked away. Most people find it accidentally when they can't find something in Nyack and then treasure it for its good value, available land and supply of interesting homes, especially along Lake DeForest." The homes range from six Dutch sandstones dating to the 18th century to 1950's ranches and Cape Cods and sprawling new contemporaries.
One of Valley Cottage's first residents was John Ryder, who bought 300 acres of farmland off Kings Highway in 1753. The hamlet takes its name from his Dutch sandstone house, which came to be called "that cottage in the valley." (It is now Dutch House Antiques.)
In 1914, Maurice Heaton, a stained-glass artisan whose work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., was a child when he left Switzerland with his parents to settle in Valley Cottage. He lived there until his death in 1990.
In 1939, Alexandra Tolstoy, the youngest daughter of Leo Tolstoy, founded the Tolstoy Foundation with other exiles to minister to the relief of Russian emigres. She lived at the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage until her death in 1979.
Marianne Stewart, owner of the Stewart Professionals real estate agency in Valley Cottage, said that because of the accessibility of Valley Cottage to major highways and shopping malls, including the new Palisades Mall "inventory has been down in Valley Cottage in recent years because anything under $200,000 is scooped up right away."
The Cape Cods and bilevels, which sell for less than $200,000, generally need a lot of work, she said, but "it's hard to beat some of them that come with as many as four bedrooms and two baths on one-half-acre."
FROM there houses jump to $250,000 for larger bilevels built in the late 70's, she said, adding that houses bordering Lake DeForest range from $300,000 to a custom, 3,400-square-foot colonial with lake views that in mid-November was on the market for $585,000.
Anne P. Long, an associate broker at Prudential Rand Realty in New City, said the driving force behind the Valley Cottage real estate market was the eclectic range of homes available.
"You can go from one end of the spectrum to the other in Valley Cottage," she said. "If you want the cute, older house for under $200,000, you can find it. Or, for $225,000 to $295,00, you can buy a Norwegian-inspired home with cut-out hearts and scalloped moldings built by Gustav Svahn. You can buy a new five-bedroom colonial in Joy Acres for the high $300,000's or, you may get lucky and find a Dutch sandstone on a large lot for about $500,000. We have it all."
There are two garden-apartment condominium complexes in Valley Cottage, the 987-unit Mountainview on Sierra Vista Lane and the 350-unit Lake Road condominium complex, both with clubhouses and pools, said Ms. Long.
Some of the units at Mountainview have fireplaces and overlook the Hudson River. Prices range from $75,000 for a one-bedroom to $150,000 for a two-bedroom.
Sixteen condominium town houses are being built at Rockridge Estates on Route 103 where the three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath homes will sell from $179,000 to $184,900, said Ms. Long.
At the 96-unit Burgundy Gardens off Route 103, rents range from $900 for a one-bedroom to $1,125 for a two-bedroom.
Beyond the wide range of prices for housing is another attraction -- the cultural and socio-economic diversity of the 3,065-student Nyack Public School District, where 59 percent of those enrolled are white, 30.6 percent black, 5.8 percent Asian and American Indian and 4.6 percent Hispanic.
Olga and Mead Stone were living in Westchester for only a year when they moved their family of five to Valley Cottage in 1994. Mrs. Stone, the student activities director at White Plains High School, said that she and her husband, a producer and editor at CBS News, believed that "diversity is important."
"How else can children learn to respect other cultures living in this country," she said. "After all, this country is a mixed salad. America is not a melting pot. I don't want my children to perceive that everyone should have the same ways of doing everything. In a salad, a tomato is a tomato and doesn't taste like a cucumber."
"Over the years we've done a lot of different things to bring our students together," said Roberta R. Zampolin, the Schools Superintendent. "We celebrate each other's culture with International Culture Night where children share their ethnic foods, dance and art. We have an exchange program with Africa, France and Spain. We celebrate everyone's holidays and, beginning in elementary school, we talk about respecting each other, conflict resolution and learning to get along."
In bringing the children together, she said, her staff has also helped them achieve high standards. Of the district's 216 high school graduates last June, 94 percent went on to higher education.
The average S.A.T. scores last June were 497 on the verbal section and 495 on the math section, compared with 495 and 503, respectively, in New York State.
But it's also the district's attention to children's special needs that has made all the difference to the Stones, who live in the original Svahn family home built in the late 1940's. Their youngest daughter, Ana, 8, had speech and language difficulties in the beginning. "I can't applaud the district enough for everything they did for my daughter," Ms. Stone said. "They really believe in early intervention. By third grade, my daughter didn't need special help."
THIS year the district began teaching French and Spanish in the first through fifth grades in all three of the elementary schools. Two of them, the Valley Cottage School and the Liberty School, are in the hamlet and a third is in Upper Nyack. Children attend the Nyack Middle School from grades six through eight.
About 18 percent of the pupils in the district attend parochial or private schools, according to a spokesman for the public school district. Some are enrolled in the Roman Catholic St. Paul's pre-k through grade 8 y school in Valley Cottage, which offers classes for pre-k through eighth grade. Monthly tuition for parishioners of the Congers church is $215 and for nonparishioners, $285.
The houses of worship in the hamlet are the Presbyterian Elim Alliance Church, All Saints Episcopal Church, the Community Bible Church and the Russian Orthodox Church on the Tolstoy Foundation Center property.
Also on the 45-acre property of the center are two adult homes with a total of 42 beds, a 26-cottage retirement village and a 96-bed nursing home, the latter open to all.
Since Valley Cottage is a small town, the library functions as an all-purpose gathering place for residents. Amelia Kalin, program and art exhibit director of the Valley Cottage Library, said two to three times a year the library presents an art and tea program in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art that offers residents the opportunity to hear a lecture on a current exhibit at the museum. The library also offers cooking programs and a rotating monthly art exhibit by local artists.
For recreation, the residents of the hamlet can fish in Lake DeForest, a reservoir, fly kites and ice skate in the 25-acre Twin Ponds Park or stroll in the passive five-acre Heaton's Park, which has a stream running through it.
Residents can also use Clarkstown's recreational facilities, which include three pools and a dozen parks, said Jo Anne Oldenburger, assistant superintendent of the Department of Recreation and Parks.
Valley Cottage is a small town with but one small strip shopping center, a few fast-food outlets and one pub called Fordy's and no movie house or night life. But it's just right for the Cunningham family.
"I plan on being here a long time, or at least until the kids go on to college," said Dr. Cunningham.

In 1972, the library moved down the block into the site of a 2,000-square-foot former air-conditioning business. The library, now with 18,000 square feet of space, has, in addition to its books, 7,000 books on tape and 1,500 historical photographs. The wooden sign from the original library hangs behind the circulation desk, as a remembrance of times past.

HEADLINE: Baruch Builds An Urban Quadrangle

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FROM a massive base almost a full city block in extent, the facade of the new Baruch College Academic Complex on Lexington Avenue bows outward and tapers inward, as if distorted by some gigantic fish-eye lens, its bare steel columns seeming to curve like bamboo trees under a steady gale.
For the first time in its 79-year history, Baruch has claimed a memorable spot on the New York skyline. 
 Now rising between 24th and 25th Streets, the 17-level Academic Complex, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, is remarkable in other ways. With a $270 million price tag, it is the most expensive single building project ever undertaken by the City University of New York. In size, it is second only to the North Academic Center of 1984 at City College in upper Manhattan (and just by a whisker). Baruch's complex is so big that it will represent half the space of the entire campus on completion in 2000.
"On a normal campus," said Emma E. Macari, the vice chancellor of CUNY for facilities planning, construction and management, "we would have done a series of buildings around a quad: a gym, a performing arts center, a business school, liberal arts facilities, a student center with a bookstore and cafeterias. Here, they are all together, in what we call our vertical campus."
Dr. Matthew Goldstein, the president of Adelphi University, who headed Baruch until June, recalled: "It was quite a task to get the Governor to appropriate the money to design and construct the building. Then the problems really began."
A case study in the difficulties of building in New York, the project site included two single-room-occupancy hotels, one with an implacable and outspoken tenant leader; two horse-auction marts and a stable from the early 1900's that were arguably worth landmark designation; a co-op at 330 Third Avenue whose western windows would be blocked by the new building, and up to 30 feet of bedrock, every linear inch of which cost $25,000 to excavate.
To Baruch officials, however, it was the only site that offered an escape from the chronic problem of renting space for $19 million a year in commercial office towers that cannot accommodate 3,000 people getting to class in 20 minutes.
With skip-stop elevator service in six oversized cabs (7 by 12 feet), the new complex can handle such a crowd.
"We kid our alumni that future alumni will no longer have stories about the long wait for elevators," said Dr. Lois S. Cronholm, interim president of the college.
Elevator service will be supplemented with stairways and escalators around a 13-story atrium that has been stepped so that sunlight can penetrate all the way from the south to the north side of the building, even reaching across 25th Street to splash the William and Anita Newman Library.
This staggered arrangement creates a series of smaller spaces within the atrium, a contrast to the vast expanses designed by the architect John Portman in the 1970's.
"The idea was to take a quadrangle and turn it on end," said the architect William Pedersen. "It's one thing to create a Portman-like atrium. But we wanted intimacy. The intention was to break the scale down, so there were plenty of nooks and crannies where people can sit and talk and hang out."
No less interesting on the outside, the complex almost fills the three-dimensional zoning "envelope" that defines what may be built on the site. It recalls the dramatic renderings by Hugh Ferriss in the 1920's that showed structures fully built out according to zoning rules.
To disgruntled neighbors, the structure more vividly recalls the Queen Elizabeth 2. Indeed, there is a certain resemblance to the hull of an ocean liner in drydock.
The 785,000-square-foot complex will enable Baruch to give up 643,000 square feet that it now leases in 111 East 18th Street and 360 Park Avenue South, at 26th Street.
"We have reined in a sprawling campus," Dr. Cronholm said. Clearly, the complex represents an important departure in the physical development of Baruch, known among students as U.C.L.A.: University on the Corner of Lexington Avenue.
B ARUCH has always been regarded for excellence in all areas but one -- our physical facilities," Dr. Cronholm said.
Baruch was founded in 1919 as the City College School of Business and Civic Administration and renamed in 1953 for the financier Bernard M. Baruch, a benefactor of the school. It first occupied the Free Academy at Lexington Avenue and 23d Street, birthplace of City College, which was left behind when C.C.N.Y. moved uptown in 1907.
The academy, built in 1849 in the style of the Gothic town halls of the Netherlands, was replaced by a new School of Business, completed in 1930. It was until now the only structure built especially for the college. All the rest have been hand-me-downs.
The administration building at 135 East 22d Street was originally the Family Court part of Domestic Relations Court, completed in 1940. The future home of the School of Public Affairs, 137 East 22d Street, was originally the Children's Court of 1912.
The library occupies the Lexington Building, 151 East 25th Street, built in 1895 as the power station for the Lexington Avenue cable-car line. It was renovated in 1994 to designs by Davis, Brody & Associates.
Davis, Brody also drew up a proposal in 1986 for "Site B," where the complex is now rising, as part of a master plan.
The site had several advantages. It would be ideally situated between the library and the main core of Baruch buildings. The college already controlled the largest property on the block, a former stable at 155 East 24th Street. And the 10 other parcels were under common ownership -- the estate of Louis Berkowitz, whose L. B. Oil Company operated on the block -- meaning they could be acquired in a single deal.
The 1986 plan envisioned a boxy tower of 23 stories on Lexington Avenue, a mid-block atrium and a 7-story annex.
Dr. Goldstein assumed the presidency of Baruch in 1991. Shopping with his wife at Bloomingdale's a few months later, he gave his credit card to a clerk. "Are you Matthew Goldstein, the president of Baruch?" she asked while filling out the charge form.
"Yes, I am," he answered.
"What are you going to do about those terrible elevators?" she demanded.
That spelled the end to the high-rise approach. Dr. Goldstein's marching orders to the architects two years later called for "a much more horizontal building where we're not hostages to elevators."
The structure descends three levels below ground to accommodate a gymnasium with room for 1,200 spectators, a 25-meter pool, 300-seat theater and 250-seat recital hall. "The key is to get all the high-population stuff as low as possible," Mr. Pedersen said, to cut down elevator demand.
In the upper floors will be the classrooms and faculty offices of the Zicklin School of Business and the Mildred and George Weissman School of Arts and Sciences.
"We are developing essentially a new building type," said Philip Logan, the project coordinator for Baruch.
Space planning and engineering were challenging enough. But there were social and historic complications as well.
East 24th Street was once "Old Stable Row" and many vestiges remained between Lexington and Third Avenues, a block dominated in the early 20th century by Fiss, Doerr & Carroll, which called itself the "largest dealer of horses in the world."
To designs by Horgan & Slattery, architects of the Surrogate's Court on Chambers Street, the company built a seven-story stable and two Beaux-Arts auction marts, one of which was used until 1991 by the H. Kauffman & Sons Saddlery Company.
In a ground-floor studio in the stable building, a young country singer named Elvis Presley recorded his first RCA album in January 1956, including "Blue Suede Shoes" and "One-Sided Love Affair."
If this sounds like a landmark -- it almost was. The Landmarks Preservation Commission considered the Fiss, Doerr buildings in 1989 but failed the next year to muster enough votes for a designation, which would have derailed Baruch's plans.
Jennifer J. Raab, the current chairwoman of the commission, said she "tried to salvage as much of the buildings as possible" for a historic exhibit that is to be incorporated in the north plaza of the new complex.
Far more wrenching was the case of two S.R.O.'s: the Gramercy Hotel on 24th Street and the Amsterdam Hotel on 25th Street. When they were taken over in 1995 by the Dormitory Authority, they had 21 tenants, many of whom were over 50 and living on welfare or Social Security.
Jim Davis, a carpenter and handbag maker who moved into the Gramercy in the early 80's and paid $66 a week for his room, said life grew miserable after the takeover. He said one tenant in the Amsterdam was beaten by a security guard, although officials said that a police investigation failed to substantiate that charge.
Mr. Davis said plumbing and bathroom fixtures were ripped out of vacant units, although officials said the Dormitory Authority repaired electric and water service. Worse yet, Mr. Davis said, was the feeling of isolation as pressure mounted on tenants to move out. About a dozen residents sued the Dormitory Authority. Mr. Davis said the goal was not to stop the project but to win comparable housing at comparable rents in the community, as officials had promised.
ONE by one, however, the other tenants agreed to relocate. They were each paid a $17,500 stipend by the Dormitory Authority. Depending on their needs, they were also given refrigerators or television sets, said Jane R. Crotty, Baruch's director of community relations and economic development. There was a relocation company and social worker on site to assist them.
"Great care was taken in doing the relocation," Ms. Crotty said.
The tenants were dispersed to East Harlem, the Upper West Side and Times Square. "We kept most of them in Manhattan, which is quite a feat," Ms. Crotty said.
Mr. Davis and another tenant would not accept the relocation terms and were evicted in 1996. Now living on West 43d Street, Mr. Davis is pursuing his lawsuit against the Dormitory Authority.
Baruch came under fire from the other side of the block in 1996. The residents of 330 Third Avenue sued to stop the project, saying they were victims of a "bait-and-switch" maneuver, having believed that the new building would be a tower on Lexington Avenue rather than a bulky mid-block structure that walled off their western facade. (While the Academic Complex has only 14 stories above ground, the high floors result in a structure that is almost as tall at its eastern end as the 20-story co-op next door.)
"They misled us in terms of the structure they were going to build," said Ed Virshup, who was then president of the co-op board.
Under a negotiated settlement, Baruch agreed to reconfigure the upper floors somewhat. "What became very important was the light to those western apartments," said Karl F. Schmid, an assistant vice president of Baruch, "and we did give way a bit."
Not enough, however, to mollify Mr. Virshup entirely. He still finds Baruch's building to be "a big monolith that doesn't do anything to enhance the neighborhood because it's not in keeping."
Dr. Cronholm is aware that the neighbors continue to mutter. Her answer: "After our building is built and your property values go up, I think you'll be less unhappy with us."
Ground was broken for the complex in June 1997. And broken. And broken. All told, some 65,000 cubic yards of bedrock -- roughly 140,000 tons -- were excavated, said Nicholas D'Ambrosio, project manager for the Dormitory Authority. The construction manager is TDX Construction Corporation.
The steel work was topped off last month but much remains to be done. What will be the pool is nothing more than a muddy rock pit. No diving will be allowed; the excavation to provide for the right ceiling height would have been prohibitively expensive.
Construction represents $168 million of the $270 million project and is currently running about $1 million under budget, said Anthony J. Mosellie, project manager for Kohn Pedersen Fox. Land acquisition costs are being negotiated, Ms. Crotty said.
Even in a raw state, the complex is already working in one important way. On a recent visit, a patch of sunlight 15 by 20 feet could be seen piercing the atrium and reaching the facade of the library. "Just how we planned it, right?" Mr. D'Ambrosio asked Mr. Pedersen, with evident satisfaction.
Dr. Goldstein said the architects were "artful" in linking the two buildings through the use of light. But something else is on his mind: that frustrated Baruch student who waited on him at Bloomingdale's six years ago. "I wish I could see her today and say, 'We finally did something about those terrible elevators,' " he said.

Lighting Up With Ideas For Using Tobacco Money

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The state's first payment does not arrive until April 15, 2000, but the debate has already begun here at the State House over how to spend the state's share of the $206 billion national tobacco settlement.
New Jersey and the 45 other states that have signed the agreement are free to spend the money any way they choose. Negotiators have urged states to spend the money on tobacco-control and tobacco-prevention programs, but that has not stopped some New Jersey lawmakers from suggesting that it could be used to address some of the state's other pressing needs. 
Already, Assembly Minority Leader Joseph V. Doria, a Democrat from Bayonne, suggests that part of the proceeds should be used to help repair the state's crumbling schools.
Under the deal, tobacco companies will begin distributing payments to states, beginning in 2000. New Jersey will get a total of $7.6 billion over 25 years. After the first payment of $100 million in 2000, the state is due to receive annual checks of between $250 million and $325 million until 2025.
Governor Whitman has tried to steer the debate toward using the money for antismoking programs and public health programs, including charity care, which pays hospital bills for the uninsured. "It is very important that we keep our focus on health-related issues," she said. "That's where the money should go, and that's where I want to insure that it continue to go. I would prefer to see it go to things such as that rather than areas that have no necessary relationship to smoking."
But Mrs. Whitman has not yet answered the most important question: Will all of the new money be used to pay for new public health and new antismoking programs or cover the costs of existing programs? And while the original lawsuit, brought by New Jersey and some of the other states, was intended to recover state Medicaid costs from smoking-related diseases, the biggest challenge remains stopping teen-agers from starting to smoke in the first place.
Consider these grim statistics from Len Fishman, the state's health commissioner. One out of five high school students in New Jersey regularly smokes cigarettes. One of out three middle school students has experimented with cigarettes. One out of three teen-agers who starts smoking and continues to smoke will die prematurely from a smoking-related disease.
Mr. Fishman said the tobacco industry was spending about $5 billion a year on marketing and advertising efforts directed at teen-agers, and several hundred million dollars in this market alone.
While New Jersey has imposed new taxes on cigarettes and tough new restrictions limiting cigarette sales to minors, the state now spends about $1 million annually in advertising and marketing efforts to counter the big tobacco companies.
Anyone who knows anything about advertising or even political campaigns knows the power of money in getting your message across. In almost any contest, the campaign that has $100 million to spend is easily going to beat the campaign that has only $1 million.
Some states, including Massachusetts and Minnesota, are already pouring tens of millions of dollars into antismoking campaigns directed at preventing young people from starting smoking and helping others stop. Some antismoking groups think New Jersey should look at what those states have done, and consider adopting similar programs here.
"We should use it for powerful antitobacco advertising, research and comprehensive community programs," said Regina Carlson, executive director and founder of the Group Against Smoking Pollution (GASP). "This is blood money. The tobacco company made this money killing people. We should use it to stop the killing."
While $206 billion is a lot of money, it is much less than the deal that was worked out last spring. But that deal, which provided $368.5 billion and imposed much tougher restrictions on cigarette companies, failed to win Congressional approval.
Now that the states have accepted this pact, it is up to Congress to revisit this issue. Both of New Jersey's Senators, Robert G. Torricelli and Frank R. Lautenberg, have vowed to make this a top priority when the Congress convenes next year.
New Jersey and other states may not be able to regulate nicotine. But there are steps that they can take with this money that might prevent big health care bills in years to come.
State Senator Shirley Turner, a Democrat from Trenton, has offered a solution aimed at preventing diversion of this money for other needs. She noted that while Governor Whitman has proposed using the money for public health care programs, there is nothing to prevent future governors from using it for something else. She has proposed a constitutional amendment that would require all the money coming to New Jersey be spent on public health programs.
"We need only look at the recent raiding of state pension, temporary disablity insurance and unemployment funds as one-time-only gimmicks used to balance the state budget to get a vision of how supposedly dedicated funds can be diverted away from their original purpose to suit a passing political need," Senator Turner said. "Only a constitutional amendment can protect this money for its intended usage."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
The Economy Grows. The Smokestacks Shrink.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
AMERICA is putting on an unusual spectacle: The economy keeps growing and thriving even while manufacturing suffers and falls behind.
That rarely happens, and its appearance now reopens the long-debated question of whether manufacturing still matters. The issue is particularly pertinent because manufacturers have been insisting, with much chest-thumping, that they have made American factories the most efficient in the world today. The Asian crisis, they argue, is only a temporary setback in a turnaround that is not yet evident in the data. 
 But evidence of manufacturing's shrinking role in the economy shows up everywhere. The Olin Corporation has just announced the closing of a factory that makes copper rods, wires and tubes; imports cost less. Thomson Consumer Electronics recently shut the last factory in the United States making television sets, replacing it with a plant in Juarez, Mexico, where labor is so much cheaper. I.B.M., Dell Computer and others assemble computers from parts increasingly made abroad.
Once the kingpin of the economy, manufacturing in 1997 accounted for only about 17 percent of the wages, salaries, benefits and profits generated within the United States, the Commerce Department reported this month. And the shrinkage continues. The Asian economic crisis has been particularly hard on manufacturers this year, mainly by denying them sales abroad.
Anecdote and statistic alike suggest that the slide is not easily reversed. Even the sophisticated equipment that American manufacturers buy for their factories -- computer-controlled machines, for example, that cut and shape metal -- now come mostly from Japan and Europe. Manufacturing has been losing momentum for decades, with its share of the gross domestic product dwindling to just over half of what it was in 1953, the peak postwar year. That year, manufacturing yielded 29.6 percent of personal compensation and corporate profits; by 1989, the eve of the last recession, its share had fallen to 18.6 percent.
"My concern is that we can go too far down," said the economist Robert Hayes, an expert in manufacturing at Harvard University. "But I don't know how far too far is. I would have thought 10 years ago that where we are now was too far. But we are still humming along."
Switzerland is the only developed nation whose manufacturing has diminished further than in the United States, and it regards itself as vulnerable, Mr. Hayes said. The Swiss are still active in pharmaceuticals and machinery manufacturing, but banking and tourism play ever bigger roles as sources of wages and profits. And these days, banks can leave a country through mergers even faster than factories.
Factories leave fast enough. What still surprises so many executives, Mr. Hayes said, is "how quickly less-developed nations have been able to master advanced manufacturing techniques and technology."
In theory at least, any nation should be able to function quite nicely with a diminished manufacturing sector. The huge and growing service sector -- retailers, banks, insurers, law firms, hotel operators, restaurants, phone companies, brokers, home builders, airlines and Internet operators -- should be able to generate a satisfactory amount of income and profits. Certainly they play a big role today in the stock market's spectacular performance and in strong job growth.
But none of the industrial nations have tested the theory, certainly not this country. Americans are far and away the most innovative in developing new products, new techniques and new software, which are then incorporated into manufacturing here first, and later abroad.
Within the United States, manufacturing generates more income per hour worked than any other sector. As these jobs disappear -- 198,000 since last March and 760,000 since 1989 -- the displaced workers get new jobs outside manufacturing, but usually at lower pay. That downward shifting in wages is one reason why the nation has escaped inflationary wage pressures, despite strong economic growth and an unemployment rate of only 4.6 percent.
Manufacturing has other advantages. There is the multiplier effect: the great number of satellite companies that come into existence to service manufacturers. In addition, no other sector except government does as much research, the source of new technology. Above all, the United States has built up over the decades great reservoirs of knowledge and skill in the manufacture of complex products. That experience disappears when makers of railroad cars, for example, leave the country.
"In the sense of production capability," said Seymour Melman, a Columbia University manufacturing expert, "we are in danger of finding ourselves, at the end of the current expansion, weaker than we were at the beginning."

HEADLINE: Vans, Just 15, In Middle Age

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
FIFTEEN years have passed since Lee A. Iacocca drove the first modern minivan off a Chrysler Corporation assembly line in Windsor, Ontario. That short trip, on Nov. 2, 1983, began a noteworthy journey in which the minivan dethroned the station wagon as the preferred utility vehicle of American families. But more recently, the minivan has become the object of snickers and has seemed at risk of being muscled aside by sport utilities, with their comparable space plus an outdoorsy image.
Although the minivan segment is not growing, it is far from dead. Auto makers are frantically working to lure new buyers with vans that are safer, more exciting, more luxurious and more practical. 
 On average, Americans have bought 1.2 million of the vans each year for the last four years. Industry-wide, they account for approximately 8 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States.
For this segment to remain viable, significant demographic challenges have to be dealt with, according to a recent report on the compact van market by J. D. Power & Associates. Auto makers are grappling with how to continue to appeal to baby boomers (those aged, roughly, 35 to 50) as they move out of their prime child-rearing years and how to attract the group that Power calls Generation X'ers (25- to 35-year-olds) in their family-raising years.
Baby boomers account for more than half of all minivan sales, and they are loyal. When it is time to replace the old minivan, 40 percent buy another, compared with only 36 percent of those aged 25 to 35, according to another J. D. Power report.
Although minivans appeal to people with children, this report found that those in the 25-to-35-year-old group appeared to be marrying later, or perhaps not at all. When they do have children, the report said, they are more inclined to buy sport utility vehicles. These buyers appear to be rejecting the minivans of their parents, much as their parents rejected the station wagons that they had grown up with.
One surprising finding about minivans -- and what may be part of their salvation -- is that children are not required. J. D. Power says that a third of all compact vans sold in 1997 went to families without children, said Paul Ballew, chief economist and senior director of automotive analysis at J. D. Power. Such a high number bolsters the idea that minivans are not dead. Also, 85 percent of the buyers without children were over 50, suggesting that minivans may have a future as utility vehicles for older buyers.
It seems likely that what these older buyers will want, and can afford, is pampering. Just as most older consumers move upscale in their vehicle choices, "the same thing will be true for the people who want to be in minivans," said Susan G. Jacobs, an auto industry analyst in Rutherford, N.J. "So at least within the empty-nester group, the people who stay in minivans are more likely to prefer luxury versions."
A prime example is Chrysler's Town & Country Limited, a step up from the already luxurious Town & Country LXi, with special trim, a distinctive interior and even an umbrella holder. It is aimed at retaining van customers and attracting luxury car owners. And Chrysler may be onto something: Town & Country sales rose to 73,188 in 1997 from 33,695 in '95.
Oldsmobile is offering its Silhouette Premiere, and the Ford Motor Company is positioning its redesigned 1999 Windstar SEL (which last year was called the Limited) against the Town & Country Limited. The top Windstar has a leather interior and a long list of features, including dual power sliding doors, side-impact air bags and a sensor that warns the driver if something is in the path as it backs up.
But even as minivans become more pampering, they face plusher competition from their nemesis, the luxury sport utility.
"It is a very dynamic, fast-paced environment," Mr. Ballew said. "And, because of that, we're all sitting back here scratching our heads a bit and trying to get our arms around it. The key is that it doesn't add up to the demise of the segment, but it does add up to a very competitive future."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Chrysler's Pacifica show car, above and left, may offer clues to the minivan's future. It has airliner-style features like reclining seats with foot rests, overhead storage bins and a drop-down TV screen. Chrysler's original minivan of 1983.

Take This Car and Plug It

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, 1998 was going to be the year of the electric car. In 1990 California announced that 2 percent of the automobiles sold in the state by major manufacturers in 1998 would have to be nonpolluting. New York and Massachusetts soon followed suit. The electric car was hailed as the route to clean air and the antidote to dependence on imported oil.
Today the electric car seems an idea whose time has been put on hold. 
 "This was the year it was all going to happen," said Nancy Hazard, of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, a nonprofit advocacy group in Greenfield, Mass. "Obviously it is not unfolding as they anticipated it to unfold." As the last of the 1998 models leave dealers' lots, very few of them are running on batteries.
The technology behind electric car improves yearly, but the cars themselves fail to attract buyers. Experts say the reason is they are not as flexible as gasoline cars, so consumers are not lining up, and policy makers have become reconciled to gasoline as engines have become cleaner and oil cheaper.
But Ms. Hazard and others are still enthusiastic about the electric vehicle because technology has created a gasoline-electric car, with potentially huge implications for energy use and pollution.
The nomenclature has changed, too. Specialists once called electric vehicles EV's, but they now call them battery electric vehicles, or BEV's, to distinguish them from hybrid HEV's, which use internal combustion engines to charge the batteries and electric motors to turn the wheels.
Before this hybrid appeared, something quite unexpected happened to the old internal combustion engine. The century-old automotive technology, thought by many experts to have reached its limits, adapted.
California, when it first called for the electric car in 1990, also set standards for cleanliness in regular cars; the most stringent was the "ultra-low emission vehicle," or ULEV. But the state, the toughest in the nation when it came to the environment, underestimated the capacity of auto makers to respond. Toyota has plans for a gasoline car that is four times cleaner than the ULEV; Honda plans one that is 10 times cleaner.
This new car, the "super ultra low emission vehicle," quickly acquired its inevitable acronym: SULEV. "California ran out of superlatives, so they had to start compounding them," said David W. Hermance, general manager in charge of engines at the Toyota Technical Center USA Inc., in Gardena, Calif.
California recently enabled auto makers to meet their LEV quotas with SULEV's instead. Of course, the nonpolluting electric car does not emit pollutants itself, but that doesn't mean it doesn't contribute to fouling the environment; somewhere out there is a plant producing power for charging batteries. California's electric power system, though, is very clean, and pollution for charging batteries is much lower than for the ULEV. With the introduction of the SULEV, the difference grows smaller; the cost is modest.
AYEAR ago in Japan, Toyota introduced a hybrid car called the Prius, which cost about 10 percent more than a Corolla and is the same size. Its factories, which make 2,000 cars a month, cannot keep up with demand. In 2000 the Prius will be sold in this country.
The Prius, which does not idle, has a gas engine to charge its batteries or power its wheels. The result is low emissions and fuel economy of 66 miles a gallon. Today every other major car company has a hybrid on the drawing boards or in research, generally with an internal-combustion engine as an auxiliary power unit.
And oil is a tough competitor. The Energy Information Administration, the Government's main energy forecasting group, pointed out last week that oil costs $7 a barrel less than it did a year ago. Because of the Asian economic meltdown, prices are not expected to rise to pre-crisis levels until 2007.
The shift away from battery electric cars is disappointing to purists and some engineers, partly because the vehicles can get their energy from "clean" sources like the sun as well as from coal, natural gas or oil. But efficiency alone is not enough to sell products.
Still, mass production of the hybrid means further improvements in electric engines, paving the way for a pure electric car if better batteries become available. In the meantime, Ms. Hazard said, "more and more, consumers are seeking information on environmentally friendly automobiles.
"If the auto companies can produce a vehicle which meets their driving needs, they will make that green choice," she said.

How Toys Cleaned Up Urban Blight

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR decades the industrial area just east of this city's downtown was an economic wreck -- 15 blocks of derelict prewar buildings abutting the flophouses, cheap hotels and unappetizing sights of skid row. But in recent years the area has come to boisterous life with voices in various South China dialects, Vietnamese, Korean, Farsi, Spanish and myriad other languages, all talking about toys.
The energy of immigrant entrepreneurship and a vision of a specialized commercial district have effected this remarkable transformation, turning Central City East, the kind of archaic industrial area that lies rotting in cities all across the country, into Toytown, a bustling marketplace with more than 4,000 jobs and $1 billion in annual sales. 
 "In December, we have about the worst traffic problem in downtown," Charlie Woo says, proudly. Mr. Woo immigrated to Los Angeles from Hong Kong as a teen-ager in 1968 and now, at 47, is widely considered Toytown's founding father. During the holiday season, consumers flock to the area, seeking cut-rate toys, dolls and action figures, including knockoffs of well-known brands. The rest of the year, the district sustains itself as a global wholesale center, with nearly half its shipments going to Latin America and Mexico.
TOYTOWN was not dreamed up in City Hall. Few in the Los Angeles establishment noticed in 1979, when Mr. Woo and his family started their first toy wholesaling business there.
"When Toytown started, the C.R.A. didn't even know about it," recalled Don Spivack, who is now deputy administrator of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency. "It happened on its own. It was a dead warehouse district."
How dead? Dave Zoraster, an appraiser at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial brokerage firm, estimated that in the mid-70's, land in the area was worth about $2.75 a square foot and half the commercial space was vacant. Today the land commands $100 a square foot or more, and vacancy rates are in the single digits.
The redevelopment agency envisioned the area as a place for low-income transients, safely away from the new high-rises of the financial district a few blocks west. But Mr. Woo, then working on a Ph.D. in physics at U.C.L.A., saw it as a great central location for wholesaling and distributing the billions of dollars in imported toys flowing from Asia into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. He bought a building for $140,000 and got started.
Personal connections in Asia helped him establish close relationships with scores of toy manufacturers there. He built up volume by halving the 40 to 50 percent markup typically sought by traditional small toy wholesalers. Today, Mr. Woo and his family own 10 Toytown buildings and a distribution company, Megatoys, with $30 million in annual sales.
Mr. Woo built the toy district around him with a strategy that few other business people would ever consider: He invited his competitors in. He reasoned that the critical mass of a Hong Kong-style commercial cluster would lower shipping costs, attract more buyers and ultimately benefit everyone in the district.
"It was a tough decision," Mr. Woo says, surveying Toytown recently on crutches, the legacy of a childhood bout with polio. "But we saw how the garment district was working. We saw it in the flower and food markets. Convenience brings in more customers."
TODAY, the toy district, a hodgepodge of one- and two-story buildings often painted in pastel shades, is home to roughly 500 toy and electronics-related businesses. Many of them started in much the same way as M & J Toys did: Minh Quach and his family came from Vietnam in 1980 and started selling toys at the swap meets that flourish throughout ethnic Southern California, then graduated to a small storefront and today operate a 6,000-square-foot store and a nearby 30,000-square-foot warehouse packed with boxes of toys.
Toytown's success has bred growth in toy-related businesses across Southern California. The region, also home to Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, has spawned hundreds of smaller toy designers, distributors and manufacturers. The Otis College of Art and Design in West Los Angeles has started a toy design department. Over all, as much as 60 percent of the $12 billion in toys sold to American retailers come through Southern California.
With Toytown's rents and land prices much higher now, Mr. Woo believes the area's future lies in retail development. To make Toytown more attractive to families, he recently helped establish a business improvement district to clean streets and improve security. The area has also seen a boom in new construction and restoration of older buildings.
But perhaps most important, the area's continuing success testifies to the ability of immigrant entrepreneurs to turn around even the most destitute urban neighborhoods.
Mr. Woo sees the latest improvements as helping keep Toytown a vital place for wholesalers and designers keen on staying close to industry trends.
"The future of Toytown will be as a gathering point for anyone interested in toys," Mr. Woo said. "The industry will grow all over, but this place will remain ground zero."

HEADLINE: Above and Beyondthe Workplace Call of Duty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Saving a Life but Crossing a Line" (The Right Thing, Nov. 15), which described how a subordinate donated one of her kidneys to her boss: 
 I wholeheartedly agree that the company should have discussed the issues with both parties beforehand. That being said, however, I wouldn't diminish in any way this subordinate's incredible generosity. Nor, if a discussion had taken place, would I be squeamish about the transplant itself in regard to expectations about how she should be treated in the future.
A manager is expected to make the tough decisions. If the kidney donor ever does not perform her duties as expected, then the boss should counsel, correct and dismiss her as befits his responsibilities to the company. Acting otherwise would be an insult to the subordinate's altruism.
Even if the boss ever found it necessary to dismiss her, however, that would not preclude his working hard to help her find another job, as long as he doesn't cross any ethical boundaries. It's what any friend should do.
Over all, I think there is much more to celebrate about this woman's actions than there is to second-guess. Such a strong worker-boss relationship says something special about the company and encourages all people there to look more compassionately and emphatically at one another.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Howard B. Moss;
Harbor International Growth Fund

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

 BODY:
Y the time Howard B. Moss enrolled at the University of Liverpool in 1966, the Beatles had left town, moving out into the big wide world.
And that's what Mr. Moss, manager of the $1.23 billion Harbor International Growth fund, eventually did too -- alas, without ever seeing the band perform. (His student residence was on Penny Lane, the title of his favorite Beatles tune, and he calls himself "a huge fan.") Today, he works from an office in Fort Myers, Fla., for Jennison Capital Associates, a New York money manager that is subadviser of the fund for Harbor Capital Advisors of Toledo, Ohio. 
 Still, it's a relatively small world these days for Mr. Moss, 50. About the only place he finds the sort of stocks he likes to buy is in Europe, where about 95 percent of the fund's assets are invested. The fund is also concentrated in its number of stocks -- just 24 in the portfolio.
Using a bottom-up approach to investing based on corporate fundamentals, he likes well-managed mid- to large-capitalization companies with long-term annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent and forward price-to- earnings ratios below that rate. That kind of growth is hard to find in rocky economic landscapes like Asia and Latin America.
His circumspect view may well have sharpened Mr. Moss's performance this year. It has achieved a return of 14.3 percent through Nov. 20 -- notably north of the 8.4 percent for its better-known, value-oriented sister fund, Harbor International, and the 8.3 percent average for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. Over three years, Harbor International Growth has tallied an average annual return of 18.5 percent versus 16.2 for the sister fund and 9.2 percent for the peer group.
In 1997, as much as 14 percent of the portfolio was in Hong Kong real estate and bank stocks. Mr. Moss reduced those holdings to zero by last summer, though he acknowledged that the Asian crisis still hurt the fund's otherwise stellar returns.
Asian companies outside Hong Kong don't tempt him. "With the debacle of currency devaluations and falls in the stock market, the companies we used to follow in places like the Philippines and Thailand, specifically, are no longer viable, in that their market capitalizations are too low for us to become interested," he said.
As for Japan, companies like Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi "have unfortunately become cyclical," in part because of slowing consumer spending there, he said. "They are no longer secular growth companies on which one can rely" for consistent earnings growth, he added.
So how is Mr. Moss playing Europe? While he doesn't see a recession there, he expects economic growth to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent annually over the next 12 to 18 months, from his estimate of 2.3 to 3 percent for this year. As a result, earnings in cyclical sectors like chemicals, steel and auto-making are likely to slump, while well-managed noncyclicals -- the kind he prefers, in any case -- should do much better. That points to drug, telephone and bank companies as outperformers. He expects European economic growth "to pick up from the middle of 2000 going forward."
For companies that can expand, he said, the elimination of economic borders in the European Union offers huge opportunities.
"From the individual company point of view, this will become the United States of Europe," he said. "So you will see the growth of new, pan-European companies."
HE predicted that many of those companies would be based in southern Europe, where, after decades of high inflation and high interest rates, governments have adopted many of the disciplined economic policies of their northern neighbors. About one-third of his fund's assets are invested in southern Europe, mainly in banks and telephone companies, which often meet his growth criteria.
The fund's biggest holding, at 6.4 percent of assets, is Unicredito Italiano, a Milan-based bank previously named Credito Italiano. Its chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, is expanding the company, trimming costs and making it "very shareholder-friendly," Mr. Moss said.
He said earnings were likely to compound at more than 20 percent a year, and that the share price, 9,597 lire on Friday, could double by 2001. He started buying the stock last year at 3,400 lire.
Another big position in southern Europe, at about 5 percent of the fund's assets, is Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone company, which has about 85 percent of the conventional, fixed-line business in Spain and 71 percent of the cellular market. Telefonica also has major stakes in phone companies in Latin America, where stock prices tumbled recently. But Mr. Moss said the growth potential of the Latin American telephone industry made those holdings a good long-term asset. He first bought Telefonica shares in 1994 at about 2,400 pesetas; they closed on Friday at 6,930 pesetas. He predicts earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next four to five years and said share prices would tend to rise at the same rate.
One of International Growth's newest holdings is Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical company, which Mr. Moss began buying at about 780 francs a share in late September. Last week, it closed at 1,049 francs. Sanofi has two new cardiovascular drugs -- Plavix, a blood thinner, and Avapro, which treats high blood pressure -- that it is marketing worldwide with Bristol-Myers Squibb. "The sales have literally exploded," Mr. Moss said. He forecasts earnings growth of up to 25 percent annually for the next five years.

HEADLINE: The Wall Street Recruiting Bowl

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
JOSHUA COHEN, a senior at the University of Michigan, has a dozen folders in his file cabinet that are crammed with financial reports and news clippings about companies he is pursuing for a job. He bought a cellular phone so he would be available to recruiters 24 hours a day.
Mr. Cohen, an English major who has already had internships at Salomon Smith Barney and Bear Stearns, said job hunting was "like taking an extra class," but it might well add up to even more than that. Companies are on campus nearly every day, and Mr. Cohen sometimes spends several hours with a recruiter; once, he skipped a class for one such meeting. 
 With only six months until graduation, the class of '99 is prepping for entry into the real world. While many seniors will not begin job-hunting until next semester, a growing band of students seeking jobs on Wall Street and in consulting have already begun a recruiting game that just keeps getting more competitive.
A year ago, with the markets roaring, the appetite for new blood was huge. As students scrambled to win entry-level jobs at top companies, companies were racing to snare the top students. The cream of the class emerged with multiple offers and five-figure bonuses for jobs that typically encompass the grunt work of basic research and support.
But now, with the markets' tumultuous summer and fall bringing cutbacks on Wall Street, the competition among the students has heated up. To land jobs, the class of '99 is leaving no angle unexamined.
"I really think I should put it on bond as opposed to linen," a senior at Cornell University said recently to her two roommates. It was almost 1 A.M. the night before a campus job fair, and she was talking earnestly about her resume. "I read that you don't want to stand out, so linen paper is definitely out," she said anxiously, declining to be identified for fear that her comments might affect her chances of landing a certain consulting job. "And I have to print it on white paper, not cream."
For students, the angst is heavy with deja vu. Just four short years after agonizing over S.A.T.'s and college applications, they are again polishing cover letters -- still in some cases ghost-written by parents, and now almost always edited by professors and career counselors.
Glorified descriptions of internships and extracurricular activities may pepper the resumes -- laser-printed, of course, on fancy paper. Calls go out to family members and friends in search of a "connection." Even those S.A.T. scores cannot be forgotten: some consulting firms ask for them, along with college transcripts.
While graduating seniors have long faced this trying process, by many accounts the intensity of the job hunt has stepped up recently. "The last couple of years has really stretched rational thinking," said David L. Reed, director of global recruiting at Andersen Consulting in Chicago.
Though this is clearly a buyers' market, top employers have not eased up. Partly, no doubt, this is because they still want the best people, even if there are fewer jobs to fill. But, perhaps too, the recruiting frenzy has taken on a life of its own.
So with some Wall Street firms offering starting salaries in excess of $50,000 for undergraduates with nothing more than a B.A., the competition -- on both sides -- can reach fever pitch. "A lot of employers really ratcheted up starting salaries, and bonuses have become much more prevalent," Mr. Reed said.
The pressure has created a new breed of ultra-informed, sometimes overzealous students who come to the recruiting process with broad knowledge -- and sometimes experience -- in a given industry.
"They are just so much more sophisticated," said Peter D. Kiernan 3d, a partner on the recruiting committee at Goldman, Sachs. "If I were to look at the students today compared with the students even two years ago or five years ago, their state of awareness of investment banking or sales and trading is dramatically higher."
And the process starts earlier. Some students begin jockeying for interviews as juniors or even sophomores, vying for internships that might help them clinch a full-time, permanent job later.
Valentina Chamorro, a senior at Harvard, had an internship last summer at J. P. Morgan, which has already offered her a post-graduation job. "I wanted to get a feel for what you do day to day," said Ms. Chamorro, a government major. "The people at J. P. Morgan were amazing and really took their time to teach me about banking and how to do research and how to be analytical."
Mr. Cohen's internships have not landed him a job yet, but he still says he has the best chance at companies that already know him. "They know my work ethic," he said.
Internships have become especially important for students who are not finance or economics majors. "As an English major, having Bear Stearns on the top of my resume has definitely helped," Mr. Cohen said.
Even a path not taken can be a plus. Mr. Cohen was offered an internship with BT Alex. Brown last summer. He rejected it to go to Bear Stearns, but the offer alone helped him go directly to the final interview round at Alex. Brown this fall.
 
An Ephemeral Prize
Ms. Chamorro, with a job offer in hand, is one of the lucky few. Come spring, as most students well know, the pickings will be slim.
"No question, we will be seeing some real cutbacks in hiring," said Steve Pollack, co-founder of Wet Feet Press, a San Francisco company that tracks the recruiting process. But he hesitated to say that the cuts would be deep. "Despite the fact that a lot of these banks are announcing big layoffs, they still need these pools of talent to come in." And new graduates, he added, "are still relatively cheap labor."
Mr. Cohen, who was not called back to a second round of interviews with Bain & Company and Andersen Consulting, said he had already expanded his job hunt to include commercial banks. "I guess you could call that hitting the panic button," he said.
"If I got an offer today, even if it's not my top choice," he added, "I'd consider taking the job, just to have something in the bank."
Students seek out careers in investment banking or management consulting because in many ways it is the quintessential transitional job. Most enter the field as analysts and stay only two to three years, after which many pursue an M.B.A. or change careers.
"In many situations, the M.B.A. is the ticket for admission," Mr. Reed said.
After graduate school, it is common for them to return to their original employer, which might well have paid their business school tuitions. Yet most companies are keen to stress that while they are great places to start out, the chances are slim that a new hire will stay even five years. McKinsey & Company, widely regarded as one of the most successful campus recruiters, tells students that only 25 percent of those hired in 1996 still worked for the company in 1998.
 
The Three-Act Ritual
In the last decade, campus recruiting has changed dramatically. Most Wall Street firms used to stop only at a few Ivy League schools -- perpetuating, some recruiters now say, the idea of an old-boy network. But when demand surged, Wall Street cast its nets much wider.
"That's good news, because at any school you hit diminishing returns," Mr. Kiernan said. "But it means that firms have to involve more people and go to more schools and spend more time -- and frankly, it's more competitive."
Campus recruiting today is often a three-act ritual: a career fair, followed by information sessions and the infamous interview process.
The career fair, traditionally early in the school year, keeps creeping closer to the first week of classes. These convention-style events -- "live meat markets," one PricewaterhouseCoopers recruiter called them -- usually last a day or two, and are held in athletic field houses, with hundreds of companies erecting fancy booths. Joining Wall Street firms might be recruiters from consumer products companies like Procter & Gamble and S. C. Johnson or technology giants like Microsoft, Intel and Motorola.
In addition to chatting up prospective employees, almost every company gives away hundreds of logo-adorned goodies. T-shirts and pens used to be the hot items, but this year, possibly in a commentary on the times, everyone has been giving away stress balls -- those squishy, rubbery things you squeeze to relieve tension.
Stress balls may not be enough. "I feel like I'm selling my soul for the next 20 years to the most interesting offer I get," Tamara C. Nedjar, a Cornell senior, said as she left one of the hundreds of booths at this year's fair.
More and more students flock to these events in business attire, resumes in hand, hoping to pose some memorable question to a recruiter. An exceptional comment -- particularly to a partner -- can get a student "fast tracked" through an otherwise cumbersome process. At day's end, some big firms make "on-campus callbacks" -- sometimes by E-mail -- setting up interviews or arranging an informal lunch.
Most efforts to be noticed, though, are futile. Recruiters are generally low-level people, often recent hires or alumni of the host school. Their job is to sell the company to the students, not vice versa. Many recruiters who have worked the fairs say they can do little to help any specific student.
The fairs give rise to some disorienting transformations. "I ran into two friends wearing suits the other day," said Daniel Richenthal, a senior economics major at Amherst College. "It's sort of like, wait a second, it seems like yesterday I was living in the same hallway with you and we were up at 3 in the morning playing music way too loud and acting stupid. All of a sudden you're wearing a suit, holding this leather legal pad on the way to an interview. It's all very surreal."
 
The Simulations
Several weeks after a fair, most companies return to campus to put on a dog-and-pony show called an "information session." These can run several hours, and they almost always include a promotional video with the requisite images of Wall Street signs and spaceships rocketing off into the clouds.
"If you've been to one, you've been to them all," Mr. Cohen said.
Some companies, though, are trying hip, more stylized videos. This year, Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, produced a short video called "Road Show Rules," a parody of MTV's "Road Rules" program, replete with rock-and-roll background music. The 15-minute video follows a couple of analysts documentary style through an initial public offering.
Not everyone is impressed. "Is the video portraying what you're going to be really doing?" Mr. Richenthal asked. "If you get the job, you are going to be at the bottom of the totem pole. I don't know if a video with fast music and smiling people walking around the globe is going to be you when you are sitting in your cubicle."
When Goldman, Sachs came to Cornell last month for its information session, it brought almost 50 employees to answer questions from a packed room of young people dressed in their most conservative garb.
"They tell us, 'We want you,' " Mr. Richenthal said. "But if you look around the room there are 100 other people just like you -- and they can't want all of you."
Some information sessions migrate to a local bar, where the alcohol flows freely and the tab is picked up by the company.
Then comes the dreaded interview process -- if a student is picked. "The resume is the most important aspect in terms of getting in the door," said Mariam Naficy, author of "The Fast Track" (Broadway Books, 1997), an insider's account of how to land a job at an investment bank or consulting firm. Ms. Naficy, who just received an M.B.A. from Stanford Business School, previously worked as an analyst at Goldman, Sachs and as a consultant at Gemini Management Consulting. "After you get invited to an interview," she said, "your personality and what you say will dramatically impact the decision."
 
Ticking Time Bombs
There are normally three rounds of interviews -- elimination-style. The first is usually a basic, get-to-know-you conversation. But some interviewers ask tough questions from the outset.
"I walked into the interview, and before the guy even says, 'Hi, how are you doing?' he asks me, 'What's the sum of 1 through 100 consecutively,' " said a student who recently interviewed with Goldman, Sachs. "After pausing for a while, I said: 'I don't know. Like five or six thousand?' The guy looks at me like so not amused and he goes, 'No, there is a real answer for it.' " (In case you're asked, it's 5,050.)
Recruiters say hard questions are asked early because of a need to winnow candidate lists quickly and find the stars. The problem, some say, is that the same students end up interviewing with every company.
"At a small school, you end up with 5 to 10 people who are at every interview -- every second round, every third round -- and to some degree it can be true at the larger schools like Harvard, Yale and Stanford," Ms. Naficy said.
As a competitive tactic, some companies have begun to make "exploding offers." Like ticking time bombs, these job offers expire at a certain time if not accepted. Many recruiters liken this to the trend by universities to admit more students through binding early-decision admissions.
Ms. Chamorro's offer from J. P. Morgan, in fact, "explodes" tomorrow, and last week she was leaning toward accepting it. "Obviously there is some pressure," she said. "It's made the semester a little busier than I expected, because I obviously don't want to make a decision without looking into all my options." Ms. Chamorro has been exploring the consulting field, but said she planned to take the offer if she opts for investment banking. "I'm the kind of person who goes to every store when I go shopping before I buy anything," she added.
Even some internship offers "explode," like Mr. Cohen's last spring from Bear Stearns, which he had to accept or reject within days. "Some internships are harder to get than real jobs," he said.
While some recruiters see exploding offers as a necessary evil, others say they put undue pressure on the student. "It is coercive," Mr. Kiernan of Goldman, Sachs said. "I tell students: 'Don't let these employers bully you. You are a legitimate person, and if someone puts an exploding offer on you, in my judgment, it questions your legitimacy.' "
By the second round of interviews, the questions typically move from personal histories to a student's reasoning and logic. Investment banks often ask brain teasers, while management consulting firms tend to pose questions about situations that might be encountered on the job. Recruiters say they are interested in the thought process, not necessarily in whether the answer is correct.
"The case interviews definitely prepare you for the bizarre," Mr. Cohen said.
 
Courted at Last
If students make it through two rounds, they are invited to company headquarters. For those who make it that far, most recruiters agree, the chances are good that a job offer is in the cards. These interviews often turn into all-expenses-paid weekend parties, as companies woo students by putting them up in fancy hotels and taking them to expensive restaurants.
Recently Credit Suisse First Boston flew some 50 seniors to New York City for the weekend. The first night, they were treated to dinner at TriBeCa Grill, then whisked by limousine to Lemon, a trendy bar and restaurant, for drinks.
The second day is usually filled with intensive interviews and office tours. "It is very seductive," Ms. Naficy said. "It has a major influence on people who are right out of college and are interested in experiencing the real world."
Some students take full advantage of the opportunity. "I realized pretty quick you can pretty much expense completely ridiculous amounts," said a 1998 Ivy League graduate now employed at Andersen Consulting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Every single meal you should really make it your goal to eat at the most expensive restaurant you possibly can and order the most expensive thing on the menu. They will never question you." He said he even got one company he had no interest in working for to give him a free flight home for the holidays.
That is surely not the norm, but it does show how savvy some students are in job shopping. Still, what has undeniably not changed in the last decade is the ultimate credential.
"The one common denominator is, somewhere along the line these individuals cared deeply about something other than good grades," Mr. Kiernan said. "It could be ballet, the debating team or algebra team. If someone cares intensely about pursuing excellence, we think there is a predictability about their ability to transfer that sense of intensity and sense of purpose to their career."
He added: "It's about really caring deeply about something other than just the A+."
 
So What's an Analyst, Anyway?
When a fresh college graduate lands a job at an investment bank or a consulting firm, the drying ink on the business cards usually says "analyst." It's a bit cryptic, but it sounds better than "cannon fodder."
In this context, analysts are support workers for senior-level staff. They do research legwork, draft reports, create and update spreadsheets, assemble presentations and gather information from clients. At consulting firms, analysts are often traveling, spending up to four days a week visiting clients. At investment banks, analysts tend to burn the midnight oil in the home office instead.
Analyst positions in both industries are intended to last only for two or three years. After that, a small number of analysts are promoted directly to more senior posts. The rest go back to school for an M.B.A. or find another career path, while their desks, laptops and phone extensions are recycled to a new analyst crop.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Job fairs, like this one last month at Harvard University, typically kick off a three-act ritual of campus recruiting. Such fairs, traditionally held early in the school year, keep creeping closer to the first week of classes -- a sign of the increased intensity of the hunt for a post-college job. Most companies give away hundreds of tchotchkes at the on-campus career fairs. This year's goodies include a piece of the rock, a Slinky (from Citibank) and the ubiquitous stress ball. (Photographs by Evan Richman for The New York Times)(pg. 10); PUNTING SITUATION -- Joshua Cohen, a senior English major at the University of Michigan, said, "If I got an offer today, even if it's not my top choice, I would consider taking the job, just to have something in the bank." (Peter Yates for The New York Times); SUITING UP -- Daniel Richenthal, a senior economics major at Amherst College, said: "All of a sudden you're wearing a suit, holding this leather legal pad on the way to an interview. It's all very surreal." (Jon Crispin for The New York Times); TOUCHDOWN -- Valentina Chamorro, a senior government major at Harvard, had a summer internship at J. P.

Chart: "The Job Picture This Year"
Recent volatitility in financial markets has inserted doubt in many companies' staffing plans. But the big banks, brokerage firms and consultancies still plan to add many new college graduates to their analyst ranks next spring. Here are highlights of hiring plans and the usual employment terms at selected financial services and consulting companies. Chart lists expected number of new college graduates hired, 1998-99, estimated starting salary, signing bonus and allowance, year-end bonus, whether or not graduate business school tuition is reimbursed and number of core campuses for recruitment, for financial services and management consulting firms.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
When Big Fish Eat Little Fish

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue. Even before that combination came to light, deal-making was fast and furious. On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent.
Driving the resurgence in mergers is a roaring stock market, the recognition by major corporations that it is getting harder to increase revenues internally and growing confidence among market players that the economy will not plunge into a recession next year. There are also industry-specific issues, like low crude-oil prices that are driving oil giants into one another's arms. 
 But for investors, mega-marriages are not where the real money is to be made. Rather, it is among smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with stocks that again are near their peaks.
If Exxon buys Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more than $140 billion -- off from April's peak of $244 billion but three times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling.
Which industries are likely to witness the most mergers? Tom Burnett, director of Merger Insight, an institutional investment advisory firm in New York, says more deals are a certainty in the energy sector. Mr. Burnett also says health care executives are finding it tougher than ever to lift earnings.
But don't expect to get rich waiting for industry leaders to buy each other. Charles LaLoggia, editor of the Special Situation Investor newsletter in Potomac, Md., said: "Some of the premiums in high-profile mergers aren't so great anymore. The values are in small-cap stocks." Another reason is that deals involving smaller-cap candidates are less likely to incur the wrath of antitrust regulators.
Mr. LaLoggia reckons that the odds of picking takeover winners increase if an investor focuses on companies already partially owned by another. In the energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by Keyspan Energy.
He also believes more deals are imminent among drug chains and supermarkets. Longs Drug Stores and Drug Emporium, he says, remain acquisition candidates, though neither is controlled by another concern.
In supermarkets, Mr. LaLoggia likes the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, 55 percent owned by Tengelmann Group of Germany. Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores that is 55 percent owned by the United States subsidiary of Groupe Casino, France's largest supermarket chain. "Both A.& P. and Smart and Final are trading at just about book value," Mr. LaLoggia said. Takeovers typically occur above book value.
Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading near $39, close to its low for the year. The company has $30 a share in cash on its balance sheet, no debt and a dividend yield of 5 percent. After last month's announced acquisition of Rubbermaid by the Newell Company, Mr. LaLoggia thinks National Presto could find itself in an acquirer's cross-hairs.

HEADLINE: The World: Beyond the Gaza Airport;
Running the Economy Without a Country

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
WHEN their gleaming new international airport opened in the Gaza Strip last week, Palestinians saw it as one more step toward the national statehood their leaders have been promising.
But the opening tomorrow morning in Washington of an American-sponsored gathering of international aid donors to the Palestinians is a reminder of how far they have to go before assuming real control over their affairs -- and of the peculiar challenges of running a non-state state that hovers limbo-like between dependence and independence. 
 The Palestinian National Authority, midwifed into existence five years ago by the Oslo peace negotiators, has effective internal jurisdiction over an expanding territory. It polices streets, patrols borders, runs schools and hospitals, manages ministries of trade and finance and foreign affairs. But it isn't in charge of its own destiny -- or finances.
The very fact of a "donor's conference" hosted by a foreign government highlights the limits of the Authority's authority. A poor country in need of aid would directly petition multilateral lenders and friendly governments, as hurricane-ravaged Honduras is now doing. But the Palestinian National Authority has no independent standing in the multilateral agencies, and no formal diplomatic relations with major Western aid donors. And it has few immediate prospects of commercial funding.
Convened by the Clinton Administration, Monday's meeting is intended to secure firm pledges of multibillion-dollar support for the Palestinian National Authority over the next three to five years. After Oslo, it was assumed that by 1999 the Palestinians would achieve something close to full sovereignty, and foreign assistance promised in late 1993 for an envisioned five-year transition is now running out.
But now, under pressure from the United States, Palestinian leaders have backed away from their long-announced intention to proclaim statehood next May. And Israeli negotiators are talking about postponing any final Palestinian declaration of independence for several years more, as discussions continue on security issues, the repatriation of refugees, and the heatedly disputed "final status" of Jerusalem.
The status of the Palestinian National Authority, meanwhile, remains unchanged. Still subsumed economically within the state of Israel, it cannot print money, impose import duties, draw down loans from the International Monetary Fund, or float notes in the sovereign bond markets.
There are of course some advantages to international financial virginity. There is no vulnerable local currency for London traders to attack, no massive foreign debt to service, no I.M.F. budget overlord to placate. But this is the Middle East, the birthplace of the double-edged sword. And it is the era of trade, not aid, when the engines of world capitalism are expected to drive progress.
Unusually in the developing world, the Palestinians have no legacy of binge borrowing or debt defaults. This may sound like an unalloyed blessing, but that is not how things work in global financial markets.
IN virtually every tiny third-world capital there is a cluster of Western bankers doggedly seeking some sliver of profit, some credible investment opportunity, no matter how checkered the local financial history. But you don't find dealmakers from Morgan Guaranty hanging around the juice bars of Gaza City, or Ramallah. The Palestinian National Authority is not unlike a steadily employed, bill-paying consumer who has carefully avoided mortgages and Visa cards but suddenly needs a loan. To a banker, this is a non-person. Even for an incipient nation-state, having no credit history is worse than having a bad credit history. Making matters harder still, the Palestinians have no dollar reserves or other sovereign assets to act as collateral.
So for the moment the Palestinians have little choice but to go to Washington, kaffiyeh in hand, and hope for more aid. In the Monday conference the Clinton Administration is expected to increase American funding, perhaps doubling it to some $150 million yearly; the European Union nations -- by far the biggest donors -- have pledged a new multi-year package of $4 billion.
But even giving money away gets complicated when the recipient is not yet a government.
The European Investment Bank promised $300 million to the Palestinians five years ago, but has delivered not a penny, as it tries to find a way around its own requirements for repayment assurances from a sovereign borrower. The United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation pledged $125 million in credit guarantees to American business ventures in Gaza and the West Bank, but has provided a scant $6 million, in good part because there is no history of American corporate investment under a Palestinian regime.
Atypically of third world aid programs, most funding for Palestinian programs bypasses local authorities entirely and goes to projects managed by the donors themselves. The United Nations alone has 26 different agencies dispensing aid and running programs.
Though the Palestinians welcome the aid, they find its distribution suffocatingly paternalistic.
The quest for Palestinian self-determination is often portrayed as an issue of national pride, of rewards that are more psychic and symbolic than hard-headedly practical. But for Anis al-Qaq, the Palestinian National Authority deputy minister who oversees foreign assistance receipts, achieving something closer to national status is above all a managerial imperative.
"The United States and others should look at the Palestinian Authority as a state," he said, "so that they can leave us to cope with our deficits and our financial planning by ourselves."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Watch for Sale Prices in Retailers' Shares

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX 

 BODY:
FINDING the right present for your fussy Aunt Agatha may seem a lot easier this Christmas than finding the right retailer in which to invest.
First, the good news: This holiday season is expected to be the best in four years for retailers. An annual survey by Deloitte & Touche and the National Retail Federation said shoppers were expected to spend $173 billion, about 5.5 percent more than in the 1997 holiday season. And the Conference Board reported last week that consumer confidence rose in October for the first time in four months. 
 Moreover, while Amazon.com, Wal-Mart Stores and a few other retail stocks are trading near record highs, most have not recovered from the summer selloff, when investors thought shoppers might react negatively to world problems like Russia's default or Japan's banking crisis. "Everybody was worried about Asia," said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst at Paine Webber. Everybody but the consumer. "Main Street is quite far removed from Wall Street," he said.
But there are still concerns. People have not shaken off recent news of corporate layoffs. Consumers polled in the Deloitte survey said "everyday low prices" were the first thing that would lure them to a store; last year, that bait placed third.
Even if the economic expansion continues next year, it is risky to buy cyclical stocks, like those of many retailers, long into a period of extended economic growth. The trick, analysts say, is to find retailers likely to post good holiday sales. Then, an investor should look for the stocks that are cheap relative to their rivals. Finally, one should make sure the company has cash to weather a slowdown and management that knows the meaning of shareholder value.
Among the top picks of several analysts and money managers is Dayton Hudson, the parent of Target discount stores and Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores. It is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 and is cheaper than rivals like Wal-Mart and Costco, which have ratios of 41 and 31, respectively. Dayton Hudson's stock hit a one-year low of $26.13 in October, but closed at $44.25 on Friday.
"The Target division is doing beautifully," said George A. Mairs, manager of the Mairs & Power Growth fund, which owns some shares. "They have clearly tried to differentiate themselves from Kmart and Wal-Mart by having lines that are more upscale, and I think this has worked well." He said Dayton Hudson stock could hit $60 within a year.
Also expected to sparkle this season is the Zale Corporation, the big jewelry chain. Watches and earrings are always popular gifts, and Zale has a wide selection of inexpensive items. The company, based in Irving, Tex., has a P/E of 15. Its luxury competitor, Tiffany & Company, has a ratio of 20. Zale's shares have risen almost 50 percent from a low of $19.50 in October and are now at $28.75.
"They're very professionally run in a business not traditionally known for it," said Michael Exstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, who said he expects Zale to hit $35 within 12 months.
Investors worried about an economic slowdown may be happy to see that retail stock buybacks have become as fashionable this season as the color gray. Such a program is one reason Alan Snyder, head of Snyder Capital Management, owns Pier 1 Imports. The retailer, based in Fort Worth, sells more than 5,000 imported items. In September it announced a plan to repurchase five million shares, its second buyback program this year. The stock, now at $10.50, is way up from its low in October, but is still far below the $20.625 it reached on March 13. It has a P/E of 14, and Mr. Snyder expects the shares to hit $15 within a year.
"The companies we're buying can create their own upward momentum if the market doesn't recognize their value," he said.

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
TIMES are tough in the oil patch. Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing.
Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. Given the exotic locales of the most promising untapped fields, it seems unlikely that exploration will get cheaper. And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet that oil won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century -- something analysts were predicting during the oil price run-up of the early 1980's. 
 Philip K. Verleger Jr., publisher of Petroleum Economics Monthly and a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, spent some time late last week talking about Mobil, Exxon and the changing dynamics of the oil business.
Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. There is a lot of focus on the antitrust aspects of an Exxon-Mobil deal. Do you see any problems?
 
A. Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal. I think it is far from that. But if it were to happen, I don't see many problems.
BP Amoco is the perfect end-to-end merger, one in which there is little or no overlap with the company you are merging with. Exxon-Mobil comes close.
The first issue is competition in local markets. The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players there.
If there is a reason this merger might get extra attention, it will be because Exxon and Mobil have not been terribly friendly toward either the Clinton Administration's or the European Union's positions on global warming.
 
Q. Why are you skeptical about the deal?
 
A. Well, Mobil has been trying to get bigger. They had talks with Amoco. They wanted to buy Conoco.
But I don't understand where Lucio Noto, Mobil's chief executive, fits into this. That could be an impediment to an agreement, because in a merger I don't think he has a place, and he has been a very strong leader.
 
Q. Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon. Why do they need to get bigger?
 
A. In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. Companies of Mobil's size are probably marginal players.
 
Q. That suggests Mobil has been harder hit than Exxon by the downturn in prices.
 
A. From 1988 to 1996, Exxon's exploration and production expenditures rose 8 percent. Mobil's rose 14 percent. But Mobil's expenditures were much more sensitive to price elasticities of oil than Exxon's. They were pushing the envelope, and when prices fell they had to cut back. Exxon has tried to build a very large presence systematically, without paying much attention to month-to-month or even year-to-year fluctuations in oil prices. They are brutally efficient.
 
Q. Earlier this month the Energy Department said oil prices would stay soft for nearly a decade. Do you agree?
 
A. You know, every time I see forecasts that go out that far I want to go out and buy stock in oil companies. I think we are going to see low oil prices for six months to a year. It is conceivable we could go into the next century with oil at $5 a barrel, depending on what happens to the world economy.
During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non-OPEC countries. That will strengthen the hands of the OPEC countries. And when the Asian economies start growing again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 months.
 
Q. The number of oil companies is going to shrink in coming years, regardless, isn't it?
 
A. We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight. There is really no precedent for having as many big players as we have in the oil business in this modern society.
 
Q. Do you think oil stocks are a good investment?
 
A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 months. And it is an area where investors need to be careful, because in that period there will be a good deal of consolidation among smaller companies.

Squaring Off, at Last, On Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SINCE it was created in 1935, Social Security has been the centerpiece of the nation's social contract, an intergenerational commitment to provide at least a subsistence income to the most vulnerable of citizens.
The commitment appears as solid as ever. But with Social Security facing long-term financial problems, the means of making good on it are now under serious debate for the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed what would become the most enduring of New Deal legacies. 
 Ten months after President Clinton said that shoring up the system should become the nation's top domestic priority, he and Congressional leaders will begin examining the options in earnest and probing for common ground at a two-day White House conference next month, kicking off a process that could as easily end in partisan gridlock as in the historic achievement both parties are hoping for.
Should the country stick with the system it has used for 63 years and continue to levy taxes on current workers and their employers to pay current retirees? Or, as the time draws near for the vast baby boom generation to move onto Social Security, should the nation shift to a system under which individuals would invest a portion of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts.
It is an issue that turns to some extent on the complexities of actuarial tables, benefit formulas and other arcana. But in a broader sense it encapsulates fundamental tradeoffs: between individual and collective responsibility, market forces and government, and maximizing rewards and minimizing risks. Indeed, few issues have such a rich ideological backdrop or high political stakes, a fact that promises to make the debate over Social Security's future particularly contentious.
The problem is rooted in inexorable demographic change. Because there will be fewer workers paying taxes relative to the number of retirees drawing benefits once the 76 million baby boomers leave the workforce in coming decades, Social Security will take in only enough revenue to pay 75 percent of its obligations starting around 2032.
Efforts to reach a solution are being framed in part by how the world has changed since 1935. Life expectancy is shooting up, so most people will spend far longer in retirement than anyone envisioned six decades ago. Investing, long the province of the elite, is now a routine part of middle-class life. Faith in market-based capitalism, which probably hit a nadir around the time of Social Security's creation, has long been on the rise, tested though it has been by the recent bout of global financial turmoil. At the same time, trust that government can deal with the big issues has eroded since Vietnam and Watergate.
To conservatives, such changes are a call to put more responsibility in the hands of individuals and an opportunity to put the power of the markets to work for everyone through private Social Security accounts. If in the process the country scales back the biggest of all Government social programs, so much the better.
"It's one of the reasons the debate has been so fierce," said Michael Tanner, the director of health and welfare studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "There's a recognition, particularly on the part of the left, that Social Security and Medicare are the last programmatic links between the average citizen and the government."
To liberals, though, the changes that have taken place do not undermine the case for a collective approach to income security for the elderly and other beneficiaries of Social Security, including disabled workers and those left behind when a breadwinner dies.
Most individuals, said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, do not do a very good job of planning for distant or unlikely events like retirement or disability. Moreover, he said, since many people are already exposed to the risks of big stock market swings through 401(k) programs and Individual Retirement Accounts, there is good reason to maintain Social Security as a guaranteed benefit in which any investment or economic risks -- as well as administrative costs -- are spread across the generations and income levels. The wild gyrations in the stock market this year underscore the point.
"The reasons that led the nation to adopt social insurance are about as strong now as they ever were," Mr. Aaron said.
THERE is some common ground. Many, though not all, Democrats support looking to the returns available on Wall Street to help plug the hole, just as Republicans do. But rather than resort to the wholesale shift into private accounts advocated by Republicans, many Democrats want the investing to be done by the Government itself, using the surplus that will build up for the next 15 years as payroll tax receipts exceed what the system pays out in benefits.
Indeed, nearly every facet of any plan is likely to have as many opponents as supporters. Increasing the retirement age to, say, 70, would go a long way toward restoring the system's health, but is vehemently opposed by organized labor. Eliminating or substantially raising the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax -- currently $68,400 -- would solve much of the problem, but would amount to a big tax increase on middle-and upper-income people.
So it remains unclear whether it will be politically feasible to piece together a compromise.
"There is a growing understanding that this is a big issue out there," said Kenneth Apfel, the Social Security Commissioner, "but I must say I have yet to see any kind of consensus emerge."
Success will depend to some extent on political calculations by both parties. Congressional Democrats will have to decide whether to compromise now or delay in the hope that they might regain control of the House in 2000.
Republicans will have to decide whether to make a deal so they can turn attention to what they see as a more potent issue, tax cuts. And Mr. Clinton, more eager than ever after his travails this year to leave a positive legacy, will have to decide whether to take a bold stand or work behind the scenes to cobble together a one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B solution.
With more than three decades to go before the problem hits, there would not appear to be much urgency. But economists say that every year that goes by will make any solution more expensive to taxpayers and beneficiaries alike. Perhaps more important, the political and economic climate is as favorable now as it is likely to be for years: a second-term President who does not have to worry about re-election, a big Federal budget surplus and a baby boom generation that has a stake in keeping the system healthy for another half century.
"We need to reach a consensus on needed changes," said Michael J. Boskin, who was the Bush Administration's chief economist, "adopt them now and phase them in gradually before the demographic transition overwhelms us economically and politically."

HEADLINE: After You. No, After You. Ouch!

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
TWO men approach each other on a street. They quickly realize they are on a collision course. The first man, reading the body language of the second, steps to the right, then sees that the second man, attempting the same maneuver but responding a split second too late, has made the same move. The first man tacks the other way, but the second man has beat him to it. In an exquisite choreography of misinterpretation, the two men run right into each other on an empty sidewalk.
A Freudian would have no trouble interpreting the event. The two men, although they thought they were trying to avoid each other, were driven into each other arms by a subconscious sexual attraction. Non-Freudians, however, would recognize the workings of an iron law governing human affairs. 
 The law has no name. It could be called the Uncertainty Principle, if Heisenberg did not own the trademark. But it needs no name to hold sway. Wherever a plan is hatched based on rational expectations of other people's expectations, it rears its head, decreeing that the very result that the plan is designed to prevent will in fact come to pass, quickly and inevitably. Put more scientifically, expectation of an expectation alters the expected expectation, or:
 E1 + E2 = Implosion of expectation
 causing an implosion and serious injury to the expectant party. Call it the Petard Principle.
The Petard Principle has been in effect lately. Most recently, it put the whammy on the Federal Reserve. The Fed, making a rational assessment, judged that a possible slowdown in the economy could be averted with a half-point cut in interest rates. Shrewder voices at the Fed then attempted to ward off the evil work of the Petard Principle. A half-point cut, they argued, would send the message that the Fed was deeply concerned about an economic slowdown, causing conditions in the financial markets to deteriorate. The Fed settled on a quarter-point cut. Markets deteriorated, forcing the Fed to announce a second quarter-point cut on Oct. 15, and a third cut on Nov. 17. Trying to anticipate the Petard effect, the Fed faked itself out.
The Petard Principle is not an economic law. Its ambitions go far beyond that. Consider the release of Bill Clinton's videotaped testimony before the grand jury charged with looking into the Monica S. Lewinsky matter. It was generally considered to be a dead certainty that once the American people got a look at Mr. Clinton on the stand, he would be finished. His behavior was advertised by unnamed insiders as being "un-Presidential," or worse. Television viewers expected to see a performance comparable to one of Charles Manson's appearances before the California parole board. They didn't (although Mr. Clinton's eyes did begin spinning in their sockets when the word "cigar" came up). Skewed expectations produced a skewed result.
It was the Petard Principle at work again, with an interesting twist. Who skewed the expectations? Credulous observers might assume that it was the President's enemies who spread the word that a career-ending performance was in store. Students of the Petard Principle know that savvy Presidential advisers would have been working double overtime to broadcast the message that Mr. Clinton's most shameful hour was at hand, thereby leveraging defeat into victory. O.K., not victory, but at this late date, Mr. Clinton and his supporters will settle for low-grade embarrassment.
Political analysts have sliced, diced and minced the results of the Minnesota gubernatorial campaign, desperately trying to explain how it is that one of the most enlightened and well-educated body of citizens in the United States decided that a professional wrestler with a shaved head should manage their affairs. It was the Petard Principle. Every voting Minnesotan entered the booth convinced that Jesse Ventura was a fringe candidate, and every vote cast for Mr. Ventura was done in that what-the-heck spirit that keeps so many Vegas wedding chapels busy. Every Ventura voter pulled the lever fully confident that no more than a handful of his or her fellow Minnesotans were doing the same. Surprise!
Hollywood, too, wrestles constantly with the powerful but sneaky influence of the Petard Principle. Until this summer, the wise guys thought they had it beat. Studying audience behavior, the studio marketers saw that the mere expectation of a film's success could help insure success. By marketing a film as though it were destined to gross $80 million its first weekend, they could make audiences believe that a film was already a hit, and that they had better move fast and get it while it was hot.
Like a smart virus, the Petard Principle adjusted. The summer of 1998 will be remembered as the season when the blockbusters flopped. Nothing could have been bigger than "Godzilla," either the film itself, about a beast with a foot bigger than Donald Trump's hat size, or its advertising campaign.
Even so, audiences ran to "Something About Mary," a film that canny studio marketers recognized as having megahit potential -- it has taken in more than $170 million at the box office so far -- but chose to advertise almost as though it were a quirky independent film. Faked out by an underplayed ad campaign, filmgoers nourished the illusion that buying a ticket to the film made them part of a small, independent-minded community making a creative choice.
Sort of like those Minnesota voters.

Would It Still Make Sense To Pay Him With Wine?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
It might seem irrational, what with the ignominy suffered by two famous economic professors who put their Nobel-winning knowledge to work trying to make billions at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that nearly collapsed in September. But that is not stopping Richard H. Thaler, a University of Chicago economics professor, from forming a money-management firm with his friend Russell J. Fuller.
Both are proponents of behavioral economics -- an approach that recognizes that human behavior patterns play a major role in markets and the economy. Both men believe that money can be made in stocks precisely because investors often act irrationally. "The whole coherent explanation for value investing is a behavioral one," Mr. Thaler said. For example, he says, many investors underestimate a company's future earnings because they focus on lower past earnings -- a trait he calls anchoring. 
 Mr. Thaler was on the board of Mr. Fuller's RJF Asset Management in San Mateo, Calif., which manages $365 million, and received cases of wine in payment for his advice. The new company will be named Fuller & Thaler Asset Management. Its slogan: "The Behavioral Edge."

Data Offer No Hint Yet Of a Slowing Economy

 BODY:
Soak it, sleep in it, leave it out in a storm: Nothing seems to shrink or even much wrinkle the American economy.
The gross domestic product posted a healthy 3.9 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter, confounding widespread warnings that the continuing economic crisis in Asia and Russia and the resulting turmoil in financial markets would slow down the economy. Durable-goods orders slipped 1.7 percent in October, more than expected, but consumer confidence rose sharply in the November survey, personal income and spending both posted the expected modest gains in October, and existing-home sales were strong. 
 Economists continue to warn that the stream of positive indicators could dry up any time; many still tentatively forecast a slowdown sometime in 1999.
The view through the crystal ball at the holiday shopping season is none too clear, either: On Wednesday, a news report headlined "Poll: One-Quarter of Americans Plan to Cut Holiday Spending" was transmitted on Associated Press news wires within two minutes of an article sent by AP's rival, Reuters, entitled "Buoyant U.S. Consumers Set to Shop Heartily."

HEADLINE: Heart Disease Deaths More Common in Appalachia, Study Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Residents of Appalachia, one of the poorest areas of the country, are more likely to die from heart disease than people living elsewhere, a new study by researchers at West Virginia University has found.
The authors of the 100-page report, "Heart Disease in Appalachia: An Atlas of County Economic Conditions, Mortality and Medical Care Resources," say that a lack of medical facilities throughout the region and a lack of emphasis on good nutrition and exercise contribute to a higher level of heart problems in Appalachia. 
 Elizabeth Barnett, an assistant professor at the West Virginia University school of medicine who led the study group, said researchers found that white Appalachia residents between ages 35 and 64 had a 15 percent to 20 percent greater chance of dying from heart disease than white Americans living elsewhere. Researchers also found that although heart disease deaths declined nationally and in Appalachia, they declined less in Appalachia.
The study found that heart disease death rates among black Appalachia residents, who tend to live in urban areas, especially in Alabama and Mississippi, were closer to national averages.
Ms. Barnett also said that because of Appalachia's poor economic conditions, the sparsely populated communities common to the area are less likely to provide residents recreational facilities and more healthful foods that are routinely available in more densely populated areas.
Ms. Barnett described the report as "a resource to be used to implement programs and policies to prevent heart disease."
"By identifying how the area counties in the area compare to each other, we hope it will be useful to policy makers," she said.
Appalachia sweeps southwest from western New York State deep into the South, to include 399 counties in 13 states. It has historically reflected problems of the rural poor, especially those whose livelihoods come from small family farms and coal mining.
Only in recent years has the region begun to diversify, with many states seeking new industries, like timber, tourism, technology and automobile parts plants.
But many bad physical and nutritional habits persist, leading to coronary disease and death.
Ms. Barnett, who has taught at the university for three years, said the researchers tracked trends in heart disease and cardiac-related deaths from 1980 through 1993.
She said they discovered the highest mortality rates in middle Appalachia -- central West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia and northern Tennessee -- a region where coal once ruled but that now suffers from high unemployment, low income and limited availability of medical care.
The research also found that the region lacked resources to aid people who have experienced heart disease and would benefit from exercise and nutritional programs and stress management classes.
"A majority of counties in Appalachia do not have cardiac rehabilitation units or coronary care units," Ms. Barnett said. "Half of all initial heart attacks are fatal, so for those who survive, they still have a high risk for a second one."
The report is scheduled to be published on Monday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bolsters Housing Aid For the Elderly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President Clinton today highlighted two new housing programs that will provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or disabled.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton said that the money would benefit 29,400 people living in 48 states, and the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Montana and North Dakota, sparsely populated states, are the only two that are not slated to receive any of the money. 
 "For millions of struggling senior citizens and people with disabilities, the peace and security of a decent home is a distant dream and the threat of homelessness an ever-present nightmare," Mr. Clinton said, discussing the programs, which are included in the new budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "Too many of these hard-pressed Americans are warehoused in sterile nursing homes -- not because they need to be, but because they can't afford to live anywhere else."
He added: "Americans should never have to choose between putting a meal on the table or putting a roof over their heads."
The Administration's $25 billion housing budget for the 1999 fiscal year was one of the few appropropriation requests that met with little opposition in the Republican-led Congress this year. It included $1.8 billion in new spending for vouchers, which reflected the first major increase in housing spending in four years and also the department's efforts to rid itself of wasteful programs and mismanagement that characterized it in the past.
The larger of the programs Mr. Clinton cited in his radio address generates $696 million in grants to nonprofit organizations around the country to build and rehabilitate 8,200 apartment units for older people and the disabled who fall below certain income levels.
The second program will provide an additional $126.8 million to be distributed among disabled people in the form of rent subsidies.
Administration officials predict that the new apartments will accommodate 12,400 people through projects managed by 166 private groups that competed for the grants. The money will cover development costs and does not have to be repaid so long as the new housing is available for 40 years to low-income elderly residents or people with disabilities.
More money is available to the project owner to cover differences between the rent and operating costs.
Those receiving the assistance must be classified as "very low income," which means that a household cannot earn more than 50 percent of the area's median income. On a national average, Administration officials say that amounts to less than $8,000 a year.
The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income.
"This is going to be a priority for the President," Andrew M. Cuomo, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said in an interview.
"We're all getting older, not only individually, but as a society, and the numbers are alarming," Mr. Cuomo said. "The graying of America is going to have significant impact on the nation's housing and will be one of the greatest challenges we face over the next 10 years."
Currently, the country has about 34 million citizens 65 or older, compared with about 3 million at the turn of the 20th century. Mr. Cuomo said that the figure is expected to reach 53 million within 25 years, putting additional strain on the need for affordable units.
As a result, Mr. Cuomo said, the department and the private organizations that are building new units are redesigning them with older and disabled people in mind, focusing on communal facilities for health and recreation.
Mr. Clinton said that despite the benefits most Americans are accruing through the prosperous economy, too many elderly and disabled people "are trapped in substandard housing, where broken plumbing, inadequate heat and hazardous hallways are a dangerous fact of life. And too many spend more than half of their modest incomes on housing, often sacrificing basic needs like food and medical care just to pay the rent."
Promoting the Administration's efforts, he added, "At this moment of unparalleled prosperity, we must not do less."

HEADLINE: UNREGULATED CASH FLOWS INTO HANDS OF P.A.C.'S FOR 2000

BYLINE: By JILL ABRAMSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is engaged in the first test of the 2000 Presidential campaign: proving his ability to raise money. Like other Democratic and Republican hopefuls, he will have to raise more money than ever, at least $22 million, and earlier than ever before.
Searching for creative ways to get donations much larger than those allowed by the strict limits of Federal election laws, Senator Kerrey and six other Presidential aspirants have turned to so-called soft money. To raise these large unrestricted contributions from wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions, they are exploiting the less-restrictive political donation regulations at the state level, establishing nonprofit organizations and setting up political action committees. 
 Soft money is bleeding into the Presidential campaign earlier than ever before and spreading among more potential candidates. And these controversial big donations are being solicited directly by the potential candidates for their own political committees, while in the past soft money was funneled through the national political parties.
The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, passed after Watergate to prohibit large, special interest contributions, limits donations to Presidential primary candidates to $1,000. But there are many legal ways for aspiring candidates to skirt that limit.
Mr. Kerrey's fund-raising device, for example, is a political action committee that is allowed to raise larger soft money contributions. Next month, many of Senator Kerrey's most generous financial backers plan to gather at Omaha's Boys Town, where his political action committee, Building America's Conscience and Kids P.A.C., is sponsoring an international economic conference. Most of them have already given to this committee, which has raised $1.2 million.
Among those expected to attend are Kerrey supporters like the Baltimore Orioles owner, Peter Angelos, and the Wall Street investor Barry Wigmore, who have each already donated $25,000 to the political action committee, established in June. They can give these larger sums because Senator Kerrey's committee is set up with both Federal and non-Federal accounts as allowed by law. The non-Federal account can accept unlimited contributions. In fact, the committee has raised almost $800,000 through its non-Federal account.
Without this soft money, it is unlikely that Senator Kerrey or other Presidential hopefuls considering the race could raise $50,000 a day between now and the selection of the first delegates in early 2000. This amount is necessary to reach the minimum of $22 million that several campaign experts estimate candidates would need to be competitive.
"It's a staggering sum," said Steve Jarding, the Senator's national political director. "But Bob believes he could raise the money if he ran."
Until now, the political parties have been the main fund-raising vehicles for these large donations. In 1996, soft money contributions to the Democratic National Committee became a source of controversy when millions of dollars from the party were used to pay for early advertising for the Clinton-Gore ticket.
Like Senator Kerrey, at least five Republican Presidential hopefuls have established state-level political committees. Ostensibly, these committees are meant to support local candidates. Senator Kerrey, for example, has used his to make campaign donations to local Democratic candidates, including $85,000 sent to New Hampshire, the site of the first Presidential primary. But the state committees are also being used by the aspirants to pay for big-ticket items, like travel, staff and even more fund-raising for their incipient national campaigns. And these committees are not the only devices the candidates are using to raise unlimited contributions.
The wealthy publisher Steve Forbes has also established a nonprofit organization, Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity, that is raising unrestricted contributions. Mr. Forbes, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996, himself gave $100,000 and the organization has raised more than $13 million from 140,000 donors, said Bill Dal Col, the group's president.
While Mr. Dal Col said the organization supported issues, not candidates, the issues championed by Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity are the ones Mr. Forbes embraced in 1996, including tax cuts and school choice.
Campaign finance experts say the big presence of soft money so early in the Presidential election season is further evidence of the erosion of the post-Watergate election law reforms.
Starting in 1988, the two political parties began gutting the Federal limits by soliciting soft money donations, which are unlimited but are supposed to be used only for generic party-building activities.
This year, both parties used soft money to pay for issue advertising in the Congressional elections. According to pre-election reports filed at the Federal Election Commission, soft money contributions to Republican Party committees grew 144 percent over the last midterm elections, while Democratic soft money totals increased 84 percent. Together, the two parties raked in $173 million in soft money. The commission is considering a proposal to ban soft money.
Today, soft money is already bleeding into the Presidential primary contests because the primaries are front-loaded in 2000, with many big states, including California and New York, expected to choose delegates before early March.
Terry McAuliffe, a leading Democratic fund-raiser, said the schedule of early primaries, including regional contests in the South, New England and the Rocky Mountain states, would have a profound effect on fund-raising in 2000. "The way this primary schedule has been designed there is no Presidential fund-raising strategy that allows you to raise money in 2000," he said in an interview. "It must all be raised in 1999."
Mr. McAuliffe said this would create a more closed contest because an outsider candidate would not have time to exploit a surprise win to raise money, as George Bush did in 1980 after winning the Iowa caucuses.
Money spent in this early stage by Presidential aspirants does not count against the spending limit set for Presidential primary candidates who accept Federal matching funds. In 1996, the amount was $37 million and is expected to be about $45 million in 2000. Once their candidacy is declared, Presidential contenders can no longer be affiliated with political action committees and must limit their contributions from individuals to $1,000. (Mr. Forbes did not accept matching funds in 1996 and spent $30 million of his own money. In 2000, if he runs, Mr. Dal Col said Mr. Forbes would not spend as much of his own money, but would not accept matching funds.)
Until they become declared candidates, Presidential aspirants can continue to solicit soft money for their state-level political action committees without worrying about complying with more rigid Federal rules. Most of these committees have been set up in states with the least restrictive election laws. Virginia, which permits unlimited contributions from both individuals and corporations, has been a popular site for political action committees connected to the 2000 Presidential aspirants.
"Virginia has become the Cayman Islands of Presidential fund-raising," said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group that tracks contributions. Five Republicans, former Vice President Dan Quayle, the conservative leader Gary Bauer, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the former Vice Presidential nominee Jack F. Kemp and Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri have political action committees in Virginia. Although the Republican leaders have used some of their Virginia money to back local candidates, most of it has not been spent in the Old Dominion.
Not all would-be 2000 candidates have state political action committees. Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, both have only Federal P.A.C.'s. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a Republican who is a potential candidate for President, has yet to establish such a committee. Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who has spurned political action committee money for most of his career, is considering setting up such a committee as he explores whether to run for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
The early front-runners, like the Vice President and the Texas Governor, may not need to use state committees. Both have national fund-raising networks and can raise money quickly. Mr. Gore has been a fund-raising star for the Democratic National Committee. Governor Bush will have easy access to wealthy Texas donors and his father's old money machine. Last summer, Mr. Bush raised more than $1 million in Washington for his re-election campaign at a fund-raising dinner organized by some of former President Bush's longtime supporters.
Senator Kerrey, who has headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the minority House leader, Richard A. Gephardt, also have national fund-raising networks, although theirs are not as formidable as Mr. Gore's.
On the Republican side, Mr. Alexander, who pioneered the use of state political action committees and soft money and made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination in 1996, has proven to be a prodigious early fund-raiser. Mr. Bauer has raised millions nationally through the mail. And Mr. Forbes is in a class of his own.
Both Mr. Alexander and Mr. Forbes have already spent large sums on advertisements in early primary states like New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: His Home's a Castle, With a Dragon of Sorts

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
BEDFORD, N.Y., Nov. 27
Darlington Castle was like a lover Donald A. Lehman thought he could change: He coveted it despite its obvious flaw.
The elegant turn-of-the-century stone mansion, with its long, winding drive, oak-paneled drawing rooms and view clear to the World Trade Center, seems to sit on the top of the earth. But the castle also has a working radio tower mounted on its roof and an iron-clad lease that insures it will remain there until 2006. 
 Mr. Lehman, who owns an alarm company, and his wife, Barbara, a retired chemistry teacher, bought Darlington Castle and more than 30 acres of hillside for $1.5 million in 1993, substantially less than similar houses in the area cost. In this town of old money, new celebrity and sprawling estates 40 miles north of midtown Manhattan, there were few other takers for a house with a 20-foot antenna that broadcasts 1,500 watts of "smooth jazz" 24 hours a day to northern Westchester.
"All I could think about was the house," said Mr. Lehman, who first visited it in 1983 when he tried to sell the previous owners an alarm from his company, Attack Cat Security. "It was my dream house. The minute I saw it, I said, 'I want this house.' "
Although the Lehmans knew what they were getting into, they now complain that Kenny G has become the soundtrack to their lives and that the station, WZZN at 106.3 FM, comes through on every channel on the radio dial, meddles with their television reception, interrupts their fax machine and interferes with their business equipment. Mr. Lehman attributes his headaches to microwave radiation from the tower and the couple say the tower is ill-maintained, causing their roof to leak and bathroom ceiling to collapse.
The station's owners see things differently. "His claims range from false to largely exaggerated," said Robert F. Davis, the lawyer for WZZN, which is owned by Westchester Radio L.L.C.
"Our client, to buy some peace, has made many offers to accommodate him," Mr. Davis said. The station has installed cable television in 5 of the house's 17 rooms and pays the bill for the service (about $100 a month). The station has given the Lehmans two interference-free radios, two digital answering machines and offered to pay half the cost of a new roof. The station is obligated to pay about $5,000 a year in rent. It has offered to increase the rent to $18,000, Mr. Davis said, and to install cable television in the three-bedroom pool house. "And by the way," Mr. Davis said, "he paid $1.5 million for a house that's probably worth 6 or 7 million."
Yet the Lehmans are determined to be rid of the antenna.
They have been arrested once for tampering with the transmitting equipment. They have paid a $12,000 settlement to the radio company and lost two court cases and an appeal to the Federal Communications Commission to get rid of the antenna. A State Supreme Court judge issued an injunction this summer to prevent them from touching the equipment. They have been through four sets of lawyers; the last ones resigned a few weeks ago, after the Lehmans let it be known that they planned to tear the antenna down.
"I'll represent myself," Mr. Lehman said. "I'm doing it my way. It's time to have a Boston Tea Party."
The battle seems to be just another chapter in their home's colorful history. Charles F. Darlington Jr., an economist and diplomat whose father built Darlington Castle in 1904, fell upon hard times in 1966. Neighbors say he lost all his money in a bad investment. To generate enough income to keep the drafty castle in the family, he sold property and granted a 40-year lease to Martin Stone for the tower.
Mr. Stone, who died in June, was the producer of "Howdy Doody" and a pioneer in community radio. A lawyer by training, he drafted a lease that has remained valid even though the castle has changed ownership twice and the radio station has changed ownership four times. "It was a lease that was so one-sided that no one but a desperate man would sign it," Mr. Lehman said.
It turned the house into a white elephant.
"A lot of buyers came to see it but nobody wanted that house," said Sally Siano, a real estate agent in Bedford Hills who remembered when the house went on the market in the early 1990's for more than $5 million. "Every client I ever brought there would not even consider living in it because of the electric fields and their concern for their health," she said.
Joy Schieffelin and her late husband, William Jay Schieffelin 3d, a wine and spirit importer, bought Darlington Castle in 1975. Like Mr. Lehman, Mr. Schieffelin was enamored with the castle and its views. All the static that came through their television, radios and stereo could not persuade Mr. Schieffelin to move, his wife said, though she was never comfortable there.
"The lease was absolutely tight," Mrs. Schieffelin said sadly. "There was nothing we could do about it. I don't know why we stayed there except my husband loved that castle."
Mrs. Schieffelin was friendly with Mr. Lehman, who regularly serviced her security alarm. She knew how much Mr. Lehman wanted the house and said that she warned him before he bought the property that the lease was unbreakable.
"He said, 'Don't worry, I'll get rid of that antenna,' " Mrs. Schieffelin recalled in a telephone conversation. "I said, 'No, you won't.' and he said, 'Oh yes, I will.' "

HEADLINE: In Albany, Quiet Clamor For a Raise

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
With the cheery distractions of the holiday season at hand and even the most dedicated lobbyists paying scant attention to the business of state government, what better time for New York State lawmakers to take up an issue that has long inflamed voters -- legislative pay raises.
So goes the thinking in Albany, where some members of the Legislature, crying something akin to poverty, plead with their leaders to convene an unusual end-of-year legislative session to push through their first raise in 10 years. 
 The 211 members of the Legislature are to return to the State Capitol early this week, ostensibly to elect leaders for the 1999 legislative session. But as long as they are in town, there is also the chance that they will take up the matter of increasing their pay from the current base of $57,500 a year.
"We have been told to be in Albany on Monday to re-elect our majority leader, but we were also told to be prepared to stay longer if necessary," said Nicholas A. Spano of Yonkers, a deputy majority leader in the Republican-controlled Senate. "We weren't given any specifics. But obviously the thing that is high on the minds of most legislators is a cost-of-living adjustment."
If state lawmakers decide to approve a pay raise for themselves -- possibly along with raises for judges, agency heads and senior aides to the Governor -- they would have to act swiftly. State law prohibits a sitting Legislature from giving itself a salary increase that takes effect during its current two-year term. To get a raise in 1999, lawmakers must adopt legislation before Jan. 1, when a new two-year term of the Legislature begins, with newly elected members.
Even though rank-and-file members have clamored for a pay raise and legislative leaders have spoken privately about the matter with the Governor, no formal proposal has been drawn up.
That said, some ranking members of the Legislature have set their sights on a pay raise of at least $20,000 a year, or nearly 35 percent, for a job that the State Constitution envisions as part time, but has in fact become nearly a yearlong commitment for lawmakers in recent years. The session is supposed to run from January to June, but unresolved issues -- usually the budget -- can tether legislators to Albany far longer. The 220th session, which ended on Aug. 10, 1997, was the longest ever, lasting 210 days.
For now, the big question on the minds of most lawmakers is how to give themselves a pay raise without stirring the ire of a public that has become increasingly frustrated with the Legislature's long record of partisan gridlock, late budgets and squandered opportunities.
The matter is so incendiary that lawmakers, almost to a person, make a point of saying that they are not in fact seeking a pay raise but rather a "cost-of-living adjustment."
"It is almost impossible to discuss this issue as a legitimate policy question," complained Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic Assemblyman from Westchester. "There are forces out there who want to define this issue in purely political terms, and that's unfair."
He continued, "You ought to be able to decide whether it's justified to go 10 years without a cost-of-living adjustment and what level of compensation is appropriate. But it's been difficult to get those questions asked in a thoughtful way."
New York State's annual legislative pay base of $57,500 is less than the base pay for New York City Council members, who make $70,500 a year, but second in state governments only to California's base of $75,600. Lawmakers in Albany also receive stipends for leadership positions, like committee chairmanships, which can add greatly to their income -- from $6,500 for a ranking minority member of a committee, to $30,000 for the leaders of both chambers, the Speaker of the Assembly and the majority leader of the Senate.
As they have in previous years, lawmakers this year have found themselves vexed by the pay raise issue for one main reason: just about everybody wants one, but few dare to speak openly about it, lest they appear greedy and self-serving. But privately, many of them, especially those from New York City and its suburbs, say that they are barely able to make ends meet in a job that takes up more and more of their time.
Beyond that, state lawmakers routinely complain that many county and city legislators are paid more than they are. They note that the demands on the Legislature have grown in recent years, particularly as the Federal Government has placed new responsibilities on states, like the overhaul of the welfare system.
The New York Legislature was established in 1777, and its members for years received no compensation. The first paychecks for state legislators were in 1821, when voters approved a salary of $3 a day. It was left to voters to approve raises until 1948, when the State Constitution was amended to grant the legislators, with the Governor's approval, the power to set their pay. Since then, the Legislature has had eight raises, bringing their salaries from $5,000 a year to the current $57,500.
In the past, state lawmakers put off addressing the touchy issue until that legislative twilight period between the November elections, after which they are secure in their seats for another two years, and the Jan. 1 deadline that opens a new two-year legislative term.
Because incumbents almost always hold on to their seats in New York -- no member who sought re-election lost in the recent November elections, for example -- that approach provides them the opportunity to give themselves a raise for the next legislative term without having to worry about facing voters until two years later.
But as in years past, lawmakers face another hurdle this time around: getting support from Gov. George E. Pataki for a pay raise even before such a measure is brought to the floor of the Legislature for a vote. That support is crucial because neither house wants to give the Governor the opportunity to veto such a bill and thereby bolster his standing among voters at the political expense of lawmakers.
The strongest leadership voice for a raise comes from the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, who recently said he vigorously supported an increase. The Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, has strongly suggested that he does not believe that lawmakers make enough money .
But it is still far from clear whether the issue will be taken up when lawmakers convene in Albany for their leadership meetings, and that is in large part due to the Governor, who, legislators say, has sent mixed signals about his position. His spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, did not return a phone call last week seeking comment on the issue.
There is widespread speculation among lawmakers that Mr. Pataki is seeking to force his Democratic rivals in the Legislature to pass legislation that he supports -- such as a bill that would create privately run but publicly financed charter schools -- in exchange for his pledge to sign a pay raise bill.
But should Mr. Pataki pursue such a strategy, he may face resistance from Democrats, who, publicly anyway, say that the Governor should not be linking a pay bill to unrelated pieces of legislation.

HEADLINE: Purges Hint at Beginning of the End for Milosevic

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Nov. 26

 BODY:
In moves viewed here and by some in Washington as signs of weakness rather than strength, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has conducted an extraordinary purge of his innermost circle, dismissing the leaders of the army, the air force and the intelligence service, as well as one of his most trusted political commissars.
Few are brave enough to say how or when Mr. Milosevic, the strongman of Serbia, will go. But many officials here and in Washington agree that the dismissals represent the beginning of the end. 
 The purge, conducted in the wake of Mr. Milosevic's agreement on Oct. 13 to pull troops out of Kosovo, culminated this week with the dismissal of Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the long-serving Army Chief of Staff and an architect of the war in Bosnia.
In the last month Mr. Milosevic has been seen by former associates as increasingly insecure, even paranoid, as Kosovo drifts from his control, the enfeebled economy gets weaker and he bows to the demands of his politically powerful wife, replacing his apparatchiks with hers.
"Deep in their minds they know that there will be social unrest and they want totally loyal people around them when it happens," Bratislav Grubacic, the editor of an English-language newsletter for diplomats and others in Belgrade, said of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic. "He is closing the areas where he doesn't feel comfortable -- people in the state apparatus who might eventually become disloyal."
A Washington official who has followed Yugoslavia for more than a decade said: "The regime is brittle. It will crack. It will break."
The dismissals have inspired open talk here of the resemblance between the ruling court of Mr. Milosevic, his wife and their two wealthy children, Marko and Marija, and that of the Ceausescu family in Romania, which was dominated by a husband-and-wife team and collapsed in a bloody downfall in 1989.
The fall of Mr. Milosevic would have important consequences for the United States. Mr. Milosevic has been treated by the Clinton Administration as an important keeper of the peace in Bosnia, where American troops are based, and as a negotiating partner over the future of Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority is seeking independence.
Mr. Milosevic rules from behind closed doors, rarely appearing in public and almost never granting interviews, even to Serbian state news media, which he controls. There has been no official explanation of the recent dismissals.
The purges began on the heels of the departure from Belgrade of the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, who persuaded Mr. Milosevic to agree to international observers in Kosovo, and were preceded by the closing of independent newspapers and academic dismissals at Belgrade University.
The removal of General Perisic on Tuesday was perhaps the least surprising, after he publicly criticized Mr. Milosevic last month for allowing what is left of Yugoslavia to become a pariah state. Yugoslavia now consists of two republics: dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro.
General Perisic, who led the Yugoslav National Army during the atrocities in Bosnia, was reported to have opposed the use of his soldiers against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo during the summer offensive there. His skepticism apparently infuriated Ms. Markovic.
The agreement on Kosovo between Serbia and NATO was signed by General Perisic, thus forcing Mr. Milosevic to wait a decent interval before getting rid of him. What was surprising was General Perisic's decision to fight back.
On Thursday night the general taunted Mr. Milosevic with a statement saying he had been dismissed illegally and hinting that he was prepared to lead Yugoslavia down a different path.
"I was replaced without consultations, in an inadequate and illegal way," the general said in his statement, which was issued through an independent news agency. "This establishment does not like officials with high personal integrity who use their own heads. I am still at the disposal of the army, the people and the state."
General Perisic, a native of Montenegro, is reported to have the backing of that republic's president, Milo Djukanovic, a former Milosevic ally who has turned against him and has won American support for his stand.
Some opponents of Mr. Milosevic, who has thrived throughout his 11-year rule by fomenting crises, fear that with Kosovo effectively now policed by the West and its ethnic Albanian guerrillas lying low in winter snows, he will use the lull to provoke a confrontation with Montenegro.
General Perisic was replaced by Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, a member of Ms. Markovic's political party who was commander of one of the army corps most active in the savage 1991 fight to wrest the city of Vukovar from the Croatians, officials said.
The first senior official to be removed was Jovica Stanisic, the head of state security services, whom the West considers a clever intelligence officer. Mr. Stanisic, who knows all the worst secrets of Mr. Milosevic's rule, was replaced by a senior police patrol officer, Rade Markovic, a loyalist of Ms. Markovic and a member of her party, known as the Yugoslav Left. Mr. Markovic is not related to Ms. Markovic.
Along with Mr. Stanisic, a dozen top operational officers of the security service were forced into retirement or removed, a move that may undermine Mr. Milosevic in the longer term, officials said.
Mr. Milosevic next dismissed Milorad Vucelic, the deputy leader of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party, who served as the President's political disciplinarian.
To complete the list, the head of the air force, Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, who protested Mr. Milosevic's agreement to allow NATO surveillance flights over Kosovo, was also removed.
Mr. Milosevic has carried out purges before, but never to this extent. And he has never so obviously filled vacancies with loyalists of his wife.
This round is also different because it comes when there is no obvious danger to Mr. Milosevic; the Serbian opposition, which mounted vast months-long demonstrations two years ago, is weak and divided. And for the first time even courtiers of his rule speak of it in scathing terms.
Slavko Curuvija, the editor in chief of the Daily Telegraf and European magazine, which were closed down by the Government last month, was until recently a confidant of Ms. Markovic.
But in an interview, he described how he went to see her in October to tell her a few home truths. "In the next year or next two years they will lose power," Mr. Curuvija said. "They are making a private regime in which nobody who is not a close friend or not a bodyguard has important positions in the Government."
He said his meeting with Ms. Markovic ended abruptly. "I told her that everything her husband had done was dramatically bad and that he had to do several things to save Serbia," he said. "I said: 'If you don't stop what's going on, the end will be bloody,' and that many people will be killed and maybe some will be hanged on the Terazije," a central square in Belgrade.
Mr. Curuvija said the outlook for the Government was very grim indeed. "If you make war in Slovenia, you can step back to Croatia," he said, referring to Mr. Milosevic's first fights within the old Yugoslavia. "If you start a war in Montenegro, you can step back to Belgrade. When you start a war in Belgrade, you have nowhere to step back to except a trench around your house."
A critical factor governing how long the Government will survive is the economy, which has been battered by sanctions and bans on loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and continues its relentless decline.
But so far Mr. Milosevic has managed to manipulate the currency so that he can pay about three-quarters of the annual state pensions due, and keep the police and army paid. And with help from Russia, which provides natural gas even though Serbia is late in its payments, and with deals like a recent oil purchase from Libya, Mr. Milosevic is able to provide energy for the long-suffering people.
"Don't underestimate his ability to scrape the bottom for economic deals," said a Western diplomat.
Aleksandar Tijanic, a former Minister of Information, said he believes that the Government has $1 billion to $2 billion stashed abroad that it can draw on. "It's an enormous amount of money in this situation," he said.
There is considerable division among former members of the Milosevic circle and Western officials who expect Mr. Milosevic to fall about how he will go.
"I don't think it will be a palace coup," said the Washington official. "It's going to be in the streets. It could develop rapidly, something we won't anticipate -- say, superinflation should return and dinars in the morning can't buy bread in the afternoon."
In Mr. Grubacic's view, "No one can see him going from power normally. Something will happen next year for sure. Things are going quickly."
One sign of the times is that the new leader of the opposition coalition that organized the street demonstrations two years ago is Nebojsa Covic. Back then, he was Mayor of Belgrade and a close associate of Mr. Milosevic.
Mr. Covic, who describes in vivid detail Mr. Milosevic's style of bawling out underlings -- "He yelled at me that I was a coward" -- acknowledged that the opposition remains weak.
But he said that eventually, he cannot say exactly when, a spark would come from the streets. Then, as happened in Romania, it would be a matter of which way the mainstay of Mr. Milosevic's power, the 90,000-member police force, would go.
"The police are more and more willing to go against him every day," Mr. Covic said. "But they want to make sure they are on the winning side."

HEADLINE: A Fan's Fan, but an Owner First;
Decision on Patriots Put Economics Ahead of Emotions

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
The occasion called for Champagne.
Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, had just agreed to move his football team from Massachusetts to Connecticut. The Governor there was promising to build him a $350 million stadium in Hartford, to guarantee up to $17.5 million a year in sales of luxury seats, to let him keep all stadium profits without paying any rent, even to pick up the tab for the insurance. All in all, the experts said, it was one of the richest stadium deals any sports mogul had negotiated. 
 But last Sunday, Mr. Kraft wasn't celebrating. In full-page advertisements in the Boston newspapers, Mr. Kraft offered a 1,400-word apology. "Make no mistake," he wrote. "This decision was not easy."
Mr. Kraft doesn't just want Connecticut's money. He wants to be forgiven for taking it.
Perhaps more than any other sports team owner in America, Mr. Kraft, 57, embodies the opposing impulses -- one economic, the other emotional -- that are throwing dozens of cities into spasms of subsidized stadium construction and leaving others, deserted by their teams, perhaps wishing they had.
Like many of his peers, particularly in the National Football League, Mr. Kraft sought the greater revenue that a new stadium would bring from expanded luxury seating, concessions and advertising. But unlike many of them, Mr. Kraft, a native of Boston and a loyal season ticketholder before he bought the team, was loath to use explicit threats of leaving his home state as a ploy in the negotiations with Massachusetts, even as the talks about the state's contribution for a new stadium grew increasingly bitter.
When he finally acted, it was after five years of struggle with a State Legislature whose leaders came to consider him little more than a "whiny millionaire" who simply wanted too big a handout.
In its deal to build a new stadium, Hartford is buying more than just a competitive N.F.L. team and a palatial new sports complex: in Mr. Kraft, the Connecticut capital is getting someone who is described as a ruthless businessman but who also requires his players to make 10 appearances a season at local charities and civic groups. He is a man who also pays for parks in Israel and library wings in Worcester, Mass., and writes half-million-dollar checks to his own favorite causes, from the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston to cancer research and domestic-violence prevention.
But above all, Hartford's newest corporate citizen is a team owner who is deeply and openly emotional about his relationship with Patriot fans: two seasons ago, as the team's fortunes soared with a trip to the Super Bowl, that bond became an out-and-out lovefest. Before home games, Mr. Kraft would cruise through the parking lots outside suburban Foxboro Stadium in a golf cart, high-fiving tailgaters, unashamedly reveling in their affection. And each time the Patriots scored, he would wave down from his luxury suite above the 50-yard line, and the crowd would roar back.
Things have changed in the past week.
On Nov. 19, hours after he announced his deal for a Hartford stadium, a photograph of the absent Mr. Kraft was flashed on a banquet hall screen as the American Ireland Fund honored its largest contributors. The black-tie crowd of 1,500 booed loudly. On Monday night, there were few signs of rancor at Foxboro during the Patriots' game against the Miami Dolphins, suggesting that Patriot fans viewed his decision less harshly than the columnists and radio hosts who had demonized him. But Mr. Kraft skipped the golf-cart ride nonetheless.
"I don't think he'll be ostracized," said Stephen Tocco, the president of a Boston consulting firm, who worked closely with Mr. Kraft as an aide to former Gov. William F. Weld. "But he won't be signing many autographs anymore. His worst moment is going to be the day the trucks leave. But he's got three years to get ready for that day."
Mr. Kraft declined repeated requests for an interview. His son Jonathan, the Patriots' vice president, explained that more publicity could only jeopardize legislative approval of the stadium in Hartford: "We want to stay underground for now," he said.
Clearly, Mr. Kraft has encountered far fewer difficulties in Connecticut than in Massachusetts. In Boston, he was often criticized for the heavy-handed tactics he used to pursue a stadium deal. But beneath the surface were old Boston tensions seldom discussed openly. "This town is not impressed with new money," said one longtime supporter, trying to explain Mr. Kraft's troubles.
Others, including people who know him well, said there was a deeper source to the vehemence of opposition to his proposals, suggesting that although Mr. Kraft grew up in a Jewish community in Brookline and saw himself as having deep roots in Boston, to the Irish, Italian and Brahmin insiders with whom he was dealing he remained an outsider, first and foremost.
Mr. Kraft spent more than a year on an ill-fated plan for a stadium in South Boston -- an insular, predominantly Irish neighborhood notorious for its battles against school busing in the 1970's. Residents, perceiving that he was trying to ram the project down their throats, rebelled.
"I don't know if it's anti-Semitism, or anti-Kraftism, or anti-footballism, but it's really strange," Jonathan Kraft told The Boston Globe in February 1997, trying to account for the enmity his father had stirred up in South Boston. "I just don't get it."
Robert Kraft's love of sports began young, but was frustrated early on. His home in Brookline was a few blocks from the old Braves Field, where he sold programs until the baseball team moved to Milwaukee in 1953.
His father was a dry-goods merchant who was better known as a lay leader at an Orthodox synagogue. But the family's religious observance interfered with the teen-ager's desire to play high school sports, with games on Saturday. He played football for the first time as an undergraduate at Columbia University, excelling in an intercollegiate league for lightweight athletes.
After Harvard Business School he married Myra Hiatt, the daughter of a wealthy Worcester manufacturer, and soon went to work for his father-in-law. In 1972, the year he first bought season tickets to the Patriots, Mr. Kraft, then 31, took control of his father-in-law's packaging corporation, Rand-Whitney, and launched International Forest Products, which trades in raw materials around the world. Today, the two comprise the largest privately owned packaging company in the country and the biggest but least-noticed divisions of the Kraft Group, which generates an estimated $500 million a year in revenues.
 
Leaving Obscurity By Buying a Team
 Yet, outside the Boston charity-dinner circuit, Mr. Kraft was still virtually unknown when he bought the Patriots in 1994.
It was not his first venture into professional sports; he had owned the Boston Lobsters, a World Team Tennis franchise, until that league folded in 1978. Later, he made passes at the Red Sox and Celtics, and twice tried unsuccessfully to buy the Patriots, before seizing on an alternate route to control of the team -- becoming its landlord. In 1988, he and a Massachusetts shopping mall developer, Stephen Karp, bought Foxboro Stadium, the Patriots' current home 30 miles south of Boston, at a bankruptcy sale for $25 million.
Six years later, Mr. Kraft, fresh from buying out Mr. Karp's interest in the stadium, used his control of the Patriots' lease to edge out several rival bidders for the team. The closest competition came from a St. Louis businessman who offered $200 million and would have moved the team there. Mr. Kraft paid only $158 million because he threatened a costly legal battle if another buyer tried to break the Foxboro lease.
"That was far more than he wanted to pay," Mr. Tocco said. "But he really believes in Boston and Massachusetts, and the Patriots looked like they were leaving."
At the time, Mr. Kraft was hailed as the team's savior. He cultivated the image of a fan's fan, recalling in interviews how he and his sons had endured the lean years alongside blue-collar Patriots fans and wanted nothing more as owners than to bring a championship home to New England.
Almost immediately, however, Mr. Kraft began pushing for a new stadium to replace Foxboro. And Mr. Kraft, the fan's fan, increasingly clashed with the fan's favorite, Coach Bill Parcells, over player decisions. Mr. Parcells, who led the team to the Super Bowl in January 1997, resigned soon after the Patriots' loss.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kraft brought his business acumen and his history as a football fan to bear in his dealings with other N.F.L. owners, earning respect as a consensus builder. Having owned a Boston television station for five years, Mr. Kraft played an important role in negotiating the league's eight-year, $18 billion television rights deal with CBS, Fox, ABC and ESPN.
Pat Bowlen, the owner of the Denver Broncos and chairman of the league's broadcast committee, said that Mr. Kraft had stressed the need to continue broadcasting N.F.L. games over free television. "There was plenty of talk about going in different directions," he said. "But Bob felt over-the-air was necessary for an ongoing, stable relationship with our fans. It's a big thing to him. He was a big mover in getting all our games sold out the first week in September, so they could all be televised."
 
A Boston Plan Hampered by Missteps
 At the same time, as his peers in the N.F.L. accepted publicly financed stadiums -- like Art Modell, who moved his Cleveland franchise to Baltimore in exchange for a new ball park -- Mr. Kraft, who was willing to raise the money for a stadium privately, would complain to friends about the ingratitude of Massachusetts politicians.
"I was willing to spend hundreds of millions of my own money to privately finance a stadium," he wrote in the newspaper advertisement last Sunday, "but was never given the opportunity."
His stadium hunt degenerated in Boston beginning in late 1995, after the Massachusetts House rejected a proposed domed stadium and convention center complex. Mr. Kraft came up with a plan to build a downtown open-air stadium without public subsidies.
But the plan, which relied on one-time fees charged to season ticketholders, was overshadowed by a series of political missteps that left even Mr. Kraft's supporters bemoaning his political naivete and his tendency to ignore advice and to turn on his allies. At one point, for example, he claimed that the Governor at the time, Mr. Weld, had guaranteed to deliver him a new stadium, saying that promise had "induced" him to take the risk of buying the Patriots. Yet a seventh grader could have told Mr. Kraft that such a promise was meaningless without the cooperation of the Legislature.
Eventually, what had made Mr. Kraft seem so endearing a few years earlier began to turn off those who dealt with him at the bargaining table. Thomas M. Finneran, the Speaker of the Massachusetts House, who became his chief adversary, called Mr. Kraft a "whiny millionaire."
In trying for more than a year to build a stadium in South Boston, associates of Mr. Kraft said he made the mistake of believing that if he could persuade the community's political leaders to accept his plan, residents would follow. But residents bridled at that presumption, as much as at the notion of game-day traffic jams in their neighborhood. The South Boston plan went down in flames and ill will in early 1997.
In Massachusetts, Mr. Kraft had often expressed a wish that a deal could be struck if he got all the most powerful politicians in one room. In Connecticut, he was proved right. After a series of secret meetings with Gov. John G. Rowland that began in May, the two reached agreement over the weekend of Nov. 14 and 15. The following Monday, Mr. Rowland met with all six legislative leaders to gain their support, and Mr. Kraft came by to answer their questions.
His deal with Connecticut in hand, Mr. Kraft immediately set out to persuade fans that he had done right by them. In a letter to season ticketholders mailed Nov. 19, he noted that they would not have to pay extra fees to retain their seats in Hartford, vowed there would be room at the new stadium for tailgating, and even promised that the new parking lots would empty in less than an hour, a vast improvement over Foxboro.
But that was not enough for Mr. Kraft: last Sunday, in his newspaper ads, he defended the move.
"I love Massachusetts" he wrote. "It has been home to my family all our lives. I wanted nothing more than to keep the Patriots here. It was simply impossible to do so and fulfill my obligation to continue to put a championship-caliber team on the field."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Children Write Letters to Santa Asking for Help, Not Toys

BYLINE: By ADAM GERSHENSON 

 BODY:
As the holiday shopping season began last week, shoppers had nearly unlimited choices, from the newest Barbie to Interactive Barney to an $18,000 toy Range Rover, for those with unlimited means.
But for Amanda Lee Bernabe, 7, all of these presents are out of reach. Her family could afford little more than the 32-cent stamp for her letter from the Bronx to the local office of Santa Claus: the Children's Aid Society at 105 East 22d Street. 
 "Santa this year was very sad and very hard for us," she wrote. "Santa I lost my grandmother and I lost my house. My house got on fire and my mother lost her job. My mother is very sad that she don't have any Christmas spirit."
Amanda did not even ask for a Barbie doll or Nintendo 64. She wanted clothes for herself and her 5-year-old brother.
"It's as if there are two sets of holidays these days, one for rich kids and one for poor," said Philip Coltoff, the executive director of the Children's Aid Society. "We try to build a bridge between the two."
That bridge is supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which sponsors seven local charities, including the Children's Aid Society, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and UJA-Federation of New York.
The fund, which begins its 87th annual appeal today, was created in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, then publisher of The Times, who had been moved by a chance encounter on Christmas Day, 1911, with a shabby beggar. Mr. Ochs had so much; the beggar had so little. The fund was established so New Yorkers with money could help those who had none.
The same kind of encounter could occur today at Grand Central Terminal, in Central Park, or on almost any corner in the city. Despite enormous disparities in income, rich and poor New Yorkers ride the same subways and use the same libraries. "New York City has a greater concentration of wealth and a greater concentration of poverty than anywhere in the state," said Frank Mauro, the director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group that studies the New York economy.
The institute reported in September that although New York State's economy has rebounded in recent years, the benefits of this resurgence have not materialized for poor and middle-class families.
"Beneath the glittering picture of the New York City economy, the richest folks get the lion's share of it," said Larian Angelo, chief economist for the New York City Council.
Last year, 38 percent of the city's children lived in poverty, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's March 1998 Current Population Survey done by the Community Service Society of New York. The census defined a family of three as living in poverty if its income was less than $12,391 a year.
The skewed income distribution may mean extravagant gifts in some wealthy families, but it means a lack of essentials -- and more reliance on charities -- for the poor.
The Neediest Cases Fund helps needy New Yorkers celebrate holidays with their children, but it also does much more.
At the Children's Aid Society, workers do not simply fulfill the holiday wish lists sent to Santa. They use the letters as initial assessments, then enroll a needy family in programs at one of their 36 community centers, which offer day care and after-school reading programs; dental, medical and mental health providers, and job training courses and employment opportunities for adults.
As a poor 4-year-old growing up in Harlem, Herman Bagley received a Christmas yo-yo from Children's Aid. Today, as an executive with the agency, he oversees the collection and distribution of 125,000 gifts a year.
This year, Mr. Bagley is worried that rising demand will overwhelm his agency's capacity to provide gifts.
"The intensity and demand has gone through the roof," said Mr. Bagley, as he eyed a handful of dusty skateboards and Hula-Hoops in an all-but-empty storage room for toys on East 22d Street.
Upstairs in his office, Mr. Bagley rifled through hundreds of letters that had recently arrived. Almost none of the children asked for exorbitant gifts, though a few held out hope for computers. Most requests were for jackets, boots and mittens. Other children wanted catcher's mitts, encyclopedias and bicycles.
Some boys and girls wrote that they had been good all year, and they wished for things no charity could provide, like a father or a mother.
But money from the Neediest Cases Fund will help in more tangible ways.
Last year readers of The New York Times contributed a record $5,811,568 to the fund. Generosity came in the form of $5 bills, and checks for $50,000, from schoolchildren and financiers.
The Times pays all the fund's administrative costs, so every dollar donated went directly to people in need, people like the children who had written to Mr. Bagley.
"All I want for Christmas is a bed," wrote one 9-year-old boy from Washington Heights.
"I would like some sweaters because winter is coming in and I get really cold," wrote Francisco Velez, 14, who also asked for "some pants, because mine are getting a little too old and tight."
Evelyn Duran of the Bronx wrote that she understood that even Santa, a man of supposedly unlimited resources, comes up short every now and again. "I would be happy with anything you send me," she wrote. "And if you can't, thank you anyways."

Like other Democratic and Republican hopefuls, he will have to raise more money than ever, at least $22 million, and earlier than ever before. So Senator Kerrey and six other Presidential aspirants have turned to so-called soft money -- large unrestricted contributions from wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions. 1
 
Affirmative Action Debate
The longstanding debate over affirmative action in education, for years centered on universities and professional schools, is shifting to public school districts, where an increasing number of parents -- mostly white -- are complaining about policies they say are unfair to their children. Nearly a half-century after Brown v. Board of Education, the question of whether the educational value of diversity justifies race-conscious policies in public schools is an open one, never directly addressed by the United States Supreme Court. 1
 
Impeachment Inquiry Jockeying
As the House impeachment inquiry enters its crucial final weeks, Republicans and Democrats are jockeying for an advantage that could influence President Clinton's fate. Beginning on Monday, committee Republicans aim to shore up their case against Mr. Clinton by taking several steps, including a public hearing on the consequences of lying under oath. 47
 
New Housing Programs
President Clinton highlighted two new housing programs in his weekly radio address that will provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or disabled. 29

Plastic Surgery for Teen-Agers Poses a Problem for Doctors
A generation ago, it was not unusual for some teen-agers to have their noses straightened or ears pinned back, but more controversial procedures, like breast augmentation, liposuction and tummy tucks, are gaining popularity these days in this impressionable age group. Doctors say the teen-age girls now flocking to the suites of plastic surgeons from Park Avenue to Beverly Hills pose an ethical problem. 1
 
A Takeover at Troubled Union
The parent union of District Council 37, New York City's largest municipal union, said yesterday that it was taking direct control of the council, effective tomorrow, to put an end to a spiraling scandal that has involved vote fraud and embezzlement. Gerald McEntee, president of the parent union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, named a trustee to run the council and said that Stanley Hill, the council's executive director, was taking a voluntary unpaid leave. 1
 
Patriots Owner Explains Deal
Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has gone to unusual lengths to explain his decision to accept Connecticut's offer to build his team a new stadium, one of the richest stadium deals any sports mogul had ever negotiated. Mr. Kraft, a native of Boston and loyal fan before he bought the Patriots, took out full-page advertisements in the Boston newspapers asking fans to understand his decision. He doesn't just want Connecticut's money; he wants to be forgiven for taking it. The situation embodies the opposing impulses -- one economic, the other emotional -- that are throwing dozens of cities into spasms of subsidized stadium construction and leaving others, deserted by their teams, wishing they had. 49

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
White Sox and Belle Made $100 Million Pact Possible

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
What hath Jerry Reinsdorf wrought?
The Chicago White Sox owner hasn't made a major free-agent signing in two years, but the last one he did, Albert Belle, triggered the escalating activity that reached a frenzy last week. Bernie Williams and Mo Vaughn, not to mention Mike Piazza, can nod in Reinsdorf's direction because his signing of Belle on Nov. 19, 1996, made their contracts possible. 
 Major League Baseball is hurtling toward its first $100 million contract, and while salaries have been escalating since free agency was created in 1976, the Belle contract thrust the salary scale into a higher orbit.
When bad Albert became a free agent following the 1996 season, the highest-paid player in baseball was Ken Griffey Jr., who earlier that year signed a four-year contract for $8.5 million a year. To put in perspective what Reinsdorf did for baseball contracts, it took four years to get from Ryne Sandberg's record $7.1 million to Griffey's $8.5 million, an increase of 19.7 percent.
If, in signing Belle, Reinsdorf had raised the scale by the same percentage, Belle would have received just under $10.2 million a year. But no reason to stop there. The White Sox owner asked Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, what he wanted, then gave it to him -- $11 million a year -- sending the top of the scale soaring by 29.4 percent only 10 months later.
In addition, Reinsdorf agreed to a clause that enabled Belle to become a free agent if three players had higher salaries. He is in that position now and has until Wednesday to decide if he wants to remain with the White Sox or go elsewhere. If it is elsewhere -- Baltimore -- he will do it for even more money than Reinsdorf gave him.
Tellem wanted the clause because he didn't know where the market was headed, and he wanted to make sure Belle suddenly didn't become underpaid. Any player who signs a long-term contract faces that possibility. But Reinsdorf wanted Belle so he capitulated on that issue, too.
Now Belle is in position to sign with the Orioles for $13 million a year for five years, which, at least for today, would place him in a tie for second for the highest annual average salary. Piazza ($13 million) eclipsed Pedro Martinez of Boston ($12.5 million) with his Mets' contract in October, then was supplanted himself last week when Vaughn ($13,333,333) signed with Anaheim.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the soaring, leapfrogging salaries at the upper end of the scale has been the silence of Griffey. Many consider him the best player in the game, but he has plummeted from No. 1 to a tie for 12th and he has never suggested that his contract be renegotiated to get him back to the top of the scale.
"You haven't heard him say anything; that's not his style," Woody Woodward, the Seattle general manager, said. "That's the way he's always been."
Griffey's contract expires after the 2000 season, the same time that his teammate, Alex Rodriguez, ends his contract. The Mariners are warily watching the salaries soar onward and upward. By the time Junior and A. Rod sign new contracts, they might own the Mariners' new park.
"I think we have the two best all-around players in the game," Woodward said, "looking at power, speed and defense, arms and the positions they play. My position has been and continues to be both of these fellows came through our system and I'd like to see them both finish their careers with Seattle."
 
Lack of Accountability
With a new seven-year contract in his pocket, Bernie Williams should finish his career with the Yankees. And every time he sees the Boston Red Sox, he should express his gratitude because they made it possible.
"Scott Boras wins again," an American League general manager said. "He had nothing until Dan Duquette." He referred to the Red Sox general manager.
"Duquette goes ahead and offers 87 and a half for Bernie on Tuesday and Wednesday the Yankees matched his mistake."
The Red Sox offered Williams $87.5 million for seven years. Two weeks earlier they offered Mo Vaughn $63 million for five years, and when he rejected it, they said bye, bye to one of the most popular athletes in Boston sports history, a player who had carried them on his burly back.
"I have no idea what's going through their heads," one general manager said.
"It doesn't make any sense," said an agent.
The Red Sox signing of Jose Offerman two weeks ago to a four-year, $26 million contract outraged other clubs.
"There is no accountability there," said an executive of a National League club. "They have no owner there. It's a trust."
The executive said he was told by the general manager of another club that one of Offerman's agents, in talking to clubs about the vastly improved infielder, sought less money than the Red Sox gave him.
"O'Leary, Wakefield, Garciaparra, Martinez, Offerman and he almost did it with Williams," an American League general manager said, rattling off names of players whose contracts other clubs found to be unnecessarily inflationary.
 
Tale of Two2 Contracts
The signing of Bernie Williams once again raised questions about the Yankees' practice of not signing their good young players to long-term contracts. The Cleveland Indians have followed the opposite practice, prompting other teams, such as the Angels, to sign their young players at least through the salary arbitration years.
A comparison between Williams and Jim Thome tells a revealing financial tale.
When Thome had between one and two years of major league service, the Indians signed him to a four-year contract. Then during the fourth year, in 1997, they signed him to a four-year extension. In the past five years they have paid Thome a total of $10.25 million.
Williams had between one and two years of major league service at the same time as Thome, entering the 1994 season.
There was no multiyear contract for Williams then; nor was there any until last week. Going year by year, the Yankees the past five years have paid Williams $17,225,000.
Some agents recommend that their clients shun multiyear contracts early in their careers. Thome's agent, in fact, urged him not to accept either contract. But the money and the security were too great for Thome to resist.
Now the Yankees have Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera eligible for salary arbitration for the first time, and those players, as well as Andy Pettitte, remain unencumbered by a multiyear contract.
"We had some conversations last year and we agreed not to do it," Casey Close, Jeter's agent, said. "We couldn't agree on preliminary stuff. I expect they'll bring it up this year."
Even before Jeter and friends use the arbitration system, the Yankees have committed $66 million for 17 players for next season. They expect to have an opening-day payroll of about $81 million, up from a season-ending payroll of $65.6 million.
The only teams close to them in present payroll are Cleveland ($67.2 million for 18 players) and Atlanta ($65.65 million for 13 players).
 
No Conspiracy Theory
Contrary to the conspiracy theory espoused by some baseball executives last February, Scott Boras did not have a deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks to deliver Bernie Williams to them.
That so-called deal was the subject of hot speculation after the Diamondbacks signed Andy Benes, another Boras client, as a free agent. The expansion team, the theory went, helped Boras by signing Benes, and he, in turn, would make sure Williams signed with them this winter.
"It's logical for people to speculate in terms of Buck and Bernie," Colangelo said at the time, referring to his manager, Buck Showalter, who had been Williams's manager in New York. "Now there will be speculation because of the business I've done with Boras."
Colangelo was interested in Williams this month but never got serious enough with an offer to lure him to the Southwest.
In his effort to secure a record contract for Williams, Boras prepared a 23-page booklet of data on the center fielder. On one page, the agent got carried away. Citing his defensive ability, Boras said that Williams was ranked the major leagues' No. 1 center fielder in the Elias rankings, which are used to determine compensation for free agents. Williams was No. 1 all right, but not defensively.
The rankings use a complex formula based on a series of statistics, and in the case of outfielders, they are all hitting statistics -- plate appearances, batting average, on-base percentage, home runs and runs batted in.
No fly balls caught or missed, no assists, no errors.

 Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi.
 By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
 314 pp. Washington:
 Counterpoint. $25. 
 "Should one want to try to become something other than what one is?" This is the question Ruth Prawer Jhabvala asked in the introduction to her previous story collection, "Out of India," in which she reveals a deeply ambivalent love for her adopted country. There she lives each day in the thick of its languid communality, "a central European with an English education and a deplorable tendency to constant self-analysis" who is fated to feel like an eternally displaced person.
Yet it is precisely this sense of dislocation that has provided Jhabvala with the cross-cultural eye to create, over the past 40 years, the sumptuous emotional geography of her short stories, her screenplays for Merchant-Ivory Productions and her dozen novels, including the Booker Prize-winning "Heat and Dust." Jhabvala is a connoisseur of divided souls, conceiving characters whose inner longings are at odds with their outer protective coloration -- Indians who covet and achieve more tidy, "modernized" existences, then feel as if someone had stolen their life force; Westerners who eagerly hand themselves over to India's chaotic bliss, then find it too rigorous to endure.
In her most recent works, Jhabvala's rich depictions of New York City's extinguished lives -- melancholy German intellectuals arguing in dusty West Side apartments, madmen pawing through trash cans on Broadway -- have come to rival her signature descriptions of India's intricate seductions. This new collection of stories, "East Into Upper East: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi," written over the last 20 years, reaffirms her as a spellbinding urban fabulist.
Set, for the most part, in the gilded co-ops of New York's Upper East Side and the expensive villas of the "new New Delhi," Jhabvala's stories lay open the rootless, chameleon existences that thrive in habitats requiring no firm commitments, just a bundle of money and a great address. Much further adrift than the dislocated souls of her previous works, many of these characters have passed over into permanent spiritual exile. Choked off from religious moorings and family origins, they find their hungers resurfacing in a desperate voraciousness. Sensuality is reduced to clownish sexual preening, family loyalties to the language of real estate parcels and advantageous marriages. These people can be unexpectedly amusing -- or terrifying in their dumb soullessness. From time to time, they manage to find salvation through the work of spiritual shamans who may or may not be charlatans -- not that it matters. Both the louts and the potentially redeemable are portrayed with wry, bristling irony.
Each story reveals Jhabvala's mastery of the form: the sleek economy of words, free of heavy symbolism or easy judgments, that allows her to home in on small, telling details. Often, a story starts as if she were simply picking up a conversation in midstream. "Farid couldn't believe what he heard about Farida," one story begins. "She was his wife, and he would have thought that no one had known her more deeply, in every way, than he had." Jhabvala's plots unfold just as crisply, delivering sly humor and sudden, startling turns into tragedy.
In the New York stories, her characters routinely seal themselves up in willed, anonymous isolation, as if warding off the messy truths of the city might help them avoid unsettling changes in their own lives. Behind their double-bolted doors, many are locked into crushing emotional dependencies.
In "Fidelity," a middle-aged woman named Sophie spends most of her time in her dark Park Avenue apartment, hiding behind her family money and the constantly drawn drapes that prevent the sun from fading her grandparents' Biedermeier furniture. Sophie's ravenous wheeler-dealer husband, Dave, has left her yet again -- this time to live around the corner with a new young girlfriend who "wasn't worth, he said, to kiss Sophie's shoe."
He still visits his wife regularly and just as regularly bursts into tears over his infidelities, both romantic and financial -- tears so cleansing that they give him fresh strength to walk out on her once again. "Dave's relation to his wife was an affair of the utmost delicacy to him," Jhabvala writes. "He considered his love for her as the only pure and selfless part of him, which he was reluctant to tarnish with a request for money to keep him out of jail." Sophie's accession to Dave turns out to be far more tragic: she is so grateful for his visits that she will not interrupt his monologues to tell him she is dying.
Jhabvala's New Yorkers can be fiendish or funny, and they can also can be pitiable -- like Pauline, the lonely real estate agent in "Great Expectations," who hands over her apartment and her life to a parasitic family she has just met. The Indians in Jhabvala's stories, on the other hand, seem somewhat wiser, less cut off from their ancestral culture. But although they live in daily intimacy with India's fervent spirituality, only a few partake of it genuinely. The most haunting of these is Prakash in "Husband and Son," a once amorous, Cambridge-educated Cabinet minister who is now a toothless old holy man living on the roof of his Delhi house, singing Vedic hymns to greet each dawn. Otherwise, there are few saints among the Indian characters -- far from it.
Farid and Farida, in the story of the same name, are a chic young Delhi couple who move to London to hustle India's full line of enchantments, from handcrafts to cocktail delicacies. When their schemes collapse, so does their marriage. Twenty years later, Farid, his waistline and his drinking problem increasing, tracks down his wife to the Himalayas, only to find her sitting under a banyan tree with her own fleet of handmaidens and a line of pilgrims waiting to touch her feet: she has transformed herself into an even more marketable product, a holy woman. "Her skin was clear," Farid notes, "and shone with a radiance that could only be the result of the best cosmetics, applied, he knew, with consummate skill." He has arrived just in time to see her lose what little remains of her soul.
Other Indian characters engage in the same social climbing and power playing as the New Yorkers. Harry (born Hari), the disaffected husband in "Independence," amuses himself with English detective novels, Urdu poetry and vodka. Meanwhile, his wife, Sumitra, the Pamela Harriman of post-independence New Delhi, is out every night ministering to the newly elected politicos streaming in from the provinces -- teaching them to use the right fork at the French Ambassador's dinner and sometimes romancing them afterward. As Sumitra's career ascends, Harry reverts to wearing Indian clothes and staging embarrassing scenes at his wife's soirees. Gradually, he drinks himself into darkness, becoming a sad relic of the graceful, old, outworn India.
It is Ma in "The Temptress," an "ordinary Indian housewife with extraordinary powers," who is the cheeky queen of this collection. A fat, chatty sorceress in her 60's, Ma is imported to New York by a wealthy collector of gurus, one of the many young people in these stories starved for the spiritual grounding their parents have discarded. But after sharing Ma with her friends, the woman abruptly abandons her. Ma doesn't mind: she is a specialist in self-renovation, having retooled herself into a glittering woman of the world who shifts cities, countries, even New York apartments with playful ease. Besides, "Ma wasn't ready to go home. She felt she was still needed here, also that she hadn't yet had her fill of shopping and nice restaurants and all the lights coming on in the theater district and the advertisements flashing and the many different cable channels and flavors of ice cream."
Ma is also busy coaxing out of hiding the city's vast, suppressed spiritual yearnings. Her tony neighbors unlatch their doors and pour out their hearts to her; salesgirls from the local discount store consult her between customers. Even doormen, that most hardened of urban breeds, walk away from their jobs to join her chanting, lentil-cooking commune. There Ma soothes them by dealing "with everyone in the manner of one used to hearing strange and even terrible things without letting herself be overwhelmed by them."
Ma comes the closest to sainthood of anyone in the book. She may even be Jhabvala's earthy, late 90's incarnation of the Indian Mother Goddess herself, who changes her own form at will, while urging humankind to embrace -- not hide from -- the chaos, contradiction and changeability of existence. Reconciling East and West with one jingle of her bangle bracelets, Ma shows how a benevolent acceptance of our frailties and longings can bind disparate cultures -- and even a few divided souls.

HEADLINE: A Nibble of Caledonia in Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.; DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. reports for The Times from Johannesburg.

 BODY:
I AM nominally Scottish.
I also, nominally, like to fish.
This should make me a perfect candidate for trout fishing in the mountains of eastern Zimbabwe, which are called the Scottish Highlands of Africa. 
 But let's examine these claims.
I have tramped the real Highlands, even stomping up Glen Coe, where the Campbells slaughtered the MacDonalds in 1692. It was cold and wet, my boots leaked, and I liked it.
My ancestors, on the other hand, are from a wee island called Barra. They were pirates by trade. I thought they were the benign sort that scoured shipwrecks like the ones in that old Hayley Mills movie "The Moonspinners," but a Scottish friend set me straight. No, the McNeils attacked ships and performed rapine and pillage along the Irish coast. They -- we -- finally got out of the game in 1600, when a bounty hunter enticed the chief, Roderic the Turbulent, aboard his boat by promising him a taste of plundered sherry, got him drunk, locked him below decks and sailed him to Edinburgh to stand trial.
My father visited Barra once, in the 1960's. The airport was the beach at low tide, nearly everyone was named Donald McNeil, and several seemed a tad under the genetic weather from generations of island intermarriages, he said.
So much for that. Now -- am I a fisherman?
Well, as 12-year-old Californians, a friend and I used to slip off with his dad's surf-casting gear after sand sharks in the Bolinas Lagoon. He hooked them; I waded out barefoot to clock them with a softball bat so we could land them. Huck Finn I'm not.
I did once go fly-fishing in real Orvis style as the guest of an older cousin on the lovely trout stream of a Connecticut fishing club. I caught nothing, but I thoroughly enjoyed decorating the low-hanging tree branches with my cousin's magnificently colored flies and swearing as those crystal-clear waters poured into the top of my waders.
So, sort of a Scot, sort of a fisherman. Now, as to Zimbabwe:
Its highlands are the Nyanga Mountains, "nyanga" (pronounced nee-YAHN-guh, but running the first two syllables together), meaning a witch doctor, or his horn trumpet. They are so beautiful that Cecil Rhodes, the diamond magnate turned empire builder (Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980) fell in love with them and, naturally, bought them. His former homestead is now Nyanga National Park, where the weather is usually 20 degrees cooler than in the capital, Harare.
I asked an acquaintance, Robert Marsden, if he would like to go. I had thought Robert was Scottish, since I saw him get married in a kilt -- usually a dead giveaway. It turns out he did it to please his bride, Mandy McGilp. It is through Mandy that I had learned just how serious an angler he is. They took their honeymoon in a fleabag hotel on an island off Mozambique, and when Mandy went to write "Honeymoon!" on their family calendar, she discovered that Robert had written "Fishing!"
We were not heading out at the most felicitous moment. Early November is the end of the hot, dry season, and I didn't know if there would be water left in the streams, nor how warm it would be -- trout begin to die at 73 degrees, Robert told me.
Our timing was inauspicious in other ways. The Zimbabwe dollar has fallen from 11 cents to less than 3 cents against the United States dollar in two years. Most blame President Robert Mugabe, who was a liberation hero when elected in 1980, but has let his Government deteriorate.
On the Friday morning we were to leave, the tabloid headline on my Johannesburg doorstep screamed "Troops in Zim on Full Alert" above a picture of a burned-out bus. Harare, where we were to fly in, had had protests over the doubling of bus fares.
I started to cancel everything, but then called a friend who edits a newspaper there. "That riot was Wednesday," he said. "Early Wednesday. It's been perfectly quiet since then."
Reasonably reassured, we went ahead. In fact, Harare was calm -- and 95 degrees -- when we started our three-hour drive to the Nyangas. The scenery started out flat, punctuated by the fascinating balancing rocks for which the country is so well known that they appear on its currency.
We stopped at Halfway House, a thatch-roofed compound built in the middle of nowhere in 1891. There, one can enjoy a banana split or fresh raspberries on the lawn. Or pet the zebras and elands eating cabbage in a tiny zoo. Or browse the antiques shop, which sells the cast-off touches of the English style that once ruled the country: silver tea services and mahogany camp tables.
For $20, I bought a thankfully rare 1966 book, "White Africans Are Also People," a tome by conservatives arguing that "independence given to people not yet ready for self-government has resulted in chaos." The saleswoman, who was black, smirked slightly at me.
There is generally less racial tension in Zimbabwe than in South Africa. It's only about 1 percent white, and one often meets black Zimbabweans in hotels, restaurants and private clubs, which is not the case in South Africa, where local blacks are often priced out. At the same time, those 100,000 whites dominate Zimbabwe's economy, and South Africans make fun of the way many of them openly pine for the old days. They're nicknamed Whenwes, as in "When we ran Rhodesia. . . ."
After Halfway House, the road slowly climbed into an African version of the Highlands -- craggy peaks dotted with umbrella thorn trees. We stopped to take pictures and accidentally flushed a tiny duiker antelope from cover. We were later to see baboons, gnus and a scrofulous-looking luncheon party of vultures shouldering each other aside for the best bits of a cow that had been hit by a car. You don't see that in Scotland much.
Africa is generally a continent without kitsch, but we saw tiny indications that the locals were playing along with this Highlands fling -- there was an estate named Bonny Doon, of course, and one sign advertising trout fishing "in our loch."
Our destination was what my Lonely Planet guidebook had called "the lovely Troutbeck Inn." It was built in 1950 by a Maj. Robert Mc Ilwaine, who missed the hills of his native Ireland (O.K., close) and did his best to imitate them, building dams to create five lakes and planting forests of pines. His long, low hotel was built into a grass-covered hillside above two lakes.
We got in at dusk. The front hall's log fire beneath a portrait of the late major with his fly rod has been burning continuously since 1950, no matter what the weather or state of the liberation wars. "If it goes out," the receptionist said, "someone gets fired."
We made our way past a cozy bar decorated with framed flies, then down green-and-white halls hung with fox-hunting prints and stuffed trout -- the biggest a 6-pound-8-ounce rainbow. Our comfortable rooms had big double beds, big satellite televisions and big glass doors opening onto the lawn-bowling green and the lake. Each veranda had two chairs and a boot-scraper for clearing the mud from one's insteps.
Under a sky speckled with shooting stars and faint satellites, we walked to the lake, which Robert pronounced perfect. It was punctuated with thin wood jetties that, he explained, gave one the height to cast far out and keep the backcast from tangling in the reeds. A few small, worn rowboats lined the bank.
We went in to dinner. The fixed-price menu had a vegetarian choice and two meat dishes. I thought the hotel could use a new chef less devoted to old-fashioned British bland, but he may know his audience. My roast beef, for example, came with a nice miniature Yorkshire pudding, but was cooked nearly gray and the horseradish sauce didn't bite. (Looking back, this was to prove an omen.)
The service was gracious and well-meaning, but confused. The headwaiter kept taking us to an oddly shaped rear table, the only one set for three, until we asked if he could let us take one for four near the window, since the room was empty. He panicked briefly, then had five waiters reset a used table instead of just shifting one of the Reserved signs.
When we asked for South African wine -- I only drink Zimbabwean Mukuyu Red in emergencies -- there was another fire drill. That page had been removed from the wine list because the currency had fallen so fast that imports were outrageously cheap. But after three requests, a waiter went to the bar and brought back a tray of bottles, which sent the guests who had by now filled the room into a flurry of waving him over. The poor guy had no idea what the prices were, but it hardly mattered. Excellent South African wines rarely cost more than $15.
The next morning, we hit the jetties at 5. It was already light, and we resolved to start at 4:30 the next day. But most of the other guests were there for a golf tournament (another touch of Scotland), so we were alone, and it was gorgeous. In dawn's glow, a few fish mouths and a lot of frog mouths dappled the otherwise flat surface, and the only sounds were those of dabchicks and redknobbed coots.
The coot defies description; its knobs and white face make it look like a bug-eyed grasshopper in a baseball cap. The dabchick, Africa's smallest waterfowl, looks like a fairy godmother experiment gone wrong: a mouse changed into a duck. It flashes across the water squeaking like a panicked rodent, while the coot's call sounds like a baby sneezing into a harmonica. At moments, it got riotous.
Our competitors were a martial eagle on a tree stump and a gray heron in the reeds, but they didn't have any more luck than we did.
The hotel's fish warden, Shamiso Musenguri, saw me struggling to cast, put down his clipboard and showed me how to float out line and then flick it overhand. Robert later said it was a roll cast. "It's easy, but it messes up the water," he said.
The ideal is to keep your fly airborne while paying out 40 feet of line, and then lay it on the water as gently as a butterfly alighting on a rose. Some of my early attempts were more like Refrigerator Perry alighting on a swimming pool.
I did get one strike, and saw it jump -- a rainbow that I guessed to be about 40 pounds of fighting demon. Robert said it was probably just shy of two pounds. In any case, it got away, so we'll never know who was right.
Robert is the kind of serious fisherman who guts his first catch immediately to see what it likes to eat, and then checks his flybox to see if he has anything resembling it.
With the day free, we drove to World View, which offered stunning mountain vistas and a Scottish-style stone viewing tower. The nearby Nyanga Park used to be Rhodes Inyanga Park.
There is a populist move afoot to dig up the Colossus's grave in the Matopo Hills and throw his bones into a river. But President Mugabe has said it will not be disturbed because "Rhodes still pays his taxes" -- that is, the site is a tourist attraction that draws in hard currency.
We fished again that evening, competing for good spots with tired golfers. Not a nibble, and a misty cold front blew up the valley.
At 4:30 the next morning, we felt like fools for rising earlier. "Real Scottish weather," Robert said cheerfully as we shivered, a cold drizzle running down our necks and the wind blowing our lines into the bushes so that I spent three minutes untangling for every one spent casting.
 THAT day we explored the national park, visiting lakes and 500-year-old hilltop stone forts. Foolishly, we had left the rods behind, because in one clear stream, we found some pools with trout so eager that they mouthed tiny pebbles we threw in. A fishing license in the park costs only $1.25, and a comfortable chalet that sleeps five rents for $11 a night.
We also toured the Mare Dam Trout Research Center, where the Government breeds fish, including strange blue and gold albinos. That afternoon, done in by two days of 4 A.M. wake-up calls, I fell asleep. By the time I got to the water, Robert was standing on a small sandbar looking pleased with himself. "You missed all the action," he said. He had two nice rainbows.
I kept trying, but no luck. As dark fell, I walked along the dam wall. Just below was a small hatchery where one could hook fish practically out of a bathtub for $1.40 each. I was tempted, but I have my pride. After all, this is supposed to be a Zen art, one whose aim is perfection, not dinner.
After another dinner -- at which I learned I like store-bought trout better because it tastes less like lake bottom -- we resolved to sleep in if the weather stayed Caledonian. It did, so we lagged until 6:30. Almost immediately, Robert caught another, even bigger trout. I congratulated him through clenched teeth.
He let it go, graciously saying it was about the same size as the one that got away from me.
 
Where Rhodes once played
 Driving is the easiest way to reach the Nyangas. Avis and Budget have outlets at the Harare airport and downtown. Zimbabwe's roads are good but there are lots of speed traps and lots of loose cows. If you hit either, be ready to pay on the spot.
The Troutbeck Inn, Private Bag 2000, Nyanga, Zimbabwe, has 70 rooms, all facing the lake. Besides fishing, it offers golf, tennis, sailing, mountain biking, swimming, horseback riding, lawn bowling and volleyball. Rods can be rented for about $1.50 a day (at the rate of 37 Zimbabwe dollars to the United States dollar).
Room rates, which include breakfast, are $63 a person in doubles, $101 for singles. Phone (263) 298-305 or (263) 298-880, fax (263) 298-474. It may be easier to make reservations through the Zimbawe Sun hotels office in Johannesburg, (27-11) 886-2130, fax (27-11) 886-3432.
Rainbow Nyanga Lodge, Private Bag 2056, Nyanga, Zimbabwe, Cecil Rhodes's old summer house inside Nyanga National Park (some signs still call it the Rhodes Nyanga Hotel), is set in a pretty, flower-filled garden and near the park's trout-stocked lakes. Modest compared to his estates in South Africa, the 24-room hotel has a museum of local history and some of his furniture in the former stables, including his very narrow, bed. Rooms cost $84, with breakfast, single or double. Two suites are $110 a night.
Park activities include fishing and walks (the park has various antelope species, but no big predators, elephants or crocodiles). The park is full of fascinating ruins of the now-vanished Nyana people -- circular stone forts atop hills, deep stone-lined pits that date from the 1500's. Golf or horse riding can be arranged.
The hotel's phone number is (263) 298-376, fax (263) 268-477, but reservations should be made through Rainbow Tourism in Harare, (263-4) 733-775 through -779.
Nyanga National Park Chalets are comfortable, basic lodgings with electricity and hot water, wood stoves and barbecue pits. They are next to several very pretty lakes in the park and fishing is encouraged.
A chalet sleeping three rents for $6 a night, one that sleeps six $11. There is no restaurant, so you need to bring your own food or go to the Rainbow Lodge to eat. Reservations: (263) 298-274, fax (263) 298-778.
Park admission is $2.70. Fishing licenses are $1.10 or $1.60 a day (four or five fish limit depending on the lake). Rods can be rented for $1.35 a day. Fishing is legal year-round, but some lakes close periodically. The best months are June to August, and October to early November. Late November and December can be very rainy.

Maps showing the location of Zimbabwe: A word of caution -- There have been occasional riots this year in Zimbabwe, normally a peaceful country. In mid-November, trade unions announced plans for general strikes every Wednesday, demanding higher wages and a rollback of fuel price increases. The State Department said that no hostility had been aimed at tourists, and that tourist areas like Victoria Falls or game parks had not been affected.

HEADLINE: The Youngest Place on Earth

BYLINE: By Erik Eckholm; Erik Eckholm is The Times's Beijing bureau chief.

 BODY:
It is 11:30 P.M. Wednesday night at the Bridge Club, a disco in the center of Ulaan Baatar. A well-heeled crowd of 20- and 30-year-olds dances to Puffy Combs's rap version of Every Breath You Take. Just about everyone is smartly dressed: the young women in tight jeans and turtlenecks, the men in well-tailored suits. Around midnight, the deejay makes an announcement, and everyone sits down. A bawdy rap song starts up, and a woman who cannot be older than 20 takes the stage and begins to take off her clothes. The audience watches in a manner best described as nonchalant.
Ten years ago, such a scene would have been unimaginable. Until democracy arrived in 1990, Mongolia was literally closed off to the world, isolated not only by tradition and geography but also by a strict, Soviet-dominated regime. With its ancient, nomadic shepherding culture and a Stalinist ethic rooted in the country's 1921 revolution, Mongolia was the land the 20th century forgot. 
 Mongolians seem to be making up for lost time. And the country's transition to democracy does have some special qualities to it, setting it apart from other ex-Soviet satellites. While most former Communist countries are moving from the 1940's to the modern age, Mongolia is accelerating overnight from a way of life that dates back to Genghis Khan. More important, the Mongolian revolution is characterized by a stunning demographic youthfulness. Due to Communist efforts in the 1970's to expand a sparse population, a striking three-quarters of Mongolians are under the age of 35; more than half are younger than 21. (In the United States, by contrast, less than a third of the population is under 21.) In part because of this boom, the new Mongolia, at least in its capital city, seems to be a democracy defined by everything Communism was not -- free markets, lively media, political instability and sometimes a wild atmosphere reminiscent of Daytona Beach during spring break. Youth culture literally rules.
Back at the Bridge Club, the young woman finishes her act, completely nude. As she walks off the stage, most of the crowd heads back out onto the floor for a slow dance. In this city, which has swiftly created its own version of a Western-style night life, striptease has become old hat. In a competitive wave a couple of years ago, nearly all the city's dozens of clubs -- including some like the Top Ten Club that cater to high-school students -- suddenly started to offer strip acts.
When several young women are asked about the ubiquity of stripping, none say they actually find the acts enjoyable -- but none say they would refuse to go to a bar because of them. Many observe that it is a way for women to earn better money at a time when jobs are scarce. Zaya, a 24-year-old editor at a radio station who describes herself as a feminist and who like many Mongolians uses only one name, notes that stripping "is better than being a prostitute," adding that "everyone is used to it by now."
What the young people who dominate Mongolia's only sizable city and its Government do not seem entirely used to is how to live with unfettered freedom. Not surprisingly, the youth revolution is experiencing growing pains. Our society was sleeping for a long time, explains Delgermaa, a 39-year-old lawyer and one of the few female members of Parliament. Everything was prohibited. Now, it's like we're just 8 years old."
To grasp what happened in Mongolia, think back to America in the late 1960's. In those days, the young baby boomers, who trusted no one over 30, wished their generation could just take over the Government and remake institutions according to young people's dreams. In Mongolia, something like that actually took place. In 1990, the 20-ish leaders of the country's baby boom forced the local Communists -- whose Soviet sponsors were falling into disarray -- to create a democracy. Charged with Western ideas about freedom and quoting heavily from laissez-faire economists like Milton Friedman, the bright-eyed youngsters formed political parties.
In the country's first real elections in 1992, a cautious public elected former Communists who had retooled themselves as "social democrats." But then in 1996, to their own surprise, the Democratic Coalition, which ran on a platform modeled on the Republican Party's 1994 Contract With America, won big and took over the country.
Today, members of that generation, many in their 30's and some still in their late 20's, run Government ministries and manage the country's traumatic shift from state-sponsored socialism to private enterprise. The average age for a Cabinet minister is just 36.
The country's main political divide -- between the Democratic Coalition and the erstwhile Communists of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party -- is to a large extent a generation gap as well. The opposition members are mostly like our fathers, says Sangajavyn Bayartsogt, the 32-year-old Minister of Nature and the Environment. The younger people want to do things fast, without looking back.
One thing the youngsters have tried to do fast is to wipe out the economic legacy of Communism. Earlier in the decade, livestock herds and small state-owned companies were sold off, with the entire population receiving vouchers, which they could then use to purchase their own modest piece of the action. Since 1996, the process has accelerated: chicken farms, coal mines and trucking companies have all been auctioned off. Now the country is preparing to sell some of the largest state-run enterprises, including the national airline, to a combination of local and foreign investors. Following the advice of the United States and other Western countries that have poured more than $500 million in aid into Mongolia, the country's young leaders have done away with price controls and abolished tariffs on imports.
The reforms have also brought about inflation, unemployment and the hardships that inevitably follow. The new leaders are the first to admit they were poorly prepared for such complex tasks. Our democracy is very young and inexperienced, says Amarjargal, an economist who at 37 is the acting Foreign Minister. We're learning every day. It's on-the-job training.
Not everyone is happy with the learning curve. There is growing discontent among the well educated, many of whom, despite advanced degrees, find themselves underemployed or unemployed. There is also unhappiness among those who ventured to Ulaan Baatar from the Mongolian outback, where some 40 percent of the population, largely nomadic, remains. To walk around the city's sprawling and rough ger districts -- a ger is the traditional tentlike home of canvas and thick felt -- is to sense the disappointment. Many of the city's young people cannot afford to go to discos or to drink at places like the Elvis Bar or the Boeing 777 in the modern part of town. A few low-rent bars and strip shows have opened in the ger districts, but many of the young men gather in dirt alleys to play cards and drink cheap beer and vodka. (At night, a police van drives about scooping up passed-out drunks to prevent them from freezing to death.) Street urchins haunt the city's steam tunnels. Young Mongolian women have flooded into China to work as prostitutes.
Our people are not yet aware of all the dangers of extreme openness, says Hashbat Hulan, 37. A member of Parliament, she notes the connection between the strip shows and spreading prostitution on one side, and rising social ills like divorce and out-of-wedlock births on the other. In 1997, according to Government figures, in this country of just 2.3 million, 38,000 girls age 16 and under were unwed mothers. Sexually transmitted diseases are soaring, and AIDS has just started to appear.
In the last year, although the economy started to show some signs of life, things began to sour politically. Factionalism among the Democrats became more bitter and evidence appeared of corruption and cronyism in high places. Perhaps this was inevitable in a country where newly minted leaders were inventing a democracy from scratch. No one, however, expected the tensions to lead to violence. But that appears to be what happened last month, when 36-year-old Sanjaasuren Zorig, a founder of the pro-democracy movement, was knifed to death by unidentified assailants only hours after it became clear that he would be named the country's next Prime Minister. Zorig was universally considered Mongolia's Mr. Clean, and the unsolved murder has left everyone asking which forces had the most to lose by his ascension -- corrupt businessmen, crooked politicians or the newly emergent Russian mafia?
"We had na 1/4ve ideas about each other, and generally about human beings, Hulan laments.
To find their way through this strange new time, Mongolians have looked mostly toward the West, inhaling deeply. "We see American TV and movies," notes Delgermaa, the member of Parliament, "and we're trying to understand what's right and wrong in the rest of the world.
Where the strongest cultural influences used to come from Russia, today the patron culture is that of the United States. MTV plays the same techno, hip-hop and heavy-metal music that attracts young people everywhere. Traditional Mongolian music remains popular, and some of Mongolia's aspiring bands like Hurd are weaving traditional folk themes into Western rock. But a typical stall selling tapes and CD's along Ulaan Baatar's streets features Nirvana, Metallica and Megadeth T-shirts.
Young Mongolians, attracted to everything that is not Communist, also seem, increasingly, to be finding direction through religion. Before the Communists came to power, Mongolia was a Tibetan-style theocratic state. Today, despite the intense and violent efforts of the Communists to stamp it out, Buddhism is enjoying something of a revival. Not uncommon are pictures and posters of the Dalai Lama, who has visited the country four times. Ulaan Baatar's temples bustle with activity during morning prayers. Tens of thousands of Mongolians have also joined Christian churches, which engage in aggressive missionary work and even run a popular television channel.
Given Mongolia's seven decades of Communist rule, its imposed social isolation and its young population, it is not surprising that the country has spent the 1990's on an occasionally reckless spree, sampling once-forbidden fruits ranging from X-rated entertainment to the excesses of the free market. In a few short years, it has experienced a truncated version of our own social, sexual and "values" revolution.
But it is hard not to feel optimistic about the country too. While Mongolia's young people have doubtless made the transition to democracy a particularly bumpy one, they have also infused the country with a vitality that may well insure its future progress. Mongolia is less corrupt than its ex-Communist counterparts. Extremism plays little role in its politics, and there are few calls for a return to the old order. In a 1997 Freedom House study, Mongolia was the only post-Communist country outside of Eastern Europe to be ranked as "free."
Flashing forward through history that took decades to sort out in the West, the Mongolians are learning in a heartbeat that the best and worst sides of the fin de siecle Western world are often entwined. They are learning, too, that the rewards of democracy and free markets are rarely immediate. "Not everyone can drive a Mercedes -- some of us will always have to ride a horse," says Batjargal, 27, who lives with his wife and two kids in one of the ger districts. "While I am not too hopeful for myself, I am hopeful for our children's future."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Ready to Return to Asia? A Prudent Path for Optimists

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
IN the last year, exposure to Asia has generally meant risking a bad case of the flu. The region's economic turmoil has weakened demand, and the health of many companies -- and their stocks -- has suffered.
But some analysts see signs of a possible Asian recovery. Economists at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, for example, forecast growth in gross domestic product for the region, excluding Japan, of 3.3 percent for 1999. Falling interest rates, looser monetary policies, rebounding currencies and greater direct foreign investment are also positive signs. 
 In a recent report, the Morgan Stanley analysts Markus Rosgen in Hong Kong and Deborah Weinswig in New York said that it was too soon to declare the Asian crisis over, but that there were "glimmers of hope" in the region. They recommended that investors consider multinational corporations they might have avoided previously because of Asian exposure. Working with their colleagues, the analysts compiled a list of North American companies that derive at least a fourth of their revenues from Asia.
While investors who remain skeptical can still avoid these companies, buying stocks of multinationals helps reduce the risk of betting on the Asian turnaround. "These are globally diversified companies," Ms. Weinswig said, and that diversification should help protect them even if the Asian economy fails to recover.
Technology companies, especially semiconductor-related companies like Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Applied Materials and Intel, are among the biggest sellers to Asia, according to the analysts, but demand for their goods is not driven solely by Asian companies or consumers. While these companies initially ship many of their goods to the region, they are then assembled into electronic products that are exported to other areas. Energy companies like Unocal, Texaco, Chevron and Mobil also do a lot of business in Asia.
Morgan Stanley has also uncovered some companies whose exposure to Asia may be less obvious: Aflac, an insurer, which gets the bulk of its sales from Japan, and AMF Bowling, which runs bowling centers.
Investors may also want to consider overseas companies that aren't based in Asia but that derive a sizable share of their revenue there. These include Cable and Wireless Communications of Britain, the telecommunications company; Gucci Group of the Netherlands, a luxury goods maker; Bulgari of Italy, a jeweler, and Sappi of South Africa, a paper maker.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 6, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investing in companies with large exposure to Asia misstated the name of one that derives a sizable share of its revenues there. It is Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain, not Cable and Wireless Communications.

HEADLINE: Oysters R Not in Season Because of Parasites . . .

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
THESE are lean times for Long Island's oystermen. Just four years ago, oysters were so plentiful along the western half of the North Shore that hundreds could be dredged in a few hours, but beginning last year, two microscopic parasite pests have virtually wiped out oysters and the local industry that depends on them.
"There's really only 1 or 2 percent of the oysters left, if that," said Mark Lawn, president of the Oyster Bay Baymen's Association. "You can't make any money at all." 
 With the oyster harvest destroyed, the baymen have turned to clamming and lobstering for income, putting additional pressure on those dwindling fisheries. Or they have given up and taken jobs onshore, further depleting the ranks of one of Long Island's most tradition-steeped ways of life.
Off-Island suppliers have moved in, and the retail price of oysters, ranging from $1 to $3 each depending on whether they are purchased at a fish market or a tony restaurant in the Hamptons, hasn't changed very much. But for the few local oysters that are still brought in, the price at the dock has tripled to about 45 cents each.
Oystering was a roughly $10 million fishery on Long Island before the parasites struck. Ronald Pickerell, a shellfish dealer in Centerport, said the collapse of the industry has had an effect on the local economy, because if the baymen don't make money they can't spend it.
Oystering "was half a year's salary to some of the guys here, the fishermen," Mr. Pickerell said. The lost income hurts not only the oysterman, he said, but also "the guy who owns the hardware store, the gas station, the car dealership."
In search of a solution, the hardy, individualistic oystermen have been forced into greater cooperation with state environmental officials and university researchers, and their counterparts from Connecticut, where the protozoan parasites have also severely hurt the oyster industry. So far, the protozoans have won every round.
Experts on the two pests, known as Dermo and MSX, are nevertheless hopeful they can be vanquished, or at least beaten back, and the oyster fishery restored, by applying sophisticated underwater farming techniques to replace the natural stock with hatchery-grown, parasite-resistant oyster seed.
To some extent, the problem stems from the way oystering is done on Long Island. Unlike on the Connecticut shore, where oystermen engage more in aquaculture, as underwater farming is known, local baymen have relied on nature to replenish the oyster stock.
The exceptions are a few big commercial oyster companies, notably Frank M. Flower & Sons in Oyster Bay, the largest on Long Island, that raise oyster larvae in hatchery tanks onshore and use them to seed their underwater beds leased from state or local governments.
The Dermo and MSX organisms, the experts are quick to note, present no danger to people. They are natural parasites that affect only oysters. They may infect other kinds of shellfish, but aren't lethal to them. Gregg Rivara, an educator with the Cornell Cooperative Extension program in Riverhead who has been assisting Long Island baymen in trying to improve their oyster harvest, said the parasites don't even change the taste of an infected oyster.
In the last 10 to 20 years, they havedecimated oyster crops in the Gulf of Mexico and all along the Atlantic coast, hitting Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay particularly hard. Although the parasites have been known to be present in Long Island Sound since the 1930's, little is known about them, and there is no known way to destroy them.
Dermo is caused by a single-cell protozoan called Perkinsus marinus, and is the slower-acting of the two, taking up to three years to kill an infected oyster. Its name was derived from a fungus previously thought to be the cause of the oyster disease. MSX (for multinucleated sphere X), caused by the protozoan Haplosporidium nelsoni, kills more rapidly, often within three to six weeks of infection. Because oysters take three to five years to reach marketable size, either parasite can wipe out the market.
Gordon Colvin, director of marine resources with the state Department of Environmental Conservation office in Stony Brook, said he first became aware of the infestation in midsummer 1997, when he began to receive reports of weak oysters in the bays. By late August, he said, the oyster die-off had begun.
"You can see it in Mount Sinai Harbor," he said. "It's just paved with dead oyster shells. It has gotten hard to find live oysters now."
Baymen who went out to the oyster beds expecting to harvest thousands of bushels of oysters instead found just open shells with no meat inside.
"By the end of the fall there were hardly any to harvest at all," said Mr. Lawn. "I catch like one a day," he said, noting he used to catch several hundred a day "without really trying."
This year, the baymen got more bad news. A bacteria called Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which causes a flu-like illness in people, chose an embarrassing moment to appear, just before last month's Oyster Bay Oyster Festival. Health officials closed the oyster beds in Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor, forcing Flower & Sons, which annually supplies the festival, to buy oysters from a Connecticut company.
Old-timers recalled that the parasites hit the local oyster industry hard in the early 1980's, and that it took a long time for the stock to return. So when the oyster diseases didn't abate this year, many baymen took that as a sign that it wouldn't for many more years.
"A lot of guys got out of the business," said Charlie Murphy, president of the North Shore Baymen's Association, who has been harvesting oysters out of Huntington Harbor for more than 35 years. He said many former oystermen are now employed on land remodeling houses or as landscapers and carpenters on the estates of "rich people in the Hamptons."
Those who have remained on the water have had to increase their harvest of clams to compensate, and Mr. Lawn said overfishing has begun to deplete the clam population. "Clamming is not what it used to be," he said.
Mr. Murphy said he thought the practice by local governments of granting the same unrestricted shellfishing permits to part-time and full-time fishermen has encouraged overfishing and contributed to the current problem. He said his association has suggested to state officials that they limit licenses and fishing hours and require a fisherman to show that he makes at least half his income on the water or be subject to stricter limits than a full-timer.
Aided by state and Federal grants, a vigorous effort spanning both sides of the Sound is underway to fight the oyster diseases and restore the fishery. Among the organizations involved are the Long Island Soundkeeper, with headquarters in Norwalk, Conn., the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and the United States Marine Fisheries Laboratory, both in Milford, Conn., the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation office in Stony Brook, the Cornell Cooperative Extension program in Riverhead, researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and numerous local oystermen from Connecticut and Long Island.
At the front in this battle are David Relyea, owner of Flower & Sons, and Terry Backer, the Soundkeeper. They are experimenting with ways of raising oysters with natural resistance to the parasites. Mr. Relyea declined to be interviewed, but Mr. Backer said the idea is to use natural selection against the organisms.
Even when the Dermo and MSX protozoans destroy the oyster population in an oyster bed, a small number of oysters, usually only about 5 percent, survive the predatory attack. Mr. Backer said it is thought that the survivors possess some natural quality that protects them, and that if those oysters are used to create larvae to reseed the oyster beds, their descendents may have higher survival rates. The research has only recently begun, and more time is needed to judge any success.
Mr. Colvin thought the work to develop disease-resistant oysters offered the best potential for success. He pointed to another disease that was found to be killing oysters in Long Island waters in the early 1990's, and then subsided.
"Ultimately, resistance was what got them out of that," he said. "The oysters became resistant. They just grew out of it.'
Mr. Backer said there are other avenues of research being tried. It may only be a coincidence, but the parasites seem to have their greatest lethality just after the oyster spawning, which takes place in June, July and August. Spawning takes considerable effort for oysters, leaving their meat shrunken in their shells. The old warning that one should eat oysters only in a month with no "r" in its name may have its origin in that, he said.
There are ways to genetically alter oysters to leave them sterile, by giving them an extra set of chromosomes. These oysters do not go through the rigors of spawning, and Mr. Backer said some research suggests that that may leave them with enough strength to withstand the parasites.
Salinity and water temperature also affect the survival rate of the parasites. Dermo and MSX grow best in warm, salty water, suggesting to some researchers that El Nino, which is widely believed to have caused the last two winters to be unseasonably warm and dry, may have been a factor in the decline of Long Island Sound's oyster industry.
"We haven't had a really cold winter since 1994 and 1995, when the bay froze over," Mr. Lawn said.
This has left him and other oystermen wishing for a cold winter, which could suppress the parasites. A cold winter that froze over the bays would hurt the baymen's incomes by preventing them from harvesting clams and oysters, but if it caused a higher survival rate for oysters it would be good for them in the long run, Mr. Lawn said.
Persuading the baymen to employ more sophisticated aquaculture methods has gained advocates on both sides of the Sound. Large oyster companies already do it, and if smaller, independent operators did too, it would make oystering more like farming and less dependent on the vagaries of nature.
Raising the farmed oysters in deeper water is another measure being advocated. Oyster farmers typically raise their set, the tiny half-inch oysters recently hatched from larvae, close to shore, then transplant them to other beds in deeper water, spreading them out to encourage larger, rounder shell growth, which makes them more marketable. The deeper water is also colder, which retards the growth of the parasites. Combined with the disease resistance being bred in the hatcheries, the crops, oyster farmers hope, will be far safer from the parasites.
Mr. Rivara said local oystermen had shunned aquaculture out of fear it would encourage more big companies to move in, driving the independent operators out of business. But Mr. Rivara argued that oyster farming could actually allow one-man operations to flourish. He said that if the oystermen put down their own clutch, the washed oyster shells to which juvenile oysters attach to grow and seem to prefer, and seeded it with disease-resistant oyster larvae grown in hatcheries as Flower & Sons have, they could create new beds.
In the long run, Mr. Rivara noted, the oyster industry on Long Island will be cyclical, periodically struck by disease, unless more sophisticated methods of underwater farming are adopted. In fact, the ravages of Dermo and MSX may have actually provided the baymen with an opportunity.
"We can't develop, at least not yet, a resistant oyster without the disease present," he said. "So this is a good time to work on this."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Nov. 29 about the collapse of the Long Island oyster harvest misstated the traditional rule about oyster-eating. In any month without an "r" in its name, oysters are to be avoided, not eaten.

In a country run by the military, a station manager sees talk radio as a democratic duty.

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer 

 BODY:
IN the scattered cities of Niger, they have talk radio of a different kind. It's more like walk-in radio. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, farmers and merchants and homemakers gather outside the independent stations run by Radio Anfani in Niamey, Maradi and Zinder to await the start of a two-hour program.
They want to talk about their children's health or the price of tomatoes or the latest decree of the military Government of Ibrahim Bare Mainassara. They want to talk about some of the news broadcast by Radio Anfani, like reports translated from Voice of America or the German service Deutsche Welle. 
 "We don't take telephone callers and put them on the air," explained Gremah Boucar, the director general of Radio Anfani. Those who own telephones, he explained, are automatically considered rich, and "it shouldn't be such a small circle" of people doing the talking.
For a fee equivalent to about $1 a year -- not so small in a country where per capita share of the gross domestic product is $200 a year -- listeners can join Radio Anfani's club, which has 36,000 members. Membership lets them talk to listeners and suggest programming changes or otherwise object to the material the stations broadcast. "The only way to really be free is to accept criticism," Mr. Boucar said.
In Niger, a landlocked country of 10 million people without Don Imus, Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern, Arbitron ratings or democracy, radio is a truly intimate medium. When people want to talk, they walk in and talk. When the military -- sorry, maybe it was just people in stolen military uniforms -- wants to close down a station, it storms in and smashes the equipment. When people who control the military or the police want to lodge a complaint about his news broadcasts, they take Gremah Boucar from home, stuff him in a bag, throw him on a flatbed truck and spend hours discussing how to kill him.
Mr. Boucar, a 39-year-old who saw a journalist for the first time when Niger's President came to his village of Maine-Soroa 30 years ago, is about as distant from New York's and Washington's brand of journalism as possible. His country is remote and obscure, often confused with its richer and more populous neighbor, Nigeria. His medium is radio. In the archipelago of settled communities in Africa, it is more ubiquitous and influential than any newspaper.
He and his editorial committee create their 20-hour-a-day schedule with a practical eye. They produce programs on health (ways to prevent AIDS or diarrheal illness in infants), the economy (the price of food) and politics (including pronouncements of Mr. Mainassara's political opponents).
Mr. Boucar's attitude toward his profession carries none of the overt cynicism about the business that tends to permeate discussions in this country. "It seems to me that journalism goes with democracy," he said. To practice journalism, therefore, is to give life to democracy. "My moral obligation," he calls it.
Such earnest simplicity can veer into the dreaded realm of platitude. But that is a risk the Committee to Protect Journalists is willing to take when it gives out its International Press Freedom awards. At its annual dinner last week, the group honored Mr. Boucar and four other journalists, from Indonesia, Peru, Belarus and Eritrea, who have been persecuted, arrested, tried and otherwise hindered by governments that have little history of -- or tolerance for -- a free press.
It was an occasion for some of the profession's most accomplished or just plain famous members to take a quick refresher course in the underpinnings of the business.
Sure, like any occasion that mixes professional pride with expensive food, tuxedos and celebrity, it had its Tom Wolfish moments. (What to do? Listen to Mr. Boucar's paean to democracy and a free press, or try to spot the actress Sharon Stone?)
Still, celebrity watching and financial prodding aside, the persecuted foreign journalists and their pampered domestic counterparts have something to offer each other. When Mr. Boucar was arrested, the outcry of groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the accompanying protests by American diplomats, helped free him, or so he tells it. When Anna Zarkova, a Bulgarian journalist who covers her country's mafia, had acid thrown on her face, blinding one eye, as she walked down a Sofia street six months ago, it was the material and psychic support of groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women's Media Foundation that helped lift her from a profound depression, or so she told friends.
In return, Mr. Boucar offers a reminder that simple news broadcasts and open-mike programs and a willingness to reflect diverse political viewpoints can be a precious commodity in countries where the life expectancy of a person is less than 50 years and the life expectancy of a democracy is less than three.
After nearly 20 years, the event "still maintains its power," said Gene Roberts, the committee's chairman and a former managing editor of The New York Times. "If anything, it seems to increase each year. The dinner always runs an hour and a half too long. There's only one way to make it stay within space limitations -- severely limit the time that the awardees have." That, the group is unwilling to do -- it would be like editing the apostles.

Taiwan and Its Troubles as an Underdog

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
In an age distinguished by mass cruelty wherever one looks, Americans may be forgiven if they have not given much attention, in the intervals between emergencies, to the decades of troubles of the people of Taiwan. Tonight, to repair the neglect, comes "Tug-of-War: The Story of Taiwan," which offers a glimpse of history from the perspective of a perpetual underdog caught up in wars, occupations, power plays and other ills of the weak confronted by the strong.
The problem, as the narrator notes, begins with geography. Lying 90 miles from China, the island of Taiwan has always been "too near to China to be different, too far away to be the same." 
 Although they are mostly of Chinese stock, the Taiwanese had a reputation for independence, not that it did them much good in 1895, when their island fell into the hands of the Japanese.
When Japan invaded China in 1937, the Taiwanese found themselves drafted to fight for the invaders. Without much affection for either side, they were pawns in a political contest that they had no power to influence.
The 90-minute program gives a sense of what it was like for a politically marginal people caught up after World War II in what seemed like a remote civil war in China and then the even more remote maneuverings of the cold war. (For viewers of a certain age, the names Quemoy and Matsu may recall panicky threats of war between the United States and Communist China.)
The Nationalist Chinese who fled the mainland after the Communist takeover and established themselves in Taiwan saw the island as enemy territory; after decades of occupation, its people seemed more Japanese than Chinese. Efforts at independence were crushed by the Nationalists. The Taiwanese had a pithy line for the change in rule, from Japanese to Chinese: "The dog leaves, but the pig comes."
The doleful history is brightened by a look at how American aid, shifts in diplomatic calculations, the famous Nixon opening to China, economic success and the rise of an indigenous opposition movement against the Nationalists has brought more freedom and a reassertion of cultural identity to the islanders in recent years.
Taiwan has joined the other "mini-dragons" of Southeast Asia in the "economic miracle" club, at least for now. The lure of the vast Chinese market is strong -- money has a way of making allies -- but the worries about provoking China with too flagrant a show of independence remain real.
As ever, the Taiwanese remain at the mercy of other, greater powers.

The power-drunk high-technology world seems to be trying to one-up itself in the cynicism department.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
NO matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up."
That aphorism, a sage comment on the absurdities of 1980's culture, was written by Jane Wagner for the actress Lily Tomlin, in their 1985 Broadway hit, "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe." 
 But Ms. Wagner and Ms. Tomlin could just as well have applied that same observation to the trajectory of the 1990's money- and power-drunk world of high technology, an industry that seems to be trying to one-up itself, almost daily, in the "how cynical can we get?" department.
Just how cynical indeed is becoming abundantly clear as the board room and courtroom dramas play out between the Microsoft Corporation and its archrivals -- the Netscape Communications Corporation, America Online Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. -- and, of course, the United States Government.
Hard-core cynics find honesty contemptible unless it serves a purpose; the truth too often makes suckers out of those who practice it. It is an attitude so embedded in our business culture that feigned ignorance is now an acceptable courtroom defense.
For example, we shake our heads and tut-tut when we read about the videotaped deposition in which Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, the most powerful and feared executive in all of technology, "cannot recall" a single negative E-mail or its context, even when the wording suggests that he was articulating his ideas, plans, visions and strategies with great fervor.
 Yet few people, in or out of the industry, cried foul when one of Mr. Gates's advisers -- a former Justice Department official, no less -- characterized the Gates testimony as a success because he had refused to concede anything to his questioners, even when it appeared they had him dead to rights.
And how cynical is it for some industry executives who say they believe in an unfettered free market -- and who, not coincidentally, reap the secondary benefits of Microsoft's success -- to argue that Microsoft's dominance has been good for consumers?
Most economists would argue that what is good for software buyers -- whether corporate or consumer -- is choice and quality. Microsoft asserts that the market domination of its Windows operating system insures both, by providing a stable platform on which developers can build myriad application programs.
Certainly true -- until one then considers that most of Microsoft's vast revenues derive from its own Windows applications. Few companies are brave enough to develop products that compete head on with Microsoft's; historically, the odds of winning that market battle are next to zero.
But choice spurs quality. One could argue, for instance, that the very best software Microsoft has produced in the last 10 years has been its browser, Internet Explorer.
Coincidence? Not likely. Internet Explorer is Microsoft's only major consumer application that has had serious competition -- Netscape's Navigator, which once dominated its market niche at the 90 percent levels of Microsoft's Windows.
Microsoft joined the battle with a huge advantage: it could afford to give its browser away free, and did so. When that failed, Microsoft -- in what may someday be known as one of the greatest cynical acts in industry history -- effectively killed the entire market segment by declaring the browser to be not a browser but the "HTML engine" of Windows, an inextricable component of its operating system.
But the deepest cynicism, set forth with great righteousness by Microsoft and its defenders, is their assertion that, given the opportunity to do so, its competitors would act exactly as Microsoft has.
Unfortunately, this defense is absolutely true. Strong-arm tactics and cutthroat behavior have long been considered not just acceptable business practices in technology, but de rigueur. And all the industry aspires to the stock price and the market heft of Microsoft -- although none want to be sued by the Government, of course.
But the argument is specious. No other company has the opportunity to act like Microsoft; it is too late.
Not surprisingly, Microsoft was quick to point to last week's announcement of America Online's takeover of Netscape as proof that there is plenty of healthy competition in the industry.
But while consolidation sometimes enhances competition, even a troika as apparently formidable as the America Online, Netscape and Sun Microsystems alliance lacks the muscle to nudge Microsoft from its market dominance or to stem its hegemony in cyberspace.
Even if the alliance were to conquer every new market they envision, the personal computer market is enormous and still growing, and most new -- and old -- machines will be powered by Microsoft's operating system for many years to come.
But the merger announcement was a classic tactic for a cynical industry. Many such announcements have been made over the last decade or so, and despite the vast media coverage they engender, most do not work and are quietly dismantled later, when their public relations value has waned.
Such cynicism is perfectly legal, of course, but it demeans everything it touches. It demands that we take nothing at face value, because everyone has an agenda and everything has a price. At some point, even principled people start to waver: "If they can do it, why shouldn't I get mine, too?"
By most accounts, that is where the technology industry is today, a game with few rules and only brute moves -- jockeying for position, cutting the flanks of the competition whenever possible. Yet, that game, too, has a price -- but it is a price of a different, more personal sort.
As Jane Wagner put it so eloquently, "The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat."

Exxon-Mobil Talks Add To Oil Workers' Anxiety
They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when the 900 remaining blue-collar workers at Mobil's largest domestic refinery in Beaumont, Tex., heard that their company was in merger talks with Exxon, it was like an alarm warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow.
"I think it's a terrible thing," said Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerged from the main gate after his 12-hour shift. "It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. It's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it." Page A1.

HEADLINE: Big Bonuses Expected With Merger of Deutsche and Bankers Trust

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank A.G. is expected to provide multimillion-dollar incentives to a handful of top Bankers Trust and Deutsche executives to secure their services once the German banking giant completes its $9.67 billion purchase of Bankers Trust.
The acquisition is expected to be announced formally this morning in Frankfurt. The boards of both companies gave final approval to the deal late yesterday. 
 Executives involved in the merger talks said the select top bankers would each receive at least $10 million to stay with the merged company for an undisclosed period of time, to help insure that managers crucial to the merger's success are in place. Hundreds of other employees of the investment banking unit will receive smaller incentives.
Although fat bonuses have never been known to be guarantors of long-term loyalty on Wall Street, those who will receive the largest financial incentives include at least six Bankers Trust executives and three Deutsche executives, all of whom will be overseeing the enlarged investment banking business created by Deutsche's purchase.
From the Bankers Trust side, the executives include the bank's chairman, Frank S. Newman; Mary Cirillo, who will run the new unit's global custody business; Yves de Balmann and Mayo Shattuck, who will jointly manage the new investment banking business; Ted Virtue, who will run corporate finance, and Robert Ferguson, who will supervise retail brokerage activities.
From the Deutsche Bank side, the executives include Josef Ackermann, who oversaw Deutsche's investment banking business; Edson Mitchell, who will oversee global debt trading in the new business, and Michael Phillip, who will oversee the equities business of the merged company.
All of these executives will be members of the merged company's investment banking committee, which will be supervised by Mr. Ackermann and Mr. Newman.
The big payouts are being offered although Deutsche Bank has been badly burned in the past when it gave lucrative pay packages in an effort to secure what it believed to be top investment banking talent. Most notably, Deutsche went on an expensive shopping spree to build up its Deutsche Morgan Grenfell investment banking unit with very little impact on the bank's bottom line.
Nonetheless, Deutsche has to do something to make sure that the acquisition goes as smoothly as possible, given the potential for client defections or a late start in snaring new business if the investment banking unit lacks direction and stability. Deutsche already lost dozens of investment bankers earlier this year who specialized in making deals in high-technology businesses.
The bank is expected to retreat from its policy of awarding bonuses in the form of Deutsche Bank shares.
At Bankers Trust, the senior ranks have been badly divided in recent months both because of the heavy trading losses the bank suffered in Russia and other emerging markets and by disagreement about how the bank was managing its risky junk bond business. Much of the ill will growing from these problems at Bankers Trust has been directed internally at Mr. Newman, even though the economic downturn overseas affected a broad array of financial services companies.
Bankers Trust has also struggled to integrate the Baltimore brokerage firm Alex. Brown into its ranks. It acquired Alex. Brown last year, but a number of senior executives left the firm over concerns about how it was being managed, and the unit has experienced continuing morale problems.
If Mr. Newman faces a challenge in carving out a role for himself as a co-director of Deutsche's new investment banking unit, he can still play a valuable part helping to overcome regulatory hurdles. Mr. Newman, a former Treasury Department official, is well connected in Washington. Deutsche is likely to face tough regulatory scrutiny about some of its industrial and financial holdings in Germany, as well as its involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II and its handling of bank accounts owned by Jewish depositors.
Deutsche plans to pay cash for Bankers Trust, and executives involved in the merger talks said that Deutsche would raise that money through a mixture of new stock and bond offerings.
While it is still unclear how many layoffs will result from the acquisition, executives involved in the transaction said cuts would fall most heavily on administrative staff in Europe and the United States as well as managers and employees in the fixed-income and equities businesses. The two banks together employ about 9,000 people in Britain, where a sizable number of layoffs is likely, and have overlapping investment banking operations in New York, another likely setting for cutbacks.
If the acquisition is completed, it will be the biggest purchase of an American financial services firm by a foreign company and will create the largest financial services firm in the world, with about $850 billion in assets.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Increase Package Of Aid to Palestinians

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The United States will pledge hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians this week and is pressing other wealthy nations to dramatically increase economic assistance to encourage the Palestinians to stick to the peace process with Israel, senior Clinton Administration officials said.
The new American aid package, to be announced on Monday at a one-day international donors' conference here, could total as much as $900 million over the next five years, officials said. In all, they hope the conference will raise $2.3 billion for the Palestinians, the amount pledged at the last major donors' conference in October 1993, shortly after the Oslo peace accords. 
 "I'm not going to tell you precisely what we'll pledge because we're still in consultations with Congress," a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week. "But I can tell you that we do plan to substantially increase the amount of assistance that we will provide for this next five-year period."
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will be the host for the conference, which will be attended by President Clinton; Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab nations.
"We'd like to see if we can do better" than in 1993, the State Department official said. "One way to underpin peace and to build a constituency of peace is to make certain that people are better off."
The Israeli Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, will not attend the conference because of what American officials described as domestic political turmoil. The Israeli team will be led by the Director General of the Foreign Ministry, Eytan Bentsur.
Mr. Arafat arrived in Washington on Saturday and had lunch today with Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley and a group of 15 American business leaders. He also met groups of Arab Americans.
In past years, much of the American aid money for the Palestinians has been used for infrastructure, including the paving of more than 400 miles of roads that knit together scattered towns and villages in the West Bank and Gaza.
American aid to the Palestinians is expected to increase, in part because of promises that President Clinton made to Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority and to Israel that Washington would pick up much of the bill for the land-for-security plan that was hammered out in negotiations last month in Wye, Md.
The Israelis are expected to seek up to $1.2 billion in additional aid as a result of the Wye agreement, while Palestinian officials have suggested that they will solicit as much as $400 million in new aid.
The United States also hopes that an expanded aid package to the Palestinians will allow Mr. Arafat to blunt the influence of the radical Islamic militant organization Hamas, which has built public support by sponsoring medical clinics, schools and sport clubs.
State Department officials said only two Arab nations -- Syria and Lebanon -- turned down invitations to the meeting on Monday, just as they did when invited to the 1993 conference. Syria and the Syrian-controlled Government of Lebanon have been harsh critics of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Even as they spoke optimistically about the chances of increasing aid to the Palestinians, State Department officials acknowledged that they had effectively suspended plans to open a Middle East development bank, an institution that they had once billed as a symbol of economic cooperation among Israel, the Palestinians and their neighbors.
Plans for the Middle East and North Africa Development Bank were announced in 1994. The bank, with the United States as its largest shareholder, was supposed to encourage Israelis and Arabs to work together with private investors on regional development projects.
But the United States was unable to get the main Middle East partners in the project -- Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians -- to agree on a charter for the bank. And without their support, State Department officials said, Congress refused to make a contribution to capitalize the bank.

HEADLINE: For Oil Workers, Merger Is Just Another Word for More Layoffs

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: BEAUMONT, Tex., Nov. 29

 BODY:
They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow.
"I think it's a terrible thing," said Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after his 12-hour shift ended at 4:30 this morning. He stopped to rub eyes rimmed with red, but on this topic his bedtime could be delayed. "It's a revival of the Standard Oil Company. It's going to put 20 or 30 thousand people out of work. I think the Justice Department should step in and stop it." 
 Ernest Lewis, whose overalls bore a "Big E" patch appropriate to his scale, added his uh-huh's. The latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions who now operate the refinery's generators.
But if the Mobil Corporation has to be sold, Mr. Lewis said, noting the gains in his company stock holdings, a buyer as solid and large as the Exxon Corporation might be the least of all evils. "If we merged with Chevron, we'd be Moron," he added.
A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries, in petroleum as much as any.
Those here point to the tote board by the Beaumont plant's brick headquarters, which they say shows they have already handled 171 million barrels out of 130 million planned for the full year. But the numbers that matter even more are the ones like 89.9, 88.9, even 81.9, on nearby gas stations -- the lowest prices for a gallon of gas, after inflation, since the Depression.
Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company. Some people close to the talks cautioned, however, that no final deal had been reached and nothing would be considered by the companies' boards until at least Tuesday, maybe Wednesday.
But as of last Wednesday evening, the phone at the home of Jimmy Herrington, the president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 4-243, began ringing without stop. No, he did not know about that merger talk on television, said Mr. Herrington, who also works full-time producing lubricants. He had asked some Mobil managers, in a meeting earlier this month, about all the rumors, but they said they had heard nothing.
Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the field. One company's accountants could almost do the work for two.
But the crews here fully expect that an Exxon or any other buyer would ask yet again whether the refinery could turn more crude oil into gasoline, motor oil and other products with even fewer people.
Union leaders raise the prospect that Exxon would have to sell the refinery. Antitrust regulators, they say, are bound to notice that Exxon has refineries an hour's drive in one direction and three hours in the other, along a Gulf of Mexico crescent that forms the petrochemical industry's home.
The Beaumont plant, a steaming, humming chemistry set lining the Neches River off the Gulf, has become the prime provider of livelihoods here since it was built almost under the spray of the nearby Spindletop gusher.
With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year. "People go there to retire there," Mr. Herrington said, as he drove around the plant's fenced periphery.
Mr. Lewis, in his 17th year, is a third-generation employee. But his nephew laboring here as well is the exception. The workers streaming to and from the plant before dawn are mostly balding or going gray, a sign that for a full generation the refinery has been more concerned about how to get rid of workers than how to attract them.
The cutbacks have, so far, come through attrition, with early retirements often encouraged by incentives. But the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around Mr. Herrington's union hall advertise that the best times are long gone.
His members chafe at the experts who come from Wall Street to question the justification for every person's job. Working in tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant has become safer over the years). They complain about the growing numbers of outside contractors taking over formerly unionized tasks.
But with many workers choosing to invest at least some retirement savings in Mobil stock, a 1990's ethos is gaining. Some share credit with the plant's management for the efficiency measures they agree are necessary for true job security. Some take the attitude that every company is always for sale.
"They will not be too concerned about what we feel about it," said Sam Salim, one of the electrical plant workers whose future is uncertain. "But if they fork out $60 billion? I'd look it over."
With most Mobil executives saying as little as possible for now, calls today to the local plant manager and a company spokesman did not elicit a response.
Union leaders, however, are already objecting. "I don't believe creating new monopolies is the way to prop up the industry," said Robert E. Wages, a former refinery operator himself and now the union's national president, by telephone on Saturday. The union, with foresight worthy of a risk arbitrager on Wall Street, negotiated a clause in last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any buyer of the company would have to keep to its terms.
Many union members, who typically came to Mobil after high school, are already wary of Exxon's intentions.
"They're the biggest," said Bobby Whisneant, an assistant operator producing gasoline and lubricants, referring to Exxon. "So they go buy the second biggest. That's one way to get rid of the competition. I just hope it's not something like the 80's -- buying companies and scrapping them."
Or something like the robber baron era a century before, said Mr. Mabry, another operator.
"Didn't the teachers teach us all through school that the Standard Oil Company would never come back? Remember that?" he asked, looking to his friend, Mr. Lewis, for support. "But I better shut up. I still work for Mobil."
"Used to," Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: Burying the Past: War Guilt Haunts Japan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Just last month, Japan had seemed to be making major progress in laying World War II to rest, forthrightly apologizing to South Koreans for its behavior and receiving something of an absolution from the visiting Korean President.
Then President Jiang Zemin of China arrived on the first visit ever by a Chinese head of state and asked for a similar apology. And suddenly, like a forgotten old jack-in-the-box, history leaped out of the past to roil the present and the future. 
 Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered Mr. Jiang the traditional welcome gift -- a statement of "deep remorse" for Japan's war-time conduct -- but Mr. Jiang wanted an actual formal written apology. And Japan refused.
The grim shadowboxing these days as Mr. Jiang travels around Japan on a six-day visit, exhorting his hosts to confront their past while he is told to pipe down, underscores the degree to which East Asia's history dominates the present. Here, the most important tensions are not rooted in present-day disagreements but rather in 60-year-old wounds that have never healed.
Mr. Jiang's trip began with the troublesome meeting with Mr. Obuchi and continued along the same thorny path, as he made speeches in which he offered pointed advice to Japanese audiences to remember the past and was confronted by hecklers who denounced China's nuclear weapons program and who criticized plans for Japanese-Chinese cooperation.
Mr. Jiang's visit ends Monday and has achieved progress in such areas as youth exchanges and environmental cooperation. But instead of easing the most important source of tensions between the two great powers of East Asia -- the common history that divides them -- the visit seems to have backfired and left the region quarreling as painfully as ever about responsibility for the past.
To Chinese, Japan's reluctance to apologize formally suggests a dark ambivalence about one of the bloodiest invasions in human history. Many Chinese are honestly fearful of Japan's long-run intentions, and some passionately warn Americans not to be fooled by a Japan that they believe is itching to rise up in arms again. Chinese are outraged when Japanese officials periodically suggest that the Rape of Nanking -- in which Japanese troops killed tens of thousands of Chinese in 1937 -- was much ado about nothing or that Japan was not an aggressor in the war.
"Some Japanese, even in high positions, have distorted history and tried to gloss over Japan's invasion of China," Mr. Jiang declared Saturday. "The Chinese people have felt hurt because of this conduct."
To Japanese, who often feel that half their diplomacy in Asia is spent bowing abjectly in regret for events that occurred before most of today's Japanese were born, Mr. Jiang's behavior has been impolite and calculating, simply an effort to push the guilt button and gain more concessions. Moreover, most Japanese see the most important threat to peace in the region in the long run coming from China, and there has been growing annoyance within Japan at the Chinese demands.
"Isn't this a finished problem?" asked Hiromu Nonaka, Japan's chief cabinet secretary and one of the country's most powerful politicians. "There is a school of thought that Japan has already reflected on its past and apologized to China any number of times already."
Mr. Jiang was originally scheduled to visit in September, and if he had come then the summit meeting might have gone much more smoothly. But then Mr. Jiang delayed the trip because of the floods at home.
In the meantime, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea visited Japan early last month, and the meeting went extraordinarily well. Never had Japan apologized so graciously to a neighboring country for war-time conduct, and never had another nation accepted the apology with such magnanimity.
Prime Minister Obuchi, according to a written statement of his meeting with President Kim, "expressed remorseful repentance and heartfelt apology." Mr. Kim responded that it was time to move on and called for a "future-oriented relationship."
When Mr. Jiang's visit was rescheduled, he demanded the same kind of written apology that Mr. Kim had received. Japan refused, saying that its maximum offer was an oral apology by Mr. Obuchi and a standard written expression of deep remorse.
Why the sharp distinction? The explanation is partly linguistic, because the term that is usually translated into English as remorse -- "hansei" -- is actually a bit vaguer than that. It can mean remorse, but it can also mean self-reflection about even minor matters. A child, for example, might be told to show "hansei" for some mischief, and the term is far less weighty than the various words for apologies.
Akitaka Saiki, Prime Minister Obuchi's spokesman, offered a couple of reasons why Japan was willing to apologize in writing to South Korea but not to China. First, he said, Japan had colonized Korea but not China, and so the circumstances were different. Second, he added, Japan's Emperor had already gone to China and apologized for the war, while the Emperor has not visited Korea yet.
It is true that Japan annexed the Korean peninsula and forced Koreans to speak Japanese and take Japanese names, something that never happened in China. But Japan also did establish a puppet state in Manchuria after invading it in 1931, and it dropped plague germs over China to start epidemics and killed and tortured far more Chinese than Koreans.
Moreover, although Emperor Akihito did go to China, he quite deliberately did not apologize for the war. He instead simply expressed deep sadness about "an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great suffering on the people of China."
The real reason for the recent difference in apologies to Japan and Korea seems to go deeper. Under the previous South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, Japanese relations with South Korea were just as testy as relations with China. But Kim Dae Jung was perceived as genuinely eager to start a new chapter in relations.
"While President Kim made it clear that he would like to settle past history," Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura told reporters, "it was not necessarily the case" with President Jiang.
Indeed, many diplomats and scholars say that China's leaders have been less interested in healing the wounds of history than in reminding everyone of their existence. The Communist Party derives its legitimacy in part from the spirited resistance it led against Japanese invaders, and whenever it wants something from Tokyo it thunders about Japanese war brutality.
Perhaps for these reasons, there has been a remarkable inflation in the number of Chinese reported killed in the war with Japan. Immediately after the war, China announced that Japan had killed 1.75 million of its people, although that figure included only soldiers; it was considered impossible to determine how many civilians had been killed.
After it came to power, the Chinese Communist Party declared that 9.32 million Chinese had been killed, civilians included, and that figure stood for many years. Finally, in a speech in 1995, President Jiang raised the casualty estimate to 35 million, and now that is the official Chinese figure.
Mr. Jiang repeated the 35 million estimate in his speeches in Japan, and added: "I, as a witness of history, have the responsibility to convey the historical facts to the younger generation."
What Mr. Jiang himself witnessed is a bit unclear, although it is known that his junior high school was seized by the Japanese Army and turned into a stable. But as Japanese diplomats sometimes note, far more Chinese were killed by the Communist Party than by the Japanese Army. Yet when Chinese scholars raise the issue of Communist excesses, the Communist Party has emphasized the need to forget about past mistakes and move on.

HEADLINE: Subsidy for the Stock Exchange

 BODY:
New York City's economy is diverse, but no industry comes close to the financial business in its importance to the welfare of the city. The New York Stock Exchange, which has been on Wall Street for more than 200 years, is both the symbolic and actual center of that business. Now the exchange says it needs to expand its trading floor to make its operations more international and to remain competitive.
The question that faces the Giuliani and Pataki administrations is whether a financial-aid package intended to keep the exchange in lower Manhattan is corporate welfare on a grand scale or a necessary investment to preserve the city's tax base. Keeping the exchange in its traditional location will require the largest subsidy package in city history, but the investment is justifiable, for the loss of the tax revenues generated by the exchange and related businesses would be devastating. 
 The plan calls for the city and state to buy the block across Broad Street from the exchange's current facility -- between Broad and William Streets and between Wall Street and Exchange Place. The historic facade of the J. P. Morgan building at 23 Wall Street would be preserved as the buildings on the block were torn down.
In their place would rise a large office tower, with the bottom floors containing the new trading area, and associated computer operations, while the upper floors would be rented out to corporate customers. The rent from the exchange and the payments in lieu of taxes from the developer of the office tower are expected to offset the $250 million to $300 million cost of acquiring the land.
 The city and state would pay up to $450 million to build the new trading area, with the exchange paying several hundred million dollars to outfit it. There would be $160 million in tax concessions.
Such a generous package may seem excessive. But a decision by the exchange to leave lower Manhattan would damage the city's economy, and the exchange has threatened to move to New Jersey if a deal is not reached by Thursday.
We understand why some oppose on principle any concession to the blackmailing tactics of businesses that threaten to move unless they get public assistance. But the reality is that if New York City refuses to play this game, other, hungrier cities and states will take advantage of that passivity. Then Manhattan, in particular, will see its prestige residents lured away like so many free agents.
If the exchange did leave, the city and state would lose much of the income taxes now paid by those who work there. Many companies that need to be close to the exchange would also move, causing property values -- and property tax revenues -- to fall significantly.
The New York Stock Exchange is the pre-eminent stock exchange in the world, but it faces challenges from Europe, where the new euro currency will encourage consolidation and major exchanges are trying to cooperate. The new trading floor will help the Big Board, and the taxes generated by its location in Manhattan will more than offset the high cost of this plan.

King of Chutzpah

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In blowing off the House Judiciary Committee's 81 interrogatories, a mockingly evasive Bill Clinton told the Congress of the United States: Take your impeachment process and stick it in your ear.
Somewhere up in Modified Limited Hangout Heaven, Richard Nixon is applauding. Clinton is carrying out his Watergate credo: Presidents caught covering up admit only a mistake -- and never give their enemies an inch on having broken any law. 
 Clinton stiffed the Congress on questions about the most characteristic moment in his Presidency. In January, caught lying under oath in the Jones lawsuit, he consulted Dick Morris about the people's reaction if he told the truth. 
Morris testified he took a poll showing public forgiveness about adultery but not about perjury. He reported Clinton's declaration of dishonesty: "We just have to win, then" -- that is, to hang tough with his line of lies.
In his answer to Congress, Clinton had to admit the polling consultation because phone records back up what Morris told the grand jury. But that damning quote about winning by lying? Clinton answered "I do not recall."
He dared not deny outright saying that because Morris's habit is to make contemporaneous notes on his laptop of all conversations with Clinton. (By the way -- who paid for the historic poll that led Clinton to his ruination?)
Such exquisite disremembering is typical of the Clinton defense. Its guiding principle: If you can prove wrongdoing, I'll admit it, but not if it's a crime. In his grand jury testimony, Clinton took the position that he never touched Monica Lewinsky intimately, not even once -- look, Ma, no hands -- yet he and his lawyers assert that he did not lie under oath.
Words have meaning. You can argue that lying under oath about sex does not rise to an impeachable offense, but if what Bill Clinton told that grand jury is not lying under oath, then nothing is lying under oath.
What Clinton has done in his mocking answers to 81 questions is to fling down a gauntlet: Impeach me if you dare. If you dare not, then the only adjectives acceptable to me in a shame-on-you resolution are "indefensible" and "wrong" about my initial behavior, and "misled" about my subsequent denials under oath (not "lied" and certainly never "unlawful"). You have my permission to be cross, goes his message -- but not judgmental.
Clinton's present in-your-face attitude places many representatives in a pickle. Do they let him treat them with unconcealed contempt, or do they let him force them to hit him harder than they want to?
Most will base their vote against impeachment less on the rule of law than on a simple judgment: whether this helps or hurts them in the next election.
Few doubt that on the basis of the last election, Democrats should oppose impeachment. Clinton is triumphalistic; the market is booming; Ken Starr proved only lies about sex; nothing can stop the move-on movement. But politicians know that it is in the nature of the political wheel to turn.
Two years hence, we could be in a recession, with people finding fault. A missile from a rogue nation could remind us who opposed a missile defense. With the statute of limitations run, Chinese fund-raising culprits could start confessing for fame and profit. Memoirists will be impelled to reveal all and Democratic partisans will claim to be shocked, shocked at President Pinocchio.
If the Clinton star falls again, as it has twice before, few candidates for re-election will want to say to their constituents: This fellow you are reviling in 2000 is the one I saved from retribution in 1998.
That is why Democrats, denied a genuine contrition fix, want the shame-on-you way out. They want to be able to say: "I voted to verbally skin him alive; I wasn't soft on Clinton's wrongdoing." A scolding resolution is their insurance policy for giving him a constitutional pass. They are desperate to get right with the possible condemnation of voters in the next election.
House Republicans rightly don't want them to get away with it. And the Comeback Kid, by coming back too cockily, is helping those who want to let the Senate make the final judgment.

HEADLINE: Bishops Appeal for Aid to Hurricane Victims

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the Archbishop of Honduras said he had come to St. Patrick's Cathedral mainly to give thanks.
But in his chronicle of the devastation a hurricane called Mitch had wrought on his small, hungry country, Archbishop Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga made one thing plain: the time for giving was not over. 
 With bridges and highways washed away, crops destroyed and disease spreading quickly among the very poor, he said, the wrath of Hurricane Mitch was not likely to end anytime soon.
"In two days, we went backwards 50 years," he said.
Barely a month after the hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster to strike Central America this century, killed more than 10,000 people in Honduras and Nicaragua, the Archbishop said the planes bearing food and relief supplies from abroad were coming less and less often -- "I would say rather seldom."
The appeal by the Archbishop, who spoke yesterday morning, was followed in the afternoon by that of Bishop Leopoldo Brenes of Nicaragua. A collection was taken up for Central American flood relief; so far, the New York Archdiocese has distributed about $3.75 million in food, medicine, water and clothing.
As residents of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, braced for another round of rain and flooding, Archbishop Rodriguez stressed that the need for immediate short-term relief remained. Bodies were still being pulled from under the wreckage, he said, with 7,000 Hondurans confirmed dead and 8,000 missing.
In Tegucigalpa alone, he said, more than 150,000 people remained homeless and the city's poorest neighborhoods lacked clean potable water. Cases of dengue and typhoid have been reported, he said, and hepatitis and malaria, chronic health concerns in Honduras, have worsened. The Archbishop said people were afraid to eat meat for fear of what the surviving livestock may have eaten.
Perhaps worst of all, he said, was the sweeping destruction of Honduras's banana and coffee plantations, which for years have been the country's main cash crops and the source of much of its foreign exchange. Two weeks ago, international lending agencies estimated that Honduras and Nicaragua, the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti, suffered about $5 billion in losses, equivalent to nearly half their gross national products.
The Archbishop pressed the Federal Government to use its leverage by urging its allies to forgive Honduras's foreign debts and persuading international banks to extend low-interest loans to resuscitate businesses and rebuild the infrastructure. He also urged officials in Washington to consider a temporary program giving illegal Honduran immigrants legal status. Similar programs have been set up for other Central Americans fleeing wars over the last 10 years.
The Clinton Administration is now considering granting temporary protective status to illegal immigrants from the four Central American nations that bore the brunt of the storm: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.
"We would like to have status for the people already here," the Archbishop said. "Most of the people who come here are the poorest."

HEADLINE: Parents and Teachers Leery of New 4th-Grade English Test

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
A new reading and writing test will be given to fourth graders across New York State early next year, and it is so different from traditional multiple-choice tests that teachers and parents can barely contain their panic.
Like its predecessors, the test includes multiple-choice questions, with circles that must be filled in with a No. 2 pencil. But for the first time it also has pages and pages of blank lines for children to take notes on a story read aloud and to write literary critiques and a personal essay. The essay section alone takes 50 minutes and the entire test is given over three days. 
 The test, called the English Language Arts test, is based on new standards developed by the state that require fourth graders not only to read proficiently but also to write analytically about what they have read. Two-thirds of the test consists of writing about literature.
Some teachers contend that not all 9-year-olds are ready for a test that requires so much abstract thinking and writing. "It's like a ride in an amusement park," said Nancy Baron, a teacher at the Chatsworth Avenue School, a public school in Larchmont. "There are some children who shouldn't go on that ride right now because they are too short."
The test is important not only to the children whose educational futures it will help shape, but also to the reputations of schools, school districts and communities.
In New York City, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has proposed that beginning in 2000, fourth graders who flunk the state test not be promoted to fifth grade. And for children in some parts of the city -- including the Upper West Side, Park Slope, Bay Ridge and parts of Queens -- test scores can help determine whether they will be admitted to middle school. Administrators there are now wrestling with questions like whether to count the new test for middle-school admission, and if so whether to count the whole test or just the multiple-choice part.
For schools across the state, whether children pass the test will determine whether the state deems the school to be failing, a ruling that can trigger state monitoring and the removal of principals and teachers. In the suburbs, test scores also help determine real estate values.
"If everybody fails, which is a possibility, everybody will be judged accordingly," said Nancy Gasparino, the Parent-Teacher Association president at Public School 185 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who is worried about getting her son into a public program for gifted students or a private school next year.
State officials predict that the test will expose weaknesses in the curriculum and teaching practices of even the best schools that the old test merely papered over -- upsetting long-held assumptions about whether schools are doing a good job.
The State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, said there had been a kind of grade inflation, in which test scores had been rising year after year. "Many communities are used to seeing 85, 90, 95 percent performance," he said, "and they conclude that this is just fine. Well, it's not fine."
The state is also introducing a new fourth-grade math test, and new English and math tests in the eighth grade, all subject to the new standards. Those tests are being given from June 1 to 4.
At the same time, the state has raised standards for high school, requiring all students to take Regents' exams to graduate. The fourth- and eighth-grade tests, state officials say, are designed to insure that children will be ready for the Regents.
But the anxiety over the English test is especially high because it will be given over three days on the week of Jan. 11, an hour each day. In the past, standardized tests were always given in the spring -- and always on a single day. Even teachers who believe that fourth graders can be trained to take the new English test are looking up and realizing that there are only six weeks to go -- just enough time to cram, at best.
For first-year teachers, the pressure is almost unbearable, administrators say.
"I have one brand-new teacher, this poor girl is down here hysterical, every day," said Roberta Lyman, assistant principal of P.S. 185 in Bay Ridge, one of the city's higher-performing schools. "She doesn't know what to do first."
Mrs. Baron, the teacher from Larchmont, gave the pilot test last February and said that many children had trouble going beyond repetition of the facts in the story to inferential leaps. For instance, she said, after reading a story about a plague of toads, most children could describe how the toads had infested gardens and slept inside boots. But it was beyond them to connect those details to an essay question about "how life had changed" for the people of Australia. Many children complained, Mrs. Baron said, that the story did not describe life before the toads came.
The demand for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation was also daunting, said Mrs. Baron, a teacher for 31 years. "Children usually come in, they're big on run-on sentences," she said. "They ignore punctuation, they're so interested in getting everything down. They love writing. They love reading. But the writing they do is mostly conversation, punctuated incorrectly, with every detail of somebody's life in it."
Writing is such a personal act for young children, Mrs. Baron added, that failure could be devastating. "Let me give a short-answer test that doesn't take a child's soul and put it on paper," she said.
Unlike the old multiple choice tests, which were scored by machine, the essays will be read by district or regional committees of teachers. Mrs. Baron said she feared that some children would be stigmatized by the test for the next four years, until the next test in the eighth grade. "You hold it up to this rubric and give it a number," she said. "What's going to happen to those who didn't do it? Nobody can answer that question."
At a recent faculty meeting at P.S. 185, teachers brainstormed about how to prepare for the test, and Ms. Lyman described elements she believed would be the hardest. For example, she warned that children should be trained to notice the footnotes.
In what many teachers agree is the hardest part of the test, on day two, the teacher must read a story out loud, twice. During the second reading, children must take notes in a given page in their test booklets. They are not allowed to see the text. Then they have 50 minutes to answer some short questions and draft two essays -- paying attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation and paragraph structure -- based on the reading they have heard.
In an intensely visual culture, dominated by video, TV and computer games, many children have never developed the ability to retain what they hear, many educators warned.
"Does anybody have a system to teach children how to take notes?" Ms. Lyman asked. She urged teachers to practice their oratorical skills, and commandeered the gym teacher to sharpen the children's listening skills by giving them commands. "Practice reading aloud," she said. "Some people speak way too quickly. They have to be comfortable with the speed at which you read, where you pause."
In the end, she said ruefully, some children will look at the test and simply shut down. "You have to assume that they know nothing about what they're reading about," Ms. Lyman said. "Some children will spend the entire 45 minutes coloring in the little illustration."
The State Board of Regents authorized development of the test in April 1994, before the current class of fourth graders started school. It was developed by a statewide committee of teachers, in partnership with CTB/McGraw-Hill, a standardized-testing company.
The new test puts New York among a handful of states, including Kentucky, Massachusetts and South Carolina, that have tried to rank students and schools by how well they meet a written standard of performance, rather than along a national curve that determines what is average, above and below average.
The state is moving to strengthen its standards because many critics, including state officials, have complained that the current test measures minimum competency, a standard so low that 94 percent of third graders outside New York City meet it. In New York City, 35 percent fall below the standard, and are considered in need of remedial instruction.
The new test was shifted to fourth grade because the committee that developed the test believed that was the earliest point at which children can master the skills it demands, said Roseanne DeFabio, the assistant state commissioner who supervised the development of the test. At the same time, Ms. DeFabio said, fourth grade is still early enough to allow for effective intervention and help for children who do poorly.
Ms. DeFabio said schools that tried to cram for the test were likely to fail. "This is not really meant to reflect the work of the fourth grade," she said. "It's meant to reflect the child's development as a reader and writer, from the time he began to read and write, which for many children began before they entered school."

HEADLINE: Homes Built by Inmates Come to Aid of Small-Town South Dakotans

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: ARMOUR, S.D., Nov. 23

 BODY:
The railroad used to rumble through the cornfields and cow pastures here, braiding this southeastern South Dakota town into a necklace linked to the commercial cosmos of Chicago.
But the freight trains don't come this way anymore. And increasingly, amid the wild oceans of lavender pasqueflower and buffalo grass and the fields of alfalfa and soybeans, the farm towns are fading as they lose their people and their pulse. 
 A lot of people here are like Ethel Mingo, a 73-year-old widow who until recently was happily ensconced at 604 Henderson Avenue, a trim, whisper-yellow house on a red gravel road at the western hem of this mile-square town.
Mrs. Mingo has affection for this community of 850 or so people, even though, she says, "you can't even buy a towel in Armour." But she thought her days here might be numbered after a ruptured disk, spinal fusion surgery and a "triple aneurysm the size of a tennis ball" left her legs beholden to a walker and her lungs harnessed to an oxygen tank.
She could no longer make it to the basement to do the laundry or up the mud room steps to the kitchen. She feared that a retirement home in a larger town was her only option.
But Mrs. Mingo was just the sort of person South Dakota's maverick Governor, William J. Janklow, had in mind when he came up with a way to address his state's worst problems: rural towns faltering as family farms went under, an exodus of young people, and too many older people with homes they could no longer handle.
Governor Janklow said he thought that if he could supply the elderly with smaller homes that were easier for them to manage, they could stay in their towns and turn their larger homes over to younger families, maybe luring some new blood to the rural communities.
"I wanted to help the small town maintain its viability," said Mr. Janklow, who said his state has a high percentage of elderly -- 16 percent -- and the nation's largest proportion of small towns -- 96 percent of the state's communities have fewer than 5,000 people.
"If people don't have the services they need in a small town," Governor Janklow said, "they'll have to go to another town. I tell people, 'Quit dreaming for a General Motors plant when you're a town of 300 people and start maintaining the economic viability of your elderly.' "
To implement his plan, Mr. Janklow tapped a resource that South Dakota and other states have in great supply: prison inmates. The Governor assigned prisoners to build single-story houses, complete with accessible entrances and bathrooms for the disabled. Anyone at least 62 years old or disabled, who lives in a town with fewer that 5,000 residents, can buy one of the houses, and have it delivered from the prison, all at cost.
Mrs. Mingo bought a 768-square-foot house last year for $19,000 and had it set it on a vacant lot across the street. She sold her old three-bedroom home for $35,000 -- less than its market value -- to Warren and Pam Parker, a couple moving into town because they could not afford to keep their hog farm.
Mrs. Mingo can peer out her front window and see Mrs. Parker tending the snow-on-the-mountain flowers that she had left in the front yard. And she can still drive the several blocks to her son's drugstore on Main Street where, she does the bookkeeping.
Mr. Janklow, a 59-year-old Republican with a reputation as a stubborn prairie populist who recently stopped Canadian agriculture trucks for inspections in a protest of Federal trade policies, was elected this month to his fourth term as Governor. He served his first two terms from 1978 to 1987, and was elected again in 1994. He believes in putting inmates to work, partly, he acknowledges, because of what he calls his "juvenile delinquent" past, in which he shot holes in the water tower of his hometown of Flandreau. He was expelled from high school, and a judge sent him to the Marines.
"I'm the toughest, most hard-nosed, right-wing conservative you've ever met," Mr. Janklow said. "I believe in punishment, and I believe in retribution." But he said he also believed in preparing inmates for their release with job training that gives them "dignity and self-respect."
South Dakota inmates wire schools for computers, put out forest fires and build hunting cabins and outhouses for state parks. They raise beetles that destroy a weed called purple loosestrife. When a tornado leveled Spencer this spring, inmates were brought to the town to help families sift through the rubble.
Under a vast sky recently, about 60 inmates at the medium-security Springfield State Prison 116 miles southwest of here pounded nails and slapped on sheet rock inside a high fence topped with razor wire. Even murderers can join the work crews, but everyone has to apply for the jobs, which pay 25 cents an hour. Virgil Miller, the construction supervisor, says 275 inmates, of about 700 in the prison, are on a waiting list.
"Makes the time go by quick," said William Eutzy, 33, who is serving a three-year sentence for forgery. Mr. Eutzy, wiring the second bedroom of a house destined for the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, has earned an electrician's apprenticeship license at the Springfield prison. "When I get on the streets, I'm going to get back on my feet," he said.
In another house, Ron Huffaker, 29, sentenced to 10 years for selling marijuana, was installing oak cabinets made by inmates at another prison. "Every once in a while, an elderly lady will write a letter," he said. "Makes you kind of feel good that it's going for a good cause."
The Governor's method of quality control is to exploit that feeling. "I tell them, 'If you don't do a good job, you've got to understand you're not hurting me, you're hurting somebody's grandma,' " Mr. Janklow said.
Still, when the first crews of inmates proudly affixed wooden plaques beside the front door that said "Made by the Inmates of Team 267," Governor Janklow said that was taking things a bit too far. "I made them take the plaques off of the front of the houses. Now, they can put them inside the closet."
The inmates have also begun to build day care centers that are sold to would-be entrepreneurs in small towns, where a shortage of child care is one reason young families leave.
Governor Janklow neutralized opposition from home builders by making sure the houses were small and built in small towns so big companies would see no profit in building them. And small contractors get work building foundations and garages or other extras for the houses.
So far, 263 houses have been sold to elderly and disabled people in 135 small towns. In Woonsocket, Edwina and Aleck Larson bought one after Mrs. Larson lost both of her legs to illness. In Menno, Alta Herman, her memory starting to slip, set one up on her daughter's land, so she can live on her own but be close to help.
Three houses have been sold in Armour, named for the meat-packing baron and, this time of year, rising from a blanket of autumn-exhausted cornfields.
One went to Lyle and Janice Dierks, who have lived here for 35 years. After Mr. Dierks, 63, and his wife, 57, both learned they had cancer, they began looking for something easier to manage than their aging two-story house on Main Street. After a two-year search, the Dierkses, whose son has moved away, thought they might have to move to a city, until they saw the inmate-built homes on display at a state fair.
They sold their big house to newcomers, Mike and Beth Adam, a young couple who plan to stay until their two young children are grown and who have redecorated with Mr. Adam's hunting trophies -- white-tailed deer heads and the pelt of a sleek black bear.
The Dierkses' new house is 10 blocks away on the south end of Main Street, where Mr. Dierks enjoys watching the harvest bustle at the Armour grain elevator across the street. Besides, he said, "I'm right in the middle of my fishing lakes here. I'd hate to have to give that up."

Blow to Hindu Nationalists In State Elections in India
Voters in India outraged by rising food prices handed a humiliating defeat to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in a series of important state elections. The party lost in Delhi, the district that includes the nation's capital, and in the Hindi heartland state of Rajasthan. In a stunning resurrection, the Congress Party kept a firm hold on power in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, the country's largest. A3

Plan Would Give Disabled An Easier Return to Work
President Clinton will propose expanding Medicaid and Medicare to allow tens of thousands of people with disabilities to retain their health benefits when they return to work, Administration officials say. Under current law, many of these people must, in effect, choose between working and keeping their health insurance coverage. A1
 
Wood Heating at 20-Year Low
National and regional statistics show wood heating at its lowest ebb since the numbers started to be tracked 20 years ago, out-run by other cheap fuels and increasingly abandoned by older, busier householders who do not want to cut, chop, split, stack, carry, load and sweep up anymore. The nadir follows a decade of decline in the popularity of the potbellied radiance that, to many, once meant more than just cheap heat. A1
 
G.O.P. Whip Sees Impeachment

Oil Talks Worry Workers
When the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers at Mobil's largest domestic refinery in Beaumont, Tex., heard that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow. They have already been downsized, cut back and re-engineered. A growing American economy that can make a billionaire out of someone with an unproven idea for Internet marketing is still sloughing off workers in older industries, in petroleum as much as any.

Met Life Plans to Reorganize
Metropolitan Life Insurance, one of the country's biggest insurers, said that it was taking the first steps toward reorganizing in a way that would turn it into a stock-based corporation and provide a windfall of as much as $14 billion for its policyholders. The money -- profits that have accumulated for decades -- will be shared, according to a complex formula, by the mutual company's 12 million life insurance policyholders, who are its formal owners.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Duplicate Efforts

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
In 1938, two men in a dark, makeshift laboratory in Astoria, Queens, rubbed a handkerchief on a zinc plate coated with sulfur to give it an electric charge, placed a slide on it on which they had written the date and the site of the lab and exposed it to light.
 Then they sprinkled electrically reactive powder on the plate and gently blew on it. 
 Where the writing on the slide had obscured the plate, the powder stuck. Afterward, the men -- Chester F. Carlson, a manager of a patent office in an electronics firm and the inventor of the process they had just tested, and his assistant, Otto Kornei, a young unemployed German physicist -- went out to lunch to celebrate the invention of xerography. The term was coined from two Greek words -- literally meaning "dry writing" -- to describe the new process. The modern method for making copies had been invented.
 The technology, which uses paper instead of slides, of course, was slow to be perfected -- it was 21 years before the first widely available commercial copier based on xerography reached the market -- but since the 1970's the use of copiers has exploded.
 According to Dataquest International, a market research firm, 1.75 million copiers were sold in the United States last year, 600,000 more than were sold in 1987 and 11 times as many as were sold in 1977.
 Xerography is not just a copier technology, though. According to Louis E. Slawetsky, president of Industry Analysts Inc., a company that follows the office-equipment market, it is also the basis of fax machines and laser printers.
 Most people think of xerography, if they think of it at all, as mundane or frustrating. "Copiers are the office equipment that people love to hate," said John Bees, editor of Better Buys for Business. But it has also had a significant effect on society.
 In 1972, James Reston, the New York Times columnist, wrote in the wake of the publication of the Pentagon Papers, "Why are so many government secrets now leaking to the press? The real source of the leaks is Chester Carlson, who invented the electrostatic copying or Xerox sytem, which now dominates the Federal government and influences the flow of information in every other big institution in the country."
 Xerography has also influenced the English language. In common usage, "to xerox" has become synonomous with "to copy." This despite the best efforts of the Xerox Corporation to fight this use, contending that it is an infringement on its brand name.
 Today, analysts say the cutting edge of xerography is in developing all-in-one machines that serve the computer networks that are the backbones of many offices.
 "There is a battle shaping up as to whose machine will be on the network. Will it be a printer or a copier?" Mr. Bees said. "As the two technologies converge, there will be some fallout, and some companies will fold."
 Ironically, though people have come up with new ways to use xerography, it is the same as it was 60 years ago.
 "In very gross terms, nothing has changed since 1938," Mr. Slawetsky said. "The theory, the physics is the same." DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

GRAPHIC: Chart:
1938 -- Chester Carlson invented xerography. For several years, he tried unsuccessfully to interest large companies, including I.B.M., General Electric and Eastman Kodak, in his invention. Finally, the Battelle Memorial Institute, a small, private research facility in Columbus, Ohio, agreed to invest a few thousands dollars in developing a machine in return for 60 percent of the profits. Some improvements were made, but the machines were still crude. In 1946, the Haloid Company, a struggling maker of photographic paper, read about the invention and paid $10,000 for the rights to develop the process. Over the next dozen years, Haloid spent $12.5 million developing a copier, renaming itself Haloid Xerox along the way.
 
Early 1950's Before the Haloid Company came out with its copier, other companies, like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, A. B. Dick, Eastman Kodak and Ricoh, sold copying machines based on several different technologies, like heat-sensitive paper or a dye-transfer process. These early copiers sold fairly well, but they all had at least one feature that people did not like. Some were hard to operate, used expensive, specially treated paper, or produced wet copies that had to air dry. The copies of other machines faded or darkened over time, making them no good for long-term storage.
 
1959 -- Haloid Xerox introduced the 914 copier, so-called because it could reproduce documents as large as 9 inches by 14 inches. Its list price was $27,500, or $153,800 in 1998 dollars, making it prohibitively expensive for most companies. So Haloid Xerox also leased the copiers for $75 a month and 4.5 cents a copy for all copies over 2,000. The product was a huge success, and Haloid Xerox dropped Haloid from its name in 1961.
 
MID-1960's to MID-1970's -- In cooperation with Magnavox, Xerox developed the facsimile, a new use for xerography. Other companies followed with their own machines, but with no standards for communicating, the market grew slowly.
 
1980 -- Another major development in the use of xerographic technology: Hewlett-Packard's laser printer. It cost $100,000, or $197,500 in 1998 dollars, and was the size of a desk. Within four years, Hewlett-Packard had shrunk the technology down and the first personal laser printer, the HP Laser Jet, became available.
 
1990 -- Xerox introduced the Docutech 135, the first digital copier. In addition to copying, it could be attached to a computer network, making it possible to print documents as well as reproduce them; Xerox 914; HP 2680, the first laser printer; Xerox Docutech 135

HEADLINE: Soviet Mindset Blocks Capitalism on Farms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: SAVINO, Russia

 BODY:
Vadim Voloboyev's day begins before sunrise, when he scurries over to a weather-beaten barn to supervise the morning milking.
It is not the easiest job. Two hundred cows are crammed together in a stockade originally built for pigs. The farm cannot afford new conveyor belts to dispense the cheap feed or remove the pungent manure. 
 It might all be worth it if milk production helped keep the farm solvent. But milk is turning out to be a money-losing proposition.
"We work hard," said Viktor A. Remizov, the director of the Savino farm. "But we have no money to invest in production. There is no way to get credit. Taxes are high. There is simply no easy way out of our situation."
For all of the vaunted talk of building a free market, agriculture is the least reformed sector of the Russian economy.
The Communist-led Parliament has refused to approve the sale of farmland. The nation's chronically inefficient collective farms have been relabeled, not reorganized.
The Kremlin has done little to help the fiercely conservative farmers cope with the brave new world of capitalism. Their distress has only been compounded by the virtual collapse of the banking system and a ruinous drought.
As winter begins to grip the heartland, the results have been distressingly clear: Russia's grain harvest is at its lowest point in 45 years. Milk and meat production has continued to plummet.
Russia remains heavily dependent on imports of food -- so dependent that the Kremlin has put aside its pride and sought almost five million tons of food aid from the United States and Europe.
It is a bitter legacy for a nation where ties to the land seem almost primordial and where 100 million citizens tend their own modest plots to grow fruit and vegetables.
"Farming requires good management and capital," said Viktor F. Lishchenko, a leading agricultural specialist at a Government academy of economics. "Unfortunately Russia does not have either. Food security is a big, big issue."
Nestled on 4,000 acres near the storied city of Novgorod in the northwest, Savino is a textbook case of Russia's neglect of agricultural reform.
During the heyday of Soviet power, this was a state-owned collective, grandly called the 50th Anniversary of the Soviet Union Farm. It had a bloated work force and fought a daily battle against pilferage. But its production of wheat, meat and milk was buoyed by subsidized feed, fertilizer and tractors.
The demise of the Soviet Union gave workers a opportunity to break free of the collective. No one did.
All workers received a handsome certificate allowing them to take about 10 acres of tilled land and 5 acres of pasture and farm it for themselves. Instead the workers leased their land back to the farm, keeping only tiny plots for themselves to grow vegetables and perhaps raise a pig or a calf.
"Nobody wanted to leave," recalled Mr. Remizov, the director now as in Soviet times. "People seem to be afraid of the uncertainty and financial difficulties."
It is a common story. Few of Russia's 27,000 former collective farms have been broken up or restructured. Russia has some 275,000 private farms, but they are generally far smaller than collective farms and account for a mere 5 percent of farmland.
Nor is the number of private farms increasing. Without the right to buy and sell land, many investors are reluctant to pour their money into Russian agriculture.
Cash-poor farmers cannot use their land as collateral to obtain loans. Programs to teach farmers accounting and other management skills are rare. And Russia lacks the infrastructure to develop a market that would distribute domestic produce across the vast land.
"If you gave the Russian farmers all the modern equipment in the world, it would not solve their problem," said Christian J. Foster, an expert on Russian farming at the United States Department of Agriculture. "They need to operate their farms like a real business."
Banding together, certainly, has not brought Savino's farmers prosperity. Officially Savino is now a joint stock company; in reality it operates much as it did when it was state owned, but without the government handouts it used to count on.
Savino's work force remains swollen, if underpaid. Some 500 people live here, but since many are pensioners, only about 200 work the farm. A comparable farm in the United States would be run by a handful of workers.
Seed, feed, fertilizer and tractors now must be bought in the marketplace at sky-high prices. Big dairies, meat factories and grain elevators have become regional monopolies and pushed down farm revenues by paying less for raw milk, livestock and wheat.
Loans are hard to come by. The regional government in Novgorod offered the farm a two-month loan at 25 percent, but the farm cannot afford to pay it back over such a short period and turned it down.
So instead of the 1,500 tons of fertilizer a year it used in Soviet times, Savino is making do this year with 120 tons. And instead of buying new tractors and harvesters, old ones are lined up in a muddy lot awaiting the spare parts that the farm scrambles to buy.
"We don't have a chance to buy basic equipment," Mr. Remizov said. "If I could get a loan for four years, I might take it."
Savino lost a million rubles (about $59,000) during the last two years. That's normal; about 80 percent of Russian farms are unprofitable. They survive through barter, delaying tax payments, paying their workers with food instead of money or squeezing tax breaks and other concessions from regional authorities.
What most farms have not done is reorganize by laying off unneeded workers, concentrating on crops that are most profitable or introducing modern business techniques.
At Savino the old ways are apparent at the fetid paddock where Mr. Voloboyev oversees the dairy cows. The feed is short on the nutrients needed to raise milk production. The conveyor belts that distribute feed are old and rickety. The milking is labor intensive.
Each row of 40 cows is assigned to a milkmaid, who tends to them one-by-one and then carries away the steaming pails. A milkmaid receives 400 to 600 rubles a month (about $24 to $35) for her efforts. The animals themselves are filthy. A milkmaid is paid a 10-kopek bonus for keeping each of the cows clean for a month -- less than one cent a cow.
Most simply refuse.
"I ask them to clean the cows," said Mr. Voloboyev, "but they say, 'Why don't you do it yourself?' "
The faltering state of agriculture has powerful political implications. Many farm regions are already Communist strongholds, and without reform they are likely to stay that way. Farms and teetering military plants make up much of the "Red Belt," a swath of territory across southern and central Russia.
The grinding inefficiencies have also made Russia increasingly dependent on imported food. Because of poor feed and other shortages, it takes the Russians about 65 days to raise a chicken to market weight, compared with 40 days in the United States.
Before the ruble collapsed in August, Russia imported more than a third of its food. In major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, the percentage was far higher.
"In most of the farms of northwest Russia, veterinary work has deteriorated," said Andrei V. Katargin, the manager of Novgorod's leading meat-packaging plant. "The selection of forage is bad. The meat we bought from Australia, Canada and Europe before the crisis was not only of high quality; it was cheaper than the meat from the St. Petersburg area, two hours away."
To a considerable extent, the failures have been cushioned by the small garden plots most Russians maintain, which yield most of the nation's potatoes and vegetables.
Still, even before the latest financial crisis, Russians were cutting back on meat and eating potatoes, pasta and other cheaper foods.
Then this year, bad luck came in threes. Drought swept across the heartland. Garden plots were hit by potato blight. The collapse of the ruble and the paralysis of Russia's banks took a brutal toll on imports.
Russia's harvest may recover somewhat next year if the weather improves. But its land will still not be nearly as productive as it could be. And while the Government talks about reforming the farm sector, it has yet to present a cogent plan.
"To succeed in modern farming today, you need to be an agronomist, an expert in cattle breading, a specialist on market research, a financier and a computer programmer," said Sergei Saidov, one of the handful of successful private farmers in the region.
"But in Russia they simply took the old collective farms and left them to their own devices. Now the food security of the country is at risk."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page picture caption yesterday with an article about problems of agricultural reform in Russia referred incorrectly to the milking of cows on large Russian farms. While inefficient procedures are common, the milking is done by machine, not by hand.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Hand-milking and pails, signs of the old times, prevail on Russian farms like this one near Novgorod. (Jason Eskanazi for The New York Times)(pg. A1); The end of Soviet-style farm collectives offered the promise of more efficient, market-oriented agriculture, but the promise has not been met. Here, buyers from Smolensk load cabbages at the Novorus farm near Novgorod. With meat output down, Russians rely more on cabbages and potatoes. (Jason Eskanazi for The New York Times)(pg. A6)

HEADLINE: U.S. Report on Net Commerce Set for Release

BYLINE: By JERI CLAUSING 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON. Nov. 29

 BODY:
To many Americans, the name Ira Magaziner is synonymous with the ill-fated Clinton health care plan. But the Presidential adviser's more lasting legacy may prove to be the Administration's laissez-faire policy on Internet commerce: no taxes, no Government regulations.
As Mr. Magaziner prepares to take leave of the White House, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are scheduled to release with great fanfare on Monday a long-awaited report by Mr. Magaziner's interagency working group in electronic commerce. 
 The report -- the foundation of the Administration's new Internet commerce policy -- argues for stronger consumer protection and privacy rights, but like Mr. Magaziner's 1997 "Framework for Electronic Commerce," it clings to the insistence that these be achieved through self-regulation by industries rather than dictated by the Government.
"Self-regulation in the digital age will require the private sector to engage in much greater collective action to set and enforce rules than was characteristic of the Industrial Age," the report states.
Not everyone agrees with that theme, particularly as it relates to consumers.
One of Mr. Magaziner's most vocal critics, Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is among those who say that "self-regulation has been a lot of smoke and mirrors."
Mr. Rotenberg insists that laws are needed to protect consumer interests and personal data in the young and often free-for-all atmosphere of cyberspace. Without such laws, he warns, the United States will open itself to a trade war with Europe, where self-regulation has been declared incompatible with laws guaranteeing strong privacy protections for consumers.
The European law, which took effect in October, prohibits any company that does business in the European Union from transmitting personal data to any nation that does not guarantee comparable privacy protections.
Mr. Magaziner concedes, "If self-regulation is not working at the end of the year, then I would advocate that government do more."
On the other hand, he adds: "I would point out that just passing laws is still not protecting privacy. You still have to put in place an enforcement mechanism and demonstrate that you can enforce the law. So I think it might be fairer for critics to say that no country has found a way to do this adequately."
Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Internet civil liberties group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the fact that the United States has won a reprieve from the European Union while both sides search for mutually acceptable privacy protections is a credit to Mr. Magaziner.
Calling the differences over privacy "a real nightmare," Mr. Farber said: "I think what he has done has kept us from falling off an edge of a cliff. October came and we are still doing business."
Beyond consumer issues, the report tries to head off moves by the Federal Communications Commission to regulate high-speed Internet access in the United States.
"There are rumblings about the F.C.C. wanting to regulate advanced services," Mr. Magaziner said. "We want to make it clear that we think this would be a mistake."
The report also calls for a series of programs intended to spread the Internet to developing countries quickly, using low-orbit satellite links in areas that lack telephone service; to help small businesses use the Internet and to update the Government's statistical and economic models to help better measure the economic impact of information technology industries.
A final report on the Administration's -- and Mr. Magaziner's -- headway on cyberspace issues, the document details treaties signed and laws passed in the last 18 months to keep the Internet tax free and unregulated and to encourage electronic commerce with new digital copyright and security protections.
Those successes, said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade organization, show that Mr. Magaziner proved to be "a pivotal leader at a pivotal time."
His most important contribution, Mr. Miller said, was "the idea that the Internet and electronic commerce are not going to be like traditional industries in the sense that they need to be heavily regulated from birth."
While even an outspoken critic like Mr. Rotenberg gives Mr. Magaziner "a lot of credit for his energy, his smarts, and his ability to create a coherent vision for the Administration," he added, "At the end of the day, it can be fairly asked whether the Administration's policy was based on self-regulation or on promoting business interests."
The paradox is that such criticism is the antithesis of widespread criticism of the plan for a heavily regulated national health care system that Mr. Magaziner and Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed during the President's first term.
Where the Internet policy is seen as laissez-faire, the health care plan was criticized as government meddling. And shaping Internet policy has been a comparatively low-key effort, consensus driven and largely devoid of the partisan politics that Mr. Magaziner largely blames for the health care plan's demise.
It was also an effort that began almost accidentally, without any preconceived political notions or agendas, he said.
"Initially, when health care failed, I actually offered to resign," Mr. Magaziner said in an interview over the weekend. "The President said no. He suggested that I do something in a different area -- not in health care because Hillary and I had both become radioactive on that subject."
So in 1995, Mr. Magaziner recalled, he and the late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and Mickey Kantor began holding hearings around the country to develop an economic development strategy.
"There really was almost no electronic commerce on the Internet then," Mr. Magaziner said. "But it became very clear to me that if we set the right environment, the Internet and electronic commerce were going to explode."
He added: "When I presented that, to be honest, I think a number of people didn't understand. But the President did."
Mr. Magaziner then set out to formulate a new policy for the Administration and to sell those goals domestically and abroad.
"Initially, there was suspicion of the United States and the fact that the Internet started here and that somehow we were trying to use this whole policy to further the American agenda around the world," he said.
Eventually, he said, the "principles we began espousing spread around the world."
On an issue even more contentious than electronic commerce, Mr. Magaziner recently wrapped up an agreement for turning over administration of the Internet's addressing system, which has historically been managed by Government contractors, to a private, nonprofit corporation -- a big step in Internet self- governance.
Now, Mr. Magaziner says he feels his role is played out. "We accomplished more than the goals we set out for," he said. "I think it is a good time to return to private life."
After wrapping up his White House duties in the next few days, he will join his wife and three children in Rhode Island and decide what the future holds for him professionally.
"I think he did a very good job," said Mr. Farber of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "He was very visible to the Internet community. He tried very hard to get into the culture. He got on line. He traveled. He felt he had to meet these people."
In the end, Mr. Farber said: "He probably decided the whole Internet community is wacko. And it probably is."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 5, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about the Clinton Administration's policy report on Internet commerce omitted a passage in an estimate by Ira Magaziner, a presidential adviser, on how long it would take to determine whether industry self-regulation is effective. Mr. Magaziner said he believed it would take until the end of 1999, not the end of 1998.
